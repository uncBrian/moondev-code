00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
this morning giving this market a much
 

15
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,510
this morning giving this market a much
needed rally back inside. So, as always,

16
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
needed rally back inside. So, as always,
 

17
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,150
needed rally back inside. So, as always,
we're going to start on the daily. All

18
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
we're going to start on the daily. All
 

19
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,070
we're going to start on the daily. All
right, starting on the daily. You can

sell. Uh in the afternoon, we had some

24
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
sell. Uh in the afternoon, we had some
 

25
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,749
sell. Uh in the afternoon, we had some
continuation. Almost made that uh 800

26
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
continuation. Almost made that uh 800
 

27
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,350
continuation. Almost made that uh 800
level. We did get outside this little

28
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
level. We did get outside this little
 

29
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,830
level. We did get outside this little
shelf here into 37.

30
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
shelf here into 37.
 

31
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,749
shelf here into 37.
Um and we've tried to dip outside that

32
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
Um and we've tried to dip outside that
 

33
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,070
Um and we've tried to dip outside that
this morning and not. So market finding

34
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
this morning and not. So market finding
 

35
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,150
this morning and not. So market finding
a reaction in here. If we think about

36
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
a reaction in here. If we think about
 

37
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,950
a reaction in here. If we think about
the bib of the swing points right now,

38
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
the bib of the swing points right now,
 

39
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,230
the bib of the swing points right now,
right, we found a bid off the 61. We did

40
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
right, we found a bid off the 61. We did
 

41
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,790
right, we found a bid off the 61. We did
talk about that yesterday. Probable if

42
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
talk about that yesterday. Probable if
 

43
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,310
talk about that yesterday. Probable if
we weren't going to find a bid here, the

44
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
we weren't going to find a bid here, the
 

45
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,070
we weren't going to find a bid here, the
next levels were here and here. So we've

46
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
next levels were here and here. So we've
 

47
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,230
next levels were here and here. So we've
started to find that bid off that 61

48
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
started to find that bid off that 61
 

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,629
started to find that bid off that 61
fib. Uh now we can think about where

50
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
fib. Uh now we can think about where
 

51
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,430
fib. Uh now we can think about where
this leg could possibly retrace to. All

52
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
this leg could possibly retrace to. All
 

53
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,909
this leg could possibly retrace to. All
right. If we're going to create a new

54
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
right. If we're going to create a new
 

55
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,469
right. If we're going to create a new
bare flag and liquidity, probably into

56
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
bare flag and liquidity, probably into
 

57
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,749
bare flag and liquidity, probably into
350s. if we're going to go for the 50%

58
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
350s. if we're going to go for the 50%
 

59
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,550
350s. if we're going to go for the 50%
probably into 500s. Both of those are

60
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
probably into 500s. Both of those are
 

61
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,749
probably into 500s. Both of those are
major major confluence areas. All right,

62
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
major major confluence areas. All right,
 

63
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,629
major major confluence areas. All right,
major confluence areas. So, let's go in

64
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
major confluence areas. So, let's go in
 

65
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,189
major confluence areas. So, let's go in
and have a look at that.

66
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
and have a look at that.
 

67
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,189
and have a look at that.
If we look now into the hourly charts,

68
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
If we look now into the hourly charts,
 

69
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:00,710
If we look now into the hourly charts,
make sure you can see enough of this.

70
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720

 

71
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,710

All right. If we look in the hourlys,

72
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
All right. If we look in the hourlys,
 

73
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,469
All right. If we look in the hourlys,
you can see this is the developing

74
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
you can see this is the developing
 

75
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,510
you can see this is the developing
profile from the week. All right, this

76
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
profile from the week. All right, this
 

77
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,350
profile from the week. All right, this
is current week. It's still developing.

78
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
is current week. It's still developing.
 

79
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,629
is current week. It's still developing.
What we have is some big liquidity

80
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
What we have is some big liquidity
 

81
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,629
What we have is some big liquidity
created down here yesterday. We've left

82
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
created down here yesterday. We've left
 

83
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,430
created down here yesterday. We've left
good excess at that low, right? So, low

84
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
good excess at that low, right? So, low
 

85
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,830
good excess at that low, right? So, low
volume node left underneath previous day

86
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
volume node left underneath previous day
 

87
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,749
volume node left underneath previous day
point control into previous day value

88
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
point control into previous day value
 

89
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,790
point control into previous day value
area low. We are starting to bid back up

90
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
area low. We are starting to bid back up
 

91
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,270
area low. We are starting to bid back up
off this. We are into or we have gone

92
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
off this. We are into or we have gone
 

93
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,350
off this. We are into or we have gone
back above that low volume node right

94
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
back above that low volume node right
 

95
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,790
back above that low volume node right
here. Bulls have a chance here. I'm not

96
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
here. Bulls have a chance here. I'm not
 

97
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,150
here. Bulls have a chance here. I'm not
talking about I want to be clear. I'm

98
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
talking about I want to be clear. I'm
 

99
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,990
talking about I want to be clear. I'm
not talking about a protrend move, but

100
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
not talking about a protrend move, but
 

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,909
not talking about a protrend move, but
bulls have a chance to do a bigger

102
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
bulls have a chance to do a bigger
 

103
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,510
bulls have a chance to do a bigger
pullback leg. All right? Because your

104
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
pullback leg. All right? Because your
 

105
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,749
pullback leg. All right? Because your
swing point, right, is from here to

106
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
swing point, right, is from here to
 

107
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,189
swing point, right, is from here to
here. If we think about this swing

108
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
here. If we think about this swing
 

109
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,309
here. If we think about this swing
point, we are from the 500s down into

110
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
point, we are from the 500s down into
 

111
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,230
point, we are from the 500s down into
these sort of 880s or wherever it is. We

112
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
these sort of 880s or wherever it is. We
 

113
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,390
these sort of 880s or wherever it is. We
are already coming into 61 fib. So, our

114
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
are already coming into 61 fib. So, our
 

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,390
are already coming into 61 fib. So, our
ideal location to long is not here, is

116
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
ideal location to long is not here, is
 

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,830
ideal location to long is not here, is
it? We don't want to long here. This is

118
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
it? We don't want to long here. This is
 

119
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,309
it? We don't want to long here. This is
into a 61 fib. And we have point of

120
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
into a 61 fib. And we have point of
 

121
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,390
into a 61 fib. And we have point of
control. We have this thick contested

122
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
control. We have this thick contested
 

123
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,990
control. We have this thick contested
level from the week. All right. Maybe

124
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
level from the week. All right. Maybe
 

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,830
level from the week. All right. Maybe
this acts as resistance. Maybe we just

126
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
this acts as resistance. Maybe we just
 

127
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,749
this acts as resistance. Maybe we just
do this in here. We have to see because

128
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
do this in here. We have to see because
 

129
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,029
do this in here. We have to see because
every time we've come into there, we've

130
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
every time we've come into there, we've
 

131
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,670
every time we've come into there, we've
chopped. If I wanted to be bullish

132
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
chopped. If I wanted to be bullish
 

133
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,430
chopped. If I wanted to be bullish
today, where would I want to be bullish?

134
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
today, where would I want to be bullish?
 

135
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,909
today, where would I want to be bullish?
Well, I'd want to leave every bear in

136
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
Well, I'd want to leave every bear in
 

137
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,830
Well, I'd want to leave every bear in
the previous day's range, which is down

138
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
the previous day's range, which is down
 

139
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,029
the previous day's range, which is down
here, trapped, right? So, if I'm going

140
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
here, trapped, right? So, if I'm going
 

141
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,670
here, trapped, right? So, if I'm going
to be a bull today, even for the

142
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
to be a bull today, even for the
 

143
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,029
to be a bull today, even for the
retracement leg, I will want a pullback

144
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
retracement leg, I will want a pullback
 

145
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,670
retracement leg, I will want a pullback
to hold previous day area high. Maybe we

146
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
to hold previous day area high. Maybe we
 

147
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,110
to hold previous day area high. Maybe we
don't get the pullback. I don't know.

148
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
don't get the pullback. I don't know.
 

149
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,110
don't get the pullback. I don't know.
But this is my thesis today. What I'd be

150
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
But this is my thesis today. What I'd be
 

151
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,189
But this is my thesis today. What I'd be
looking for previous day value area

152
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
looking for previous day value area
 

153
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,550
looking for previous day value area
high. I'm going to get rid of this white

154
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
high. I'm going to get rid of this white
 

155
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,710
high. I'm going to get rid of this white
line. We don't need that anymore. All

156
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
line. We don't need that anymore. All
 

157
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,189
line. We don't need that anymore. All
right. Previous day value area high

158
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
right. Previous day value area high
 

159
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,670
right. Previous day value area high
which lines up with this low volume node

160
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
which lines up with this low volume node
 

161
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,909
which lines up with this low volume node
at very worst 25100 25,090. All right.

162
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
at very worst 25100 25,090. All right.
 

163
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,029
at very worst 25100 25,090. All right.
So pull back somewhere into 25,150

164
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
So pull back somewhere into 25,150
 

165
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,749
So pull back somewhere into 25,150
25,100ish.

166
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
25,100ish.
 

167
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,830
25,100ish.
You need this to hold. If you're looking

168
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
You need this to hold. If you're looking
 

169
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,550
You need this to hold. If you're looking
for the move back upside, you need this

170
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
for the move back upside, you need this
 

171
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,430
for the move back upside, you need this
level to hold. So if this level holds

172
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
level to hold. So if this level holds
 

173
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,350
level to hold. So if this level holds
right and we get back inside previous

174
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
right and we get back inside previous
 

175
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,350
right and we get back inside previous
days range, it means we're holding the

176
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
days range, it means we're holding the
 

177
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,909
days range, it means we're holding the
current weekly uh value and maybe

178
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
current weekly uh value and maybe
 

179
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,990
current weekly uh value and maybe
there's a return back in towards 350.

180
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
there's a return back in towards 350.
 

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,390
there's a return back in towards 350.
This will be a TP point. All right. So I

182
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
This will be a TP point. All right. So I
 

183
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,990
This will be a TP point. All right. So I
would be taking a good chunk of my

184
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
would be taking a good chunk of my
 

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,150
would be taking a good chunk of my
profit off if it gives me something like

186
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
profit off if it gives me something like
 

187
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,150
profit off if it gives me something like
this. Good chunk of my profit is coming

188
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
this. Good chunk of my profit is coming
 

189
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,469
this. Good chunk of my profit is coming
up into that because I expect it to get

190
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
up into that because I expect it to get
 

191
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,710
up into that because I expect it to get
stuck. It might very well slam it back

192
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
stuck. It might very well slam it back
 

193
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,589
stuck. It might very well slam it back
down from there. If I get lucky and we

194
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
down from there. If I get lucky and we
 

195
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,749
down from there. If I get lucky and we
find acceptance above, then we can think

196
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
find acceptance above, then we can think
 

197
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,469
find acceptance above, then we can think
about that trade all the way up to uh

198
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
about that trade all the way up to uh
 

199
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,990
about that trade all the way up to uh
25,500.

200
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
25,500.
 

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,749
25,500.
And maybe this becomes an ad. If there's

202
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
And maybe this becomes an ad. If there's
 

203
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,469
And maybe this becomes an ad. If there's
a break, break retest and hold, that

204
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
a break, break retest and hold, that
 

205
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,350
a break, break retest and hold, that
becomes an ad. If this morning we do a

206
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
becomes an ad. If this morning we do a
 

207
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,350
becomes an ad. If this morning we do a
straight drive up, all right, if we do a

208
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
straight drive up, all right, if we do a
 

209
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,990
straight drive up, all right, if we do a
straight drive up into this, you want to

210
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
straight drive up into this, you want to
 

211
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,509
straight drive up into this, you want to
be very careful about thinking about

212
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
be very careful about thinking about
 

213
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,509
be very careful about thinking about
longs. Right? If we come up into this,

214
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
longs. Right? If we come up into this,
 

215
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,590
longs. Right? If we come up into this,
even if we peek over and you start to

216
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
even if we peek over and you start to
 

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,430
even if we peek over and you start to
see a rejection back under that node, do

218
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
see a rejection back under that node, do
 

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,269
see a rejection back under that node, do
not be surprised to see them slam this

220
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
not be surprised to see them slam this
 

221
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,829
not be surprised to see them slam this
back down. This might look like nothing.

222
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
back down. This might look like nothing.
 

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,949
back down. This might look like nothing.
That's 250 points. You do not want to be

224
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
That's 250 points. You do not want to be
 

225
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,790
That's 250 points. You do not want to be
the wrong side of some of these moves,

226
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
the wrong side of some of these moves,
 

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,550
the wrong side of some of these moves,
okay? They can happen very, very quick.

228
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
okay? They can happen very, very quick.
 

229
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,550
okay? They can happen very, very quick.
Why am I saying that? We're thin in

230
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
Why am I saying that? We're thin in
 

231
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,030
Why am I saying that? We're thin in
here. We're thin in here. We're thin in

232
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
here. We're thin in here. We're thin in
 

233
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,670
here. We're thin in here. We're thin in
here. That can re repric very quick if

234
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
here. That can re repric very quick if
 

235
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,430
here. That can re repric very quick if
it wants. So, just trying to make you

236
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
it wants. So, just trying to make you
 

237
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,829
it wants. So, just trying to make you
aware of that.

238
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
aware of that.
 

239
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,350
aware of that.
It might be that we don't do a look

240
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
It might be that we don't do a look
 

241
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,430
It might be that we don't do a look
above and fail. It might be that we just

242
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
above and fail. It might be that we just
 

243
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,590
above and fail. It might be that we just
bang into it and instantly get rejected.

244
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
bang into it and instantly get rejected.
 

245
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,509
bang into it and instantly get rejected.
Um, I don't really want to take that

246
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
Um, I don't really want to take that
 

247
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,269
Um, I don't really want to take that
short. I'm actually more interested in

248
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
short. I'm actually more interested in
 

249
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,870
short. I'm actually more interested in
waiting to see how we react down here.

250
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
waiting to see how we react down here.
 

251
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,630
waiting to see how we react down here.
It buys me a bit of time to get a feel

252
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
It buys me a bit of time to get a feel
 

253
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,870
It buys me a bit of time to get a feel
for the market this morning. Letting it

254
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
for the market this morning. Letting it
 

255
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,389
for the market this morning. Letting it
build out some volume. All right,

256
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
build out some volume. All right,
 

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,430
build out some volume. All right,
letting it build out some volume.

258
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
letting it build out some volume.
 

259
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,550
letting it build out some volume.
If we get back over PC, all right, and

260
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
If we get back over PC, all right, and
 

261
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,030
If we get back over PC, all right, and
we start to hold there, you need to be

262
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
we start to hold there, you need to be
 

263
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,790
we start to hold there, you need to be
careful because this is fair value for

264
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
careful because this is fair value for
 

265
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,590
careful because this is fair value for
the last well since Sunday open. But if

266
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
the last well since Sunday open. But if
 

267
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,670
the last well since Sunday open. But if
they start to hold this and bid, can't

268
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
they start to hold this and bid, can't
 

269
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,750
they start to hold this and bid, can't
rule out that move here. All right, this

270
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
rule out that move here. All right, this
 

271
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,750
rule out that move here. All right, this
move here to use this liquidity. Cannot

272
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
move here to use this liquidity. Cannot
 

273
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,430
move here to use this liquidity. Cannot
rule that out. Remember the pro trend

274
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
rule that out. Remember the pro trend
 

275
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,630
rule that out. Remember the pro trend
right now is down. If we zoom out,

276
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
right now is down. If we zoom out,
 

277
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,110
right now is down. If we zoom out,
the protrend is down. You have I mean

278
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
the protrend is down. You have I mean
 

279
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,630
the protrend is down. You have I mean
what I would call about as clear a

280
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
what I would call about as clear a
 

281
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,150
what I would call about as clear a
channel as you can get. Have we got a

282
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
channel as you can get. Have we got a
 

283
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,590
channel as you can get. Have we got a
channel on here? Pretty sure we've got

284
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
channel on here? Pretty sure we've got
 

285
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,829
channel on here? Pretty sure we've got
one somewhere. There it is. All right.

286
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
one somewhere. There it is. All right.
 

287
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,670
one somewhere. There it is. All right.
About clear as channel as you can get.

288
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
About clear as channel as you can get.
 

289
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,350
About clear as channel as you can get.
Right. That's your channel. We're coming

290
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
Right. That's your channel. We're coming
 

291
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,389
Right. That's your channel. We're coming
up to the top side. All right. So, we

292
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
up to the top side. All right. So, we
 

293
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,910
up to the top side. All right. So, we
want to see if this holds, finds

294
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
want to see if this holds, finds
 

295
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,630
want to see if this holds, finds
respect. If you do this move, maybe you

296
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
respect. If you do this move, maybe you
 

297
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,230
respect. If you do this move, maybe you
get that move outside of it. If we just

298
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
get that move outside of it. If we just
 

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,590
get that move outside of it. If we just
bang into that and they reject the

300
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
bang into that and they reject the
 

301
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,269
bang into that and they reject the
channel, then I'm looking to see if we

302
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
channel, then I'm looking to see if we
 

303
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,790
channel, then I'm looking to see if we
hold a bid there. If we come all right,

304
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
hold a bid there. If we come all right,
 

305
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,030
hold a bid there. If we come all right,
this is very much like yesterday. If we

306
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
this is very much like yesterday. If we
 

307
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,790
this is very much like yesterday. If we
just drift down here without tapping

308
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
just drift down here without tapping
 

309
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,389
just drift down here without tapping
into that and we come into yesterday's

310
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
into that and we come into yesterday's
 

311
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,550
into that and we come into yesterday's
range, I don't really want to trade in

312
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
range, I don't really want to trade in
 

313
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,430
range, I don't really want to trade in
this, right? are really uninterested in

314
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
this, right? are really uninterested in
 

315
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,110
this, right? are really uninterested in
trading that. If we reject that, come

316
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
trading that. If we reject that, come
 

317
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,949
trading that. If we reject that, come
in, reject that, then maybe I'm

318
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
in, reject that, then maybe I'm
 

319
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,190
in, reject that, then maybe I'm
interested in playing that rotation. But

320
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
interested in playing that rotation. But
 

321
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,870
interested in playing that rotation. But
if we don't do anything, if this is just

322
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
if we don't do anything, if this is just
 

323
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,430
if we don't do anything, if this is just
like a mediocre 61 and we come into here

324
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
like a mediocre 61 and we come into here
 

325
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,350
like a mediocre 61 and we come into here
and we start doing this, well, no thank

326
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
and we start doing this, well, no thank
 

327
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,030

329
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,910
you. I don't really fancy do I don't
think we're going to do that, but I

330
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
think we're going to do that, but I
 

331
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,829
think we're going to do that, but I
don't really fancy doing that. Okay,

332
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
don't really fancy doing that. Okay,
 

333
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,990
don't really fancy doing that. Okay,
let's have a look at what we did in the

334
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
let's have a look at what we did in the
 

335
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,509
let's have a look at what we did in the
GlobeEx session then.

336
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
GlobeEx session then.
 

337
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,829
GlobeEx session then.
And you can see right here. Oh, don't

338
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
And you can see right here. Oh, don't
 

339
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,350
And you can see right here. Oh, don't
move that. I'm going to need it.

340
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
move that. I'm going to need it.
 

341
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,670
move that. I'm going to need it.
We went sideways

342
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680

 

343
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,630

after protecting the previous day value

344
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
after protecting the previous day value
 

345
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,389
after protecting the previous day value
area. So we tried to break down numerous

346
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
area. So we tried to break down numerous
 

347
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,230
area. So we tried to break down numerous
times yesterday. Uh we did trade that

348
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
times yesterday. Uh we did trade that
 

349
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,949
times yesterday. Uh we did trade that
upside uh in Discord together. We were

350
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
upside uh in Discord together. We were
 

351
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,630
upside uh in Discord together. We were
waiting for that retest up here. It

352
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
waiting for that retest up here. It
 

353
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,150
waiting for that retest up here. It
never came to sell back down. So we

354
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
never came to sell back down. So we
 

355
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,150
never came to sell back down. So we
traded this upside Globeex. We held this

356
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
traded this upside Globeex. We held this
 

357
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,389
traded this upside Globeex. We held this
level here. All right. This level here

358
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
level here. All right. This level here
 

359
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,990
level here. All right. This level here
held. This is your key level. This is

360
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
held. This is your key level. This is
 

361
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,949
held. This is your key level. This is
where they've rotated from basically 100

362
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
where they've rotated from basically 100
 

363
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,590
where they've rotated from basically 100
p.m. yesterday all the way into 2:00

364
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
p.m. yesterday all the way into 2:00
 

365
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,829
p.m. yesterday all the way into 2:00
a.m. So, they spent about 12 hours, 13

366
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
a.m. So, they spent about 12 hours, 13
 

367
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,269
a.m. So, they spent about 12 hours, 13
hours in here before finally breaking

368
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
hours in here before finally breaking
 

369
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,829
hours in here before finally breaking
out. They held the retest in London. We

370
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
out. They held the retest in London. We
 

371
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,829
out. They held the retest in London. We
go sideways for a bit into this key

372
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
go sideways for a bit into this key
 

373
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,110
go sideways for a bit into this key
level, which is previous day. Uh, no,

374
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
level, which is previous day. Uh, no,
 

375
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,430
level, which is previous day. Uh, no,
current week value area low, sorry. CPI

376
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
current week value area low, sorry. CPI
 

377
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,590
current week value area low, sorry. CPI
comes, call print, upside we go. All

378
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
comes, call print, upside we go. All
 

379
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,350
comes, call print, upside we go. All
right, so it's looking to retest this

380
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
right, so it's looking to retest this
 

381
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,030
right, so it's looking to retest this
area right now. Look how big this move

382
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
area right now. Look how big this move
 

383
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,790
area right now. Look how big this move
is. We don't really want to try and long

384
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
is. We don't really want to try and long
 

385
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,230
is. We don't really want to try and long
up here. We're running out of room. We

386
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
up here. We're running out of room. We
 

387
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,069
up here. We're running out of room. We
really want this to come back down and

388
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
really want this to come back down and
 

389
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,870
really want this to come back down and
offer offer us a re long up. That' be

390
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
offer offer us a re long up. That' be
 

391
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,030
offer offer us a re long up. That' be
the nicest way to get long in this.

392
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
the nicest way to get long in this.
 

393
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,190
the nicest way to get long in this.
Okay, moving into lower time frames.

394
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
Okay, moving into lower time frames.
 

395
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,110
Okay, moving into lower time frames.
We're going to go through ES, the ETS,

396
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
We're going to go through ES, the ETS,
 

397
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,310
We're going to go through ES, the ETS,
gold, BIX, all the good stuff.

398
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320

 

399
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,230

Okay, I'm going to take this off because

400
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
Okay, I'm going to take this off because
 

401
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,389
Okay, I'm going to take this off because
I can visually see whereabouts that is

402
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
I can visually see whereabouts that is
 

403
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,790
I can visually see whereabouts that is
without it.

404
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
without it.
 

405
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,470
without it.
All right. Yes, same kind of story.

406
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
All right. Yes, same kind of story.
 

407
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,310
All right. Yes, same kind of story.
You can see it's doing exactly the same

408
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
You can see it's doing exactly the same
 

409
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,150
You can see it's doing exactly the same
thing. So inverted sort of head and

410
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
thing. So inverted sort of head and
 

411
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,150
thing. So inverted sort of head and
shoulders, left shoulder, head, right

412
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
shoulders, left shoulder, head, right
 

413
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,230
shoulders, left shoulder, head, right
shoulder, repric into range. There's

414
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
shoulder, repric into range. There's
 

415
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,829
shoulder, repric into range. There's
your old range. It's trying to find

416
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
your old range. It's trying to find
 

417
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,470
your old range. It's trying to find
acceptance. We might rotate if we get in

418
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
acceptance. We might rotate if we get in
 

419
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,310
acceptance. We might rotate if we get in
here, right? Don't be surprised if we

420
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
here, right? Don't be surprised if we
 

421
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,990
here, right? Don't be surprised if we
rotate. If they find a reaction here

422
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
rotate. If they find a reaction here
 

423
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,550
rotate. If they find a reaction here
this morning and sell this back down and

424
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
this morning and sell this back down and
 

425
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,150
this morning and sell this back down and
you're looking to see if it holds the

426
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
you're looking to see if it holds the
 

427
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,069
you're looking to see if it holds the
800s, if it holds 800s, you're looking

428
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
800s, if it holds 800s, you're looking
 

429
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,949
800s, if it holds 800s, you're looking
at dips. Um there is a massive gamma

430
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
at dips. Um there is a massive gamma
 

431
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,870
at dips. Um there is a massive gamma
level. We're going to go over it on the

432
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
level. We're going to go over it on the
 

433
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,629
level. We're going to go over it on the
spiders,

434
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
spiders,
 

435
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,430
spiders,
right? 670 is huge. In fact, so big.

436
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
right? 670 is huge. In fact, so big.
 

437
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,230
right? 670 is huge. In fact, so big.
Let's just make sure we draw that on.

438
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
Let's just make sure we draw that on.
 

439
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,310
Let's just make sure we draw that on.
Right. Huge [snorts]

440
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
Right. Huge [snorts]
 

441
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,550
Right. Huge [snorts]
put wall.

442
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
put wall.
 

443
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,790
put wall.
Huge, huge, huge, huge, huge put wall.

444
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
Huge, huge, huge, huge, huge put wall.
 

445
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,629
Huge, huge, huge, huge, huge put wall.
They do not want price under this right

446
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
They do not want price under this right
 

447
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,310
They do not want price under this right
now.

448
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
now.
 

449
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,230
now.
I'm going to set a price alert as we get

450
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
I'm going to set a price alert as we get
 

451
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,990
I'm going to set a price alert as we get
close to it as well. If we lose that,

452
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
close to it as well. If we lose that,
 

453
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,750
close to it as well. If we lose that,
it's game over for the market. All

454
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
it's game over for the market. All
 

455
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:19,430
it's game over for the market. All
right. It's that big.

456
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440

 

457
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,069

Sorry, just mark this up so I know. Put

458
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
Sorry, just mark this up so I know. Put
 

459
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,949
Sorry, just mark this up so I know. Put
all. All right, so 670 massive level.

460
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
all. All right, so 670 massive level.
 

461
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,190
all. All right, so 670 massive level.
Uh, guess what the level is on Q's? You

462
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
Uh, guess what the level is on Q's? You
 

463
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,870
Uh, guess what the level is on Q's? You
can probably have a pretty good guess.

464
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
can probably have a pretty good guess.
 

465
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,509
can probably have a pretty good guess.
It is 600.

471
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,030

Sorry about just setting these alerts

472
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
Sorry about just setting these alerts
 

473
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,750
Sorry about just setting these alerts
before I forget.

Okay, so let's go back to spiders so you

476
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
Okay, so let's go back to spiders so you
 

477
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,509
Okay, so let's go back to spiders so you
can have a look at the ETFs. Right, we

478
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
can have a look at the ETFs. Right, we
 

479
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,030
can have a look at the ETFs. Right, we
found a bid of that put wall. We're

480
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
found a bid of that put wall. We're
 

481
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,470
found a bid of that put wall. We're
coming we're already coming back into

482
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
coming we're already coming back into
 

483
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,629
coming we're already coming back into
this old range. So again, very, very

484
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
this old range. So again, very, very
 

485
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,829
this old range. So again, very, very
similar to everything else, right?

486
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
similar to everything else, right?
 

487
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,350
similar to everything else, right?
You've got a channel. It's a very, very

488
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
You've got a channel. It's a very, very
 

489
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,910
You've got a channel. It's a very, very
clear channel down, right? You've got a

490
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
clear channel down, right? You've got a
 

491
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,710
clear channel down, right? You've got a
channel. Every time we're coming up one,

492
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
channel. Every time we're coming up one,
 

493
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,030
channel. Every time we're coming up one,
two, three, four times, we're fading it.

494
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
two, three, four times, we're fading it.
 

495
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,550
two, three, four times, we're fading it.
We're finding dips on the bottom to

496
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
We're finding dips on the bottom to
 

497
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,629
We're finding dips on the bottom to
trade back inside. I would be interested

498
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
trade back inside. I would be interested
 

499
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,949
trade back inside. I would be interested
in this mean today. All right, you might

500
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
in this mean today. All right, you might
 

501
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,069
in this mean today. All right, you might
be like, well, it's midpoint in the

502
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
be like, well, it's midpoint in the
 

503
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,829
be like, well, it's midpoint in the
range. It is, but it's more that we've

504
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
range. It is, but it's more that we've
 

505
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,550
range. It is, but it's more that we've
left sellers stuck underneath it. If

506
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
left sellers stuck underneath it. If
 

507
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,710
left sellers stuck underneath it. If
they hold that, I expect them to try and

508
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
they hold that, I expect them to try and
 

509
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,230
they hold that, I expect them to try and
do something like this today, and that

510
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
do something like this today, and that
 

511
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,910
do something like this today, and that
will be the target. This is big supply.

512
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
will be the target. This is big supply.
 

513
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,069
will be the target. This is big supply.
We don't want to be long up here. We

514
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
We don't want to be long up here. We
 

515
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,750
We don't want to be long up here. We
want to be long from the mean if we're

516
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
want to be long from the mean if we're
 

517
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,389
want to be long from the mean if we're
going to play it up into that.

518
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
going to play it up into that.
 

519
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,230
going to play it up into that.
Same story on the Q's. All right, it's

Same story on the Q's. All right, it's
going to look very, very similar, right?

522
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
going to look very, very similar, right?
 

523
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,030
going to look very, very similar, right?
Interested if we can hold the mean of

currently stuck VIX let's just zoom out

542
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
currently stuck VIX let's just zoom out
 

543
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,230
currently stuck VIX let's just zoom out
of this a minute because these have all

544
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
of this a minute because these have all
 

545
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:06,790
of this a minute because these have all
moved around

547
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,150

right you can see we're Still in a range

548
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
right you can see we're Still in a range
 

549
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,910
right you can see we're Still in a range
in the VIX really. We are trying to

550
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
in the VIX really. We are trying to
 

551
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,590
in the VIX really. We are trying to
build.

552
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
build.
 

553
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,110
build.
This is kind of dangerous, right? This

554
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
This is kind of dangerous, right? This
 

555
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,550
This is kind of dangerous, right? This
is the area I said every time we come

556
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
is the area I said every time we come
 

557
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,069
is the area I said every time we come
down into here, we tend to do these like

558
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
down into here, we tend to do these like
 

559
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,990
down into here, we tend to do these like
pretty drastic moves out. That looks

560
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
pretty drastic moves out. That looks
 

561
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,069
pretty drastic moves out. That looks
like a bit of a swipe. Now we're stuck

562
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
like a bit of a swipe. Now we're stuck
 

563
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,910
like a bit of a swipe. Now we're stuck
in between sort of let's just call it

564
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
in between sort of let's just call it
 

565
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,430
in between sort of let's just call it
18s and 16s. Really no acceptance below

566
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
18s and 16s. Really no acceptance below
 

567
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,430
18s and 16s. Really no acceptance below
16s and we're sort of coming into the

568
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
16s and we're sort of coming into the
 

569
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,430
16s and we're sort of coming into the
mid part of that. So it's a bit messy to

570
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
mid part of that. So it's a bit messy to
 

571
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,269
mid part of that. So it's a bit messy to
be honest on the VIX which is expected

572
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
be honest on the VIX which is expected
 

573
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,829
be honest on the VIX which is expected
into roll over and opex. Do not forget

574
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
into roll over and opex. Do not forget
 

575
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,670
into roll over and opex. Do not forget
we're in a roll over and OPEX week. All

576
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
we're in a roll over and OPEX week. All
 

577
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,590
we're in a roll over and OPEX week. All
right. Options are going to become more

578
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
right. Options are going to become more
 

579
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,030
right. Options are going to become more
and more key as we get through this

580
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
and more key as we get through this
 

581
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,350
and more key as we get through this
week. Let's change these levels. Um, we

582
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
week. Let's change these levels. Um, we
 

583
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,949
week. Let's change these levels. Um, we
can set a price alert on VIX up at 18.

584
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
can set a price alert on VIX up at 18.
 

585
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,590
can set a price alert on VIX up at 18.
And if it starts breaking that

586
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
And if it starts breaking that
 

587
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,670
And if it starts breaking that
VIX upside breakout, then we need to be

588
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
VIX upside breakout, then we need to be
 

589
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,829
VIX upside breakout, then we need to be
aware about market starting to roll over

590
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
aware about market starting to roll over
 

591
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,310
aware about market starting to roll over
if we're going to do that.

592
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
if we're going to do that.
 

593
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,389
if we're going to do that.
Uh, let's have a quick look at gold.

Uh, let's have a quick look at gold.
 

595
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,990
Uh, let's have a quick look at gold.
It's still looks like it's in that

596
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
It's still looks like it's in that
 

597
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,069
It's still looks like it's in that
range. uh for that person that's trading

598
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
range. uh for that person that's trading
 

599
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,550
range. uh for that person that's trading
it and asked me last week or earlier

600
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
it and asked me last week or earlier
 

601
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,670
it and asked me last week or earlier
this week. All right, you're still

602
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
this week. All right, you're still
 

603
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,509
this week. All right, you're still
developing liquidity in here. All the

604
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
developing liquidity in here. All the
 

605
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,470
developing liquidity in here. All the
time you're holding this, you're

606
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
time you're holding this, you're
 

607
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,069
time you're holding this, you're
bullish. The target will be alltime

608
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
bullish. The target will be alltime
 

609
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,430
bullish. The target will be alltime
highs, right? All the time it's doing

610
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
highs, right? All the time it's doing
 

611
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,749
highs, right? All the time it's doing
this, it's trying to build it to get to

612
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
this, it's trying to build it to get to
 

613
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,269
this, it's trying to build it to get to
alltime highs. So, you're holding dips

614
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
alltime highs. So, you're holding dips
 

615
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,749
alltime highs. So, you're holding dips
versus 300 looking for expansion. So,

616
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
versus 300 looking for expansion. So,
 

617
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,829
versus 300 looking for expansion. So,
it's like TP1, TP2. If you lose 300, uh

618
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
it's like TP1, TP2. If you lose 300, uh
 

619
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,910
it's like TP1, TP2. If you lose 300, uh
it's a problem because it's an inability

620
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
it's a problem because it's an inability
 

621
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,550
it's a problem because it's an inability
to break out and then this liquidity can

622
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
to break out and then this liquidity can
 

623
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,749
to break out and then this liquidity can
be moved used to move down. I'm going to

624
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
be moved used to move down. I'm going to
 

625
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,670
be moved used to move down. I'm going to
have one really quick look. We need to

626
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
have one really quick look. We need to
 

627
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,189
have one really quick look. We need to
be aware of this carry trade which is

628
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
be aware of this carry trade which is
 

629
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,590
be aware of this carry trade which is
coming in in the next 24 48 hours

630
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
coming in in the next 24 48 hours
 

631
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,790
coming in in the next 24 48 hours
move starting to do drifting down. Let

632
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
move starting to do drifting down. Let
 

633
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,310
move starting to do drifting down. Let
me just check and then we're going to do

634
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
me just check and then we're going to do
 

635
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,350
me just check and then we're going to do
the mag. I'm running out of time here.

636
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
the mag. I'm running out of time here.
 

637
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,110
the mag. I'm running out of time here.
Okay, that's pulling back inside. Let's

638
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
Okay, that's pulling back inside. Let's
 

639
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,710
Okay, that's pulling back inside. Let's
have a quick look at the mag.

640
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720

 

641
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,110

Held the lows on Apple gapping up but uh

642
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
Held the lows on Apple gapping up but uh
 

643
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,910
Held the lows on Apple gapping up but uh
inside previous days range. Amazon

644
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
inside previous days range. Amazon
 

645
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,509
inside previous days range. Amazon
relative strength. That's a good drive

646
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
relative strength. That's a good drive
 

647
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,110
relative strength. That's a good drive
away. That will give the market some

648
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
away. That will give the market some
 

649
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,189
away. That will give the market some
juice. So if Amazon breaks 27s, that's

650
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
juice. So if Amazon breaks 27s, that's
 

651
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,110
juice. So if Amazon breaks 27s, that's
pretty good. Google, same thing. Gapping

652
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
pretty good. Google, same thing. Gapping
 

653
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,390
pretty good. Google, same thing. Gapping
up, leaving the bottom side of the

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
up, leaving the bottom side of the
 

655
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,150

range, leaving those shorts who are late

656
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
range, leaving those shorts who are late
 

657
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,309
range, leaving those shorts who are late
trapped. Same thing on Meta, leaving

658
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
trapped. Same thing on Meta, leaving
 

659
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,189

late shorts trapped. Same thing on

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
late shorts trapped. Same thing on
 

661
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,630
late shorts trapped. Same thing on
Microsoft, although it's a little bit

662
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:16,640
Microsoft, although it's a little bit
 

663
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,630
Microsoft, although it's a little bit
more messy, but it's got a liquidity run

664
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
more messy, but it's got a liquidity run
 

665
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,630
more messy, but it's got a liquidity run
to do here into 480. So be watching

666
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
to do here into 480. So be watching
 

667
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,230
to do here into 480. So be watching
that. But again, gapping up, leaving

668
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
that. But again, gapping up, leaving
 

669
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,726
that. But again, gapping up, leaving
shorts trapped from earlier in the week.

670
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:24,736
shorts trapped from earlier in the week.

Nvidia, same thing. Shorts trapped down

676
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
Nvidia, same thing. Shorts trapped down
 

677
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,510
Nvidia, same thing. Shorts trapped down
here, back into its range. It needs to

678
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
here, back into its range. It needs to
 

679
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,750
here, back into its range. It needs to
reclaim 75. So, we can set price alert

680
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
reclaim 75. So, we can set price alert
 

681
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,390
reclaim 75. So, we can set price alert
here for Nvidia. Uh

682

reclaim Nvidia. And then Tesla

688
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
reclaim Nvidia. And then Tesla
 

689
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,870
reclaim Nvidia. And then Tesla
needs to do the same thing. Needs to get

690
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
needs to do the same thing. Needs to get
 

691
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,990
needs to do the same thing. Needs to get
back above 81s. All right, we just

692
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
back above 81s. All right, we just
 

693
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,230
back above 81s. All right, we just
missed 500. What you don't want to see

694
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
missed 500. What you don't want to see
 

695
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,310
missed 500. What you don't want to see
is see this this and then that lose.

696
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
is see this this and then that lose.
 

697
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,830
is see this this and then that lose.
What you need to see is this hold and a

698
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
What you need to see is this hold and a
 

699
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,390
What you need to see is this hold and a
reclaim for it to go again. So overall

700
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
reclaim for it to go again. So overall
 

701
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,310
reclaim for it to go again. So overall
MAG looks pretty good, but it's uh it's

702
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
MAG looks pretty good, but it's uh it's
 

703
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,789
MAG looks pretty good, but it's uh it's
all gapping up. So the easiest thing

704
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
all gapping up. So the easiest thing
 

705
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,350
all gapping up. So the easiest thing
will be if they pull back this morning,

706
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
will be if they pull back this morning,
 

707
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,590
will be if they pull back this morning,
that'll be the kindest thing for us. If

708
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
that'll be the kindest thing for us. If
 

709
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,950
that'll be the kindest thing for us. If
we see a nice early morning pullback, we

710
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
we see a nice early morning pullback, we
 

711
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,870
we see a nice early morning pullback, we
can hope for it. Like whether we get it

712
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
can hope for it. Like whether we get it
 

713
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,710
can hope for it. Like whether we get it
or not is another thing. If we bang

714
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
or not is another thing. If we bang
 

715
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,630
or not is another thing. If we bang
straight into this, then um we have to

716
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
straight into this, then um we have to
 

717
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,830
straight into this, then um we have to
see if we're going to do a look above

718
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
see if we're going to do a look above
 

719
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,590
see if we're going to do a look above
and fail or what kind of thing we're

720
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
and fail or what kind of thing we're
 

721
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,669
and fail or what kind of thing we're
going to do.

722
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
going to do.
 

723
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,430
going to do.

What do you mean? How does the mag move
 

737
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,789
What do you mean? How does the mag move
in after hours from people trading it? I

738
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
in after hours from people trading it? I
 

739
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,390
in after hours from people trading it? I
don't I don't understand that question.

740
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
don't I don't understand that question.
 

741
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,190
don't I don't understand that question.
Be very careful. Right, we've developed

742
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
Be very careful. Right, we've developed
 

743
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,110
Be very careful. Right, we've developed
one of these here this morning. It would

744
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
one of these here this morning. It would
 

745
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,789
one of these here this morning. It would
not surprise me for a little push fail

746
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
not surprise me for a little push fail
 

747
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,549
not surprise me for a little push fail
and a fade back inside. So, I definitely

748
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
and a fade back inside. So, I definitely
 

749
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,870
and a fade back inside. So, I definitely
don't want to be long where we are now.

750
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
don't want to be long where we are now.
 

751
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,110
don't want to be long where we are now.
It's a even if it starts shoving up, it

752
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
It's a even if it starts shoving up, it
 

753
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,870
It's a even if it starts shoving up, it
is not a good location to be long out

754
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
is not a good location to be long out
 

755
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,750
is not a good location to be long out
of. So, ideally, they come back down and

756
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
of. So, ideally, they come back down and
 

757
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,590
of. So, ideally, they come back down and
offer us a dip down into here, but we

758
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
offer us a dip down into here, but we
 

759
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,510
offer us a dip down into here, but we
will see here this morning. We will see.

760
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
will see here this morning. We will see.
 

761
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,510
will see here this morning. We will see.
Good luck, everybody.

762
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
Good luck, everybody.
 

763
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,870
Good luck, everybody.
If they're just going to go on a violent

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
If they're just going to go on a violent
 

765
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,549
If they're just going to go on a violent
rip, it's going to be a little bit hard

766
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
rip, it's going to be a little bit hard
 

767
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,470
rip, it's going to be a little bit hard
to get involved if they just want to go

768
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
to get involved if they just want to go
 

769
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,630
to get involved if they just want to go
and test that supply with lost location

770
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
and test that supply with lost location
 

771
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,430
and test that supply with lost location
to be bullish up here. The RR is not

772
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
to be bullish up here. The RR is not
 

773
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,549
to be bullish up here. The RR is not
good. Doesn't mean it doesn't go up

774
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
good. Doesn't mean it doesn't go up
 

775
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,390
good. Doesn't mean it doesn't go up
there. It's just in terms of riskreward,

776
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
there. It's just in terms of riskreward,
 

777
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,230
there. It's just in terms of riskreward,
it's poor.

778
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
it's poor.
 

779
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,430
it's poor.
It is poor.

00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
current point of control like we talked
 

787
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,350
current point of control like we talked
about and how we act here is going to be

788
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
about and how we act here is going to be
 

789
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,110
about and how we act here is going to be
key. Are they going to get above and

790
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,120
key. Are they going to get above and
 

791
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,950
key. Are they going to get above and
base above or are bears going to come

792
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
base above or are bears going to come
 

793
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,110
base above or are bears going to come
back in and say no no no no. Down you

794
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
back in and say no no no no. Down you
 

795
00:19:51,120 --> 00:20:02,549
back in and say no no no no. Down you
go. It's a big big supply area.

796
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:02,559

 

797

but I don't use it on uh
 

803
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,710
but I don't use it on uh
on the weeklys and monthlies. Maybe I

804
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
on the weeklys and monthlies. Maybe I
 

805
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,390
on the weeklys and monthlies. Maybe I
should, maybe that would be a good idea.

806

1090
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
Keeps banging into this shelf. Question
 

1091
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,029
Keeps banging into this shelf. Question
is, can it get back above 280s? Here we

1092
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
is, can it get back above 280s? Here we
 

1093
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,830
is, can it get back above 280s? Here we
go. So, rejection of current value area

1094
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
go. So, rejection of current value area
 

1095
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,230
go. So, rejection of current value area
low.

1096
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
low.
 

1097
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,830

40 plus points is far too much. All
 

1123
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,230
40 plus points is far too much. All

1125
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,909
right, they're going to try and get back

1128
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
280. It's where bears are in control
 

1129
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,070
280. It's where bears are in control
from at the moment.

1130
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,080

 

1131
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,990

You have it 210. Yeah, it's okay. So,

1132
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
You have it 210. Yeah, it's okay. So,
 

1133
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,430
You have it 210. Yeah, it's okay. So,
this one might be wrong. So, I have

1134
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
this one might be wrong. So, I have
 

1135
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,430
this one might be wrong. So, I have
Ninja Trader at 210 as well. So, I'm

1136
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
Ninja Trader at 210 as well. So, I'm
 

1137
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,789
Ninja Trader at 210 as well. So, I'm
going to double this up. All right. Just

1138
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
going to double this up. All right. Just
 

1139
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,950
going to double this up. All right. Just
so that we're aware. It might be that

1140
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960
so that we're aware. It might be that
 

1141
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,190
so that we're aware. It might be that
they protect 210. We don't know, but

1142
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,200
they protect 210. We don't know, but
 

1143
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,909
they protect 210. We don't know, but
it's worth being aware of. It's worth

1144
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:29,919
it's worth being aware of. It's worth
 

1145
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,870
it's worth being aware of. It's worth
being aware of.

1146
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
being aware of.
 

1147
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,310
being aware of.
And that is the level. It's a bit like

1148
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
And that is the level. It's a bit like
 

1149
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,390
And that is the level. It's a bit like
yesterday. Bulls will need to hold

1150
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:36,400
yesterday. Bulls will need to hold
 

1151
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,190
yesterday. Bulls will need to hold
previous days value. All right. So,

1152
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
previous days value. All right. So,
 

1153
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,950
previous days value. All right. So,
we're starting to see some bears get

1154
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
we're starting to see some bears get
 

1155
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,630
we're starting to see some bears get
aggressive here. And they're not getting

1156
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
aggressive here. And they're not getting
 

1157
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,630
aggressive here. And they're not getting
the move down the snap that they want.

1158
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
the move down the snap that they want.
 

1159
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,470
the move down the snap that they want.
We have some bids on the tape all the

1160
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
We have some bids on the tape all the
 

1161
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,029
We have some bids on the tape all the
way down to 200. Here we go. Right. So,

1162
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
way down to 200. Here we go. Right. So,
 

1163
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,029
way down to 200. Here we go. Right. So,
maybe let's see now if these bulls want

1164
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
maybe let's see now if these bulls want
 

1165
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,789
maybe let's see now if these bulls want
to defend previous day's value. This is

1166
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
to defend previous day's value. This is
 

1167
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,990
to defend previous day's value. This is
where they need to come in. If they're

1168
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
where they need to come in. If they're
 

1169
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,870
where they need to come in. If they're
going to defend it, folks must come in

1170
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
going to defend it, folks must come in
 

1171
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,070
going to defend it, folks must come in
around here if they're going to defend

1172
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
around here if they're going to defend
 

1173
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,750
around here if they're going to defend
previous day's value.

1174
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:01,760

 

1175
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,750

So, we'll be looking for bears to get

1176
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
So, we'll be looking for bears to get
 

1177
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,750
So, we'll be looking for bears to get
trapped down here and to see a reaction

1178
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
trapped down here and to see a reaction
 

1179
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,430
trapped down here and to see a reaction
from someone absorbing the tape. If we

1180
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
from someone absorbing the tape. If we
 

1181
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,110
from someone absorbing the tape. If we
don't see that, then there is simply no

1182
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
don't see that, then there is simply no
 

1183
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,350
don't see that, then there is simply no
play at this level and we have to wait

1184
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,360
play at this level and we have to wait
 

1185
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,070
play at this level and we have to wait
for a move all the way down into 100.

1186
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080
for a move all the way down into 100.
 

1187
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,990
for a move all the way down into 100.
And if you've been bearish off that

1188
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
And if you've been bearish off that
 

1189
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,510
And if you've been bearish off that
rejection from the highs, you're looking

1190
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
rejection from the highs, you're looking
 

1191
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,350
rejection from the highs, you're looking
pretty good right now. Really good.

1192
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
pretty good right now. Really good.
 

1193
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,190
pretty good right now. Really good.
So, 95 is losing. We might come all the

1194
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
So, 95 is losing. We might come all the
 

1195
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,510
So, 95 is losing. We might come all the
way down to 100s, but if we reclaim 210s

1196
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
way down to 100s, but if we reclaim 210s
 

1197
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,510
way down to 100s, but if we reclaim 210s

Starting to see a bit of absorption

1218
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:54,399
Starting to see a bit of absorption
 

1219
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,070
Starting to see a bit of absorption
here. We haven't taken out that 75

1220
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,080
here. We haven't taken out that 75
 

1221

player yet, though. Here's previous day

1222

1223
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,389
player yet, though. Here's previous day
value area high. Do they go for a

1224
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
value area high. Do they go for a
 

1225
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,710
value area high. Do they go for a
reclaim and a scream? Maybe. Watching

00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
reclaim and a scream? Maybe. Watching
 

1227

this carefully now. We know this is the
 

1229
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,230
this carefully now. We know this is the
area. If we were bullish, this is the

1230
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
area. If we were bullish, this is the
 

1231
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,750
area. If we were bullish, this is the
area that they would want to see them

1232
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:07,760
area that they would want to see them
 

1233
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,669
area that they would want to see them
defend. We don't see them defend this.

1234
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679
defend. We don't see them defend this.
 

1235
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,750
defend. We don't see them defend this.
There's not a lot we can do with it.

1236
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
There's not a lot we can do with it.
 

1237
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,230
There's not a lot we can do with it.
Still no defending of it. So, that 175

1238
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,240
Still no defending of it. So, that 175
 

1239
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,070
Still no defending of it. So, that 175
player rebidding down there is trying to

1240
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
player rebidding down there is trying to
 

1241
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,350
player rebidding down there is trying to
drag the market down. And they're adding

1242
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,360
drag the market down. And they're adding
 

1243
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,110
drag the market down. And they're adding
lower. This is dangerous because they're

1244
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
lower. This is dangerous because they're
 

1245
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,389
lower. This is dangerous because they're
adding lower. They want to drag this

1246
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
adding lower. They want to drag this
 

1247
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,310
adding lower. They want to drag this
market down.

1248
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,320

 

1249
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,350

Now they're adding at 150 and 137 and

1250
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
Now they're adding at 150 and 137 and
 

1251
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,190
Now they're adding at 150 and 137 and
125. They want this market lower right

1252
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
125. They want this market lower right
 

1253
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,950
125. They want this market lower right
now. Just be careful here, folks. Until

1254
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
now. Just be careful here, folks. Until
 

1255
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,389
now. Just be careful here, folks. Until
we see a strong bid and a strong

1256
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
we see a strong bid and a strong
 

1257
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,389
we see a strong bid and a strong
reaction, I'd be very careful about

1258
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
reaction, I'd be very careful about
 

1259
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,669
reaction, I'd be very careful about
looking for any move back upside.

1260
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679

 

1261
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,350

Yes, doing much better.

1262
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
Yes, doing much better.
 

1263
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,590
Yes, doing much better.
Nice reaction off VWAP. Okay, here we

1264
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
Nice reaction off VWAP. Okay, here we
 

1265
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,830
Nice reaction off VWAP. Okay, here we
go. Let's watch this now into 210s. Do

1266
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
go. Let's watch this now into 210s. Do
 

1267
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,669
go. Let's watch this now into 210s. Do
we have excess down there at 85s? A

1268
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
we have excess down there at 85s? A
 

1269
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,750
we have excess down there at 85s? A
little bit. a little bit. We have a low

1270
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
little bit. a little bit. We have a low
 

1271
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,029
little bit. a little bit. We have a low
volume node at 25 right now. And if we

1272
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
volume node at 25 right now. And if we
 

1273
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,870
volume node at 25 right now. And if we
start really reclaiming 240, it's off to

1274
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:56,880
start really reclaiming 240, it's off to
 

1275
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,549
start really reclaiming 240, it's off to
the races. So, let's see. Do bulls have

1276
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
the races. So, let's see. Do bulls have
 

1277
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,909
the races. So, let's see. Do bulls have
a go here. We're starting to have a go

1278
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
a go here. We're starting to have a go
 

1279
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,190
a go here. We're starting to have a go
here. All right. Here's the low volume

1280
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
here. All right. Here's the low volume
 

1281
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,950
here. All right. Here's the low volume
node into 25. Can we re bid over this?

1282
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
node into 25. Can we re bid over this?
 

1283
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,510
node into 25. Can we re bid over this?
No, is the answer. So, still holding

1284
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,520
No, is the answer. So, still holding
 

1285
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,510
No, is the answer. So, still holding
that low volume node at 25. They need to

1286
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
that low volume node at 25. They need to
 

1287
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,029
that low volume node at 25. They need to
rebid over that. The bulls to have a

1288
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:11,039
rebid over that. The bulls to have a
 

1289
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,750
rebid over that. The bulls to have a
really good go. They got that door shut

1290
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:13,760
really good go. They got that door shut
 

1291
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,430
really good go. They got that door shut
in their face at that low volume node.

1292
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,440
in their face at that low volume node.
 

1293
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,269
in their face at that low volume node.
This little node right here. [snorts]

1294
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:19,279
This little node right here. [snorts]
 

1295
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,190
This little node right here. [snorts]
So that's definitely the overunder right

1296
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
So that's definitely the overunder right
 

1297
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,870
So that's definitely the overunder right
now. And uh 200 is big sellside delta.

1298
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:24,880
now. And uh 200 is big sellside delta.
 

1299
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,470
now. And uh 200 is big sellside delta.
All the time they're under all the time

1300
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
All the time they're under all the time
 

1301
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,389
All the time they're under all the time
we're under 200. Bears are in control.

1302
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:28,399
we're under 200. Bears are in control.
 

1303
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,230
we're under 200. Bears are in control.
They want to fill this guy at 75. He

1304
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,240
They want to fill this guy at 75. He
 

1305
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,630
They want to fill this guy at 75. He
keeps rebidding down there at 75 trying

1306
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
keeps rebidding down there at 75 trying
 

1307
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,470
keeps rebidding down there at 75 trying
to drag the market down. And now he's

1308
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
to drag the market down. And now he's
 

1309
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,630
to drag the market down. And now he's
bidding at 62 and 50. So little

1310
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
bidding at 62 and 50. So little
 

1311
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,830
bidding at 62 and 50. So little
concerning that we're going to go all

1312
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:37,840
concerning that we're going to go all
 

1313
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,389
concerning that we're going to go all
the way down to be up here, I would say,

1314
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
the way down to be up here, I would say,
 

1315
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,789
the way down to be up here, I would say,
because they're trying to use big size

1316
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:42,799
because they're trying to use big size
 

1317
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,950
because they're trying to use big size
as a magnet. He is starting to lose a

1318
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:44,960
as a magnet. He is starting to lose a
 

1319
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,830
as a magnet. He is starting to lose a
bid. Apple's still in a cell and Nvidia

1320
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
bid. Apple's still in a cell and Nvidia
 

1321
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,269
bid. Apple's still in a cell and Nvidia
got absolutely hammered from that top

1322
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
got absolutely hammered from that top
 

1323
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,990
got absolutely hammered from that top
range. So, nothing here, just a backside

1324
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000
range. So, nothing here, just a backside
 

1325
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,590
range. So, nothing here, just a backside
move. If you took the short here or here

1326
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
move. If you took the short here or here
 

1327
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,029
move. If you took the short here or here
for the lower high like we talked about,

1328
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
for the lower high like we talked about,
 

1329
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,950
for the lower high like we talked about,
congratulations. I am waiting for this

1330
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
congratulations. I am waiting for this
 

1331
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,430
congratulations. I am waiting for this
long to come in and it might be that it

1332
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,440
long to come in and it might be that it
 

1333
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,269
long to come in and it might be that it
doesn't come. It's it's possible.

1334
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279
doesn't come. It's it's possible.
 

1335
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,950
doesn't come. It's it's possible.
It's possible, but this is the area

1336
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
It's possible, but this is the area
 

1337
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,470
It's possible, but this is the area
around here if it's going to come, but I

1338
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:06,480
around here if it's going to come, but I
 

1339
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,870
around here if it's going to come, but I
need to see some strength.

1340
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880

 

1341
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,710

Still haven't filled this player at 75

1342
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
Still haven't filled this player at 75
 

1343
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,950
Still haven't filled this player at 75
who's playing games. He is playing games

1344
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:14,960
who's playing games. He is playing games
 

1345
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,430
who's playing games. He is playing games
down there.

1346
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,440

 

1347
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,190

I'm on the H contract. You will be able

1348
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm on the H contract. You will be able
 

1349
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,950
I'm on the H contract. You will be able
to tell by the price on the side.

1350
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
to tell by the price on the side.
 

1351
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,950

Everyone who asks that, right, just look

Everyone who asks that, right, just look
 

1353
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,310
Everyone who asks that, right, just look
at the price. They're very different

1354
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
at the price. They're very different
 

1355
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,870
at the price. They're very different
prices.

1356
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
prices.
 

1357
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,549
prices.
We rolled over on Tuesday. As soon as

1358
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559
We rolled over on Tuesday. As soon as
 

1359
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,149
We rolled over on Tuesday. As soon as
the volume rolled over, we rolled over.

1360
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
the volume rolled over, we rolled over.
 

1361
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,990
the volume rolled over, we rolled over.
They're still trying to bid at 75 and

1362
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,000
They're still trying to bid at 75 and
 

1363
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,830
They're still trying to bid at 75 and
50. Little concerned about a flush

1364
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
50. Little concerned about a flush
 

1365
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,549
50. Little concerned about a flush
coming to fill these guys.

1366
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
coming to fill these guys.
 

1367
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,990
coming to fill these guys.
I'm not sure we're ready. I don't think

1368
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm not sure we're ready. I don't think
 

1369
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:56,389
I'm not sure we're ready. I don't think
we finished this auction lower yet.

1370
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399

 

1371
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,870

Yes, it's weak as well. Very, very weak.

1372
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880

 

1373
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,710

There's the spy

1374
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720

 

1375
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,789

76es. We know 75 is a big level.

1376
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:12,799

 

1377
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,710

Still waiting here. I'd love to get

1378
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
Still waiting here. I'd love to get
 

1379
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,230
Still waiting here. I'd love to get
long. Just waiting to see something to

1380
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
long. Just waiting to see something to
 

1381
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,269
long. Just waiting to see something to
give me some interest.

1382
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:21,279

 

1383
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,950

Maybe a reclaim of value. What I don't

1384
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:22,960
Maybe a reclaim of value. What I don't
 

1385
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,870
Maybe a reclaim of value. What I don't
like is these bids below us. I do not

1386
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880
like is these bids below us. I do not
 

1387
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,470
like is these bids below us. I do not
like how they played. We definitely have

1388
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
like how they played. We definitely have
 

1389
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,669
like how they played. We definitely have
some shorts trapped for the first time

1390
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:27,679
some shorts trapped for the first time
 

1391
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,950
some shorts trapped for the first time
today. 85 though.

1392
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
today. 85 though.
 

1393
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,070
today. 85 though.
Remember, we've got to watch this low

1394
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,080
Remember, we've got to watch this low
 

1395
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,509
Remember, we've got to watch this low
volume though. That will act as

1396
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519
volume though. That will act as
 

1397
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,630
volume though. That will act as
resistance all the time. They're

1398
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
resistance all the time. They're
 

1399
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,310
resistance all the time. They're
rejecting that. They can still shove

1400
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
rejecting that. They can still shove
 

1401
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,149
rejecting that. They can still shove
this down. I don't like this bids

1402
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
this down. I don't like this bids
 

1403
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,830
this down. I don't like this bids
underneath. If we can get over 200, we

1404
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:39,840
underneath. If we can get over 200, we
 

1405
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,230
underneath. If we can get over 200, we
have delta offside. And if we can get

1406
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:42,240
have delta offside. And if we can get
 

1407
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,029
have delta offside. And if we can get
over 25, there's a potential squeeze.

1408
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,039
over 25, there's a potential squeeze.
 

1409
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,630
over 25, there's a potential squeeze.
Watching this carefully if these guys

1410
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:46,640
Watching this carefully if these guys
 

1411
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,070
Watching this carefully if these guys
actually want to play ball.

1412
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
actually want to play ball.
 

1413
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,230
actually want to play ball.
I can't get up to that low volume even

1414
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
I can't get up to that low volume even
 

1415
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,470
I can't get up to that low volume even
even up there right now. VIX has done a

1416
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:54,480
even up there right now. VIX has done a
 

1417
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,549
even up there right now. VIX has done a
spike back up to 17. So be careful.

1418
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
spike back up to 17. So be careful.
 

1419
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,310
spike back up to 17. So be careful.
Come on, market. I'd love to be bullish

1420
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
Come on, market. I'd love to be bullish
 

1421
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,870
Come on, market. I'd love to be bullish
today. Either swipe lower or get going.

1422
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:02,880
today. Either swipe lower or get going.
 

1423
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,269
today. Either swipe lower or get going.
Don't just sit here. Nothing I can do

1424
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
Don't just sit here. Nothing I can do
 

1425
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:12,389
Don't just sit here. Nothing I can do
here right now.

1426
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:12,399

 

1427
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,909

I hate that they're adding liquidity

1428
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:13,919
I hate that they're adding liquidity
 

1429
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,830
I hate that they're adding liquidity
lower. It does not make me think this

1430
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:15,840
lower. It does not make me think this
 

1431
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,389
lower. It does not make me think this
auction's finished. Point of control

1432
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:18,399
auction's finished. Point of control
 

1433
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,070
auction's finished. Point of control
right now for this session is 88 now.

1434
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,080
right now for this session is 88 now.
 

1435
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,750
right now for this session is 88 now.
And everyone is bearish underneath, but

1436
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:23,760
And everyone is bearish underneath, but
 

1437
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,070
And everyone is bearish underneath, but
they keep adding liquidity lower again.

1438
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
they keep adding liquidity lower again.
 

1439
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,669
they keep adding liquidity lower again.
They [\h__\h] doubled up that size

1440
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:27,679
They [\h__\h] doubled up that size
 

1441
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,870
They [\h__\h] doubled up that size
underneath.

1442
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:30,880

 

1443
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,350

Messy start to the day based on what

1444
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
Messy start to the day based on what
 

1445
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,870
Messy start to the day based on what
they're doing with the volume.

1446
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
they're doing with the volume.
 

1447
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,549
they're doing with the volume.
This is where bears got stuck where we

1448
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:38,559
This is where bears got stuck where we
 

1449
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,870
This is where bears got stuck where we
are now. 85 and under. And I'm not

1450
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,880
are now. 85 and under. And I'm not
 

1451
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,630
are now. 85 and under. And I'm not
convinced right now that we're not going

1452
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
convinced right now that we're not going
 

1453
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,789
convinced right now that we're not going
lower. If Mr. 75, Mr. 150 pissed off,

1454
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
lower. If Mr. 75, Mr. 150 pissed off,
 

1455
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,950
lower. If Mr. 75, Mr. 150 pissed off,
I'd maybe think that we were done, but I

1456
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
I'd maybe think that we were done, but I
 

1457
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,669
I'd maybe think that we were done, but I
don't think we are.

1458
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679

 

1459
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,070

Trigger for me would be

1460
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,080
Trigger for me would be
 

1461
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,590
Trigger for me would be
10 125 basing above that probably. We

1462
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:01,600
10 125 basing above that probably. We
 

1463
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,509
10 125 basing above that probably. We
did just leave those bears trapped again

1464
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:03,519
did just leave those bears trapped again
 

1465
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,750
did just leave those bears trapped again
into point control. So 85 is stuck. Here

1466
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
into point control. So 85 is stuck. Here
 

1467
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,470
into point control. So 85 is stuck. Here
come the bulls and slammed in their face

1468
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:08,480
come the bulls and slammed in their face
 

1469
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,710
come the bulls and slammed in their face
again. So this 10 and 20s, I'm watching

1470
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:10,720
again. So this 10 and 20s, I'm watching
 

1471
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,230
again. So this 10 and 20s, I'm watching
this now to see if we're going to break.

1472
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,240
this now to see if we're going to break.
 

1473
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,510
this now to see if we're going to break.
Have they actually got any strength

1474
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,520
Have they actually got any strength
 

1475
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,270
Have they actually got any strength
here?

1476
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
here?
 

1477
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,710
here?
Can't get over this little low volume

1478
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
Can't get over this little low volume
 

1479
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,470
Can't get over this little low volume
node. Can we get over this low volume

1480
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:18,480
node. Can we get over this low volume
 

1481
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:29,349
node. Can we get over this low volume
node and start attacking upside

1482
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:29,359

 

1483
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,030

175 still on the book down there? He's

1484
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
175 still on the book down there? He's
 

1485
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,669
175 still on the book down there? He's
still not left. I don't like that he's

1486
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:33,679
still not left. I don't like that he's
 

1487
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,470
still not left. I don't like that he's
not walking up.

1488
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:40,480

 

1489
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,710

Tricky, tricky.

1490
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
Tricky, tricky.
 

1491
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,550
Tricky, tricky.
Watching these 25s. That's the low

1492
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
Watching these 25s. That's the low
 

1493
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,990
Watching these 25s. That's the low
volume. Rejected it again.

1494
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
volume. Rejected it again.
 

1495
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,790
volume. Rejected it again.
Rejected 25s again.

1496
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:52,800

 

1497
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,190

And that's 7 Mr. 175 still there. Big

1498
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,200
And that's 7 Mr. 175 still there. Big
 

1499
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,990
And that's 7 Mr. 175 still there. Big
rejection of 25s again. Don't like that.

1500
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,000
rejection of 25s again. Don't like that.
 

1501
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,349
rejection of 25s again. Don't like that.
Mr. Mr. 175 hasn't walked up. So, we got

1502
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
Mr. Mr. 175 hasn't walked up. So, we got
 

1503
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,190
Mr. Mr. 175 hasn't walked up. So, we got
to get over that low volume node and we

1504
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
to get over that low volume node and we
 

1505
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,069
to get over that low volume node and we
need Mr. 175 to stop being a bit of a

1506
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:06,079
need Mr. 175 to stop being a bit of a
 

1507
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,069
need Mr. 175 to stop being a bit of a
prick hanging out down there because

1508
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
prick hanging out down there because
 

1509
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,430
prick hanging out down there because
he's trying to attract the market down

1510
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,440
he's trying to attract the market down
 

1511
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,750
he's trying to attract the market down
to him and he might well get it. Bears

1512
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
to him and he might well get it. Bears
 

1513
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,750
to him and he might well get it. Bears
are stuck underneath 85. But if we've

1514
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
are stuck underneath 85. But if we've
 

1515
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,430
are stuck underneath 85. But if we've
just rejected low volume node, if this

1516
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,440
just rejected low volume node, if this
 

1517
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,430
just rejected low volume node, if this
is a lower high, oh, don't do that. This

1518
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
is a lower high, oh, don't do that. This
 

1519
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,109
is a lower high, oh, don't do that. This
is a lower high, we might very well come

1520
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:19,119
is a lower high, we might very well come
 

1521
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,589
is a lower high, we might very well come
and sweep. Oh, you're going to not let

1522
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
and sweep. Oh, you're going to not let
 

1523
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,270
and sweep. Oh, you're going to not let
me teach now today either. E, we might

1524
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,280
me teach now today either. E, we might
 

1525
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,470
me teach now today either. E, we might
very well come and do one of these,

1526
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,480
very well come and do one of these,
 

1527
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,670
very well come and do one of these,
which we're starting to see happen.

1528
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
which we're starting to see happen.
 

1529
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,990
which we're starting to see happen.
There you go. [\h__\h] hell, mate. This

00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,000
There you go. [\h__\h] hell, mate. This

1536
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,000
absolute [\h__\h] I knew he was going to be
 

1537
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,244
absolute [\h__\h] I knew he was going to be
a dick today. You could see it.

1538
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:39,254
a dick today. You could see it.
 

1539
00:35:39,254 --> 00:35:43,510
a dick today. You could see it.

1540
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520

 

1541
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,349

Oh, what a bell end. He wants price much

1542
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:47,359
Oh, what a bell end. He wants price much
 

1543
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,710
Oh, what a bell end. He wants price much
lower then, does he?

1544
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:50,720
lower then, does he?
 

1545
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,190
lower then, does he?
Let this [\h__\h] mess around. Right, he's

1546
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
Let this [\h__\h] mess around. Right, he's
 

1547
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,109
Let this [\h__\h] mess around. Right, he's
gone to 160 now. Let's see if he gets

1548
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:55,119
gone to 160 now. Let's see if he gets
 

1549
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,510
gone to 160 now. Let's see if he gets
himself caught. Still not in. I'm

1550
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520
himself caught. Still not in. I'm
 

1551
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,030
himself caught. Still not in. I'm
watching to see if we expand through low

1552
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
watching to see if we expand through low
 

1553
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,750
watching to see if we expand through low
volume node. Then our join. Here's low

1554
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
volume node. Then our join. Here's low
 

1555
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,750
volume node. Then our join. Here's low
volume node. I've got to see us close up

1556
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:03,760
volume node. I've got to see us close up
 

1557
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,670
volume node. I've got to see us close up
above this now. Starting to join in

to hold price though. We got to get

1562
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760
to hold price though. We got to get
 

1563
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,589
to hold price though. We got to get
through this and accelerate. All

1564
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:11,599
through this and accelerate. All
 

1565
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,190
through this and accelerate. All
starting to get trapped through at 36.

1566
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
starting to get trapped through at 36.
 

1567
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,190
starting to get trapped through at 36.
Want to see acceleration moving stop

1568
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,200
Want to see acceleration moving stop
 

1569
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,829
Want to see acceleration moving stop
into the money.

1570
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:17,839
into the money.
 

1571
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,790
into the money.
What a knob that guy at 175 was. There's

1572
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
What a knob that guy at 175 was. There's
 

1573

VWAP. I've already taken a big chunk of
 

1581
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,270
VWAP. I've already taken a big chunk of
my uh position off. Really, we want to

1582
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
my uh position off. Really, we want to
 

1583

1584
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:35,760
hold over this. Otherwise, I'm out.
 

1585
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,750
hold over this. Otherwise, I'm out.
Okay. Out here already. And if we rebid

1586
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:37,760
Okay. Out here already. And if we rebid
 

1587
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,430
Okay. Out here already. And if we rebid
this at 210, I'll be interested in

1588
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
this at 210, I'll be interested in
 

1589
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,069
this at 210, I'll be interested in
taking it again on a reload. If we lose

1590
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079
taking it again on a reload. If we lose
 

1591
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,630
taking it again on a reload. If we lose
210, I'm not really interested. I know

1592
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640
210, I'm not really interested. I know
 

1593
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,630
210, I'm not really interested. I know
there's a guy playing games on the tape

1594
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:46,640
there's a guy playing games on the tape
 

1595
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,630
there's a guy playing games on the tape
today. So, I want to be careful until

1596
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
today. So, I want to be careful until
 

1597
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,550
today. So, I want to be careful until
he's done playing his games. I want to

1598
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:50,560
he's done playing his games. I want to
 

1599
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,109
he's done playing his games. I want to
be careful. Here's the red dip into 110.

1600
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:53,119
be careful. Here's the red dip into 110.
 

1601
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,470
be careful. Here's the red dip into 110.
Now, do they hold this? If they don't

1602
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
Now, do they hold this? If they don't
 

1603
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,870
Now, do they hold this? If they don't
hold this, be very, very careful. It's a

1604
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:56,880
hold this, be very, very careful. It's a
 

1605
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,030
hold this, be very, very careful. It's a
good dip. Good hold so far. There is a

1606
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
good dip. Good hold so far. There is a
 

1607
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,950
good dip. Good hold so far. There is a
bid there at 14s. I know. And he's come

1608
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:00,960
bid there at 14s. I know. And he's come
 

1609
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,750
bid there at 14s. I know. And he's come
back on at 75.

1610
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:05,760

 

1611
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,150

It's iffy, man. It's iffy in here. I'm

1612
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,160
It's iffy, man. It's iffy in here. I'm
 

1613
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,030
It's iffy, man. It's iffy in here. I'm
going to tell you. I'm going to be very

1614
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
going to tell you. I'm going to be very
 

1615
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,190
going to tell you. I'm going to be very
honest with you. We should be bidding

1616
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,200
honest with you. We should be bidding
 

1617
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,470
honest with you. We should be bidding
back off it, but they couldn't get

1618
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
back off it, but they couldn't get
 

1619
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,069
back off it, but they couldn't get
through this low volume node. So, bears

1620
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
through this low volume node. So, bears
 

1621
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,109
through this low volume node. So, bears
are in control. We're underneath VWAP.

1622
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
are in control. We're underneath VWAP.
 

1623
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,589
are in control. We're underneath VWAP.
This here is holding us down. I'm flat

1624
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:19,599
This here is holding us down. I'm flat
 

1625
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,270
This here is holding us down. I'm flat
right now. I wanted to see if we held

1626
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,280
right now. I wanted to see if we held
 

1627
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,510
right now. I wanted to see if we held
tens. We didn't. It's possible they come

1628
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
tens. We didn't. It's possible they come
 

1629
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,349
tens. We didn't. It's possible they come
back down into this and this. Look at

1630
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:25,359
back down into this and this. Look at
 

1631
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,910
back down into this and this. Look at
them adding at 75 and 60s now. This

1632
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:27,920
them adding at 75 and 60s now. This
 

1633
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,430
them adding at 75 and 60s now. This
guy's trying to attract the market down.

1634
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
guy's trying to attract the market down.
 

1635
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,270
guy's trying to attract the market down.
I need at this point I actually want the

1636
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280
I need at this point I actually want the
 

1637
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,069
I need at this point I actually want the
market to flush everyone out. I think

1638
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:34,079
market to flush everyone out. I think
 

1639
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,589
market to flush everyone out. I think
they've built a lot of people in here.

1640
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:35,599
they've built a lot of people in here.
 

1641
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,670
they've built a lot of people in here.
It would it would actually be beneficial

1642
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
It would it would actually be beneficial
 

1643
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,589
It would it would actually be beneficial
if we flush everyone out. Bare flag.

1644
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
if we flush everyone out. Bare flag.
 

1645
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,270
if we flush everyone out. Bare flag.
Yeah, absolutely. That's is what it's

1646
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,280
Yeah, absolutely. That's is what it's
 

1647
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,630
Yeah, absolutely. That's is what it's
currently looking like, right? Because

1648
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
currently looking like, right? Because
 

1649
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,430
currently looking like, right? Because
they had the opportunity here.

1650
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:45,440
they had the opportunity here.
 

1651
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,310
they had the opportunity here.
Where's to dip and hold this and do it.

1652
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,320
Where's to dip and hold this and do it.
 

1653
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,829
Where's to dip and hold this and do it.
They couldn't do it. So, they should

1654
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:49,839
They couldn't do it. So, they should
 

1655
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,510
They couldn't do it. So, they should
come and run these out. But bears are

1656
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,520
come and run these out. But bears are
 

1657
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,790
come and run these out. But bears are
stuck here, right here into current low

1658
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800
stuck here, right here into current low
 

1659
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,349
stuck here, right here into current low
90 to low. Well,

1660
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
90 to low. Well,
 

1661
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,230
90 to low. Well,
94s into the lows. We have excess. But

1662
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,240
94s into the lows. We have excess. But
 

1663
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,910
94s into the lows. We have excess. But
this guy keeps adding lower. So, he

1664
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:01,920
this guy keeps adding lower. So, he
 

1665
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,630
this guy keeps adding lower. So, he
wants the market lower.

1666
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:04,640
wants the market lower.
 

1667
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,910
wants the market lower.
So, I can show you. I'm pretty much

1668
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:05,920
So, I can show you. I'm pretty much
 

1669
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,630
So, I can show you. I'm pretty much
flat. All right. Just a couple trading

1670
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
flat. All right. Just a couple trading
 

1671
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,150
flat. All right. Just a couple trading
at the moment together in a little

1672
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
at the moment together in a little
 

1673
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,589
at the moment together in a little
bundle.

1674
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599

 

1675
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,030

It might be we come all the way down,

1676
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,040
It might be we come all the way down,
 

1677
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,190
It might be we come all the way down,
which is fine. If you're short, you've

1678
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
which is fine. If you're short, you've
 

1679
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,430
which is fine. If you're short, you've
looked very good that failure. This was

1680
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
looked very good that failure. This was
 

1681
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,710
looked very good that failure. This was
the short really. And uh there's value.

1682
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
the short really. And uh there's value.
 

1683
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,829
the short really. And uh there's value.
So, let's see.

1684
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:27,839
So, let's see.
 

1685
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,670
So, let's see.
Let's see.

1686
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
Let's see.
 

1687
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,349
Let's see.
Shorts coming flying in. Not getting

1688
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:31,359
Shorts coming flying in. Not getting
 

1689
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,069
Shorts coming flying in. Not getting
much of acceptance lower here. We're

1690
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
much of acceptance lower here. We're
 

1691
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,710
much of acceptance lower here. We're
pretty close to VWAP. Same on the ES. Uh

1692
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,720
pretty close to VWAP. Same on the ES. Uh
 

1693
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,030
pretty close to VWAP. Same on the ES. Uh
shorts did just come flying in. If we

1694
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,040
shorts did just come flying in. If we
 

1695
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,190
shorts did just come flying in. If we
get back above 91, they're all going to

1696
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
get back above 91, they're all going to
 

1697
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,109
get back above 91, they're all going to
be trapped.

1698
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:43,119
be trapped.
 

1699
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,150
be trapped.
Is he adding lower again?

1700
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,160
Is he adding lower again?
 

1701
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:53,430
Is he adding lower again?
62s. He's at right now. 6250s.

1702
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440

 

1703
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,109

75 GX magnet. Yeah, def definitely. I've

1704
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
75 GX magnet. Yeah, def definitely. I've
 

1705
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,270
75 GX magnet. Yeah, def definitely. I've
got the whole thing marked out.

1706
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:03,280

 

1707
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,190

Let's battle down here. The bulls are

1708
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
Let's battle down here. The bulls are
 

1709
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,630
Let's battle down here. The bulls are
trying to bid off this area. They're

1710
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
trying to bid off this area. They're
 

1711
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,750
trying to bid off this area. They're
trying to hold previous day's value.

1712
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:11,760

 

1713
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,270

So this was the interesting. This was

1714
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,280
So this was the interesting. This was
 

1715
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,710
So this was the interesting. This was
the level I had on Trading View and this

1716
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:14,720
the level I had on Trading View and this
 

1717
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,150
the level I had on Trading View and this
is off Ninja Trade and Trading View

1718
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
is off Ninja Trade and Trading View
 

1719
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,670
is off Ninja Trade and Trading View
level just held. Weird

1720
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
level just held. Weird
 

1721
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,190
level just held. Weird
weird weird weird weird that there's

1722
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,200
weird weird weird weird that there's
 

1723
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,750
weird weird weird weird that there's
such a big um discrepancy between the

1724
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,760
such a big um discrepancy between the
 

1725
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,870
such a big um discrepancy between the
two. [snorts]

1726
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:28,880

 

1727
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,630

All right, watching again. Same looking

1728
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,640
All right, watching again. Same looking
 

1729
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,230
All right, watching again. Same looking
at the same thing just to see if bears

1730
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,240
at the same thing just to see if bears
 

1731
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,230
at the same thing just to see if bears
get trapped down here. Not going to be

1732
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
get trapped down here. Not going to be
 

1733
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,150
get trapped down here. Not going to be
aggressive. Just waiting to see if they

1734
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,160
aggressive. Just waiting to see if they
 

1735
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,109
aggressive. Just waiting to see if they
do. If they do, we can play upside

1736
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
do. If they do, we can play upside
 

1737
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,150
do. If they do, we can play upside
because it means we're not having

1738
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,160
because it means we're not having
 

1739
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,109
because it means we're not having
acceptance into previous days uh value.

1740
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:43,119
acceptance into previous days uh value.
 

1741
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,390
acceptance into previous days uh value.
That's all I'm looking for. I'm looking

1742
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:44,400
That's all I'm looking for. I'm looking
 

1743
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,150
That's all I'm looking for. I'm looking
to lean on previous days value to see if

1744
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,160
to lean on previous days value to see if
 

1745
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,550
to lean on previous days value to see if
bulls want to hold it and control it. If

1746
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
bulls want to hold it and control it. If
 

1747
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,670
bulls want to hold it and control it. If
they're not willing to hold it and

1748
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:49,680
they're not willing to hold it and
 

1749
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,750
they're not willing to hold it and
control it, then there's no play here.

1750
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:51,760
control it, then there's no play here.
 

1751
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,750
control it, then there's no play here.
And uh the next level will be down here.

1752
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
And uh the next level will be down here.
 

1753
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,430
And uh the next level will be down here.
All right. So, if bulls want to sort of

1754
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
All right. So, if bulls want to sort of
 

1755
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,790
All right. So, if bulls want to sort of
do something like this, there's a play

1756
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800
do something like this, there's a play
 

1757
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,190
do something like this, there's a play
back upside. If they fail this, this is

1758
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
back upside. If they fail this, this is
 

1759
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,790
back upside. If they fail this, this is
the next side to check. If we're going

1760
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:02,800
the next side to check. If we're going
 

1761
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,030
the next side to check. If we're going
to fail that, I don't want to play. This

1762
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,040
to fail that, I don't want to play. This
 

1763
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,670
to fail that, I don't want to play. This
is my no play zone down here today.

1764
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:07,680
is my no play zone down here today.
 

1765
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,790
is my no play zone down here today.
Don't want to play in yesterday's

1766
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:08,800
Don't want to play in yesterday's
 

1767
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,910
Don't want to play in yesterday's
levels.

1768
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:13,920

 

1769
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,910

They're still in control. 62 is still

1770
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:15,920
They're still in control. 62 is still
 

1771
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,550
They're still in control. 62 is still
the level right now. No rebidding 62s.

1772
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,560

 

1773
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,750

We're pretty [clears throat] close to

1774
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
We're pretty [clears throat] close to
 

1775
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,510
We're pretty [clears throat] close to
VWAP on ES. We're under VWOP on spiders.

1776
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
VWAP on ES. We're under VWOP on spiders.
 

1777
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,589
VWAP on ES. We're under VWOP on spiders.
So, you got divergence there.

1778
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599

 

1779
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,150

No, don't change that. Thank you. All

1780
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
No, don't change that. Thank you. All
 

1781
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,829
No, don't change that. Thank you. All
right. Bear's getting stuck down there.

1782
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
right. Bear's getting stuck down there.
 

1783
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,349
right. Bear's getting stuck down there.
Still not repric over this uh 210s.

1784
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:41,359

 

1785
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,829

It's still bidding at 62s. Still can't

1786
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:43,839
It's still bidding at 62s. Still can't
 

1787
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,430
It's still bidding at 62s. Still can't
get over 210. So that's your rotation

1788
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
get over 210. So that's your rotation
 

1789
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,750
get over 210. So that's your rotation
right now. 62 to 210s. If you get over

1790
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:47,760
right now. 62 to 210s. If you get over
 

1791
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:57,270
right now. 62 to 210s. If you get over
210, your rotation is to 240s.

1792
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280

 

1793
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,109

Guys, you keep like

1794
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
Guys, you keep like
 

1795
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,309
Guys, you keep like
which contract? NQ. Please guys, please

1796
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:04,319
which contract? NQ. Please guys, please
 

1797
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,550
which contract? NQ. Please guys, please
use your eyes. Look at the side. Look at

1798
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
use your eyes. Look at the side. Look at
 

1799
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,790
use your eyes. Look at the side. Look at
the price. Look at the contracts. Big

1800
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
the price. Look at the contracts. Big
 

1801
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,630
the price. Look at the contracts. Big
difference in price. You can see it

1802
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:10,640
difference in price. You can see it
 

1803
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,470
difference in price. You can see it
really easy. Everyone's rolled over now.

1804
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,480
really easy. Everyone's rolled over now.
 

1805
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,589
really easy. Everyone's rolled over now.
If you're trading the old contract,

1806
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
If you're trading the old contract,
 

1807
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,950
If you're trading the old contract,
you're way behind on volume. Here's the

1808
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:14,960
you're way behind on volume. Here's the
 

1809
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,630
you're way behind on volume. Here's the
reclaim. Looking to see if we can

1810
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
reclaim. Looking to see if we can
 

1811
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,630
reclaim. Looking to see if we can
squeeze. Watching to see if we can close

1812
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
squeeze. Watching to see if we can close
 

1813
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,030
squeeze. Watching to see if we can close
back above 210s and 220s. If we can't do

1814
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
back above 210s and 220s. If we can't do
 

1815
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,870
back above 210s and 220s. If we can't do
that, there's no play. But if we can

1816
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:22,880
that, there's no play. But if we can
 

1817
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,589
that, there's no play. But if we can
close back above, I am interested in it.

1818
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:25,599
close back above, I am interested in it.
 

1819
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,030
close back above, I am interested in it.
Watching very carefully with this

1820
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
Watching very carefully with this
 

1821
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,710
Watching very carefully with this
divergence between ES Spy and V1.

1822
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720

 

1823
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:47,990

Spy through it. He has not had it yet.

1824
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000

 

1825
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,589

Don't like how we built this out, but

1826
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:49,599
Don't like how we built this out, but
 

1827
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:59,430
Don't like how we built this out, but
hey. Coming into VWAP here.

1828
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440

 

1829
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,589

Yep. Okay, let's go then, baby. Let's

1830
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:01,599
Yep. Okay, let's go then, baby. Let's
 

1831
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,430
Yep. Okay, let's go then, baby. Let's
go. If we're going to go through it, we

1832
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
go. If we're going to go through it, we
 

1833
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,349
go. If we're going to go through it, we
got to go up into it. Yep. Yep. Yep.

1834
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,359
got to go up into it. Yep. Yep. Yep.
 

1835
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,829
got to go up into it. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Lock some in. Let's see if we can get

1836
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:07,839
Lock some in. Let's see if we can get
 

1837
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,990
Lock some in. Let's see if we can get
it. Are you going to offer any more

1838
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,000
it. Are you going to offer any more
 

1839
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,750
it. Are you going to offer any more
into this low volume node again? They've

1840
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:13,760
into this low volume node again? They've
 

1841
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,270
into this low volume node again? They've
got to hold this node and accelerate.

1842
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280
got to hold this node and accelerate.
 

1843
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,510
got to hold this node and accelerate.
Otherwise, there's no play here. Come on

1844
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
Otherwise, there's no play here. Come on
 

1845

Beautiful. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
 

1853
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,950
Beautiful. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go. There's value

1854
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
go, go, go, go, go, go. There's value
 

1855
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,990
go, go, go, go, go, go. There's value
high on the session. Let's go

1856
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,000
high on the session. Let's go
 

1857
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,069
high on the session. Let's go
accelerate. Accelerate. Accelerate.

1858
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:32,079
accelerate. Accelerate. Accelerate.
 

1859
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,270
accelerate. Accelerate. Accelerate.
Taking some off here cuz we're

1860
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
Taking some off here cuz we're
 

1861
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,109
Taking some off here cuz we're
stuttering into the 50s. I want to see

1862
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:35,119
stuttering into the 50s. I want to see
 

1863
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,230
stuttering into the 50s. I want to see
acceleration now up to 7980.

1864
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,240
acceleration now up to 7980.
 

1865
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,829
acceleration now up to 7980.
That's my next TP. And if we get through

1866
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
That's my next TP. And if we get through
 

1867
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,309
That's my next TP. And if we get through
that, we get going. Really nice. ES has

1868
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
that, we get going. Really nice. ES has
 

1869
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,750
that, we get going. Really nice. ES has
already done that move. So ES is already

1870
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:43,760
already done that move. So ES is already
 

1871
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,190
already done that move. So ES is already
into its New York open. That's why I'm

1872
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,200
into its New York open. That's why I'm
 

1873
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,550
into its New York open. That's why I'm
locking in some profit. If we get back

1874
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
locking in some profit. If we get back
 

1875
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,550
locking in some profit. If we get back
over New York open, New York session

1876
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,560
over New York open, New York session
 

1877
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,069
over New York open, New York session
goes red to green. So far, they're

1878
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
goes red to green. So far, they're
 

1879
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,270
goes red to green. So far, they're
defending it. So locked in most in this

1880
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
defending it. So locked in most in this
 

1881
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,390
defending it. So locked in most in this
drive.

1882
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400

 

1883
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,270

I keep moving that accidentally.

1884
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,280

 

1885
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,109

Really nice. They're still holding. Just

1886
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
Really nice. They're still holding. Just
 

1887
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,270
Really nice. They're still holding. Just
don't let this come back below 37. Now

1888
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,280
don't let this come back below 37. Now
 

1889
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,950
don't let this come back below 37. Now
we've built a little shelf there at 37.

1890
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:10,960
we've built a little shelf there at 37.
 

1891
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,270
we've built a little shelf there at 37.
Low volume node. Still down at 25. So we

1892
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
Low volume node. Still down at 25. So we
 

1893
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,750
Low volume node. Still down at 25. So we
need to hold above this node for bulls.

1894
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
need to hold above this node for bulls.
 

1895
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,230
need to hold above this node for bulls.
Do not definitely don't want 220. 220

1896
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
Do not definitely don't want 220. 220
 

1897
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,829
Do not definitely don't want 220. 220
where I came back in. Don't want to lose

1898
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
where I came back in. Don't want to lose
 

1899
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,430
where I came back in. Don't want to lose
220.

1900
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:23,440

 

1901
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,270

Looks good. They're going to try and

1902
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
Looks good. They're going to try and
 

1903
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,190
Looks good. They're going to try and
accelerate here.

1904
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,200

 

1905
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,630

little shelf up here. They're trying to

1906
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:30,640
little shelf up here. They're trying to
 

1907
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,230
little shelf up here. They're trying to
accelerate. This is the ES New York

1908
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
accelerate. This is the ES New York
 

1909
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,829
accelerate. This is the ES New York
Open. They want to accelerate back

1910
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
Open. They want to accelerate back
 

1911
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,150
Open. They want to accelerate back
through it. So, what they're attempting

1912
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,160
through it. So, what they're attempting
 

1913
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,150
through it. So, what they're attempting
to do at the moment is to accelerate

1914
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,160
to do at the moment is to accelerate
 

1915
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,829
to do at the moment is to accelerate
through this New York Open. They keep

1916
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:39,839
through this New York Open. They keep
 

1917
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,309
through this New York Open. They keep
getting stuck here on the ES. It's a big

1918
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:42,319
getting stuck here on the ES. It's a big
 

1919
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,349
getting stuck here on the ES. It's a big
overunder.

1920
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:45,359

 

1921
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,510

Here they go. Last attempt. If they

1922
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
Here they go. Last attempt. If they
 

1923
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,550
Here they go. Last attempt. If they
can't get through, I'm going to cut the

1924
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:48,560
can't get through, I'm going to cut the
 

1925
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,829
can't get through, I'm going to cut the
rest. They've got to go and they got to

1926
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:49,839
rest. They've got to go and they got to
 

1927
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,069
rest. They've got to go and they got to
go now.

1928
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
go now.
 

1929
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,270
go now.
You got to go and you got to go now.

1930
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,280
You got to go and you got to go now.
 

1931
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,950
You got to go and you got to go now.
Come on, baby. I've only got a little

1932
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:56,960
Come on, baby. I've only got a little
 

1933
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,349
Come on, baby. I've only got a little
bit left. You got any juice? Yeah, let's

1934
00:43:59,349 --> 00:43:59,359
bit left. You got any juice? Yeah, let's
 

1935
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,030
bit left. You got any juice? Yeah, let's
go.

1936
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
go.
 

1937
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,670
go.
Let's go.

1938
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
Let's go.
 

1939
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,190
Let's go.
All right, bit more off there. Big

1940
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
All right, bit more off there. Big
 

1941
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,109
All right, bit more off there. Big
reaction. I'm going to wait now for a

1942
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
reaction. I'm going to wait now for a
 

1943
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,550
reaction. I'm going to wait now for a
reload if we're going to come back down

1944
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
reload if we're going to come back down
 

1945
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,309
reload if we're going to come back down
and fill.

1946
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
and fill.
 

1947
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,950
and fill.
Only a runner left now.

1948
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
Only a runner left now.
 

1949
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,710
Only a runner left now.
It's getting frothy up here. Big big

1950
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:14,720
It's getting frothy up here. Big big
 

1951
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,470
It's getting frothy up here. Big big
battle here.

1952
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:18,480

 

1953
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,309

We should go 80s if they're going to do

1954
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:20,319
We should go 80s if they're going to do
 

1955
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,390
We should go 80s if they're going to do
the same move, but ES is uh going under

1956
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:22,400
the same move, but ES is uh going under
 

1957
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,150
the same move, but ES is uh going under
over under over. It's getting rejected

1958
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,160
over under over. It's getting rejected
 

1959
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,190
over under over. It's getting rejected
now. out. So let's see if they rehold

1960
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
now. out. So let's see if they rehold
 

1961
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,589
now. out. So let's see if they rehold
this dip now. So this needs to be held

1962
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:29,599
this dip now. So this needs to be held
 

1963
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,990
this dip now. So this needs to be held
as a dip for buyers

1964
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,000
as a dip for buyers
 

1965
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,510
as a dip for buyers
if we're going to go back upside. All

1966
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520
if we're going to go back upside. All
 

1967
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,190
if we're going to go back upside. All
right, that's your sentiment is this low

1968
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
right, that's your sentiment is this low
 

1969
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,950
right, that's your sentiment is this low
volume node. Buyers must hold this dip

1970
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:36,960
volume node. Buyers must hold this dip
 

1971
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,030
volume node. Buyers must hold this dip
for rotation. We went into value area

1972
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,040
for rotation. We went into value area
 

1973
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,550
for rotation. We went into value area
high on the current session. All right,

1974
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:40,560
high on the current session. All right,
 

1975
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,270
high on the current session. All right,
so no look below. No acceptance under

1976
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,280
so no look below. No acceptance under
 

1977
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,270
so no look below. No acceptance under
here. This was previous day value. I'm

1978
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
here. This was previous day value. I'm
 

1979
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,790
here. This was previous day value. I'm
going to remove this because this must

1980
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
going to remove this because this must
 

1981
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,390
going to remove this because this must
be wrong. So trading view was right

1982
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
be wrong. So trading view was right
 

1983
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,750
be wrong. So trading view was right
today. The 160s. So we came W shape into

1984
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
today. The 160s. So we came W shape into
 

1985
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,510
today. The 160s. So we came W shape into
previous day's value high. If we hold

1986
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:53,520
previous day's value high. If we hold
 

1987
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,430
previous day's value high. If we hold
this, we should accelerate. This is your

00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,440
this, we should accelerate. This is your
 

1989
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,030
this, we should accelerate. This is your

TP
 

1991
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,589
TP
and then up here. It's why I wanted to

1992
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599
and then up here. It's why I wanted to
 

1993
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,230
and then up here. It's why I wanted to
be bullish today on pullbacks.

1994
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:04,240

 

1995
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,589

They are desperately trying to

1996
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
They are desperately trying to
 

1997
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,670
They are desperately trying to
accelerate, but they're they keep

1998
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:07,680
accelerate, but they're they keep
 

1999
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,670
accelerate, but they're they keep
getting stuck up here. Once this uh lets

2000
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:09,680
getting stuck up here. Once this uh lets
 

2001
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,950
getting stuck up here. Once this uh lets
go, there's probably a swipe um upside

2002
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:12,960
go, there's probably a swipe um upside
 

2003
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,270
go, there's probably a swipe um upside
into 80s, but it's a big if button.

2004
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:15,280
into 80s, but it's a big if button.
 

2005
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,030
into 80s, but it's a big if button.
Maybe right now.

00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,040

 

2007
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,589

I hate that this buyer is still down at

I hate that this buyer is still down at
 

2009
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,109
I hate that this buyer is still down at
175 and not jogging price up. Don't like

2010
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:25,119
175 and not jogging price up. Don't like
 

2011
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:35,270
175 and not jogging price up. Don't like
that. What is he doing?

2012
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280

 

2013
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,190

Sellers coming flying in here. So, back

00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
Sellers coming flying in here. So, back
 

2015
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,510
Sellers coming flying in here. So, back
down to this low volume node and VWAP.

00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:39,520
down to this low volume node and VWAP.
 

2017
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,270
down to this low volume node and VWAP.
Buyers must hold that low volume node

2018
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,280
Buyers must hold that low volume node
 

2019
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:53,829
Buyers must hold that low volume node
and VWAP otherwise they will get caught.

You wonder if they need to do a little

00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:11,119
You wonder if they need to do a little
 

2031
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,030
You wonder if they need to do a little
reflush and then bid it back up at the

00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:13,040
reflush and then bid it back up at the

Yeah, balls need to defend this.

Lots of bears coming in here and we're

want this to still accelerate, but just

want this to still accelerate, but just
 

2055
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,790
want this to still accelerate, but just
let's see. Can they get up to 80s?

2056
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
let's see. Can they get up to 80s?

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,349
let's see. Can they get up to 80s?
They're going to have one more go.

00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:43,359
They're going to have one more go.

the day right now. That shelf up here
holding. Once we get through that,

holding. Once we get through that,
 

2067
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,510

there's probably acceleration. Here we

00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
acceleration. Here we come. Can we get
 

2073
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,109
acceleration. Here we come. Can we get
80s and then a price above 80s?

Discord, let's think about what we've
just done. Right. What did we talk about

00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
just done. Right. What did we talk about
 

2115
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,550

00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:58,560
this morning? Where was the dip to? What
 

2117
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,710
this morning? Where was the dip to? What
was the pathing? All right. All drawn

2118
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:00,720
was the pathing? All right. All drawn
 

2119
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,390
was the pathing? All right. All drawn
out. We're looking good. Here was the

2120
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:02,400
out. We're looking good. Here was the
 

2121
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,950
out. We're looking good. Here was the
pathing into previous day area high. All

2122
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:04,960
pathing into previous day area high. All
 

2123
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,390
pathing into previous day area high. All
right. And looking for that move back

2124
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
right. And looking for that move back
 

2125
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,710
right. And looking for that move back
into 300s. We're close to it now. So,

2126
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:08,720
into 300s. We're close to it now. So,
 

2127
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,309
into 300s. We're close to it now. So,
locking most in. Really nice way

2128
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:12,319
locking most in. Really nice way
 

2129
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,030
locking most in. Really nice way
on a Thursday. Nice. Nice play, guys.

2130
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,040
on a Thursday. Nice. Nice play, guys.
 

2131
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,589
on a Thursday. Nice. Nice play, guys.
Nice play. Lock most in. You're holding

2132
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:17,599
Nice play. Lock most in. You're holding
 

2133
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,790
Nice play. Lock most in. You're holding
runners now to see if you get

2134
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
runners now to see if you get
 

2135
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,230
runners now to see if you get
acceleration. The one thing I'd be

2136
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:20,240
acceleration. The one thing I'd be
 

2137
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,470
acceleration. The one thing I'd be
watching in like some of these mag are

2138
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:22,480
watching in like some of these mag are
 

2139
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,309
watching in like some of these mag are
not able to reclaim some of these supply

2140
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:24,319
not able to reclaim some of these supply
 

2141
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,069
not able to reclaim some of these supply
levels. So, you want to be careful. Like

2142
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,079
levels. So, you want to be careful. Like
 

2143
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,510
levels. So, you want to be careful. Like
for example, 175 on Nvidia tapped in in

2144
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:29,520

it's not a tick chart. It's a one minute
 

2323

it's not a tick chart. It's a one minute

got it. Really nice work. All right, so

2328
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:24,160
got it. Really nice work. All right, so
 

2329
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,910
got it. Really nice work. All right, so
we hit we hit the level we were looking

2330
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:25,920
we hit we hit the level we were looking
 

2331
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,230
we hit we hit the level we were looking
for. So this sort of New York open, we

2332
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,240
for. So this sort of New York open, we
 

2333
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,910
for. So this sort of New York open, we
can still it's possible they still be

2334
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
can still it's possible they still be
 

2335
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,670
can still it's possible they still be
bullish, but we can develop a range here

2336
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
bullish, but we can develop a range here
 

2337
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,069
bullish, but we can develop a range here
now because we know from the current

2338
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:34,079
now because we know from the current
 

2339
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,309
now because we know from the current
weekly all right, from the current

2340
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:36,319
weekly all right, from the current
 

2341
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,270
weekly all right, from the current
current weekly profile, this is our

2342
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
current weekly profile, this is our
 

2343
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,190
current weekly profile, this is our
point of control. This red box I

2344
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:41,200
point of control. This red box I
 

2345
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,790
point of control. This red box I
expected on the first test to get

2346
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
expected on the first test to get
 

2347
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,470
expected on the first test to get
rejected. All right, maybe they reject

2348
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,480
rejected. All right, maybe they reject
 

2349
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,710
rejected. All right, maybe they reject
it again. Maybe we base over and hold

2350
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:46,720
it again. Maybe we base over and hold
 

2351
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,390
it again. Maybe we base over and hold
and then there's a re long. All right,

2352
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:48,400
and then there's a re long. All right,
 

2353
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,390
and then there's a re long. All right,
but bulls the reason one of you asked

2354
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,400
but bulls the reason one of you asked
 

2355
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,150
but bulls the reason one of you asked
why was I long bias? Why was I long

2356
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:52,160
why was I long bias? Why was I long
 

2357
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,470
why was I long bias? Why was I long
biased? If we zoom out, everything

2358
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
biased? If we zoom out, everything
 

2359
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,470
biased? If we zoom out, everything
starts from the higher time frame. This

2360
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:56,480
starts from the higher time frame. This
 

2361
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,910
starts from the higher time frame. This
is why you need to get here in the

2362
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:57,920
is why you need to get here in the
 

2363
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,549
is why you need to get here in the
mornings. All right, we have already hit

2364
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:00,559
mornings. All right, we have already hit
 

2365
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,990
mornings. All right, we have already hit
a 61 fib to the downside. All right, so

2366
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:04,000
a 61 fib to the downside. All right, so
 

2367
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,470
a 61 fib to the downside. All right, so
we are in deep discount. All right, deep

2368
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
we are in deep discount. All right, deep
 

2369
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,150
we are in deep discount. All right, deep
discount. We're on discount based on

2370
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,160
discount. We're on discount based on
 

2371
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,950
discount. We're on discount based on
profile. We're a discount based on fibs,

2372
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:10,960
profile. We're a discount based on fibs,
 

2373
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,190
profile. We're a discount based on fibs,
right? And we

2374
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:13,200
right? And we
 

2375
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,349
right? And we
are not getting acceptance under this

2376
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
are not getting acceptance under this
 

2377
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,950
are not getting acceptance under this
shelf. All right. If bears wanted to do

2378
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:16,960
shelf. All right. If bears wanted to do
 

2379
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,630
shelf. All right. If bears wanted to do
this, they would need to smash us back

2380
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
this, they would need to smash us back
 

2381
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,390
this, they would need to smash us back
down. We're not seeing that. We've

2382
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,400
down. We're not seeing that. We've
 

2383
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,549
down. We're not seeing that. We've
reclaimed it. We're an inside bar. I

2384
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:22,559
reclaimed it. We're an inside bar. I
 

2385
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,870
reclaimed it. We're an inside bar. I
expect liquidity to be built out today.

2386
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:24,880
expect liquidity to be built out today.
 

2387
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,270
expect liquidity to be built out today.
And I expect dips to be holding into

2388
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,280
And I expect dips to be holding into
 

2389
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,069
And I expect dips to be holding into
these key levels. So daily for me was

2390
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
these key levels. So daily for me was
 

2391
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,069
these key levels. So daily for me was
bullish rotation. All right, bullish

2392
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079
bullish rotation. All right, bullish
 

2393
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,630
bullish rotation. All right, bullish
rotation. Not bullish, bullish rotation.

2394
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
rotation. Not bullish, bullish rotation.
 

2395
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,510
rotation. Not bullish, bullish rotation.
If we then go to the hourly chart. All

2396
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:37,520
If we then go to the hourly chart. All
 

2397
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,990
If we then go to the hourly chart. All
right, we talked about what price did

2398
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,000
right, we talked about what price did
 

2399
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,910
right, we talked about what price did
yesterday.

2400
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:41,920
yesterday.
 

2401
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,990
yesterday.
We have these big nodes. All right, we

2402
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
We have these big nodes. All right, we
 

2403
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,390
We have these big nodes. All right, we
have a at the low failing to auction

2404
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,400
have a at the low failing to auction
 

2405
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,230
have a at the low failing to auction
lower. All right, we left some nice

2406
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
lower. All right, we left some nice
 

2407
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,950
lower. All right, we left some nice
excess. We repriced. We drove away from

2408
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:50,960
excess. We repriced. We drove away from
 

2409
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,710
excess. We repriced. We drove away from
think about this. Think about if you

2410
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:52,720
think about this. Think about if you
 

2411
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,390
think about this. Think about if you
were short in here. All right, if you

2412
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:54,400
were short in here. All right, if you
 

2413
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,950
were short in here. All right, if you
are swing short in here, who's stuck in

2414
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:56,960
are swing short in here, who's stuck in
 

2415
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,390
are swing short in here, who's stuck in
this market? Swing shorts from down

2416
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:58,400
this market? Swing shorts from down
 

2417
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,630
this market? Swing shorts from down
here. All right, bulls up here are stuck

2418
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:00,640
here. All right, bulls up here are stuck
 

2419
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,630
here. All right, bulls up here are stuck
or bulls in here are stuck, right? And

2420
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
or bulls in here are stuck, right? And
 

2421
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,790
or bulls in here are stuck, right? And
swing shorts down here. So we expect

2422
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:04,800
swing shorts down here. So we expect
 

2423
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,630
swing shorts down here. So we expect
price to probably move between these

2424
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640
price to probably move between these
 

2425
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,549
price to probably move between these
levels and these levels. These are the

2426
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:08,559
levels and these levels. These are the
 

2427
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,069
levels and these levels. These are the
current rotations, right? And if we find

2428
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
current rotations, right? And if we find
 

2429
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,670
current rotations, right? And if we find
acceptance above, we're going to go

2430
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
acceptance above, we're going to go
 

2431
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,950
acceptance above, we're going to go
between these levels. If we find

2432
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
between these levels. If we find
 

2433
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,470
between these levels. If we find
acceptance below, we're going to go

2434
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
acceptance below, we're going to go
 

2435
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,309
acceptance below, we're going to go
between these levels. But what I know is

2436
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
between these levels. But what I know is
 

2437
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,630
between these levels. But what I know is
the person in pain right now is the

2438
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,640
the person in pain right now is the
 

2439
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,790
the person in pain right now is the
person who got short thinking the world

2440
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:20,800
person who got short thinking the world
 

2441
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,549
person who got short thinking the world
is going to end. All right? That person

2442
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:22,559
is going to end. All right? That person
 

2443
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,549
is going to end. All right? That person
is the person in pain. So that is the

2444
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:24,559
is the person in pain. So that is the
 

2445
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,349
is the person in pain. So that is the
person I want to abuse this morning. I

2446
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:27,359
person I want to abuse this morning. I
 

2447
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,990
person I want to abuse this morning. I
say that in a light manner, right? In a

2448
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,000
say that in a light manner, right? In a
 

2449
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,190
say that in a light manner, right? In a
light manner. That's who I'm going to

2450
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200
light manner. That's who I'm going to
 

2451
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,109
light manner. That's who I'm going to
abuse. Once we reclaim previous day

2452
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
abuse. Once we reclaim previous day
 

2453
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,549
abuse. Once we reclaim previous day
value area high, remember this is

2454
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:36,559
value area high, remember this is
 

2455
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,190
value area high, remember this is
previous day's value.

2456
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,200
previous day's value.
 

2457
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,309
previous day's value.
This is current week's value.

2458
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:42,319
This is current week's value.
 

2459
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,549
This is current week's value.
If we are going to hold these levels

2460
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:44,559
If we are going to hold these levels
 

2461
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,870
If we are going to hold these levels
here, I'm going to expect a rotation

2462
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:46,880
here, I'm going to expect a rotation
 

2463
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,190
here, I'm going to expect a rotation
either in here or in here if we find

2464
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
either in here or in here if we find
 

2465
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,589
either in here or in here if we find
acceptance. All right. So that means

2466
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:51,599
acceptance. All right. So that means
 

2467
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,829
acceptance. All right. So that means
everyone from here is trapped. So I want

2468
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:53,839
everyone from here is trapped. So I want
 

2469
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,670
everyone from here is trapped. So I want
to be bullish all the time they're

2470
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:55,680
to be bullish all the time they're
 

2471
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,510
to be bullish all the time they're
trapped. That's not to say you can't

2472
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,520
trapped. That's not to say you can't
 

2473
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,950
trapped. That's not to say you can't
sell this like I talked about in the

2474
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:58,960
sell this like I talked about in the
 

2475
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,030
sell this like I talked about in the
morning drive back down to these levels,

2476
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:01,040
morning drive back down to these levels,
 

2477
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,430
morning drive back down to these levels,
but for me it's more likely that we're

2478
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,440
but for me it's more likely that we're
 

2479
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,030
but for me it's more likely that we're
going to see something like this. Maybe

2480
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
going to see something like this. Maybe
 

2481
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,950
going to see something like this. Maybe
after the two-leg they resell it. Very

2482
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:06,960
after the two-leg they resell it. Very
 

2483
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,870
after the two-leg they resell it. Very
possible. But it's more likely that

2484
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:08,880
possible. But it's more likely that
 

2485
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,230
possible. But it's more likely that
we're going to abuse these people at

2486
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
we're going to abuse these people at
 

2487
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,470
we're going to abuse these people at
least to start. So that was why I was

2488
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:12,480
least to start. So that was why I was
 

2489
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,990
least to start. So that was why I was
going to say I said I was going to leave

2490
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,000
going to say I said I was going to leave
 

2491
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,589
going to say I said I was going to leave
the short and focus on the long after

2492
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
the short and focus on the long after
 

2493
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,910
the short and focus on the long after
the short. Plus, if you rewind it said I

2494
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:19,920
the short. Plus, if you rewind it said I
 

2495
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,829
the short. Plus, if you rewind it said I
say and it's going to buy me some time

2496
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
say and it's going to buy me some time
 

2497
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,230
say and it's going to buy me some time
to see what happens. So the bullish move

2498
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
to see what happens. So the bullish move
 

2499
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,309
to see what happens. So the bullish move
I said I'm not going to take the drive

2500
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:26,319
I said I'm not going to take the drive
 

2501
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,309
I said I'm not going to take the drive
opening drive into here because the RR

2502
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319
opening drive into here because the RR
 

2503
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,990
opening drive into here because the RR
is too bad. There's your trend line.

2504
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,000
is too bad. There's your trend line.
 

2505
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,470
is too bad. There's your trend line.
There's the liquidity built. This is the

2506
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
There's the liquidity built. This is the
 

2507
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,390
There's the liquidity built. This is the
level that we were interested in. We can

2508
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400
level that we were interested in. We can
 

2509
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,109
level that we were interested in. We can
delete that cuz that is incorrect. So

2510
00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:37,119
delete that cuz that is incorrect. So
 

2511
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,430
delete that cuz that is incorrect. So
trading view coming up clutch this time.

2512
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:39,440
trading view coming up clutch this time.
 

2513
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,630
trading view coming up clutch this time.
This is the level that we were

2514
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
This is the level that we were
 

2515
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,390
This is the level that we were
interested in and this level. So we were

2516
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:42,400
interested in and this level. So we were
 

2517
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,950
interested in and this level. So we were
interested in 160

2518
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:44,960
interested in 160
 

2519
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,030
interested in 160
and 25K if we had to but I really didn't

2520
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
and 25K if we had to but I really didn't
 

2521
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,109
and 25K if we had to but I really didn't
want it to get down there. So 160 and

2522
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:49,119
want it to get down there. So 160 and
 

2523
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,030
want it to get down there. So 160 and
100

2524
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,040
100
 

2525
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,750
100
opening drive, right? They all come

2526
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
opening drive, right? They all come
 

2527
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,430
opening drive, right? They all come
flying in. They get stuck at current

2528
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:55,440
flying in. They get stuck at current
 

2529
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,750
flying in. They get stuck at current
weak point controlling supply. We get

2530
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
weak point controlling supply. We get
 

2531
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,390
weak point controlling supply. We get
boom, boom, boom. All right. Everyone

2532
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:00,400
boom, boom, boom. All right. Everyone
 

2533
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,789
boom, boom, boom. All right. Everyone
who bought late out the money. Perfect.

2534
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:02,799
who bought late out the money. Perfect.
 

2535
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,510
who bought late out the money. Perfect.
I'm watching in here and here to see if

2536
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
I'm watching in here and here to see if
 

2537
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,950
I'm watching in here and here to see if
bears get stuck. We move to this. Zoom

2538
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:08,960
bears get stuck. We move to this. Zoom
 

2539
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,270
bears get stuck. We move to this. Zoom
in. Show you what I'm watching. This

2540
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:11,280
in. Show you what I'm watching. This
 

2541
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,030
in. Show you what I'm watching. This
candle right here, we create excess.

2542
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
candle right here, we create excess.
 

2543
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,390
candle right here, we create excess.
All right. So this is the first time

2544
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
All right. So this is the first time
 

2545
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,829
All right. So this is the first time
like okay well bears are starting to get

2546
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:19,839
like okay well bears are starting to get
 

2547
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,470
like okay well bears are starting to get
stuck and then they try again here.

2548
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,480
stuck and then they try again here.
 

2549
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,309
stuck and then they try again here.
That's the transition. So I was watching

2550
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
That's the transition. So I was watching
 

2551
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:28,069
That's the transition. So I was watching
200 220 220 was the key trigger for me

2552
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
200 220 220 was the key trigger for me
 

2553
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,630
200 220 220 was the key trigger for me
was around here. All right. And once we

2554
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:30,640
was around here. All right. And once we
 

2555
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,950
was around here. All right. And once we
started to see this I'm long for the

2556
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
started to see this I'm long for the
 

2557
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,630
started to see this I'm long for the
acceleration

2558
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:34,640
acceleration
 

2559
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,630
acceleration
and then out. All right. So it's the

2560
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
and then out. All right. So it's the
 

2561
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,950
and then out. All right. So it's the
same level.

2562
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:38,960
same level.
 

2563
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,069
same level.
You pair that with the volume profile.

2564
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:42,079
You pair that with the volume profile.
 

2565
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,829
You pair that with the volume profile.
Right. The same level with the volume

2566
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:43,839
Right. The same level with the volume
 

2567
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,870
Right. The same level with the volume
profile. 220s. Where was the shelf? Get

2568
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
profile. 220s. Where was the shelf? Get
 

2569
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,349
profile. 220s. Where was the shelf? Get
rid of all this. Sorry folks. Where was

2570
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:49,359
rid of all this. Sorry folks. Where was
 

2571
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,910
rid of all this. Sorry folks. Where was
the shelf? Right here is build out of

2572
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:51,920
the shelf? Right here is build out of
 

2573
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,510
the shelf? Right here is build out of
liquidity.

2574
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:55,520

 

2575
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,069

Do this as just gray.

2576
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:58,079
Do this as just gray.
 

2577
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,309
Do this as just gray.
Did we have acceptance below this? No,

2578
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:00,319
Did we have acceptance below this? No,
 

2579
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,750
Did we have acceptance below this? No,
we couldn't close this. This is where

2580
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:01,760
we couldn't close this. This is where
 

2581
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,190
we couldn't close this. This is where
those shorts came flying in and got

2582
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:03,200
those shorts came flying in and got
 

2583
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,190
those shorts came flying in and got
trapped. The moment we start to break

2584
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:05,200
trapped. The moment we start to break
 

2585
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,190
trapped. The moment we start to break
this level, especially through here,

2586
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
this level, especially through here,
 

2587
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,950
this level, especially through here,
because they reject it once, now we've

2588
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960
because they reject it once, now we've
 

2589
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,030
because they reject it once, now we've
got more shorts piling in again. Once

2590
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,040
got more shorts piling in again. Once
 

2591
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,150
got more shorts piling in again. Once
we're going to get through that, we're

2592
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
we're going to get through that, we're
 

2593
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,069
we're going to get through that, we're
going to see acceleration. So, go back

2594
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
going to see acceleration. So, go back
 

2595
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,829
going to see acceleration. So, go back
and rewind it. I know once we get

2596
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
and rewind it. I know once we get
 

2597
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,270
and rewind it. I know once we get
through that it's probably going to be a

2598
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,280
through that it's probably going to be a
 

2599
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,510
through that it's probably going to be a
breakaway to the upside. ES was leading

2600
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
breakaway to the upside. ES was leading
 

2601
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,270
breakaway to the upside. ES was leading
the charge which which helped us as

2602
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:21,280
the charge which which helped us as
 

2603
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,630
the charge which which helped us as
well. Right. So that's why we were

2604
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:24,640
well. Right. So that's why we were
 

2605
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,069
well. Right. So that's why we were
looking for that. Hopefully that makes

2606
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
looking for that. Hopefully that makes
 

2607
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,589
looking for that. Hopefully that makes
sense.

2608
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:29,599

 

2609
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,150

Hopefully that makes sense.

2610
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160
Hopefully that makes sense.
 

2611
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,990
Hopefully that makes sense.
Um

2612
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,000
Um
 

2613
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,670
Um
do you have your bookmap settings

2614
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:35,680
do you have your bookmap settings
 

2615
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,109
do you have your bookmap settings
anywhere? They're just standard, mate.

2616
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:37,119
anywhere? They're just standard, mate.
 

2617
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,630
anywhere? They're just standard, mate.
They're not they're not even uh

2618
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640
They're not they're not even uh
 

2619
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,430
They're not they're not even uh
different settings. Uh there's no like

2620
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
different settings. Uh there's no like
 

2621
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,829
different settings. Uh there's no like
special settings for them. Um, the only

2622
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:43,839
special settings for them. Um, the only
 

2623
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,030
special settings for them. Um, the only
thing I change is the the DOM. Uh, I I

2624
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:47,040
thing I change is the the DOM. Uh, I I
 

2625
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,950
thing I change is the the DOM. Uh, I I
want to see the delta and price before I

2626
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:48,960
want to see the delta and price before I
 

2627
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,230
want to see the delta and price before I
see anything else. So, I know like 250

2628
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
see anything else. So, I know like 250
 

2629
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,589
see anything else. So, I know like 250
right now is a control zone for bears.

2630
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
right now is a control zone for bears.
 

2631
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,789
right now is a control zone for bears.
Um,

2632
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799

 

2633
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,549

how do you see previous day value? You

2634
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:00,559
how do you see previous day value? You
 

2635
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,349
how do you see previous day value? You
draw it out. Yeah. So, your 930 levels.

2636
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:05,359
draw it out. Yeah. So, your 930 levels.
 

2637
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,870
draw it out. Yeah. So, your 930 levels.
We're getting back into current price in

2638
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
We're getting back into current price in
 

2639
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,549
We're getting back into current price in
a moment, right? [snorts] So, you would

2640
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:08,559
a moment, right? [snorts] So, you would
 

2641
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,670
a moment, right? [snorts] So, you would
go from

2642
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:11,680
go from
 

2643
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,270
go from
930

2644
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:15,280

 

2645
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,270

into 4:00 and you would just draw that

2646
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:17,280
into 4:00 and you would just draw that
 

2647
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,870
into 4:00 and you would just draw that
out and then mark it. I don't know why

2648
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:18,880
out and then mark it. I don't know why
 

2649
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,349
out and then mark it. I don't know why
it shifted but uh there we go there or

2650
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
it shifted but uh there we go there or
 

2651
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,390
it shifted but uh there we go there or
thereabouts. 178 one it was 160 earlier.

2652
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
thereabouts. 178 one it was 160 earlier.
 

2653
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,069
thereabouts. 178 one it was 160 earlier.
I've probably drawn it off by a little

2654
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:26,079
I've probably drawn it off by a little
 

2655
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,069
I've probably drawn it off by a little
bit probably what happened. Yeah, you

2656
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
bit probably what happened. Yeah, you
 

2657
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,430
bit probably what happened. Yeah, you
just draw it out and then you mark it

2658
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,440
just draw it out and then you mark it
 

2659
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,349
just draw it out and then you mark it
with your horizontal lines. Um go

2660
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
with your horizontal lines. Um go
 

2661
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,990
with your horizontal lines. Um go
go on my YouTube there is a free video I

2662
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
go on my YouTube there is a free video I
 

2663
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,510
go on my YouTube there is a free video I
think it's called like volume profile

2664
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:37,520
think it's called like volume profile
 

2665
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,470
think it's called like volume profile
mastery or something like that. Go and

2666
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:40,480
mastery or something like that. Go and
 

2667
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,789
mastery or something like that. Go and
watch that. All right. So now we're

2668
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:42,799
watch that. All right. So now we're
 

2669
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,069
watch that. All right. So now we're
going to get that build out of liquidity

2670
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:44,079
going to get that build out of liquidity
 

2671
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,670
going to get that build out of liquidity
like we talked about. All right. So from

2672
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:45,680
like we talked about. All right. So from
 

2673
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,829
like we talked about. All right. So from
current we point control to here. This

2674
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:47,839
current we point control to here. This
 

2675
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,030
current we point control to here. This
is why I was long from here and they can

2676
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,040
is why I was long from here and they can
 

2677
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,789
is why I was long from here and they can
hold this and look for an acceleration.

2678
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:52,799
hold this and look for an acceleration.
 

2679
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,870
hold this and look for an acceleration.
They can also lose this because now we

2680
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
They can also lose this because now we
 

2681
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,309
They can also lose this because now we
can build out a huge liquidity day. So I

2682
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
can build out a huge liquidity day. So I
 

2683
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,670
can build out a huge liquidity day. So I
would say that probably the easy money

2684
00:58:59,670 --> 00:58:59,680
would say that probably the easy money
 

2685
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,030
would say that probably the easy money
is gone. If they're going to hold this,

2686
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:01,040
is gone. If they're going to hold this,
 

2687
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,390
is gone. If they're going to hold this,
bulls are going to need to come in here.

2688
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:02,400
bulls are going to need to come in here.
 

2689
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,109
bulls are going to need to come in here.
Think about the W acceleration low

2690
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:05,119
Think about the W acceleration low
 

2691
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,510
Think about the W acceleration low
volume node. Bulls must hold this. And

2692
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:07,520
volume node. Bulls must hold this. And
 

2693
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,789
volume node. Bulls must hold this. And
really you want to see them get back

2694
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
really you want to see them get back
 

2695
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,470
really you want to see them get back
above that. The problem now is how we're

2696
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:10,480
above that. The problem now is how we're
 

2697
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,470
above that. The problem now is how we're
building thick levels everywhere. It's

2698
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,480
building thick levels everywhere. It's
 

2699
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,910
building thick levels everywhere. It's
going to get harder and harder as we get

2700
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,920
going to get harder and harder as we get
 

2701
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,069
going to get harder and harder as we get
through this day.

2702
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:18,079

 

2703
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,069

Uh stacked yet, I h I have them, but I

2704
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:20,079
Uh stacked yet, I h I have them, but I
 

2705
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,510
Uh stacked yet, I h I have them, but I
have them showing on Ninja Trader. Yeah,

2706
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:21,520
have them showing on Ninja Trader. Yeah,
 

2707
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:33,589
have them showing on Ninja Trader. Yeah,
I do. I do. I do. I do.

2708
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599

 

2709
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:51,396

Sure. I can see all of this properly.

2710
00:59:51,396 --> 00:59:51,406

 

2711
00:59:51,406 --> 00:59:58,601

>> [snorts]

2712
00:59:58,601 --> 00:59:58,611

 

2713
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:00,069

[snorts]
 

2715

2716
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:03,200

 

2717
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,230

is the live recorded? Well, uh, go it go

2718
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:06,240
is the live recorded? Well, uh, go it go
 

2719
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,309
is the live recorded? Well, uh, go it go
it sits on YouTube forever. So, yeah,

2720
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:08,319
it sits on YouTube forever. So, yeah,
 

2721
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,510
it sits on YouTube forever. So, yeah,
you can come back and watch this

2722
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:09,520
you can come back and watch this
 

2723
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,910
you can come back and watch this
anytime. Okay, back down to value area

2724
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
anytime. Okay, back down to value area
 

2725
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,990
anytime. Okay, back down to value area
low on the day. So, back into this big

2726
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,000
low on the day. So, back into this big
 

2727
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,670
low on the day. So, back into this big
node. So, bulls have not defended that

2728
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:15,680
node. So, bulls have not defended that
 

2729
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,750
node. So, bulls have not defended that
low volume node. That's not a good sign.

2730
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:17,760
low volume node. That's not a good sign.
 

2731
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,470
low volume node. That's not a good sign.
It's a very bad sign. They had the

2732
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:20,480
It's a very bad sign. They had the
 

2733
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,470
It's a very bad sign. They had the
opportunity to v to defend it. They

2734
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:22,480
opportunity to v to defend it. They
 

2735
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,309
opportunity to v to defend it. They
haven't. You're going to see rotation

2736
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:24,319
haven't. You're going to see rotation
 

2737
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,150
haven't. You're going to see rotation
and this looks a little bit weaker now.

2738
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,160
and this looks a little bit weaker now.
 

2739
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,309
and this looks a little bit weaker now.
So, back into value area low on the day.

2740
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:28,319
So, back into value area low on the day.
 

2741
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,990
So, back into value area low on the day.
This is the last chance saloon I'd say

2742
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,000
This is the last chance saloon I'd say
 

2743
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,470
This is the last chance saloon I'd say
for bulls to start absorbing price down

2744
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:32,480
for bulls to start absorbing price down
 

2745
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,069
for bulls to start absorbing price down
here and try and make a higher low down

2746
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079
here and try and make a higher low down
 

2747
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,990
here and try and make a higher low down
here. But the way we are acting today

2748
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
here. But the way we are acting today
 

2749
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,750
here. But the way we are acting today
just looks like a rotation. I would not

2750
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:37,760
just looks like a rotation. I would not
 

2751
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,230
just looks like a rotation. I would not
be surprised to see this just develop in

2752
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:40,240
be surprised to see this just develop in
 

2753
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,630
be surprised to see this just develop in
a big old fat D-shaped profile for a

2754
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:42,640
a big old fat D-shaped profile for a
 

2755
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,630
a big old fat D-shaped profile for a
while until it makes some decisions. So

2756
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
while until it makes some decisions. So
 

2757
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,230
while until it makes some decisions. So
maybe like a look below and fail and

2758
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,240
maybe like a look below and fail and
 

2759
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,910
maybe like a look below and fail and
maybe a look above and fail, which we've

2760
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:47,920
maybe a look above and fail, which we've
 

2761
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,910
maybe a look above and fail, which we've
done twice. It really would not surprise

2762
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:49,920
done twice. It really would not surprise
 

2763
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,109
done twice. It really would not surprise
me uh because the move off CPI has been

2764
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:53,119
me uh because the move off CPI has been
 

2765
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,630
me uh because the move off CPI has been
so big. The move down yesterday was

2766
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:54,640
so big. The move down yesterday was
 

2767
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,950
so big. The move down yesterday was
massive. We repriced it on CPI. We're

2768
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:56,960
massive. We repriced it on CPI. We're
 

2769
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,710
massive. We repriced it on CPI. We're
probably going to go sideways for a bit,

2770
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
probably going to go sideways for a bit,
 

2771
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,230
probably going to go sideways for a bit,
especially with OPEX. It wouldn't

2772
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
especially with OPEX. It wouldn't
 

2773
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,950
especially with OPEX. It wouldn't
surprise me.

2774
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:04,960

 

2775
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,950

Uh yes, Indie absolutely could be a

2776
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
Uh yes, Indie absolutely could be a
 

2777
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,870
Uh yes, Indie absolutely could be a
rotational day. Yeah, absolutely. And

2778
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:08,880
rotational day. Yeah, absolutely. And
 

2779
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,270
rotational day. Yeah, absolutely. And
like the easiest way to see that, the

2780
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:11,280
like the easiest way to see that, the
 

2781
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,430
like the easiest way to see that, the
easiest way I would say the the first

2782
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,440
easiest way I would say the the first
 

2783
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,309
easiest way I would say the the first
clue, where's my OBS gone? The first

2784
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
clue, where's my OBS gone? The first
 

2785
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,150
clue, where's my OBS gone? The first
clue, right, when you're thinking what

2786
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:18,160
clue, right, when you're thinking what
 

2787
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,549
clue, right, when you're thinking what
kind of day are we in? What where are we

2788
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:20,559
kind of day are we in? What where are we
 

2789
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,030
kind of day are we in? What where are we
in versus yesterday, right? That's your

2790
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,040
in versus yesterday, right? That's your
 

2791
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,990
in versus yesterday, right? That's your
first clue. Yeah. So, we're an inside

2792
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,000
first clue. Yeah. So, we're an inside
 

2793
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,069
first clue. Yeah. So, we're an inside
bar. There's clue number one. Probably

2794
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:28,079
bar. There's clue number one. Probably
 

2795
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,990
bar. There's clue number one. Probably
going to need to develop chop. Clue

2796
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,000
going to need to develop chop. Clue
 

2797
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,670
going to need to develop chop. Clue
number two is normally after big moves,

2798
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:33,680
number two is normally after big moves,
 

2799
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,990
number two is normally after big moves,
we need to develop liquidity. Yeah.

2800
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:36,000
we need to develop liquidity. Yeah.
 

2801
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,069
we need to develop liquidity. Yeah.
because we can't just keep doing this

2802
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,079
because we can't just keep doing this
 

2803
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,990
because we can't just keep doing this
and this. The only time you have that is

2804
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
and this. The only time you have that is
 

2805
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,990
and this. The only time you have that is
if there's like a big news event, COVID,

2806
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,000
if there's like a big news event, COVID,
 

2807
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,309
if there's like a big news event, COVID,
for example, um you know, if they

2808
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:44,319
for example, um you know, if they
 

2809
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,549
for example, um you know, if they
announce here, oh, we're in global

2810
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:46,559
announce here, oh, we're in global
 

2811
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,870
announce here, oh, we're in global
recession. AI's [\h__\h] the world. Yeah,

2812
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:48,880
recession. AI's [\h__\h] the world. Yeah,
 

2813
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,750
recession. AI's [\h__\h] the world. Yeah,
sure. We're going to go panic mode. But

2814
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:51,760
sure. We're going to go panic mode. But
 

2815
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,549
sure. We're going to go panic mode. But
if when it's normal normal price action,

2816
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:54,559
if when it's normal normal price action,
 

2817
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,230
if when it's normal normal price action,
you will see like maybe big days

2818
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240
you will see like maybe big days
 

2819
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,470
you will see like maybe big days
followed by inside days, big days

2820
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
followed by inside days, big days
 

2821
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,150
followed by inside days, big days
followed by inside days. It's how we

2822
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
followed by inside days. It's how we
 

2823
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,390
followed by inside days. It's how we
build liquidity. Big days followed by

2824
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:04,400
build liquidity. Big days followed by
 

2825
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,829
build liquidity. Big days followed by
inside days. Yeah, big days, two in a

2826
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
inside days. Yeah, big days, two in a
 

2827
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,670
inside days. Yeah, big days, two in a
row here, followed by an inside bar.

2828
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680
row here, followed by an inside bar.
 

2829
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,349
row here, followed by an inside bar.
It's how we build liquidity. So, that's

2830
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:11,359
It's how we build liquidity. So, that's
 

2831
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:14,870
It's how we build liquidity. So, that's
your first clue. Your second clue

2832
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:14,880
your first clue. Your second clue
 

2833
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,390
your first clue. Your second clue
is the rotation.

2834
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:18,400

 

2835
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,750

Your second clue is this, right? We're

2836
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:21,760
Your second clue is this, right? We're
 

2837
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,510
Your second clue is this, right? We're
in

2838
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,520
in
 

2839
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,309
in
current week profile.

2840
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:26,319
current week profile.
 

2841
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,230
current week profile.
We're creating a Dshape here. I know

2842
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:28,240
We're creating a Dshape here. I know
 

2843
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,430
We're creating a Dshape here. I know
it's the wrong way around, but we're

2844
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
it's the wrong way around, but we're
 

2845
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,950
it's the wrong way around, but we're
creating a D-shape here, and we are

2846
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:32,960
creating a D-shape here, and we are
 

2847
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,270
creating a D-shape here, and we are
above yesterday's profile. So it's very

2848
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:35,280
above yesterday's profile. So it's very
 

2849
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,910
above yesterday's profile. So it's very
possible we move we can move value up

2850
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
possible we move we can move value up
 

2851
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,670
possible we move we can move value up
right it's if value was here yesterday

2852
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:39,680
right it's if value was here yesterday
 

2853
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,270
right it's if value was here yesterday
it's possible we move it up we might

2854
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:41,280
it's possible we move it up we might
 

2855
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,870
it's possible we move it up we might
move value here but what did we do last

2856
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:42,880
move value here but what did we do last
 

2857
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,630
move value here but what did we do last
time we were here stuck stuck stuck

2858
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:46,640
time we were here stuck stuck stuck
 

2859
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,789
time we were here stuck stuck stuck
right so we know in here is likely to be

2860
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:48,799
right so we know in here is likely to be
 

2861
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,789
right so we know in here is likely to be
messy if we come beneath here we might

2862
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:50,799
messy if we come beneath here we might
 

2863
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,390
messy if we come beneath here we might
come and visit these lows but I don't

2864
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:52,400
come and visit these lows but I don't
 

2865
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,470
come and visit these lows but I don't
really want to trade that down there

2866
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:54,480
really want to trade that down there
 

2867
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,030
really want to trade that down there
ideally we talked about earlier I don't

2868
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:57,040
ideally we talked about earlier I don't
 

2869
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,430
ideally we talked about earlier I don't
really

2870
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,440
really
 

2871
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,230
really
for for bulls they need to defend these

2872
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:02,240
for for bulls they need to defend these
 

2873
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,710
for for bulls they need to defend these
100s I'm not really interested in

2874
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,720
100s I'm not really interested in
 

2875
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,230
100s I'm not really interested in
trading.

2876
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,240
trading.
 

2877
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,109
trading.
Not really interested in trading in

2878
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
Not really interested in trading in
 

2879
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,990
Not really interested in trading in
here, right? And technically

2880
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:12,000
here, right? And technically
 

2881
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,829
here, right? And technically
I'd need to see bulls do that. If we

2882
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:13,839
I'd need to see bulls do that. If we
 

2883
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,789
I'd need to see bulls do that. If we
don't do that, um, it's very possible we

2884
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:16,799
don't do that, um, it's very possible we
 

2885
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,789
don't do that, um, it's very possible we
go from here to PC. I don't want to

2886
01:03:18,789 --> 01:03:18,799
go from here to PC. I don't want to
 

2887
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,309
go from here to PC. I don't want to
trade it because of how we've built

2888
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:20,319
trade it because of how we've built
 

2889
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,750
trade it because of how we've built
this. This is a [sighs]

2890
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:23,760
this. This is a [sighs]
 

2891
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,670
this. This is a [sighs]
trying to think how I can frame this.

2892
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:25,680
trying to think how I can frame this.
 

2893
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,549
trying to think how I can frame this.
This is a possible move. This is a

2894
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:28,559
This is a possible move. This is a
 

2895
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,870
This is a possible move. This is a
possible move.

2896
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:30,880
possible move.
 

2897
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,630
possible move.
This is a possible move. I don't want to

2898
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
This is a possible move. I don't want to
 

2899
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,710
This is a possible move. I don't want to
trade this one.

2900
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
trade this one.
 

2901
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,230
trade this one.
That's the one I don't want to trade

2902
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,240
That's the one I don't want to trade
 

2903
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,710
That's the one I don't want to trade
today. I'd rather miss that trade. Stick

2904
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:38,720
today. I'd rather miss that trade. Stick
 

2905
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,270
today. I'd rather miss that trade. Stick
to my rules. Yeah. Doesn't mean it's not

2906
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,280
to my rules. Yeah. Doesn't mean it's not
 

2907
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,069
to my rules. Yeah. Doesn't mean it's not
valid for you guys. If you like trading

2908
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079
valid for you guys. If you like trading
 

2909
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,470
valid for you guys. If you like trading
from one side to the other, it might be

2910
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,480
from one side to the other, it might be
 

2911
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,309
from one side to the other, it might be
really nice move for you, right? Don't

2912
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
really nice move for you, right? Don't
 

2913
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,510
really nice move for you, right? Don't
let h I'm here to teach you, but I also

2914
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,520
let h I'm here to teach you, but I also
 

2915
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,910
let h I'm here to teach you, but I also
have to trade how I know I make money. I

2916
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:53,920
have to trade how I know I make money. I
 

2917
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,390
have to trade how I know I make money. I
make money sticking to my rules. I hate

2918
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
make money sticking to my rules. I hate
 

2919
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,470
make money sticking to my rules. I hate
playing back inside ranges unless we've

2920
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:58,480
playing back inside ranges unless we've
 

2921
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,390
playing back inside ranges unless we've
had a huge failed breakout, which could

2922
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
had a huge failed breakout, which could
 

2923
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,549
had a huge failed breakout, which could
argue we've done, but hopefully that

2924
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:02,559
argue we've done, but hopefully that
 

2925
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,270
argue we've done, but hopefully that
helps.

2926
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:07,280

 

2927
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,990

Uh Eddie, yeah, I I only really are

2928
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,000
Uh Eddie, yeah, I I only really are
 

2929
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,510
Uh Eddie, yeah, I I only really are
interested in it from the New York

2930
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:11,520
interested in it from the New York
 

2931
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,870
interested in it from the New York
session because it's where most the

2932
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:12,880
session because it's where most the
 

2933
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,670
session because it's where most the
volume was done. It's where most the

2934
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:15,680
volume was done. It's where most the
 

2935
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,710
volume was done. It's where most the
volume was done.

2936
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
volume was done.
 

2937
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,510
volume was done.
Okay, so back into this little ledge,

2938
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
Okay, so back into this little ledge,
 

2939
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,510
Okay, so back into this little ledge,
this gray box.

2940
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:23,520
this gray box.
 

2941
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,589
this gray box.
We might build rotation in this gray box

2942
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:25,599
We might build rotation in this gray box
 

2943
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,910
We might build rotation in this gray box
again for a little minute.

2944
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:27,920
again for a little minute.
 

2945
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,710
again for a little minute.
Right, we might build in here. Right,

2946
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
Right, we might build in here. Right,
 

2947
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,309
Right, we might build in here. Right,
there's your value on the day. There's

2948
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
there's your value on the day. There's
 

2949
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,990
there's your value on the day. There's
previous day value very low. Can they

2950
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,000
previous day value very low. Can they
 

2951
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,910
previous day value very low. Can they
find acceptance and go back in? And this

2952
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:35,920
find acceptance and go back in? And this
 

2953
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,910
find acceptance and go back in? And this
is will this act as resistance for

2954
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:37,920
is will this act as resistance for
 

2955
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,630
is will this act as resistance for
bears? All right. Or the bulls just

2956
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
bears? All right. Or the bulls just
 

2957
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,150
bears? All right. Or the bulls just
reclaim it and we go right back upside

2958
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,160
reclaim it and we go right back upside
 

2959
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,630
reclaim it and we go right back upside
in a rotation. So, it's going to get

2960
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,640
in a rotation. So, it's going to get
 

2961
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,309
in a rotation. So, it's going to get
messier and messier until they start

2962
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:46,319
messier and messier until they start
 

2963
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:51,029
messier and messier until they start
making some big decisions.

2964
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039

 

2965
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,029

But value for the day just held for me

2966
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:53,039
But value for the day just held for me
 

2967
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,230
But value for the day just held for me
on Ninja Trader. Value was down here at

2968
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,240
on Ninja Trader. Value was down here at
 

2969
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,750
on Ninja Trader. Value was down here at
180. So, that's your current value area

2970
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:57,760
180. So, that's your current value area
 

2971
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,910
180. So, that's your current value area
low on the day. So, at the moment, they

2972
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
low on the day. So, at the moment, they
 

2973
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,829
low on the day. So, at the moment, they
are unable to get back beneath that.

2974
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:01,839
are unable to get back beneath that.
 

2975
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,230
are unable to get back beneath that.
Bears remain trapped under 82s right

2976
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
Bears remain trapped under 82s right
 

2977
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,230
Bears remain trapped under 82s right
now. All right, that's where the bears

2978
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
now. All right, that's where the bears
 

2979
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,470
now. All right, that's where the bears
have been trapped. So, they need to let

2980
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:08,480
have been trapped. So, they need to let
 

2981
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,670
have been trapped. So, they need to let
them out if they're going to look for

2982
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:09,680
them out if they're going to look for
 

2983
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,150
them out if they're going to look for
expansion lower because we've been down

2984
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
expansion lower because we've been down
 

2985
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:18,950
expansion lower because we've been down
there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 times

2986
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 times
 

2987
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,950
there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 times
since the open and we're not seeing

2988
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:20,960
since the open and we're not seeing
 

2989
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,710
since the open and we're not seeing
expansion. If they can see expansion,

2990
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,720
expansion. If they can see expansion,
 

2991
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,069
expansion. If they can see expansion,
all those bears will be comfortable.

2992
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:24,079
all those bears will be comfortable.
 

2993
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,829
all those bears will be comfortable.
Right now, they are trapped underneath

2994
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:25,839
Right now, they are trapped underneath
 

2995
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:31,430
Right now, they are trapped underneath
82.

2996
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:31,440

 

2997
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,109

Oh, what did I say? I probably said it

2998
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:33,119
Oh, what did I say? I probably said it
 

2999
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,789
Oh, what did I say? I probably said it
wrong then, Scott. Yeah, whatever I

3000
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:34,799
wrong then, Scott. Yeah, whatever I
 

3001
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,789
wrong then, Scott. Yeah, whatever I
said. If

3002
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
said. If
 

3003
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,950
said. If
Excuse me, it's 7:15 in the morning. If

3004
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
Excuse me, it's 7:15 in the morning. If
 

3005
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,789
Excuse me, it's 7:15 in the morning. If
I got my tongue tied and I said value

3006
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:40,799
I got my tongue tied and I said value
 

3007
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,029
I got my tongue tied and I said value
area low and meant value high, then

3008
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:43,039
area low and meant value high, then
 

3009
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:54,870
area low and meant value high, then
switch switch them around. [laughter]

3010
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:54,880

 

3011
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,309

Yeah. I mean higher time frame we are

3012
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:58,319
Yeah. I mean higher time frame we are
 

3013
01:05:58,319 --> 01:05:59,910
Yeah. I mean higher time frame we are
still technically in a cell right like

3014
01:05:59,910 --> 01:05:59,920
still technically in a cell right like
 

3015
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,430
still technically in a cell right like
on the hourlys and stuff if you think

3016
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,440
on the hourlys and stuff if you think
 

3017
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,950
on the hourlys and stuff if you think
your pivot to pivot on the higher time

3018
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:02,960
your pivot to pivot on the higher time
 

3019
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,630
your pivot to pivot on the higher time
frame is you pivot high is 500 your

3020
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
frame is you pivot high is 500 your
 

3021
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,549
frame is you pivot high is 500 your
pivot low is 880 the question is in here

3022
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:10,559
pivot low is 880 the question is in here
 

3023
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,549
pivot low is 880 the question is in here
in those levels we are likely to build

3024
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:12,559
in those levels we are likely to build
 

3025
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,029
in those levels we are likely to build
out liquidity right that's that's the

3026
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:15,039
out liquidity right that's that's the
 

3027
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,150
out liquidity right that's that's the
day I'm anticipating if we think about

3028
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,160
day I'm anticipating if we think about
 

3029
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,710
day I'm anticipating if we think about
the main trend right there was your

3030
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:20,720
the main trend right there was your
 

3031
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,870
the main trend right there was your
previous pivot previous pivot built out

3032
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,880
previous pivot previous pivot built out
 

3033
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,750
previous pivot previous pivot built out
liquidity pivot pivot. What are we

3034
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:25,760
liquidity pivot pivot. What are we
 

3035
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,950
liquidity pivot pivot. What are we
probably going to do? Build out some

3036
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:26,960
probably going to do? Build out some
 

3037
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,630
probably going to do? Build out some
liquidity. And then they got to decide,

3038
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:28,640
liquidity. And then they got to decide,
 

3039
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,470
liquidity. And then they got to decide,
do they want to drag it down or are they

3040
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,480
do they want to drag it down or are they
 

3041
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,630
do they want to drag it down or are they
going to come and test this high? Right?

3042
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:32,640
going to come and test this high? Right?
 

3043
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,470
going to come and test this high? Right?
So, this is my anticipation today is a

3044
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:34,480
So, this is my anticipation today is a
 

3045
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,990
So, this is my anticipation today is a
buildout of liquidity. Hopefully, that

3046
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,000
buildout of liquidity. Hopefully, that
 

3047
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,910
buildout of liquidity. Hopefully, that
makes sense. A bit like this, right? How

3048
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
makes sense. A bit like this, right? How
 

3049
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,150
makes sense. A bit like this, right? How
we did this here. Very possible we do

3050
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:40,160
we did this here. Very possible we do
 

3051
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,950
we did this here. Very possible we do
this here because we can't just go down

3052
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:42,960
this here because we can't just go down
 

3053
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,870
this here because we can't just go down
down down like we talked about. This is

3054
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:44,880
down down like we talked about. This is
 

3055
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,190
down down like we talked about. This is
your pullback leg. We're we're coming

3056
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:47,200
your pullback leg. We're we're coming
 

3057
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,430
your pullback leg. We're we're coming
into key level 61. So, this is 61% of a

3058
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:51,440
into key level 61. So, this is 61% of a
 

3059
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,549
into key level 61. So, this is 61% of a
a weekly or a monthly pullback low. This

3060
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:54,559
a weekly or a monthly pullback low. This
 

3061
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,190
a weekly or a monthly pullback low. This
is a 61 retracement into here. So, we're

3062
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:57,200
is a 61 retracement into here. So, we're
 

3063
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,390
is a 61 retracement into here. So, we're
probably going to pull back off that and

3064
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
probably going to pull back off that and
 

3065
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,750
probably going to pull back off that and
then we're going to build out. I know

3066
01:06:59,750 --> 01:06:59,760
then we're going to build out. I know
 

3067
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,990
then we're going to build out. I know
that looks messy, but

3068
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:02,000
that looks messy, but
 

3069
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,829
that looks messy, but
hopefully what you guys will understand.

3070
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:03,839
hopefully what you guys will understand.
 

3071
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,589
hopefully what you guys will understand.
If you're new to trading, you might it

3072

If you're new to trading, you might it
 

3073
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,510
If you're new to trading, you might it

gobbleygook or something. I don't know

3076
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
gobbleygook or something. I don't know
 

3077
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,430
gobbleygook or something. I don't know
what you want to call it, but just stick

3078
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,440
what you want to call it, but just stick
 

3079
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,950
what you want to call it, but just stick
just stick with it. It will start to

3080
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
just stick with it. It will start to
 

3081
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,069
just stick with it. It will start to
make sense, right? They're trying to let

3082
01:07:14,069 --> 01:07:14,079
make sense, right? They're trying to let
 

3083
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,190
make sense, right? They're trying to let
these bears out and come for this value

3084
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:17,200
these bears out and come for this value
 

3085

So, this one is incorrect. I thought I'd

So, this one is incorrect. I thought I'd
 

3093

So, this one is incorrect. I thought I'd

are stuck from here under 82s. If we let

are stuck from here under 82s. If we let
them out, may maybe they get that little

01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,480
them out, may maybe they get that little
 

3119
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,510

Still not at that uh 675 gamma

3224
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:39,440
Still not at that uh 675 gamma
 

3225
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,270
Still not at that uh 675 gamma
or spiders. They're still absorbing it

3226
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:41,280
or spiders. They're still absorbing it
 

3227
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,669
or spiders. They're still absorbing it
down here, folks. They are non-stop

3228
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:43,679
down here, folks. They are non-stop
 

3229
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:46,709
down here, folks. They are non-stop
absorbing it down here. Can't stay here

3230
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:46,719
absorbing it down here. Can't stay here
 

3231
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:48,390
absorbing it down here. Can't stay here
forever. Someone's going to get hurt at

3232
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400
forever. Someone's going to get hurt at
 

3233
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:56,950
forever. Someone's going to get hurt at
some point.

3234
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:56,960

 

3235
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,430

Those bears just got stuck. [laughter]

3236
01:10:59,430 --> 01:10:59,440
Those bears just got stuck. [laughter]
 

3237
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,350
Those bears just got stuck. [laughter]
They just got stuck. That guy absorbing

3238
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
They just got stuck. That guy absorbing
 

3239
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,430
They just got stuck. That guy absorbing
the tape was like, "No [\h__\h] way."

3240
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
the tape was like, "No [\h__\h] way."
 

3241
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,830
the tape was like, "No [\h__\h] way."
Back into low volume node. This is where

3242
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:05,840
Back into low volume node. This is where
 

3243
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,990
Back into low volume node. This is where
it's going to get a little bit messy.

3244
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:10,000

 

3245
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,790

So do they resell low volume node and do

3246
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:12,800
So do they resell low volume node and do
 

3247
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,870
So do they resell low volume node and do
bulls now try and defend 202s

3248
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:18,880

 

3249
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,030

is the question

3250
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:23,040

 

3251
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,669

the question

3252
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
the question
 

3253
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,590
the question
so low volume node here this is this is

3254
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:27,600
so low volume node here this is this is
 

3255
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,310
so low volume node here this is this is
the problem now for bears uh the bulls

3256
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:30,320
the problem now for bears uh the bulls
 

3257
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,910
the problem now for bears uh the bulls
is this low volume node they're going to

3258
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:31,920
is this low volume node they're going to
 

3259
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,350
is this low volume node they're going to
have to get through it

3260
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:35,360
have to get through it
 

3261
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,510
have to get through it
and so far they're getting rejected in

3262
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
and so far they're getting rejected in
 

3263
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,149
and so far they're getting rejected in
this sort of node so this We can just

3264
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
this sort of node so this We can just
 

3265
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,950
this sort of node so this We can just
delete this and VWAP. So that's the also

3266
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:42,960
delete this and VWAP. So that's the also
 

3267
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,669
delete this and VWAP. So that's the also
a key level. Yes, also into VWAP. So

3268
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:45,679
a key level. Yes, also into VWAP. So
 

3269
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,189
a key level. Yes, also into VWAP. So
we're going to see more build out of

3270
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199
we're going to see more build out of
 

3271
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,709
we're going to see more build out of
liquidity here. But bears definitely got

3272
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:48,719
liquidity here. But bears definitely got
 

3273
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,550
liquidity here. But bears definitely got
stuck. Like I said, under 82s, they kept

3274
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:50,560
stuck. Like I said, under 82s, they kept
 

3275
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,550
stuck. Like I said, under 82s, they kept
getting themselves caught for whatever

3276
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
getting themselves caught for whatever
 

3277
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,189
getting themselves caught for whatever
reason. There is someone absorbing down

3278
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:55,199
reason. There is someone absorbing down
 

3279
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,110
reason. There is someone absorbing down
there.

3280
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:57,120
there.
 

3281
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,470
there.
Here goes low volume node

3282
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:00,480
Here goes low volume node
 

3283
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,470
Here goes low volume node
and we might accelerate if we repric

3284
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
and we might accelerate if we repric
 

3285
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,470
and we might accelerate if we repric
this. So the next level for rotation be

3286
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:04,480
this. So the next level for rotation be
 

3287
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,149
this. So the next level for rotation be
66es. So balls have a chance here uh to

3288
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:08,159
66es. So balls have a chance here uh to
 

3289
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,510
66es. So balls have a chance here uh to
do this dance or just go straight up on

3290
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
do this dance or just go straight up on
 

3291
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,590
do this dance or just go straight up on
a squeeze because they're all stuck. So

3292
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:13,600
a squeeze because they're all stuck. So
 

3293
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,669
a squeeze because they're all stuck. So
we did identify correctly these bears

3294
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
we did identify correctly these bears
 

3295
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,910
we did identify correctly these bears
being stuck and they have got themselves

3296
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
being stuck and they have got themselves
 

3297
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,669
being stuck and they have got themselves
in pain. So just like here, their pain

3298
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
in pain. So just like here, their pain
 

3299
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,830
in pain. So just like here, their pain
point here was up. Their pain point this

3300
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:21,840
point here was up. Their pain point this
 

3301
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,550
point here was up. Their pain point this
time was here and was actually around

3302
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:24,560
time was here and was actually around
 

3303
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,070
time was here and was actually around
95.

3304
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
95.
 

3305
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,669
95.
All right. So they got really stuck down

3306
01:12:27,669 --> 01:12:27,679
All right. So they got really stuck down
 

3307
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:28,950
All right. So they got really stuck down
here and now they're getting squeezed

3308
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:28,960
here and now they're getting squeezed
 

3309
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,149
here and now they're getting squeezed
out and that's why you're getting a big

3310
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:30,159
out and that's why you're getting a big
 

3311
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,510
out and that's why you're getting a big
acceleration. We're going to come and

3312
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:31,520
acceleration. We're going to come and
 

3313
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,790
acceleration. We're going to come and
check 66s and then 78s and then back to

3314
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:34,800
check 66s and then 78s and then back to
 

3315
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,709
check 66s and then 78s and then back to
the upside again. So, you can see the

3316
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
the upside again. So, you can see the
 

3317
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,470
the upside again. So, you can see the
game of trap players. All right, so you

3318
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:38,480
game of trap players. All right, so you
 

3319
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,870
game of trap players. All right, so you
can see why I wanted to be bullish today

3320
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880
can see why I wanted to be bullish today
 

3321
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,110
can see why I wanted to be bullish today
and these bears. Who was it in chat

3322
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:43,120
and these bears. Who was it in chat
 

3323
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,229
and these bears. Who was it in chat
yesterday? Um, someone asking me about

3324
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
yesterday? Um, someone asking me about
 

3325
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,750
yesterday? Um, someone asking me about
dips. Sorry, I forget who it was in

3326
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:47,760
dips. Sorry, I forget who it was in
 

3327
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,110
dips. Sorry, I forget who it was in
Discord yesterday saying they were

3328
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,120
Discord yesterday saying they were
 

3329
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,630
Discord yesterday saying they were
struggling with pullbacks and I said,

3330
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:50,640
struggling with pullbacks and I said,
 

3331
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,870
struggling with pullbacks and I said,
"Use your same analysis, but look for

3332
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:52,880
"Use your same analysis, but look for
 

3333
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,310
"Use your same analysis, but look for
the pullback level and trap players."

3334
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:54,320
the pullback level and trap players."
 

3335
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,870
the pullback level and trap players."
Well, this was the pullback level and

3336
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:56,880
Well, this was the pullback level and
 

3337
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,390
Well, this was the pullback level and
these were the trap players. I can't

3338
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:58,400
these were the trap players. I can't
 

3339
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,790
these were the trap players. I can't
remember who said it in Discord, but

3340
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:00,800
remember who said it in Discord, but
 

3341
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,950
remember who said it in Discord, but
hopefully that makes sense. But we are

3342
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:02,960
hopefully that makes sense. But we are
 

3343
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,950
hopefully that makes sense. But we are
in a rotation. All right, so you would

3344
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:04,960
in a rotation. All right, so you would
 

3345
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,189
in a rotation. All right, so you would
be TP here, here, here, and then

3346
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:07,199
be TP here, here, here, and then
 

3347
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:25,910
be TP here, here, here, and then
runners.

3348
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920

 

3349
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,189

Mo, there was you. There you go.

3350
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
Mo, there was you. There you go.
 

3351
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,709
Mo, there was you. There you go.
Hopefully that makes today's a good

3352
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:28,719
Hopefully that makes today's a good
 

3353
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,310
Hopefully that makes today's a good
example, right? Today's actually a

3354
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,320
example, right? Today's actually a
 

3355
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,750
example, right? Today's actually a
really good example. Hopefully that

3356
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:31,760
really good example. Hopefully that
 

3357
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,910
really good example. Hopefully that
helps.

3358
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:35,920

 

3359
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,709

Do I ex do I look at daily high and

3360
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:38,719
Do I ex do I look at daily high and
 

3361
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,910
Do I ex do I look at daily high and
lows? Yep. Absolutely.

3362
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
lows? Yep. Absolutely.
 

3363
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,430
lows? Yep. Absolutely.
Absolutely.

3364
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:45,440

 

3365
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,070

Okay. Here's your New York open. So, if

3366
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:48,080
Okay. Here's your New York open. So, if
 

3367
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,830
Okay. Here's your New York open. So, if
you are long, if you got long in that,

3368
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:49,840
you are long, if you got long in that,
 

3369
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,430
you are long, if you got long in that,
here's your New York open. Now, dips.

3370
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,440
here's your New York open. Now, dips.
 

3371
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,870
here's your New York open. Now, dips.
You really want them to hold. You don't

3372
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:52,880
You really want them to hold. You don't
 

3373
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,950
You really want them to hold. You don't
really want them to let go of 66s. Now

3374
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
really want them to let go of 66s. Now
 

3375
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,669
really want them to let go of 66s. Now
we're going to start to see

3376
01:13:55,669 --> 01:13:55,679
we're going to start to see
 

3377
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,910
we're going to start to see
acceleration. Like all those bears at

3378
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:57,920
acceleration. Like all those bears at
 

3379
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,270
acceleration. Like all those bears at
low of day are absolutely caught. So you

3380
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
low of day are absolutely caught. So you
 

3381
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,790
low of day are absolutely caught. So you
want to see acceleration now. So you

3382
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:02,800
want to see acceleration now. So you
 

3383
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,790
want to see acceleration now. So you
want all dips to hold. You do not really

3384
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
want all dips to hold. You do not really
 

3385
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,590
want all dips to hold. You do not really
want to let go of like 65 66es. Now if

3386
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,600
want to let go of like 65 66es. Now if
 

3387
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,910
want to let go of like 65 66es. Now if
you're bullish, if they hold that, it is

3388
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:09,920
you're bullish, if they hold that, it is
 

3389
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,990
you're bullish, if they hold that, it is
going to be a short covering uh

3390
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
going to be a short covering uh
 

3391
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,430
going to be a short covering uh
expedition and you're going to see a

3392
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,440
expedition and you're going to see a
 

3393
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,750
expedition and you're going to see a
squeeze out here to get long. So

3394
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:15,760
squeeze out here to get long. So
 

3395
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,070
squeeze out here to get long. So
continuation highs and if you get

3396
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,080
continuation highs and if you get
 

3397
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,229
continuation highs and if you get
through 300 there's probably a 300 break

3398
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
through 300 there's probably a 300 break
 

3399
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,550
through 300 there's probably a 300 break
and we can look for this move what's

3400
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:22,560
and we can look for this move what's
 

3401
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,470
and we can look for this move what's
high of day up into like this kind of

3402
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
high of day up into like this kind of
 

3403
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,709
high of day up into like this kind of
region. So you want this level here

3404
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
region. So you want this level here
 

3405
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:29,189
region. So you want this level here
really to hold to do that otherwise

3406
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:29,199
really to hold to do that otherwise
 

3407
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,950
really to hold to do that otherwise
we're going to be in a range rotation.

3408
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
we're going to be in a range rotation.
 

3409
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,390
we're going to be in a range rotation.
You do not want to lose this. If you

3410
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400
You do not want to lose this. If you
 

3411
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,750
You do not want to lose this. If you
lose this you're going right back down

3412
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:33,760
lose this you're going right back down
 

3413
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,510
lose this you're going right back down
into this because we printed straight

3414
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
into this because we printed straight
 

3415
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,510
into this because we printed straight
up. If they lose this they will print

3416
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:37,520
up. If they lose this they will print
 

3417
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,030
up. If they lose this they will print
straight down. So they must hold this

3418
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
straight down. So they must hold this
 

3419
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:45,110
straight down. So they must hold this
for continuation. Now,

3420
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120

 

3421
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,550

if you're long, you just want this to

3422
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
if you're long, you just want this to
 

3423
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,910
if you're long, you just want this to
hold in front of 66s. Here we go. So,

3424
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
hold in front of 66s. Here we go. So,
 

3425
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,830
hold in front of 66s. Here we go. So,
let's see if we can get acceleration.

3426
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:51,840
let's see if we can get acceleration.
 

3427
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,750
let's see if we can get acceleration.
Big delta coming in here at 88. If we

3428
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:53,760
Big delta coming in here at 88. If we
 

3429
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,430
Big delta coming in here at 88. If we
pop through him, he will be forced to

3430
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:55,440
pop through him, he will be forced to
 

3431
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,990
pop through him, he will be forced to
cover. Here we go. And we should get up

3432
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:58,000
cover. Here we go. And we should get up
 

3433
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,070
cover. Here we go. And we should get up
to 300 here. And are they offering above

3434
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:00,080
to 300 here. And are they offering above
 

3435
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,550
to 300 here. And are they offering above
300? Hopefully, they are. Seller just

3436
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
300? Hopefully, they are. Seller just
 

3437
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,790
300? Hopefully, they are. Seller just
left the tape at 350. So, maybe we can

3438
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
left the tape at 350. So, maybe we can
 

3439
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:14,709
left the tape at 350. So, maybe we can
keep moving up. Nice, nice, nice.

3440
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719

 

3441
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,870

in that 300 that whole number big level.

3442
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:16,880
in that 300 that whole number big level.
 

3443
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,630
in that 300 that whole number big level.
We're still absorbing here, folks. It

3444
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:18,640
We're still absorbing here, folks. It
 

3445
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,790
We're still absorbing here, folks. It
still looks good for upside. Here we go.

3446
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:20,800
still looks good for upside. Here we go.
 

3447
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,790
still looks good for upside. Here we go.
Here we go.

3448
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:22,800
Here we go.
 

3449
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:28,470
Here we go.
Here we go. Let's go. Let's go.

3450
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:28,480
Here we go. Let's go. Let's go.
 

3451
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,430
Here we go. Let's go. Let's go.
Yeah. Beauty. All right. So, covering

3452
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:31,440
Yeah. Beauty. All right. So, covering
 

3453
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,950
Yeah. Beauty. All right. So, covering
some here or selling some here. And

3454
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:32,960
some here or selling some here. And
 

3455
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,390
some here or selling some here. And
let's see if you can get a continuation

3456
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,400
let's see if you can get a continuation
 

3457
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,270
let's see if you can get a continuation
now outside of this level here. And your

3458
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,280
now outside of this level here. And your
 

3459
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,430
now outside of this level here. And your
next spot is 330. And then we can start

3460
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,440
next spot is 330. And then we can start
 

3461
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,870
next spot is 330. And then we can start
really digging in. You never know, you

3462
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
really digging in. You never know, you
 

3463
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,590
really digging in. You never know, you
might get 500, but I would be taking 60

3464
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
might get 500, but I would be taking 60
 

3465
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,830
might get 500, but I would be taking 60
70% of your profit off here if you took

3466
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
70% of your profit off here if you took
 

3467
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,830
70% of your profit off here if you took
that last little dip in here to hold

3468
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
that last little dip in here to hold
 

3469
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,070
that last little dip in here to hold
that we talked about and just waiting to

3470
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,080
that we talked about and just waiting to
 

3471
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,830
that we talked about and just waiting to
see if you can accelerate through 30s.

3472
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
see if you can accelerate through 30s.
 

3473
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,390
see if you can accelerate through 30s.
And if you do, there is a chance. There

3474
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400
And if you do, there is a chance. There
 

3475
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,470
And if you do, there is a chance. There
is a chance to come up to 500. There is

3476
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,480
is a chance to come up to 500. There is
 

3477
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,149
is a chance to come up to 500. There is
a chance. But we are back into that sort

3478
01:15:58,149 --> 01:15:58,159
a chance. But we are back into that sort
 

3479
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,070
a chance. But we are back into that sort
of 61 fib. So you want to be locking

3480
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:00,080
of 61 fib. So you want to be locking
 

3481
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,390
of 61 fib. So you want to be locking
some in. This is the thick contested

3482
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400
some in. This is the thick contested
 

3483
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,390
some in. This is the thick contested
area.

3484
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:06,400

 

3485
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:13,252

Thank you very much.

3486
01:16:13,252 --> 01:16:13,262

 

3487
01:16:13,262 --> 01:16:16,310

[groaning]

3488
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320

 

3489
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,950

Make sure you're locking in here.

3490
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:18,960
Make sure you're locking in here.
 

3491
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,470
Make sure you're locking in here.
So, I'd say next level that they want to

3492
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
So, I'd say next level that they want to
 

3493
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,870
So, I'd say next level that they want to
hold is 80s. If they if they dip, they

3494
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:22,880
hold is 80s. If they if they dip, they
 

3495
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,910
hold is 80s. If they if they dip, they
don't want to lose 80s now, right? If

3496
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:25,920
don't want to lose 80s now, right? If
 

3497
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,830
don't want to lose 80s now, right? If
they dip at the moment, they've got no

3498
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:27,840
they dip at the moment, they've got no
 

3499
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,270
they dip at the moment, they've got no
reason to dip. If they dip, they don't

3500
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280
reason to dip. If they dip, they don't
 

3501
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,310
reason to dip. If they dip, they don't
want to lose this. Right? So

3502
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
want to lose this. Right? So
 

3503
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,590
want to lose this. Right? So
again if you go and rewind underneath 82

3504
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:35,600
again if you go and rewind underneath 82
 

3505
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,189
again if you go and rewind underneath 82
I think it was I kept saying bears are

3506
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
I think it was I kept saying bears are
 

3507
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,310
I think it was I kept saying bears are
getting trapped there is someone

3508
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:38,320
getting trapped there is someone
 

3509
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,990
getting trapped there is someone
absorbing the tape the delta was

3510
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:40,000
absorbing the tape the delta was
 

3511
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,790
absorbing the tape the delta was
actually positive so interestingly and

3512
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:42,800
actually positive so interestingly and
 

3513
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,030
actually positive so interestingly and
then once these bears got caught well

3514
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,040
then once these bears got caught well
 

3515
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,550
then once these bears got caught well
they started to cover we went straight

3516
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,560
they started to cover we went straight
 

3517
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,430
they started to cover we went straight
up the only option to join was to on a

3518
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,440
up the only option to join was to on a
 

3519
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,030
up the only option to join was to on a
hold of this all right so your only

3520
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
hold of this all right so your only
 

3521
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,709
hold of this all right so your only
option to join if you didn't take this

3522
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:52,719
option to join if you didn't take this
 

3523
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,790
option to join if you didn't take this
break was really here and now we're

3524
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:54,800
break was really here and now we're
 

3525
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,790
break was really here and now we're
starting to pop this last level here and

3526
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:56,800
starting to pop this last level here and
 

3527
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,229
starting to pop this last level here and
then we might see acceleration so

3528
01:16:58,229 --> 01:16:58,239
then we might see acceleration so
 

3529
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,910
then we might see acceleration so
through here we might see acceleration

3530
01:16:59,910 --> 01:16:59,920
through here we might see acceleration
 

3531
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,510
through here we might see acceleration
but you want to selling again. This is

3532
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,520
but you want to selling again. This is
 

3533
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,430
but you want to selling again. This is
your current weak uh point of control

3534
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,440
your current weak uh point of control
 

3535
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,870
your current weak uh point of control
and you can see why I wanted to play

3536
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:06,880
and you can see why I wanted to play
 

3537
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,630
and you can see why I wanted to play
dips today. Hopefully that makes sense

3538
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:08,640
dips today. Hopefully that makes sense
 

3539
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,630
dips today. Hopefully that makes sense
why I was more bullish on this market

3540
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:10,640
why I was more bullish on this market
 

3541
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,030
why I was more bullish on this market
today. Buyers got trapped over 330

3542
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,040
today. Buyers got trapped over 330
 

3543
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,870
today. Buyers got trapped over 330
there. So I'd be selling some into this.

3544
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:14,880
there. So I'd be selling some into this.
 

3545
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,550
there. So I'd be selling some into this.
You can reverse off this now. Now we've

3546
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
You can reverse off this now. Now we've
 

3547
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,590
You can reverse off this now. Now we've
popped those stops.

3548
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,600

 

3549
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,510

3561
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,030

Yeah. So, if you don't know folks, I

3562
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:39,040
Yeah. So, if you don't know folks, I
 

3563
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,310
Yeah. So, if you don't know folks, I
haven't publicly said it yet. I'm

Funding Ticks doing some

3568
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:45,760
Funding Ticks doing some
 

3569
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,390
Funding Ticks doing some
retrospective raw changes and all sorts

3570
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:48,400
retrospective raw changes and all sorts
 

3571
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,310
retrospective raw changes and all sorts
of nonsense. So, I wouldn't advise

3572
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,320
of nonsense. So, I wouldn't advise
 

3573
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,990
of nonsense. So, I wouldn't advise
trading with them right now. Here

3574
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,000
trading with them right now. Here
 

3575
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,070
trading with them right now. Here
we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we

3576
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,080
we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we
 

3577
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,790
we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we
go. Looking good.

3578
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800

 

3579
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,870

So, the top side of this ledge on your

3580
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:02,880
So, the top side of this ledge on your
 

3581
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,390
So, the top side of this ledge on your
current week is 344s. All right. We've

3582
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:06,400
current week is 344s. All right. We've
 

3583
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,830
current week is 344s. All right. We've
got a low volume node over that. And

3584
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:07,840
got a low volume node over that. And
 

3585
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,070
got a low volume node over that. And
then we maybe trade 377. So, your next

3586
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
then we maybe trade 377. So, your next
 

3587
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,750
then we maybe trade 377. So, your next
target would be Oh, it lines up pretty

3588
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:11,760
target would be Oh, it lines up pretty
 

3589
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,950
target would be Oh, it lines up pretty
well with that, doesn't it? Would be

3590
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
well with that, doesn't it? Would be
 

3591
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,030
well with that, doesn't it? Would be
377s,

3592
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:15,040
377s,
 

3593
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,870
377s,
which is previous week low. So, if you

3594
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:16,880
which is previous week low. So, if you
 

3595
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,470
which is previous week low. So, if you
get lucky, you get a runner up into

3596
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:18,480
get lucky, you get a runner up into
 

3597
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,870
get lucky, you get a runner up into
that. Beyond that, we're looking at

3598
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
that. Beyond that, we're looking at
 

3599
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,430
that. Beyond that, we're looking at
500s. It's that simple. I wouldn't bank

3600
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:23,440
500s. It's that simple. I wouldn't bank
 

3601
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,270
500s. It's that simple. I wouldn't bank
on it because I'm expecting a rotational

3602
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,280
on it because I'm expecting a rotational
 

3603
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,870
on it because I'm expecting a rotational
day, but you never you never you never

3604
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:28,880
day, but you never you never you never
 

3605
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,350
day, but you never you never you never
know.

3606
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:31,360
know.
 

3607
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,110
know.
Uh what contract size would I recommend

3608
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,120
Uh what contract size would I recommend
 

3609
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,189
Uh what contract size would I recommend
for a 50k account? And two to three

3610
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:35,199
for a 50k account? And two to three
 

3611
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:38,149
for a 50k account? And two to three
micros is all you need to start. Two to

3612
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:38,159
micros is all you need to start. Two to
 

3613
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:41,270
micros is all you need to start. Two to
three micros, especially in this market.

3614
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280
three micros, especially in this market.
 

3615
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,189
three micros, especially in this market.
You know, even

3616
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:43,199
You know, even
 

3617
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,030
You know, even
if you guys took the break out of the

3618
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:45,040
if you guys took the break out of the
 

3619
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,870
if you guys took the break out of the
trap, you're up 127 points. If you took

3620
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:48,880
trap, you're up 127 points. If you took
 

3621
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,030
trap, you're up 127 points. If you took
this little pullback here, you're still

3622
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
this little pullback here, you're still
 

3623
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,189
this little pullback here, you're still
up 60 points. All right, you like you

3624
01:18:53,189 --> 01:18:53,199
up 60 points. All right, you like you
 

3625
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:58,709
up 60 points. All right, you like you
don't need size.

3626
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719

 

3627
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:01,430

Oh, mate. CC, it's a joke, isn't it?

3628
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440
Oh, mate. CC, it's a joke, isn't it?
 

3629
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,590
Oh, mate. CC, it's a joke, isn't it?
It's a joke.

3630
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:03,600
It's a joke.
 

3631
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,950
It's a joke.
Honestly, I want to be careful what I

01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:04,960
Honestly, I want to be careful what I

publicly about them. But all I would say
 

3645
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,990
publicly about them. But all I would say
right now folks is unfortunately I would

3646
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
right now folks is unfortunately I would
 

3647
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,390
right now folks is unfortunately I would
not advise trading with funded ticks. I

3648
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,400
not advise trading with funded ticks. I
 

3649
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,790
not advise trading with funded ticks. I
have got a video probably going live

3650
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:22,800
have got a video probably going live
 

3651
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,030
have got a video probably going live
tomorrow or over the weekend on five

3652
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:25,040
tomorrow or over the weekend on five
 

3653
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,709
tomorrow or over the weekend on five
prop firms I would advise trading with

3654
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
prop firms I would advise trading with
 

3655
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,470
prop firms I would advise trading with
next week.

3656
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480

 

3657
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,630

How much is my stop loss? All my stop

3658
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:34,640
How much is my stop loss? All my stop
 

3659
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,630
How much is my stop loss? All my stop
loss is dependent on structure. Is

3660
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:36,640
loss is dependent on structure. Is
 

3661
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,149
loss is dependent on structure. Is
always dependent on structure. So it's

3662
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:38,159
always dependent on structure. So it's
 

3663
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,070
always dependent on structure. So it's
not like a fixed stop loss. I don't

3664
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,080
not like a fixed stop loss. I don't
 

3665
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,390
not like a fixed stop loss. I don't
really like risking more than 30 plus

3666
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:42,400
really like risking more than 30 plus
 

3667
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,870
really like risking more than 30 plus
points, but sometimes like yesterday,

3668
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:44,880
points, but sometimes like yesterday,
 

3669
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,149
points, but sometimes like yesterday,
there are a couple times where I was

3670
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:46,159
there are a couple times where I was
 

3671
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:47,910
there are a couple times where I was
able to risk only five or six points,

3672
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,920
able to risk only five or six points,
 

3673
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,830
able to risk only five or six points,
which meant I was able to size up. So, I

3674
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:49,840
which meant I was able to size up. So, I
 

3675
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,910
which meant I was able to size up. So, I
forget where it was. Was it here? One of

3676
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:53,920
forget where it was. Was it here? One of
 

3677
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,070
forget where it was. Was it here? One of
these trades yesterday, I was able to to

3678
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:56,080
these trades yesterday, I was able to to
 

3679
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,149
these trades yesterday, I was able to to
risk like very very small amount and I

3680
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
risk like very very small amount and I
 

3681
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,189
risk like very very small amount and I
was able to get like three or four minis

3682
01:20:01,189 --> 01:20:01,199
was able to get like three or four minis
 

3683
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,350
was able to get like three or four minis
on for this acceleration. And then where

3684
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
on for this acceleration. And then where
 

3685
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,189
on for this acceleration. And then where
did we trade into end of debt? Oh, it

3686
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:05,199
did we trade into end of debt? Oh, it
 

3687
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,430
did we trade into end of debt? Oh, it
wasn't here. Sorry. Maybe it was here or

3688
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:07,440
wasn't here. Sorry. Maybe it was here or
 

3689
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,870
wasn't here. Sorry. Maybe it was here or
here. I can't remember. I have to get it

3690
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
here. I can't remember. I have to get it
 

3691
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,350
here. I can't remember. I have to get it
up on Discord in a minute. But it your

3692
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
up on Discord in a minute. But it your
 

3693
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,030
up on Discord in a minute. But it your
stop loss should be based on structure,

3694
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040
stop loss should be based on structure,
 

3695
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,630
stop loss should be based on structure,
not based on points because the market

3696
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:14,640
not based on points because the market
 

3697
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,870
not based on points because the market
doesn't care about how many points. It

3698
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:16,880
doesn't care about how many points. It
 

3699
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,790
doesn't care about how many points. It
cares about the structure of the trade.

3700
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:18,800
cares about the structure of the trade.
 

3701
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,550
cares about the structure of the trade.
This is looking good now. So we built

3702
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:20,560
This is looking good now. So we built
 

3703
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,430
This is looking good now. So we built
out a new micro node here. So I'd say

3704
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:23,440
out a new micro node here. So I'd say
 

3705
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,470
out a new micro node here. So I'd say
now you want this to hold. All right.

3706
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:26,480
now you want this to hold. All right.
 

3707
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,990
now you want this to hold. All right.
You're coming to the top side of this

3708
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,000
You're coming to the top side of this
 

3709
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,750
You're coming to the top side of this
red box. So you want to be locking in a

3710
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:29,760
red box. So you want to be locking in a
 

3711
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,070
red box. So you want to be locking in a
good portion of profit here. You want

3712
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,080
good portion of profit here. You want
 

3713
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,110
good portion of profit here. You want
this to hold and this gray box to hold.

3714
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:35,120
this to hold and this gray box to hold.
 

3715
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,709
this to hold and this gray box to hold.
You want to be locking in a good chunk

3716
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:36,719
You want to be locking in a good chunk
 

3717
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,550
You want to be locking in a good chunk
here into 50. Above that, you're looking

3718
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:38,560
here into 50. Above that, you're looking
 

3719
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,950
here into 50. Above that, you're looking
at sort the 70s.

3720
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:40,960
at sort the 70s.
 

3721
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,950
at sort the 70s.
We have got guys offering up into just

3722
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:42,960
We have got guys offering up into just
 

3723
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,709
We have got guys offering up into just
in front of 400, which is really good.

3724
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:44,719
in front of 400, which is really good.
 

3725
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,550
in front of 400, which is really good.
So, you might just get a big

3726
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:46,560
So, you might just get a big
 

3727
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,070
So, you might just get a big
acceleration here. If you get some

3728
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:48,080
acceleration here. If you get some
 

3729
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,070
acceleration here. If you get some
acceleration here, you want to be

3730
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,080
acceleration here, you want to be
 

3731
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,830
acceleration here, you want to be
selling into it. If it's like a squeeze,

3732
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
selling into it. If it's like a squeeze,
 

3733
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,110
selling into it. If it's like a squeeze,
you know, if there's big volume and you

3734
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:53,120
you know, if there's big volume and you
 

3735
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,310
you know, if there's big volume and you
see stops getting popped and we

3736
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,320
see stops getting popped and we
 

3737
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,590
see stops getting popped and we
accelerate, you want to be selling some

3738
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:55,600
accelerate, you want to be selling some
 

3739
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,430
accelerate, you want to be selling some
into it because we're coming up to that

3740
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,440
into it because we're coming up to that
 

3741
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:06,070
into it because we're coming up to that
top side of that weekly rotation.

3742
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,080

 

3743
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,830

3760
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
accounts, for all accounts. And so
 

3761
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,149
accounts, for all accounts. And so
people that have gone for payouts are

3762
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
people that have gone for payouts are
 

3763
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:27,590
people that have gone for payouts are
saying, "Well, you only have five trades

3764
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:27,600
saying, "Well, you only have five trades
 

3765
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,830
saying, "Well, you only have five trades
of over $150. We just trade the change

they normally like act accordingly. Um
Khaled from funding tick. I'll give him

3808
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:19,679
Khaled from funding tick. I'll give him
 

3809
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,030
Khaled from funding tick. I'll give him
a chance but currently he's gone

3810
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:21,040
a chance but currently he's gone
 

3811
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,629
a chance but currently he's gone
missing. Let's just say that. So it

3812
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:22,639
missing. Let's just say that. So it
 

3813
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,350
missing. Let's just say that. So it
doesn't look good at the moment.

3814
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:25,360
doesn't look good at the moment.
 

3815
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,790
doesn't look good at the moment.
Doesn't look good at the moment but yeah

3816
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:26,800
Doesn't look good at the moment but yeah
 

3817
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,110
Doesn't look good at the moment but yeah
let's not talk about props too much. I

3818
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:29,120
let's not talk about props too much. I
 

3819
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,390
let's not talk about props too much. I
want I want to make sure you guys are

3820
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
want I want to make sure you guys are
 

3821
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,790
want I want to make sure you guys are
making money.

3822
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:32,800
making money.
 

3823
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,910
making money.
And ES looking really good. So SPY over

3824
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:35,920
And ES looking really good. So SPY over
 

3825
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,149
And ES looking really good. So SPY over
its 5day 20-day. The next level for SPY

3826
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
its 5day 20-day. The next level for SPY
 

3827
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,070
its 5day 20-day. The next level for SPY
to trade into is that gamma level of

3828
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
to trade into is that gamma level of
 

3829
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,070
to trade into is that gamma level of
680. All right. So we're very very

3830
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:42,080
680. All right. So we're very very
 

3831
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,709
680. All right. So we're very very
close. Don't expect it to get over that

3832
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
close. Don't expect it to get over that
 

3833
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,310
close. Don't expect it to get over that
680 682s maybe. But you know, we want to

3834
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:48,320
680 682s maybe. But you know, we want to
 

3835
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,950
680 682s maybe. But you know, we want to
be paying ourselves on an inside day,

3836
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:50,960
be paying ourselves on an inside day,
 

3837
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,030
be paying ourselves on an inside day,
don't we? This is a big squeeze up. Do

3838
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
don't we? This is a big squeeze up. Do
 

3839
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,270
don't we? This is a big squeeze up. Do
not be chasing long up here. You see how

3840
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280
not be chasing long up here. You see how
 

3841
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,030
not be chasing long up here. You see how
we didn't really build structure? It's

3842
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
we didn't really build structure? It's
 

3843
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,510
we didn't really build structure? It's
cuz they piled in short down here. So I

3844
01:22:59,510 --> 01:22:59,520
cuz they piled in short down here. So I
 

3845
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,270
cuz they piled in short down here. So I
said like they if they get rushed to

3846
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
said like they if they get rushed to
 

3847
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,430
said like they if they get rushed to
cover, well the first one covers, the

3848
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:03,440
cover, well the first one covers, the
 

3849
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,870
cover, well the first one covers, the
second one covers, the third one covers,

3850
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:04,880
second one covers, the third one covers,
 

3851
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,629
second one covers, the third one covers,
and then you get all these guys down

3852
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:06,639
and then you get all these guys down
 

3853
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,229
and then you get all these guys down
here complete panic and that's why we

3854
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:08,239
here complete panic and that's why we
 

3855
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,390
here complete panic and that's why we
get a squeeze and it's going to continue

3856
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:10,400
get a squeeze and it's going to continue
 

3857
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,590
get a squeeze and it's going to continue
because they're not going to let them

3858
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:11,600
because they're not going to let them
 

3859
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,430
because they're not going to let them
out. But what will happen is if too many

3860
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:13,440
out. But what will happen is if too many
 

3861
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,149
out. But what will happen is if too many
buyers, right, buyers buy high, they

3862
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:16,159
buyers, right, buyers buy high, they
 

3863
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,590
buyers, right, buyers buy high, they
will get caught and then the dip will

3864
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
will get caught and then the dip will
 

3865
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,270
will get caught and then the dip will
happen and then they'll wash and then we

3866
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:19,280
happen and then they'll wash and then we
 

3867
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,669
happen and then they'll wash and then we
see if it rebids. But just be careful.

3868
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,679
see if it rebids. But just be careful.
 

3869
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,510
see if it rebids. But just be careful.
Do not be buying right at the high of

3870
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:23,520
Do not be buying right at the high of
 

3871
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,350
Do not be buying right at the high of
day right now around this point of

3872
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:25,360
day right now around this point of
 

3873
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,350
day right now around this point of
control. What we can look for is if we

3874
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
control. What we can look for is if we
 

3875
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,750
control. What we can look for is if we
see an acceleration here and then we

3876
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
see an acceleration here and then we
 

3877
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,430
see an acceleration here and then we
come back and hold this because this is

3878
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
come back and hold this because this is
 

3879
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,590
come back and hold this because this is
our weekly level then we can look for

3880
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
our weekly level then we can look for
 

3881
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,669
our weekly level then we can look for
that rotation to 500. It's possible we

3882
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:35,679
that rotation to 500. It's possible we
 

3883
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:42,709
that rotation to 500. It's possible we
can look for that today.

3884
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:42,719

 

3885
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:46,070

The truth not hate speech 7 the flow

3886
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:46,080
The truth not hate speech 7 the flow
 

3887
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,990
The truth not hate speech 7 the flow
that the analysis was impeccable by the

3888
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,000
that the analysis was impeccable by the
 

3889
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,350
that the analysis was impeccable by the
way. Hey awesome thanks man.

3890
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
way. Hey awesome thanks man.
 

3891
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,629
way. Hey awesome thanks man.
IB set. Yeah. Yeah IB right here. Yeah,

3892
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:54,639
IB set. Yeah. Yeah IB right here. Yeah,
 

3893
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,308
IB set. Yeah. Yeah IB right here. Yeah,
that purple line

3894
01:23:58,308 --> 01:23:58,318

 

3895
01:23:58,318 --> 01:24:00,229

[sighs] and we're starting to accelerate

3896
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
[sighs] and we're starting to accelerate
 

3897
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,030
[sighs] and we're starting to accelerate
here. I'd say into 400 looks looking

3898
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,040
here. I'd say into 400 looks looking
 

3899
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:07,669
here. I'd say into 400 looks looking
more and more good. So higher time frame

3900
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:07,679
more and more good. So higher time frame
 

3901
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,110
more and more good. So higher time frame
over point of control over this ledge

3902
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:11,120
over point of control over this ledge
 

3903
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,669
over point of control over this ledge
into this area.

3904
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:13,679
into this area.
 

3905
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,910
into this area.
So 98400

3906
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:15,920
So 98400
 

3907
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,350
So 98400
through there if you get lucky straight

3908
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,360
through there if you get lucky straight
 

3909
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,669
through there if you get lucky straight
upside. So you can see the why I wanted

3910
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
upside. So you can see the why I wanted
 

3911
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,910
upside. So you can see the why I wanted
dips today versus this to come up and to

3912
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:21,920
dips today versus this to come up and to
 

3913
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,390
dips today versus this to come up and to
repric this. I I expect the rotation to

3914
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:24,400
repric this. I I expect the rotation to
 

3915
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,590
repric this. I I expect the rotation to
happen between here today, right? This

3916
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:27,600
happen between here today, right? This
 

3917
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,270
happen between here today, right? This
will probably be the rotation. If they

3918
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:29,280
will probably be the rotation. If they
 

3919
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,590
will probably be the rotation. If they
want to go full bull, uh then they're

3920
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:31,600
want to go full bull, uh then they're
 

3921
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,990
want to go full bull, uh then they're
going to take out 500, but I'm not

3922
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
going to take out 500, but I'm not
 

3923
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,350
going to take out 500, but I'm not
thinking about that right now.

3924
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:35,360
thinking about that right now.
 

3925
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,790
thinking about that right now.
Structurally, we are still in a

3926
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:36,800
Structurally, we are still in a
 

3927
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,149
Structurally, we are still in a
downtrend, right? Like we talked about,

3928
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
downtrend, right? Like we talked about,
 

3929
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,629
downtrend, right? Like we talked about,
we're in a massive downtrend. There's

3930
01:24:40,629 --> 01:24:40,639
we're in a massive downtrend. There's
 

3931
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,229
we're in a massive downtrend. There's
the build out down buildout and maybe we

3932
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:44,239
the build out down buildout and maybe we
 

3933
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:46,229
the build out down buildout and maybe we
lose this. Maybe we peak above and come

3934
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:46,239
lose this. Maybe we peak above and come
 

3935
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,790
lose this. Maybe we peak above and come
back down. Maybe it's the end and we're

3936
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:48,800
back down. Maybe it's the end and we're
 

3937
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,070
back down. Maybe it's the end and we're
coming back way way higher. But we can

3938
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:52,080
coming back way way higher. But we can
 

3939
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,990
coming back way way higher. But we can
deal with that tomorrow, next week.

3940
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,000
deal with that tomorrow, next week.
 

3941
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,470
deal with that tomorrow, next week.
Right now, we're just focused on each

3942
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:56,480
Right now, we're just focused on each
 

3943
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,270
Right now, we're just focused on each
level. So, here is the 70s and through

3944
01:24:59,270 --> 01:24:59,280
level. So, here is the 70s and through
 

3945
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,990
level. So, here is the 70s and through
here is 400s.

3946
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,000
here is 400s.
 

3947
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,430
here is 400s.
So, it got stuck right there. Previous

3948
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440
So, it got stuck right there. Previous
 

3949
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,350
So, it got stuck right there. Previous
week low, that little level on your

3950
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:05,360
week low, that little level on your
 

3951
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,390
week low, that little level on your
chart. We just had a reaction there.

3952
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:08,400
chart. We just had a reaction there.
 

3953
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,830
chart. We just had a reaction there.
Still think it's got a chance to move

3954
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:09,840
Still think it's got a chance to move
 

3955
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,110
Still think it's got a chance to move
higher, but you don't want to be buying

3956
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:11,120
higher, but you don't want to be buying
 

3957
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,470
higher, but you don't want to be buying
high. You want to be managing your

3958
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:12,480
high. You want to be managing your
 

3959
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,310
high. You want to be managing your
position.

3960
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:14,320
position.
 

3961
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,310
position.
Yeah, exactly. Coupe. Nice call. Yeah,

3962
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320
Yeah, exactly. Coupe. Nice call. Yeah,
 

3963
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,189
Yeah, exactly. Coupe. Nice call. Yeah,
that green level previous week low.

3964
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
that green level previous week low.
 

3965
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,669
that green level previous week low.
Big big level. ES coming right up into

3966
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
Big big level. ES coming right up into
 

3967
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,590
Big big level. ES coming right up into
its 20-day as well. So, mean reversion

3968
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:23,600
its 20-day as well. So, mean reversion
 

3969
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,030
its 20-day as well. So, mean reversion
about to be completed on the ES.

3970
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040
about to be completed on the ES.
 

3971
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,030
about to be completed on the ES.
Where is,

3972
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:29,040
Where is,
 

3973
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,189
Where is,
give me a second. Where's our 20-day on

3974
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:31,199
give me a second. Where's our 20-day on
 

3975
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,990
give me a second. Where's our 20-day on
the Q's?

3976
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:34,000
the Q's?
 

3977
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,750
the Q's?
So, 520 is our 20-day and 560 is our

3978
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
So, 520 is our 20-day and 560 is our
 

3979
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,270
So, 520 is our 20-day and 560 is our
50-day on the Q. So, I'm watching that

3980
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:39,280
50-day on the Q. So, I'm watching that
 

3981
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,990
50-day on the Q. So, I'm watching that
as well. So, this level here is a

3982
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,000
as well. So, this level here is a
 

3983
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,390
as well. So, this level here is a
massive level. It's absolutely huge on

3984
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:44,400
massive level. It's absolutely huge on
 

3985
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,709
massive level. It's absolutely huge on
every time frame.

3986
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:46,719
every time frame.
 

3987
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,550
every time frame.
Look at this big seller just stepped on

3988
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
Look at this big seller just stepped on

unload 687 lots up here.

3992
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:55,840

 

3993
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,629

So, he's at 38750. He's trying to unload

3994
01:25:58,629 --> 01:25:58,639
So, he's at 38750. He's trying to unload
 

3995
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,110
So, he's at 38750. He's trying to unload
687 lots. Let's see if we push into him.

687 lots. Let's see if we push into him.
Let's see if he actually fills or if he

3998
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:02,639
Let's see if he actually fills or if he
 

3999
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:17,510
Let's see if he actually fills or if he
lifts [snorts]

4000
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:17,520

 

4001
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,149

very close to that 20-day and previous

4002
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:20,159
very close to that 20-day and previous
 

4003
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:24,470
very close to that 20-day and previous
week low on ES as well. About to tap it.

So, you should have locked most your

01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:25,840
So, you should have locked most your
 

4007
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:26,950
So, you should have locked most your
profits in. Here we go. We're going to

profits in. Here we go. We're going to
 

4009
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,790
profits in. Here we go. We're going to
drive to 87. Let's see if he's legit.

4010

drive to 87. Let's see if he's legit.
 

4011
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,229
drive to 87. Let's see if he's legit.
He's still there. He's still there. He's

there. Let's see if he holds. He's still
 

4017
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,870
there. Let's see if he holds. He's still
there. All right. He's a legit seller by

4018
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:36,880
there. All right. He's a legit seller by
 

4019
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,070
there. All right. He's a legit seller by
the looks of it. Oh, we're going to fill

4020
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,080
the looks of it. Oh, we're going to fill
 

4021
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,990
the looks of it. Oh, we're going to fill
him. You need to be taking profits into

4022
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
him. You need to be taking profits into
 

4023
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,790
him. You need to be taking profits into
this move here. All right.

4024
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
this move here. All right.
 

4025
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,470
this move here. All right.
Especially if we squeeze through him. We

4026
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:46,480
Especially if we squeeze through him. We
 

4027
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,550
Especially if we squeeze through him. We
will stop run and we will pop through if

4028
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
will stop run and we will pop through if
 

4029
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,629
will stop run and we will pop through if
he's legit, which he looks like he is.

4030
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:50,639
he's legit, which he looks like he is.
 

4031
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,629
he's legit, which he looks like he is.
He's putting a wall up. If we pop

4032
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:52,639
He's putting a wall up. If we pop
 

4033
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,070
He's putting a wall up. If we pop
through this, it might accelerate and

4034
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,080
through this, it might accelerate and
 

4035
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,830
through this, it might accelerate and
you got to be locking in. I'd be down to

4036
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:55,840
you got to be locking in. I'd be down to
 

4037
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,070
you got to be locking in. I'd be down to
to runners at the moment. He lifted.

4038
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,080
to runners at the moment. He lifted.
 

4039
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,990
to runners at the moment. He lifted.
He's moved out the way. He's not legit.

4040
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:00,000
He's moved out the way. He's not legit.
 

4041
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,709
He's moved out the way. He's not legit.
He just I was going to say something

4042
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
He just I was going to say something
 

4043
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,510
He just I was going to say something
rude. He capped his pants and left. So

4044
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:05,520
rude. He capped his pants and left. So
 

4045
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,750
rude. He capped his pants and left. So
here's the squeeze through it. So 400's

4046
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:07,760
here's the squeeze through it. So 400's
 

4047
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,830
here's the squeeze through it. So 400's
coming up. That seller was not legit. So

4048
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:09,840
coming up. That seller was not legit. So
 

4049
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,629
coming up. That seller was not legit. So
400's coming up. Here we go into fours.

4050
01:27:12,629 --> 01:27:12,639
400's coming up. Here we go into fours.
 

4051
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,149
400's coming up. Here we go into fours.
All right. You should be out majority of

4052
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:14,159
All right. You should be out majority of
 

4053
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,310
All right. You should be out majority of
your position now. And if you get lucky,

4054
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:16,320
your position now. And if you get lucky,
 

4055
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,149
your position now. And if you get lucky,
you get fives. Now the only thing we can

4056
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:18,159
you get fives. Now the only thing we can
 

4057
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:20,550
you get fives. Now the only thing we can
now look at is a pull back into this

4058
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
now look at is a pull back into this
 

4059
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,470
now look at is a pull back into this
previous week or current week point of

4060
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,480
previous week or current week point of
 

4061
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,870
previous week or current week point of
control for acceleration up here. Again

4062
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:24,880
control for acceleration up here. Again
 

4063
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,390
control for acceleration up here. Again
guys in Discord, this was part of the

4064
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,400
guys in Discord, this was part of the
 

4065
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,709
guys in Discord, this was part of the
pathing. All right. Think about this.

4066
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:28,719
pathing. All right. Think about this.
 

4067
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:33,270
pathing. All right. Think about this.
Think about this. So we can look at it

4068
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280

 

4069
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,950

right here. All right, we're into this

4070
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:34,960
right here. All right, we're into this
 

4071
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,870
right here. All right, we're into this
move here, acceleration. So the double

4072
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:36,880
move here, acceleration. So the double
 

4073
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,790
move here, acceleration. So the double
bottom acceleration into this and then

4074
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:38,800
bottom acceleration into this and then
 

4075
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,110
bottom acceleration into this and then
the last move is to hold this and get to

4076
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:41,120
the last move is to hold this and get to
 

4077
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,110
the last move is to hold this and get to
500. So we can think about that hold of

4078
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:43,120
500. So we can think about that hold of
 

4079
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,830
500. So we can think about that hold of
300 to 500. Now, right, if they do pull

4080
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:45,840
300 to 500. Now, right, if they do pull
 

4081
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,510
300 to 500. Now, right, if they do pull
back and they want to hold this and

4082
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
back and they want to hold this and
 

4083
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,430
back and they want to hold this and
build out liquidity here, we can think

4084
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:49,440
build out liquidity here, we can think
 

4085
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,870
build out liquidity here, we can think
about something on a lower time frame,

4086
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
about something on a lower time frame,
 

4087
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,310
about something on a lower time frame,
which might look like this. That's

4088
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,320
which might look like this. That's
 

4089
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,870
which might look like this. That's
possible today.

4090
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:56,880

 

4091
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,695

Really nice.

4092
01:27:58,695 --> 01:27:58,705
Really nice.
 

4093
01:27:58,705 --> 01:28:00,310
Really nice.

Alex, why were you interested in longs

4096
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
Alex, why were you interested in longs
 

4097
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,910
Alex, why were you interested in longs
for today? Is it because we opened above

4098
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:03,920
for today? Is it because we opened above
 

4099
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,910
for today? Is it because we opened above
yesterday's lows? Uh, it's because we

4100
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:05,920
yesterday's lows? Uh, it's because we
 

4101
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,629
yesterday's lows? Uh, it's because we
trapped shorts at uh at that lows

4102
01:28:08,629 --> 01:28:08,639
trapped shorts at uh at that lows
 

4103
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,470
trapped shorts at uh at that lows
yesterday. It's because we trapped

4104
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:10,480
yesterday. It's because we trapped
 

4105
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,950
yesterday. It's because we trapped
shorts and then we opened above them.

4106
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:12,960
shorts and then we opened above them.
 

4107
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,669
shorts and then we opened above them.
So, [clears throat]

4108
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:13,679
So, [clears throat]
 

4109
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,669
So, [clears throat]
you've got to think not everyone in the

4110
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:15,679
you've got to think not everyone in the
 

4111
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,510
you've got to think not everyone in the
market is a day trader. Lots of people

4112
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:17,520
market is a day trader. Lots of people
 

4113
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,950
market is a day trader. Lots of people
are swinging traders. Lots of people

4114
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:18,960
are swinging traders. Lots of people
 

4115
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,110
are swinging traders. Lots of people
like to play the levels at the close.

4116
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
like to play the levels at the close.
 

4117
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,590
like to play the levels at the close.
So, if we build liquidity at the lows

4118
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:23,600
So, if we build liquidity at the lows
 

4119
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,750
So, if we build liquidity at the lows
and we open up above it, I want to use

4120
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:25,760
and we open up above it, I want to use
 

4121
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,110
and we open up above it, I want to use
them. I'm going to assume they're

4122
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:27,120
them. I'm going to assume they're
 

4123
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,390
them. I'm going to assume they're
offside. So, 400's here acting as some

4124
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:30,400
offside. So, 400's here acting as some
 

4125
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,750
offside. So, 400's here acting as some
resistance. You should be down to like

4126
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:31,760
resistance. You should be down to like
 

4127
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,790
resistance. You should be down to like
10% or something right now.

4128
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:34,800
10% or something right now.
 

4129
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,870
10% or something right now.
Yeah, top of the channel. Quite right.

4130
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:36,880
Yeah, top of the channel. Quite right.
 

4131
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,390
Yeah, top of the channel. Quite right.
We're going to see if this comes back

4132
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:38,400
We're going to see if this comes back
 

4133
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,189
We're going to see if this comes back
and it holds the sort of 300. The red

4134
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:41,199
and it holds the sort of 300. The red
 

4135
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,990
and it holds the sort of 300. The red
this red box basically needs to turn

4136
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
this red box basically needs to turn
 

4137
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,830
this red box basically needs to turn
into blue. All right. Something like

4138
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:45,840
into blue. All right. Something like
 

4139
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,950
into blue. All right. Something like
that. And really, I'd be looking, we can

4140
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:48,960
that. And really, I'd be looking, we can
 

4141
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,470
that. And really, I'd be looking, we can
sort of trim this down a bit. I'd

4142
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
sort of trim this down a bit. I'd
 

4143
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,110
sort of trim this down a bit. I'd
actually be looking at sort of 320

4144
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:53,120
actually be looking at sort of 320
 

4145
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,550
actually be looking at sort of 320
something around here. So, if they're

4146
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:54,560
something around here. So, if they're
 

4147
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,149
something around here. So, if they're
going to hold it, remember this is a

4148
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:56,159
going to hold it, remember this is a
 

4149
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,070
going to hold it, remember this is a
straight squeeze up, folks. If they want

4150
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,080
straight squeeze up, folks. If they want
 

4151
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,550
straight squeeze up, folks. If they want
to collapse this, they can. But what we

4152
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:00,560
to collapse this, they can. But what we
 

4153
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,470
to collapse this, they can. But what we
would like to see is a move into here.

4154
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:02,480
would like to see is a move into here.
 

4155
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,470
would like to see is a move into here.
And in here, you want to see sellers get

4156
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:04,480
And in here, you want to see sellers get
 

4157
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,590
And in here, you want to see sellers get
stuck and then acceleration to 500. If

4158
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:07,600
stuck and then acceleration to 500. If
 

4159
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,350
stuck and then acceleration to 500. If
they collapse this and they lose it,

4160
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
they collapse this and they lose it,
 

4161
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,350
they collapse this and they lose it,
then guess what? This will be a look

4162
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,360
then guess what? This will be a look
 

4163
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,790
then guess what? This will be a look
above and fail and we're going to come

4164
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:12,800
above and fail and we're going to come
 

4165
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,310
above and fail and we're going to come
back in this rotation. And I don't want

4166
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:14,320
back in this rotation. And I don't want
 

4167
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,590
back in this rotation. And I don't want
to play in here for the rest of the day.

4168
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:15,600
to play in here for the rest of the day.
 

4169
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,430
to play in here for the rest of the day.
So, either bulls hold this today or I'm

stick around, man. Just stick around. It

4302
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:11,440
stick around, man. Just stick around. It
 

4303
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,669
stick around, man. Just stick around. It
will all start to make sense. What do I

4304
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
will all start to make sense. What do I
 

4305
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,470
will all start to make sense. What do I
think of the 25,400 level? I mean, I

4306
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:16,480
think of the 25,400 level? I mean, I
 

4307
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,990
think of the 25,400 level? I mean, I
wouldn't be playing upside from here,

4308
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
wouldn't be playing upside from here,
 

4309
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,310
wouldn't be playing upside from here,
right? I wouldn't be playing upside from

4310
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
right? I wouldn't be playing upside from
 

4311
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,830
right? I wouldn't be playing upside from
here. Think, think about where we are in

4312
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840
here. Think, think about where we are in
 

4313
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,830
here. Think, think about where we are in
the swing leg. Always go back to the

4314
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:23,840
the swing leg. Always go back to the
 

4315
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,590
the swing leg. Always go back to the
higher time frame. Always, always,

4316
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:25,600
higher time frame. Always, always,
 

4317
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,750
higher time frame. Always, always,
always, always. For me, I always talk

4318
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:27,760
always, always. For me, I always talk
 

4319
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,430
always, always. For me, I always talk
about it. The hourly chart is my god

4320
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:29,440
about it. The hourly chart is my god
 

4321
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,189
about it. The hourly chart is my god
chart, as I call it. Whatever the hourly

4322
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:31,199
chart, as I call it. Whatever the hourly
 

4323
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,550
chart, as I call it. Whatever the hourly
does is what I want to do because

4324
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:32,560
does is what I want to do because
 

4325
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,870
does is what I want to do because
intraday trading, it's important. Higher

4326
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:34,880
intraday trading, it's important. Higher
 

4327
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,270
intraday trading, it's important. Higher
time frame, do we want to be long up

4328
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:37,280
time frame, do we want to be long up
 

4329
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,030
time frame, do we want to be long up
here? Think about this here. We've got

4330
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:39,040
here? Think about this here. We've got
 

4331
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,149
here? Think about this here. We've got
this little pivot. We know this can act

4332
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:42,159
this little pivot. We know this can act
 

4333
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,990
this little pivot. We know this can act
as supply. Not it will, but it can act

4334
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:44,000
as supply. Not it will, but it can act
 

4335
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,310
as supply. Not it will, but it can act
as supply. I don't want to be long. The

4336
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:46,320
as supply. I don't want to be long. The
 

4337
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,390
as supply. I don't want to be long. The
the best long, I'll be honest, was down

4338
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:48,400
the best long, I'll be honest, was down
 

4339
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,229
the best long, I'll be honest, was down
here. All right. And then the best long

4340
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
here. All right. And then the best long
 

4341
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,550
here. All right. And then the best long
was here. I wasn't up for CPI. So, we

4342
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:52,560
was here. I wasn't up for CPI. So, we
 

4343
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,870
was here. I wasn't up for CPI. So, we
had to play dips in. We don't want to be

4344
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:54,880
had to play dips in. We don't want to be
 

4345
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,950
had to play dips in. We don't want to be
a new money long up here. You want to be

4346
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:56,960
a new money long up here. You want to be
 

4347
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,629
a new money long up here. You want to be
selling into this push. You don't want

4348
01:32:58,629 --> 01:32:58,639
selling into this push. You don't want
 

4349
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,470
selling into this push. You don't want
to be short because you're not seeing

4350
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:00,480
to be short because you're not seeing
 

4351
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,550
to be short because you're not seeing
something like this to short right now.

4352
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:02,560
something like this to short right now.
 

4353
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,790
something like this to short right now.
So, you're either in a trade and

4354
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:04,800
So, you're either in a trade and
 

4355
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,669
So, you're either in a trade and
managing the position or your cash,

4356
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:07,679
managing the position or your cash,
 

4357
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:09,189
managing the position or your cash,
right?

4358
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:09,199
right?
 

4359
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:10,629
right?
This is something I think newer traders

4360
01:33:10,629 --> 01:33:10,639
This is something I think newer traders
 

4361
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:13,350
This is something I think newer traders
get confused with. You don't need to be

4362
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:13,360
get confused with. You don't need to be
 

4363
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,270
get confused with. You don't need to be
in a trade all the time. All right? You

4364
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:15,280
in a trade all the time. All right? You
 

4365
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,629
in a trade all the time. All right? You
need to wait for the trade to come to

4366
01:33:18,629 --> 01:33:18,639
need to wait for the trade to come to
 

4367
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:20,390
need to wait for the trade to come to
you. You've got that spoofer back on the

4368
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:20,400
you. You've got that spoofer back on the
 

4369
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,110
you. You've got that spoofer back on the
tape here at 410. The only trade I would

4370
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:23,120
tape here at 410. The only trade I would
 

4371
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,750
tape here at 410. The only trade I would
consider now is a lower time frame pull

4372
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:25,760
consider now is a lower time frame pull
 

4373
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,990
consider now is a lower time frame pull
back into here, which I see absorb. And

4374
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:28,000
back into here, which I see absorb. And
 

4375
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,590
back into here, which I see absorb. And
I want to see shorts come flying in

4376
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:29,600
I want to see shorts come flying in
 

4377
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,910
I want to see shorts come flying in
here. And I want to see a passive buyer

4378
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:31,920
here. And I want to see a passive buyer
 

4379
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,990
here. And I want to see a passive buyer
absorbing the tape, soaking against

4380
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:34,000
absorbing the tape, soaking against
 

4381
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,550
absorbing the tape, soaking against
these levels for a rotation to 500. If I

4382
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:36,560
these levels for a rotation to 500. If I
 

4383
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,990
these levels for a rotation to 500. If I
don't see that, if we just come flying

4384
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,000
don't see that, if we just come flying
 

4385
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,669
don't see that, if we just come flying
in here and there's no absorption, then

4386
01:33:39,669 --> 01:33:39,679
in here and there's no absorption, then
 

4387
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:40,870
in here and there's no absorption, then
I'm going to assume we're going to go

4388
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:40,880
I'm going to assume we're going to go
 

4389
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,790
I'm going to assume we're going to go
back into this range, right? And I'm

4390
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:42,800
back into this range, right? And I'm
 

4391
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,830
back into this range, right? And I'm
going to leave this alone. This would be

4392
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:43,840
going to leave this alone. This would be
 

4393
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,270
going to leave this alone. This would be
a look above and fail. And I'm going to

4394
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:45,280
a look above and fail. And I'm going to
 

4395
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,590
a look above and fail. And I'm going to
leave that alone. All right. Not that's

4396
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:47,600
leave that alone. All right. Not that's
 

4397
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,669
leave that alone. All right. Not that's
it. You would have heard, if you go back

4398
01:33:49,669 --> 01:33:49,679
it. You would have heard, if you go back
 

4399
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:50,709
it. You would have heard, if you go back
to the beginning of the tape this

4400
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:50,719
to the beginning of the tape this
 

4401
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:51,510
to the beginning of the tape this
morning, you would have heard me say,

4402
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:51,520
morning, you would have heard me say,
 

4403
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,709
morning, you would have heard me say,
I'm going to focus on the longs. Oh,

4404
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:52,719
I'm going to focus on the longs. Oh,
 

4405
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:54,149
I'm going to focus on the longs. Oh,
I've just put you on the wrong chart,

4406
01:33:54,149 --> 01:33:54,159
I've just put you on the wrong chart,
 

4407
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:56,229
I've just put you on the wrong chart,
haven't I? Here we go. Right. I'm going

4408
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:56,239
haven't I? Here we go. Right. I'm going
 

4409
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:59,590
haven't I? Here we go. Right. I'm going
to wait for this. And in here, I better

4410
01:33:59,590 --> 01:33:59,600
to wait for this. And in here, I better
 

4411
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,189
to wait for this. And in here, I better
see sellers trapped. Otherwise, I'm not

4412
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
see sellers trapped. Otherwise, I'm not
 

4413
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,550
see sellers trapped. Otherwise, I'm not
playing it. Because if we just go

4414
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:02,560
playing it. Because if we just go
 

4415
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,470
playing it. Because if we just go
straight the way back down and reject

4416
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:04,480
straight the way back down and reject
 

4417
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,990
straight the way back down and reject
this, we're going to go back into range

4418
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:06,000
this, we're going to go back into range
 

4419
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,430
this, we're going to go back into range
rotation. And I'm not going to play in

4420
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:07,440
rotation. And I'm not going to play in
 

4421
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,669
rotation. And I'm not going to play in
here. Like I said this morning, my trade

4422
01:34:09,669 --> 01:34:09,679
here. Like I said this morning, my trade
 

4423
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:12,470
here. Like I said this morning, my trade
I'm looking for is longs. Longs. All

4424
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:12,480
I'm looking for is longs. Longs. All
 

4425
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,470
I'm looking for is longs. Longs. All
right. I'm focused on that trade. I'm

4426
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:14,480
right. I'm focused on that trade. I'm
 

4427
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,390
right. I'm focused on that trade. I'm
not focused on shorts up here. I wasn't

4428
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:16,400
not focused on shorts up here. I wasn't
 

4429
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,070
not focused on shorts up here. I wasn't
focused on the short here, even though I

4430
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
focused on the short here, even though I
 

4431
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,790
focused on the short here, even though I
said it would probably play out. I home

4432
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:20,800
said it would probably play out. I home
 

4433
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,310
said it would probably play out. I home
in on where my edge is. My edge now is

4434
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,320
in on where my edge is. My edge now is
 

4435
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,990
in on where my edge is. My edge now is
being flat. That's my edge because if

4436
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:26,000
being flat. That's my edge because if
 

4437
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,070
being flat. That's my edge because if
I'm in a trade now, if I'm short now,

4438
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:28,080
I'm in a trade now, if I'm short now,
 

4439
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,149
I'm in a trade now, if I'm short now,
I'm short without structure. If I'm long

4440
01:34:30,149 --> 01:34:30,159
I'm short without structure. If I'm long
 

4441
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:33,990
I'm short without structure. If I'm long
now, I'm chasing. So my edge now flat.

4442
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,000
now, I'm chasing. So my edge now flat.
 

4443
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,669
now, I'm chasing. So my edge now flat.
Wait, wait. Let it come in. Let it prove

4444
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
Wait, wait. Let it come in. Let it prove
 

4445
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,270
Wait, wait. Let it come in. Let it prove
to me, okay, it's ready. If it doesn't

4446
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:39,280
to me, okay, it's ready. If it doesn't
 

4447
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,229
to me, okay, it's ready. If it doesn't
get to my level, I haven't really missed

4448
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:42,239
get to my level, I haven't really missed
 

4449
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,669
get to my level, I haven't really missed
anything. Right? If this, let's say, or

4450
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:45,679
anything. Right? If this, let's say, or
 

4451
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,070
anything. Right? If this, let's say, or
you could say, you could argue, hey, you

4452
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:48,080
you could say, you could argue, hey, you
 

4453
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,070
you could say, you could argue, hey, you
should have added more size. All right,

4454
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,080
should have added more size. All right,
 

4455
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,070
should have added more size. All right,
partial partial partial out. If it

4456
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:52,080
partial partial partial out. If it
 

4457
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,830
partial partial partial out. If it
doesn't come into my level and this

4458
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:53,840
doesn't come into my level and this
 

4459
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,910
doesn't come into my level and this
keeps squeezing, I don't feel like I've

4460
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
keeps squeezing, I don't feel like I've
 

4461
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,990
keeps squeezing, I don't feel like I've
missed anything. My trade's happened.

4462
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,000
missed anything. My trade's happened.
 

4463
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,030
missed anything. My trade's happened.
All right, this trade's happened. I

4464
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:01,040
All right, this trade's happened. I
 

4465
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,550
All right, this trade's happened. I
don't feel like I'm missing this because

4466
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:02,560
don't feel like I'm missing this because
 

4467
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,070
don't feel like I'm missing this because
if I take a long here and that works,

4468
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:04,080
if I take a long here and that works,
 

4469
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,550
if I take a long here and that works,
that's chasing. I'm not missing it. I'm

4470
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:06,560
that's chasing. I'm not missing it. I'm
 

4471
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,709
that's chasing. I'm not missing it. I'm
not missing anything.

4472
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:08,719
not missing anything.
 

4473
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:16,390
not missing anything.
Yeah. So, let the trade come in.

4474
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:16,400

 

4475
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,550

Adam, do I think we've flipped to a long

4476
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:18,560
Adam, do I think we've flipped to a long
 

4477
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,669
Adam, do I think we've flipped to a long
bias? Uh, no.

4478
01:35:21,669 --> 01:35:21,679
bias? Uh, no.
 

4479
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:24,870
bias? Uh, no.
No, not not yet.

4480
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:24,880
No, not not yet.
 

4481
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,910
No, not not yet.
Potentially, you know, the the the lows

4482
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:27,920
Potentially, you know, the the the lows
 

4483
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,350
Potentially, you know, the the the lows
yesterday and what we've reclaimed

4484
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:29,360
yesterday and what we've reclaimed
 

4485
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,229
yesterday and what we've reclaimed
today, right? Potenti potentially we've

4486
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:32,239
today, right? Potenti potentially we've
 

4487
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:33,990
today, right? Potenti potentially we've
come into that higher time frame level

4488
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,000
come into that higher time frame level
 

4489
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,229
come into that higher time frame level
that we talked about in the newsletter

4490
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:36,239
that we talked about in the newsletter
 

4491
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,470
that we talked about in the newsletter
that we said bulls will probably want to

4492
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:38,480
that we said bulls will probably want to
 

4493
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,149
that we said bulls will probably want to
defend. But if you look at the daily

4494
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:40,159
defend. But if you look at the daily
 

4495
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,470
defend. But if you look at the daily
chart and you look at the hourly chart,

4496
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:42,480
chart and you look at the hourly chart,
 

4497
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,470
chart and you look at the hourly chart,
they are not yet both bullish. Now if we

4498
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:44,480
they are not yet both bullish. Now if we
 

4499
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,550
they are not yet both bullish. Now if we
start

4500
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:46,560
start
 

4501
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,510
start
getting above 500, closing above 500,

4502
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520
getting above 500, closing above 500,
 

4503
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,669
getting above 500, closing above 500,
holding bullish sentiment above 500, we

4504
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:51,679
holding bullish sentiment above 500, we
 

4505
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:55,830
holding bullish sentiment above 500, we
can we can talk about that maybe.

4506
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:55,840
can we can talk about that maybe.
 

4507
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,070
can we can talk about that maybe.
Can I chart BTC?

4508
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
Can I chart BTC?
 

4509
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,229
Can I chart BTC?
Yep.

4510
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:00,239
Yep.
 

4511
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,470
Yep.
Uh on on what kind of time frame you

4512
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:02,480
Uh on on what kind of time frame you
 

4513
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:10,606
Uh on on what kind of time frame you
looking at it?

4514
01:36:10,606 --> 01:36:10,616

 

4515
01:36:10,616 --> 01:36:11,510

[sighs]

4516
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:11,520
[sighs]
 

4517
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,270
[sighs]
Right, you're in a cell. It's as simple

4518
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:13,280
Right, you're in a cell. It's as simple
 

4519
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,270
Right, you're in a cell. It's as simple
as that. I've set like you're in a cell.

4520
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:17,280
as that. I've set like you're in a cell.
 

4521
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,229
as that. I've set like you're in a cell.
All right, that's your level.

4522
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:20,239
All right, that's your level.
 

4523
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:22,390
All right, that's your level.
You're building out liquidity right now.

4524
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:22,400
You're building out liquidity right now.
 

4525
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,830
You're building out liquidity right now.
You've got a look above and fail up

4526
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:23,840
You've got a look above and fail up
 

4527
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,510
You've got a look above and fail up
here.

4528
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:25,520
here.
 

4529
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,149
here.
You've got volume trapped from here.

4530
01:36:30,149 --> 01:36:30,159
You've got volume trapped from here.
 

4531
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,870
You've got volume trapped from here.
Even if we want to do profile of let's

4532
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:32,880
Even if we want to do profile of let's
 

4533
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,510
Even if we want to do profile of let's
just say from this top side, right?

4534
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
just say from this top side, right?
 

4535
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,510
just say from this top side, right?
They're all stuck from here. And if we

4536
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:37,520
They're all stuck from here. And if we
 

4537
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:42,310
They're all stuck from here. And if we
do even a bigger profile,

4538
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:42,320

 

4539
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,270

let's do from the whole year.

4540
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:45,280
let's do from the whole year.
 

4541
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:48,390
let's do from the whole year.
Where's January?

4542
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:48,400
Where's January?
 

4543
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,990
Where's January?
We can do from this pivot.

4544
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:52,000
We can do from this pivot.
 

4545
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,430
We can do from this pivot.
All right, you're at the low end of this

4546
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:53,440
All right, you're at the low end of this
 

4547
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,590
All right, you're at the low end of this
profile. All right, this is your yearly

4548
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:55,600
profile. All right, this is your yearly
 

4549
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,750
profile. All right, this is your yearly
profile. If you cannot find acceptance

4550
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:57,760
profile. If you cannot find acceptance
 

4551
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,189
profile. If you cannot find acceptance
back inside of 96,

4552
01:37:01,189 --> 01:37:01,199
back inside of 96,
 

4553
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,990
back inside of 96,
if you keep rejecting this area,

4554
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:04,000
if you keep rejecting this area,
 

4555
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,669
if you keep rejecting this area,
all right, it means everyone from this

4556
01:37:05,669 --> 01:37:05,679
all right, it means everyone from this
 

4557
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,910
all right, it means everyone from this
year is offside and you are going to

4558
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:07,920
year is offside and you are going to
 

4559
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,990
year is offside and you are going to
search for lower prices until you find a

4560
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,000
search for lower prices until you find a
 

4561
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,510
search for lower prices until you find a
balance. It might be that you find a

4562
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520
balance. It might be that you find a
 

4563
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,590
balance. It might be that you find a
balance in here, but right now bears are

4564
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
balance in here, but right now bears are
 

4565
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,430
balance in here, but right now bears are
in absolute control. If you see

4566
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:17,440
in absolute control. If you see
 

4567
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,189
in absolute control. If you see
acceptance back in here and it builds,

4568
01:37:19,189 --> 01:37:19,199
acceptance back in here and it builds,
 

4569
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:21,669
acceptance back in here and it builds,
yeah, maybe you come back into one uh

4570
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:21,679
yeah, maybe you come back into one uh
 

4571
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,910
yeah, maybe you come back into one uh
110,000. But until you find that

4572
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:23,920
110,000. But until you find that
 

4573
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,990
110,000. But until you find that
acceptance, I'd be very concerned about

4574
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:26,000
acceptance, I'd be very concerned about
 

4575
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,669
acceptance, I'd be very concerned about
trying to find a bid in this market

4576
01:37:27,669 --> 01:37:27,679
trying to find a bid in this market
 

4577
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,229
trying to find a bid in this market
because if they've deemed these prices

4578
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:30,239
because if they've deemed these prices
 

4579
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:31,990
because if they've deemed these prices
are too expensive, the only thing left

4580
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:32,000
are too expensive, the only thing left
 

4581
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,709
are too expensive, the only thing left
to do is to look for balance. And it

4582
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:34,719
to do is to look for balance. And it
 

4583
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,629
to do is to look for balance. And it
looks like the last balance range was in

4584
01:37:36,629 --> 01:37:36,639
looks like the last balance range was in
 

4585
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:39,350
looks like the last balance range was in
here, right? Like really simple, right?

4586
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,360
here, right? Like really simple, right?
 

4587
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,550
here, right? Like really simple, right?
So if we can't find acceptance on BTC

4588
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
So if we can't find acceptance on BTC
 

4589
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,709
So if we can't find acceptance on BTC
back inside of here, we are going to

4590
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:44,719
back inside of here, we are going to
 

4591
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,229
back inside of here, we are going to
search back down into this range. All

4592
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:46,239
search back down into this range. All
 

4593
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,390
search back down into this range. All
right? because this is the last area

4594
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,400
right? because this is the last area
 

4595
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,350
right? because this is the last area
that we found balance in. Okay? So, if

4596
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,360
that we found balance in. Okay? So, if
 

4597
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,990
that we found balance in. Okay? So, if
we can't find acceptance back inside of

4598
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,000
we can't find acceptance back inside of
 

4599
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,830
we can't find acceptance back inside of
here, we will search down into there. I

4600
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:55,840
here, we will search down into there. I
 

4601
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,590
here, we will search down into there. I
don't care what the news says, what the

4602
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:57,600
don't care what the news says, what the
 

4603
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,430
don't care what the news says, what the
whales say, what anything. This is what

4604
01:37:59,430 --> 01:37:59,440
whales say, what anything. This is what
 

4605
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:00,790
whales say, what anything. This is what
we're going to do. We're either going to

4606
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:00,800
we're going to do. We're either going to
 

4607
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,709
we're going to do. We're either going to
find acceptance and do this, or we're

4608
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:02,719
find acceptance and do this, or we're
 

4609
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:03,990
find acceptance and do this, or we're
going to not find acceptance and do

4610
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:04,000
going to not find acceptance and do
 

4611
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,510
going to not find acceptance and do
this. What we're not going to do is [\h__\h]

4612
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:05,520
this. What we're not going to do is [\h__\h]

4628
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:21,360
front of you, not what you hope, you
 

4629
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,189
front of you, not what you hope, you
think. You got to trade what's actually

4630
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:23,199

4632
01:38:30,149 --> 01:38:30,159

 

4633
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:32,070

When can you confirm buyers and sellers

4634
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:32,080
When can you confirm buyers and sellers
 

4635
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,270
When can you confirm buyers and sellers
are trapped? Do you wait until the

4636
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:33,280
are trapped? Do you wait until the
 

4637
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,310
are trapped? Do you wait until the
pullback

4638
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:36,320

 

4639
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,310

pull back above below where the trap

4640
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:38,320
pull back above below where the trap
 

4641
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,669
pull back above below where the trap
play? Yeah. So, what I do is I I'm

4642
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:41,679
play? Yeah. So, what I do is I I'm
 

4643
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,669
play? Yeah. So, what I do is I I'm
look for a level like this is holding

4644
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:43,679
look for a level like this is holding
 

4645
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:44,950
look for a level like this is holding
pretty well, this little low volume

4646
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:44,960
pretty well, this little low volume
 

4647
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,270
pretty well, this little low volume
node, but it's still too high for me,

4648
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,280
node, but it's still too high for me,
 

4649
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:51,030
node, but it's still too high for me,
right? So, I'll look for a level like

4650
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,040
right? So, I'll look for a level like
 

4651
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,070
right? So, I'll look for a level like
this is the weekly PC, right? So, I want

4652
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
this is the weekly PC, right? So, I want
 

4653
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,709
this is the weekly PC, right? So, I want
to find see if we can find acceptance

4654
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:56,719
to find see if we can find acceptance
 

4655
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:59,750
to find see if we can find acceptance
like anywhere here or even down here.

4656
01:38:59,750 --> 01:38:59,760
like anywhere here or even down here.
 

4657
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,669
like anywhere here or even down here.
And then when I'm looking at this, what

4658
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:01,679
And then when I'm looking at this, what
 

4659
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,709
And then when I'm looking at this, what
I'm looking for is like what we saw here

4660
01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:04,719
I'm looking for is like what we saw here
 

4661
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:06,470
I'm looking for is like what we saw here
to happen here. So, I'm looking for

4662
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:06,480
to happen here. So, I'm looking for
 

4663
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,950
to happen here. So, I'm looking for
strong selling to come in and be

4664
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:08,960
strong selling to come in and be
 

4665
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,709
strong selling to come in and be
absorbed. So, let's say we come all the

4666
01:39:10,709 --> 01:39:10,719
absorbed. So, let's say we come all the
 

4667
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:13,189
absorbed. So, let's say we come all the
way down into 300, right? Which we can

4668
01:39:13,189 --> 01:39:13,199
way down into 300, right? Which we can
 

4669
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:14,790
way down into 300, right? Which we can
see we've got an old imbalance down

4670
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:14,800
see we've got an old imbalance down
 

4671
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,990
see we've got an old imbalance down
here, right? Right now, under 300, we've

4672
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,000
here, right? Right now, under 300, we've
 

4673
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,350
here, right? Right now, under 300, we've
got these sellers stuck.

4674
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:21,360
got these sellers stuck.

It's going to not let me draw. We've got
sellers stuck down here. If we see like

01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:24,560
sellers stuck down here. If we see like
 

4679
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,109

buyers absorbing and this is all
 

4683
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,830
buyers absorbing and this is all
sellside delta, and we start to trap

4684
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:31,840
sellside delta, and we start to trap
 

4685
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,510
sellside delta, and we start to trap
them under here, then we can use their

4686
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,520
them under here, then we can use their
 

4687
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,590
them under here, then we can use their
pain. It's all about using their pain.

4688
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:35,600
pain. It's all about using their pain.

01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:39,520
about using someone's pain. If I don't
 

4693
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:44,139

01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,910
amazing trade. I would say you don't
want I would not want this to come back

4736
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
want I would not want this to come back
 

4737
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,149
want I would not want this to come back
below 260 and that means you're going to

4738
01:40:46,149 --> 01:40:46,159
below 260 and that means you're going to
 

4739
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,070
below 260 and that means you're going to
give back another 100 points, right? So,

4740
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,080
give back another 100 points, right? So,
 

4741
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,790
give back another 100 points, right? So,
I would I would sell one micro now if

4742
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:50,800
I would I would sell one micro now if
 

4743
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,629
I would I would sell one micro now if
you haven't sold one. I would be taking

4744
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:52,639
you haven't sold one. I would be taking
 

4745
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:55,189
you haven't sold one. I would be taking
one off now. I would be looking for a

4746
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:55,199
one off now. I would be looking for a
 

4747
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:58,470
one off now. I would be looking for a
break of 500 to take the next one off.

4748
01:40:58,470 --> 01:40:58,480
break of 500 to take the next one off.
 

4749
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,470
break of 500 to take the next one off.
Um, and I would not want this to see

4750
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:00,480
Um, and I would not want this to see
 

4751
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,790
Um, and I would not want this to see
come back under here. All right. So, if

4752
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:02,800
come back under here. All right. So, if
 

4753
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,390
come back under here. All right. So, if
you're basically swing long, you don't

4754
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:04,400
you're basically swing long, you don't
 

4755
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,229
you're basically swing long, you don't
want it back under here. You ideally you

4756
01:41:06,229 --> 01:41:06,239
want it back under here. You ideally you
 

4757
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:07,430
want it back under here. You ideally you
want it to hold this, but I would have

4758
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:07,440
want it to hold this, but I would have
 

4759
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,350
want it to hold this, but I would have
already sold one into this move and

4760
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:09,360
already sold one into this move and
 

4761
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:18,470
already sold one into this move and
maybe you get this if you get lucky.

4762
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:18,480

 

4763
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,470

I think funded next if you're a beginner

4764
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:20,480
I think funded next if you're a beginner
 

4765
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,070
I think funded next if you're a beginner
is the best. I think Funded Next and

4766
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:22,080
is the best. I think Funded Next and
 

4767
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,669
is the best. I think Funded Next and
Lucid

4768
01:41:23,669 --> 01:41:23,679
Lucid
 

4769
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:25,270
Lucid
both both the same and the new trader

4770
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:25,280
both both the same and the new trader
 

4771
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,310
both both the same and the new trader
fight they're all the same. They're

4772
01:41:26,310 --> 01:41:26,320
fight they're all the same. They're
 

4773
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,750
fight they're all the same. They're
basically offering the same service.

4774
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:27,760
basically offering the same service.
 

4775
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,189
basically offering the same service.
Funded next uh Funded Next is really

4776
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:31,199
Funded next uh Funded Next is really
 

4777
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:32,470
Funded next uh Funded Next is really
good if you're beginner because it's a

4778
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,480
good if you're beginner because it's a
 

4779
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,910
good if you're beginner because it's a
onetime fee. Can take as long as you

4780
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:33,920
onetime fee. Can take as long as you
 

4781
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,430
onetime fee. Can take as long as you
want to pass. Lucid as well. Flex

4785
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,910
accounts. Lucid. What is the indicator
on the individual candles? Yes, it's

4786
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:39,920

want to learn and I'll tell you who who
I think is a good trader and mentor for

4806
01:42:04,709 --> 01:42:04,719
I think is a good trader and mentor for
 

4807
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:08,229
I think is a good trader and mentor for
you. No, I would not recommend top step

4808
01:42:08,229 --> 01:42:08,239
you. No, I would not recommend top step
 

4809
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,229
you. No, I would not recommend top step
ever.

4810
01:42:10,229 --> 01:42:10,239
ever.
 

4811
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:12,070
ever.
I've never tried my fun futures. I

4812
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:12,080
I've never tried my fun futures. I
 

4813
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:18,229
I've never tried my fun futures. I
haven't tried them but uh maybe I will.

4814
01:42:18,229 --> 01:42:18,239

 

4815
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:19,590

I definitely don't look like Andrew

4816
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:19,600
I definitely don't look like Andrew
 

4817
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,305
I definitely don't look like Andrew
Tate. Do I look bold,

4818
01:42:23,305 --> 01:42:23,315
Tate. Do I look bold,
 

4819
01:42:23,315 --> 01:42:27,430
Tate. Do I look bold,
[laughter]

4820
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:27,440

 

4821
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,270

Mac? I'm on funded ticks. Yeah, I'm not

4822
01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:29,280
Mac? I'm on funded ticks. Yeah, I'm not
 

4823
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:33,510
Mac? I'm on funded ticks. Yeah, I'm not
happy with them right now.

4824
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:33,520

 

4825
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,669

How do I see the upside target of 500?

4826
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:35,679
How do I see the upside target of 500?
 

4827
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,430
How do I see the upside target of 500?
Uh, it's the pivot, right? If you look

4828
01:42:37,430 --> 01:42:37,440
Uh, it's the pivot, right? If you look
 

4829
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,070
Uh, it's the pivot, right? If you look
at the hourly,

4830
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:40,080
at the hourly,
 

4831
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,390
at the hourly,
where did we come from? Where did we go?

4832
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:42,400
where did we come from? Where did we go?
 

4833
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,990
where did we come from? Where did we go?
Where did we come from? Cot Joe, this

4834
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:44,000
Where did we come from? Cot Joe, this
 

4835
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,550
Where did we come from? Cot Joe, this
right here. Nice pivot. All right. So,

4836
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:46,560
right here. Nice pivot. All right. So,
 

4837
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,990
right here. Nice pivot. All right. So,
we're just runners up into that. We

4838
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,000
we're just runners up into that. We
 

4839
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,830
we're just runners up into that. We
might not get there, right? It's why we

4840
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:49,840
might not get there, right? It's why we
 

4841
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,590
might not get there, right? It's why we
were long for this move. We might not

4842
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:51,600
were long for this move. We might not
 

4843
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,229
were long for this move. We might not
get there, but that's your upside target

4844
01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:54,239
get there, but that's your upside target
 

4845
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:55,910
get there, but that's your upside target
because that's the pivot. We get through

4846
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:55,920
because that's the pivot. We get through
 

4847
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,109
because that's the pivot. We get through
that, we If we get through that, only

4848
01:42:59,109 --> 01:42:59,119
that, we If we get through that, only
 

4849
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,270
that, we If we get through that, only
two things happen. Fail breakout and

4850
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,280
two things happen. Fail breakout and
 

4851
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,390
two things happen. Fail breakout and
back into range or

4852
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:04,400
back into range or
 

4853
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,229
back into range or
break and hold and a squeeze. I would

4854
01:43:06,229 --> 01:43:06,239
break and hold and a squeeze. I would
 

4855
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,669
break and hold and a squeeze. I would
doubt we are going to do the break and

4856
01:43:07,669 --> 01:43:07,679
doubt we are going to do the break and
 

4857
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:10,070
doubt we are going to do the break and
hold and squeeze only because well if we

4858
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:10,080
hold and squeeze only because well if we
 

4859
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,669
hold and squeeze only because well if we
get there in the next couple hours we

4860
01:43:11,669 --> 01:43:11,679
get there in the next couple hours we
 

4861
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,149
get there in the next couple hours we
are basically doing a straight slingshot

4862
01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:14,159
are basically doing a straight slingshot
 

4863
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:16,950
are basically doing a straight slingshot
off the lows and trying to hold that is

4864
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:16,960
off the lows and trying to hold that is
 

4865
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,709
off the lows and trying to hold that is
very hard. It's more likely that we need

4866
01:43:18,709 --> 01:43:18,719
very hard. It's more likely that we need
 

4867
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,070
very hard. It's more likely that we need
to build this right over the next couple

4868
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:22,080
to build this right over the next couple
 

4869
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,750
to build this right over the next couple
days but we can deal with that tomorrow

4870
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:23,760
days but we can deal with that tomorrow
 

4871
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:24,950
days but we can deal with that tomorrow
and Monday. We don't need to deal with

4872
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:24,960
and Monday. We don't need to deal with
 

4873
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:33,109
and Monday. We don't need to deal with
that right now.

4874
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:33,119

 

4875
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,669

What footprint do I search for? Um, it's

4876
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:35,679
What footprint do I search for? Um, it's
 

4877
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:37,990
What footprint do I search for? Um, it's
in your candles.

4878
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:38,000
in your candles.
 

4879
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,990
in your candles.
All right. Up here. See where it says

4880
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:40,000
All right. Up here. See where it says
 

4881
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,590
All right. Up here. See where it says
candles? Is that on your chart? Can you

4882
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:41,600
candles? Is that on your chart? Can you
 

4883
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,590
candles? Is that on your chart? Can you
see that? Just waiting for my stream to

4884
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:43,600
see that? Just waiting for my stream to
 

4885
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,310
see that? Just waiting for my stream to
catch up. Yeah, in here down to here.

4886
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:46,320
catch up. Yeah, in here down to here.
 

4887
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,310
catch up. Yeah, in here down to here.
Footprint. Volume footprint. I'll do a

4888
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:48,320
Footprint. Volume footprint. I'll do a
 

4889
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,790
Footprint. Volume footprint. I'll do a
video on how I set it up. But yeah, it's

4890
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:50,800
video on how I set it up. But yeah, it's
 

4891
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,950
video on how I set it up. But yeah, it's
you need the pro accounts. We are still

4892
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:52,960
you need the pro accounts. We are still
 

4893
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,790
you need the pro accounts. We are still
holding this low volume node here. They

4894
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:54,800
holding this low volume node here. They
 

4895
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,470
holding this low volume node here. They
are. Let me just zoom in on this because

4896
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:56,480
are. Let me just zoom in on this because
 

4897
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,830
are. Let me just zoom in on this because
I've been teaching you. Have we trapped

4898
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:57,840
I've been teaching you. Have we trapped
 

4899
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,430
I've been teaching you. Have we trapped
any shorts down here? We have. We have

4900
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:01,440
any shorts down here? We have. We have
 

4901
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,790
any shorts down here? We have. We have
trapped under 65 and 71. So all the time

4902
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:04,800
trapped under 65 and 71. So all the time
 

4903
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,510
trapped under 65 and 71. So all the time
you're holding 71 now, if they bid over

4904
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:07,520
you're holding 71 now, if they bid over
 

4905
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,590
you're holding 71 now, if they bid over
71, they might resqueeze this, but

4906
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
71, they might resqueeze this, but
 

4907
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,189
71, they might resqueeze this, but
you've got sellside imbalance that we're

4908
01:44:11,189 --> 01:44:11,199
you've got sellside imbalance that we're
 

4909
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:12,709
you've got sellside imbalance that we're
banging into. For me, we haven't dipped

4910
01:44:12,709 --> 01:44:12,719
banging into. For me, we haven't dipped
 

4911
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,629
banging into. For me, we haven't dipped
enough. It's very possible that they do

4912
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:14,639
enough. It's very possible that they do
 

4913
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,229
enough. It's very possible that they do
a continuation here. They definitely

4914
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:16,239
a continuation here. They definitely
 

4915
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:19,430
a continuation here. They definitely
trap some at 71 and 65.

4916
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:19,440
trap some at 71 and 65.
 

4917
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,270
trap some at 71 and 65.
So if you are long, you look good. I

4918
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:21,280
So if you are long, you look good. I
 

4919
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,629
So if you are long, you look good. I
would just basically say you don't want

4920
01:44:22,629 --> 01:44:22,639
would just basically say you don't want
 

4921
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:24,310
would just basically say you don't want
it back under 70. So we're going to test

4922
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:24,320
it back under 70. So we're going to test
 

4923
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,109
it back under 70. So we're going to test
this guy right now into 71. They want to

4924
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:27,119
this guy right now into 71. They want to
 

4925
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,030
this guy right now into 71. They want to
hold him. If they don't hold him, then

4926
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:29,040
hold him. If they don't hold him, then
 

4927
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,350
hold him. If they don't hold him, then
they're going to test 65.

4928
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:31,360
they're going to test 65.
 

4929
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:34,070
they're going to test 65.
So this is the level where bulls need to

4930
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:34,080
So this is the level where bulls need to
 

4931
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,790
So this is the level where bulls need to
hold otherwise bears in this last 1 2 3

4932
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:36,800
hold otherwise bears in this last 1 2 3
 

4933
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,750
hold otherwise bears in this last 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 30 minutes would

4934
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:39,760
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 30 minutes would
 

4935
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:43,750
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 30 minutes would
be left out or let out sorry. So we just

4936
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:43,760
be left out or let out sorry. So we just
 

4937
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,030
be left out or let out sorry. So we just
tapped into Mr. 71. We're building delta

4938
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,040
tapped into Mr. 71. We're building delta
 

4939
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,270
tapped into Mr. 71. We're building delta
there

4940
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,280
there
 

4941
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,790
there
71 on the tape. Yeah. So you can see 71

4942
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:52,800
71 on the tape. Yeah. So you can see 71
 

4943
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,870
71 on the tape. Yeah. So you can see 71
as 10268 63 all around that level. But

4944
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:56,880
as 10268 63 all around that level. But
 

4945
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,550
as 10268 63 all around that level. But
we keep filling these cellside

4946
01:44:58,550 --> 01:44:58,560
we keep filling these cellside
 

4947
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,350
we keep filling these cellside
imbalances into 85. So your range right

4948
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,360
imbalances into 85. So your range right
 

4949
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,990
imbalances into 85. So your range right
now is 70 to 85. That's it. I I need

4950
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:04,000
now is 70 to 85. That's it. I I need
 

4951
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,270
now is 70 to 85. That's it. I I need
this to come deeper for me to be

4952
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280
this to come deeper for me to be
 

4953
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,709
this to come deeper for me to be
interested. I don't want to bid around

4954
01:45:06,709 --> 01:45:06,719
interested. I don't want to bid around
 

4955
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,629
interested. I don't want to bid around
here. But if you are still managing your

4956
01:45:08,629 --> 01:45:08,639
here. But if you are still managing your
 

4957
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,709
here. But if you are still managing your
position, it's okay for now. It's

4958
01:45:10,709 --> 01:45:10,719
position, it's okay for now. It's
 

4959
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:12,550
position, it's okay for now. It's
starting to lose it now. So back into

4960
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,560
starting to lose it now. So back into
 

4961
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,109
starting to lose it now. So back into
the 60 now. Maybe the flush back down is

4962
01:45:15,109 --> 01:45:15,119
the 60 now. Maybe the flush back down is
 

4963
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,550
the 60 now. Maybe the flush back down is
starting to build into this low volume

4964
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:16,560
starting to build into this low volume
 

4965
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,950
starting to build into this low volume
node that we put in.

4966
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,960
node that we put in.
 

4967
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,390
node that we put in.
We have to see how we act when we get

4968
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:20,400
We have to see how we act when we get
 

4969
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:52,790
We have to see how we act when we get
into there.

4970
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:52,800

 

4971
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,350

still holding that low volume node.

4972
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:55,360
still holding that low volume node.
 

4973
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,790
still holding that low volume node.
Still acting as support. They're going

4974
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:56,800
Still acting as support. They're going
 

4975
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,550
Still acting as support. They're going
to try and sell through it here. Just

4976
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,560
to try and sell through it here. Just
 

4977
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,990
to try and sell through it here. Just
watching. There's a bit of a dance on

4978
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,000
watching. There's a bit of a dance on
 

4979
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,669
watching. There's a bit of a dance on
the tape sign to develop. I'm still

4980
01:46:01,669 --> 01:46:01,679
the tape sign to develop. I'm still
 

4981
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,510
the tape sign to develop. I'm still
waiting for this to dip down and come

4982
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:03,520
waiting for this to dip down and come
 

4983
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,910
waiting for this to dip down and come
lower. It might be that they don't come

4984
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:05,920
lower. It might be that they don't come
 

4985
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,750
lower. It might be that they don't come
lower and they don't let me join rejoin.

4986
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:07,760
lower and they don't let me join rejoin.
 

4987
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:12,950
lower and they don't let me join rejoin.
And that's also okay.

4988
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:12,960

 

4989
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,709

Low volume node. Low volume node. low
volume node. They're trying over and

4992
01:46:16,229 --> 01:46:16,239
volume node. They're trying over and
 

4993
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:19,189
volume node. They're trying over and
over again. Here they come. So, let's

4994
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:19,199
over again. Here they come. So, let's
 

4995
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:22,870
over again. Here they come. So, let's
see. Can we get nice and deep? So, I'd

4996
01:46:22,870 --> 01:46:22,880
see. Can we get nice and deep? So, I'd
 

4997
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,430
see. Can we get nice and deep? So, I'd
be watching 50s and I'll be watching 27.

4998
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:25,440
be watching 50s and I'll be watching 27.
 

4999
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,950
be watching 50s and I'll be watching 27.

01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:58,390
well. SPY about to break out upside as
well. Watch SPY previous day high. We've

5346
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:58,400
well. Watch SPY previous day high. We've
 

5347
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,669
well. Watch SPY previous day high. We've
already poked through it. If we start to

5348
01:54:59,669 --> 01:54:59,679
already poked through it. If we start to
 

5349
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:01,109
already poked through it. If we start to
bid above, it's going to get squeezy.

5350
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:01,119
bid above, it's going to get squeezy.
 

5351
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:02,950
bid above, it's going to get squeezy.
Here we go. Right. So, they held this

5352
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:02,960
Here we go. Right. So, they held this
 

5353
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,950
Here we go. Right. So, they held this
low volume now. So, now really all bulls

5354
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:04,960
low volume now. So, now really all bulls
 

5355
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,950
low volume now. So, now really all bulls
need to do is defend this shelf and we

5356
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:06,960
need to do is defend this shelf and we
 

5357
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,790
need to do is defend this shelf and we
should go

5358
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800

 

5359
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:14,390

big if but uh that's that's it. Yeah, I

5360
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:14,400
big if but uh that's that's it. Yeah, I
 

5361
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:15,669
big if but uh that's that's it. Yeah, I
had a feeling we weren't going to make

5362
01:55:15,669 --> 01:55:15,679
had a feeling we weren't going to make
 

5363
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:17,270
had a feeling we weren't going to make
it down there. Mo, if you just look on

5364
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,280
it down there. Mo, if you just look on
 

5365
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,350
it down there. Mo, if you just look on
the tape, like the the selling into this

5366
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:19,360
the tape, like the the selling into this
 

5367
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:22,550
the tape, like the the selling into this
low volume shelf kept getting absorbed.

5368
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:22,560
low volume shelf kept getting absorbed.
 

5369
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,990
low volume shelf kept getting absorbed.
Um so that selling at sort of 65 to 55,

5370
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,000
Um so that selling at sort of 65 to 55,
 

5371
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,669
Um so that selling at sort of 65 to 55,
you'll see it right right here. They

5372
01:55:29,669 --> 01:55:29,679
you'll see it right right here. They
 

5373
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:30,950
you'll see it right right here. They
kept absorbing it. So there was a

5374
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
kept absorbing it. So there was a
 

5375
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,390
kept absorbing it. So there was a
passive and these guys were stuck. So

5376
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:32,400
passive and these guys were stuck. So
 

5377
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,830
passive and these guys were stuck. So
there was a passive buyer stepping in

5378
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:33,840
there was a passive buyer stepping in
 

5379
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,750
there was a passive buyer stepping in
here and then once 380 left that was it.

5380
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:35,760
here and then once 380 left that was it.
 

5381
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,910
here and then once 380 left that was it.
There was no one to hold it down. So

5382
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:37,920
There was no one to hold it down. So
 

5383
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:41,510
There was no one to hold it down. So
here we go. So 410s now

5384
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:41,520
here we go. So 410s now
 

5385
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,109
here we go. So 410s now
is where the liquidity is. They keep

5386
01:55:43,109 --> 01:55:43,119
is where the liquidity is. They keep
 

5387
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:46,870
is where the liquidity is. They keep
adding up at 410s. Big level at 410s

5388
01:55:46,870 --> 01:55:46,880
adding up at 410s. Big level at 410s
 

5389
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,950
adding up at 410s. Big level at 410s
and then through that really 430 is on

5390
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
and then through that really 430 is on
 

5391
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,709
and then through that really 430 is on
the tape but really potentially all the

5392
01:55:50,709 --> 01:55:50,719
the tape but really potentially all the
 

5393
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,270
the tape but really potentially all the
way up to 500. We'll see. They can fail

5394
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:53,280
way up to 500. We'll see. They can fail
 

5395
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,870
way up to 500. We'll see. They can fail
breakout this. Remember they can fail

5396
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:54,880
breakout this. Remember they can fail
 

5397
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,070
breakout this. Remember they can fail
break out this.

5398
01:55:58,070 --> 01:55:58,080
break out this.
 

5399
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:03,910
break out this.
No worries, Mo.

5400
01:56:03,910 --> 01:56:03,920

 

5401
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,109

So, uh, Spy needs to get above previous

5402
01:56:07,109 --> 01:56:07,119
So, uh, Spy needs to get above previous
 

5403
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:09,030
So, uh, Spy needs to get above previous
day high. It needs to hold a bid above

5404
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,040
day high. It needs to hold a bid above
 

5405
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,709
day high. It needs to hold a bid above
previous day high. Keep every time it

5406
01:56:10,709 --> 01:56:10,719
previous day high. Keep every time it
 

5407
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:11,990
previous day high. Keep every time it
comes into it, it's being sold. Remember

5408
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:12,000
comes into it, it's being sold. Remember
 

5409
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,470
comes into it, it's being sold. Remember
that 680 big gamma level. Every time

5410
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:14,480
that 680 big gamma level. Every time
 

5411
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:15,830
that 680 big gamma level. Every time
it's coming into it currently, it's

5412
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:15,840
it's coming into it currently, it's
 

5413
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:18,470
it's coming into it currently, it's
being sold at that level.

5414
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
being sold at that level.
 

5415
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,229
being sold at that level.
So, this can be look above and fail if

5416
01:56:20,229 --> 01:56:20,239
So, this can be look above and fail if
 

5417
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:21,750
So, this can be look above and fail if
they can't get back through it. And on

5418
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:21,760
they can't get back through it. And on
 

5419
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,070
they can't get back through it. And on
the spiders I'm talking about, did ES

5420
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:24,080
the spiders I'm talking about, did ES
 

5421
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,310
the spiders I'm talking about, did ES
make a new high? No. Failed to make a

5422
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:26,320
make a new high? No. Failed to make a
 

5423
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,070
make a new high? No. Failed to make a
new high so far. So, this dip into this

5424
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:28,080
new high so far. So, this dip into this
 

5425
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,229
new high so far. So, this dip into this
gray box needs to hold for bulls.

5426
01:56:30,229 --> 01:56:30,239
gray box needs to hold for bulls.
 

5427
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:32,550
gray box needs to hold for bulls.
Otherwise, uh, no more upside, I would

5428
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:32,560
Otherwise, uh, no more upside, I would
 

5429
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:35,270
Otherwise, uh, no more upside, I would
say. So, they got to hold this dip into

5430
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:35,280
say. So, they got to hold this dip into
 

5431
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,189
say. So, they got to hold this dip into
this gray box for bulls. Otherwise, no

5432
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:37,199
this gray box for bulls. Otherwise, no
 

5433
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:42,310
this gray box for bulls. Otherwise, no
more upside.

5434
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:42,320

 

5435
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:43,830

And definitely a few buyers got caught

5436
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:43,840
And definitely a few buyers got caught
 

5437
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,310
And definitely a few buyers got caught
at 92s. They're going to have to

5438
01:56:46,310 --> 01:56:46,320
at 92s. They're going to have to
 

5439
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:52,070
at 92s. They're going to have to
accelerate through that to let them out.

5440
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:52,080

 

5441
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,629

They're looking for 410s. Here they go.

5442
01:56:54,629 --> 01:56:54,639
They're looking for 410s. Here they go.
 

5443
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:56,390
They're looking for 410s. Here they go.
They're trying. They're looking for 400

5444
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:56,400
They're trying. They're looking for 400
 

5445
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,709
They're trying. They're looking for 400
410s. Spy back over. We're going to go

5446
01:56:58,709 --> 01:56:58,719
410s. Spy back over. We're going to go
 

5447
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:00,550
410s. Spy back over. We're going to go
now. Come on. You got to let these

5448
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:00,560
now. Come on. You got to let these
 

5449
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:01,990
now. Come on. You got to let these
buyers out. You can't keep [\h__\h]

5450
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:02,000
buyers out. You can't keep [\h__\h]
 

5451
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,270
buyers out. You can't keep [\h__\h]
around. If you're going to go, you got

5452
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:03,280
around. If you're going to go, you got
 

5453
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:06,229
around. If you're going to go, you got
to put your foot down

5454
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:06,239
to put your foot down
 

5455
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:09,030
to put your foot down
messing about these players.

5456
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,040
messing about these players.
 

5457
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,910
messing about these players.
I bet you 410 lifts as well. Bet you he

5458
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:11,920
I bet you 410 lifts as well. Bet you he
 

5459
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:25,830
I bet you 410 lifts as well. Bet you he
lifts.

5460
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:25,840

 

5461
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,669

Accelerate. Come on. Where's the

5462
01:57:27,669 --> 01:57:27,679
Accelerate. Come on. Where's the
 

5463
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:32,149
Accelerate. Come on. Where's the
liquidity? Go. Who's here? Hello. They

Can you get some size on the book? No

5470
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,080
Can you get some size on the book? No
 

5471
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,149
Can you get some size on the book? No
one's come to play all of a sudden. It's

5472
01:57:40,149 --> 01:57:40,159
one's come to play all of a sudden. It's
 

5473
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:41,589
one's come to play all of a sudden. It's
really weird since we've got up here.

5474
01:57:41,589 --> 01:57:41,599
really weird since we've got up here.
 

5475
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:46,149
really weird since we've got up here.
Everyone's got scared.

5476
01:57:46,149 --> 01:57:46,159

 

5477
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:47,990

Yeah. Really slow. It's re It's so

5478
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:48,000
Yeah. Really slow. It's re It's so
 

5479
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,950
Yeah. Really slow. It's re It's so
weird. It's so weird. Like the book's

5480
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:50,960
weird. It's so weird. Like the book's
 

5481
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:53,589
weird. It's so weird. Like the book's
just stopped.

5482
01:57:53,589 --> 01:57:53,599
just stopped.
 

5483
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:55,430
just stopped.
Like that player at 400 left and then

5484
01:57:55,430 --> 01:57:55,440
Like that player at 400 left and then
 

5485
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,510
Like that player at 400 left and then
No, like no one's come on. I'm like

5486
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:57,520
No, like no one's come on. I'm like
 

5487
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,950
No, like no one's come on. I'm like
literally watching the book and it's

5488
01:57:58,950 --> 01:57:58,960
literally watching the book and it's
 

5489
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,430
literally watching the book and it's
still there's a guy flashing at 1875

5490
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:01,440
still there's a guy flashing at 1875
 

5491
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,629
still there's a guy flashing at 1875
now. So he's trying to get a pull back

5492
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:02,639
now. So he's trying to get a pull back
 

5493
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:06,550
now. So he's trying to get a pull back
to 1875 and he's moving down. What is

5494
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:06,560

Buyers come back in at 75 again. So 300

5548
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:16,159
Buyers come back in at 75 again. So 300
 

5549

Buyers come back in at 75 again. So 300
lot trying to support the bid at 75 and

5550
01:59:18,070 --> 01:59:18,080
lot trying to support the bid at 75 and
 

5551
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:20,709
lot trying to support the bid at 75 and
80s. Sellers at 410. That's your

5552
01:59:20,709 --> 01:59:20,719
80s. Sellers at 410. That's your
 

5553
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:23,189
80s. Sellers at 410. That's your
rotation at the moment.

5554
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:23,199
rotation at the moment.
 

5555
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:25,109
rotation at the moment.
I wouldn't be surprised if you do break

5556
01:59:25,109 --> 01:59:25,119
I wouldn't be surprised if you do break
 

5557
01:59:25,119 --> 01:59:28,229
I wouldn't be surprised if you do break
high of day to see 410 pool. Maybe they

5558
01:59:28,229 --> 01:59:28,239
high of day to see 410 pool. Maybe they
 

5559
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:31,990
high of day to see 410 pool. Maybe they
check the fundamentals.

5560
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,000

 

5561
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,790

You never know. I mean, I I my feeling

5562
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:34,800
You never know. I mean, I I my feeling
 

5563
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,149
You never know. I mean, I I my feeling
is we're going to drive higher for them

5564
01:59:36,149 --> 01:59:36,159
is we're going to drive higher for them
 

5565
01:59:36,159 --> 01:59:38,149
is we're going to drive higher for them
to resell it JD. Uh not necessarily now,

5566
01:59:38,149 --> 01:59:38,159
to resell it JD. Uh not necessarily now,
 

5567
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:42,070
to resell it JD. Uh not necessarily now,
but just in general

5568
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:42,080

 

5569
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,550

right, between tonight and tomorrow.

5572
01:59:47,589 --> 01:59:47,599
right, between tonight and tomorrow.
 

5573
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:49,510
right, between tonight and tomorrow.
I think I I wonder if that all got

5574
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520
I think I I wonder if that all got
 

5575
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:50,870
I think I I wonder if that all got
priced in though. Everyone's so

5576
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:50,880
priced in though. Everyone's so
 

5577
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,669
priced in though. Everyone's so
concerned about it, including myself.

5578
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:53,679
concerned about it, including myself.
 

5579
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,350
concerned about it, including myself.
But we'll see. What's going to be

5580
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:55,360
But we'll see. What's going to be
 

5581
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:57,350
But we'll see. What's going to be
interesting is

5582
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:57,360
interesting is
 

5583
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:01,189
interesting is
do they start selling uh US assets and

5584
02:00:01,189 --> 02:00:01,199
do they start selling uh US assets and
 

5585
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:02,709
do they start selling uh US assets and
does that cause a liquidity problem

5586
02:00:02,709 --> 02:00:02,719
does that cause a liquidity problem
 

5587
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:04,470
does that cause a liquidity problem
where we get a cascade or have we

5588
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:04,480
where we get a cascade or have we
 

5589
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:18,950
where we get a cascade or have we
started pricing that in already.

5590
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:18,960

 

5591
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,950

It's trying. It's desperately trying it.

5592
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:20,960
It's trying. It's desperately trying it.
 

5593
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:22,310
It's trying. It's desperately trying it.
It's desperately trying it. I think

5594
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:22,320
It's desperately trying it. I think
 

5595
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,750
It's desperately trying it. I think
you're going to get it. I think you're

5596
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:23,760
you're going to get it. I think you're
 

5597
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:40,229
you're going to get it. I think you're
going to get it.

5598
02:00:40,229 --> 02:00:40,239

this guy at 410's real. I'm going to bet

5604
02:00:46,629 --> 02:00:46,639
this guy at 410's real. I'm going to bet
 

5605
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:48,950
this guy at 410's real. I'm going to bet
he's not.

5606
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:48,960
he's not.
 

5607
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,910
he's not.
I'm going to bet he pulls.

5608
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:51,920
I'm going to bet he pulls.
 

5609
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:54,870
I'm going to bet he pulls.
could be wrong, but I don't think he's

5610
02:00:54,870 --> 02:00:54,880
could be wrong, but I don't think he's
 

5611
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,229
could be wrong, but I don't think he's
real. Every time we've seen that size

5612
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
real. Every time we've seen that size
 

5613
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:58,950
real. Every time we've seen that size
today, he's left. So, few people front

5614
02:00:58,950 --> 02:00:58,960
today, he's left. So, few people front
 

5615
02:00:58,960 --> 02:00:59,990
today, he's left. So, few people front
running him because they're worried

5616
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:00,000
running him because they're worried
 

5617
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,790
running him because they're worried
because it's massive size.

5618
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:02,800
because it's massive size.
 

5619
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,950
because it's massive size.

bit of a blue sky scenario. But that is

5632
02:01:24,709 --> 02:01:24,719
bit of a blue sky scenario. But that is
 

5633
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:26,310
bit of a blue sky scenario. But that is
a legit seller up there trying to unload

to get back above 410 because you have
 

5649
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:44,470
to get back above 410 because you have
565 lot buy side on the market filled

5650
02:01:44,470 --> 02:01:44,480
565 lot buy side on the market filled
 

5651
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,109
565 lot buy side on the market filled
there. Okay. So, if you don't hold a bid

5652
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:47,119
there. Okay. So, if you don't hold a bid
 

5653
02:01:47,119 --> 02:01:48,790
there. Okay. So, if you don't hold a bid
above that now, that will be a pain

5654
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:48,800
above that now, that will be a pain
 

5655
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,149
above that now, that will be a pain
point for those buyers. But you look

5656
02:01:50,149 --> 02:01:50,159
point for those buyers. But you look
 

5657
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:52,229
point for those buyers. But you look
good for that rise up into 430. All the

5658
02:01:52,229 --> 02:01:52,239
good for that rise up into 430. All the
 

5659
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:53,750
good for that rise up into 430. All the
time they can hold above at the moment.

5660
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:53,760
time they can hold above at the moment.
 

5661
02:01:53,760 --> 02:02:05,510
time they can hold above at the moment.
That dance. He was legit.

5662
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:05,520

5669
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,430
name. Great name. All right, that 410
seller coming in. So buyers are

5670
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:13,440
seller coming in. So buyers are
 

5671
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:15,350
seller coming in. So buyers are
currently stuck up there at 410. All

5672
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:15,360
currently stuck up there at 410. All
 

5673
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:18,950
currently stuck up there at 410. All
right, that was a 560

5674
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:18,960
right, that was a 560
 

5675
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,550
right, that was a 560
odd lot. We can have a look at it on the

5676
02:02:20,550 --> 02:02:20,560
odd lot. We can have a look at it on the
 

5677
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:23,430
odd lot. We can have a look at it on the
book. I can zoom you in so you can see

5678
02:02:23,430 --> 02:02:23,440
book. I can zoom you in so you can see
 

5679
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,790
book. I can zoom you in so you can see
what I'm looking at. You better have

5680
02:02:24,790 --> 02:02:24,800
what I'm looking at. You better have
 

5681
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:27,510
what I'm looking at. You better have
taken profits into that. Okay, this

5682
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:27,520
taken profits into that. Okay, this
 

5683
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,550
taken profits into that. Okay, this
participant right here, 652 lot. All

5684
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:30,560
participant right here, 652 lot. All
 

5685
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:33,270
participant right here, 652 lot. All
right, we sold into him. He's he's the

5686
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:33,280
right, we sold into him. He's he's the
 

5687
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,830
right, we sold into him. He's he's the
pain point right now. So bulls, the big

5688
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:35,840
pain point right now. So bulls, the big
 

5689
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:39,109
pain point right now. So bulls, the big
bull I would say is stuck here. All

5690
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:39,119
bull I would say is stuck here. All
 

5691
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:40,709
bull I would say is stuck here. All
right, and definitely stuck top side of

5692
02:02:40,709 --> 02:02:40,719
right, and definitely stuck top side of
 

5693
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:42,390
right, and definitely stuck top side of
that. And if we move to the delta, you

5694
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:42,400
that. And if we move to the delta, you
 

5695
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,470
that. And if we move to the delta, you
can see it here like a sore thumb. 410

5696
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:44,480
can see it here like a sore thumb. 410
 

5697
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:47,430
can see it here like a sore thumb. 410
564 lot buy side. All right, huge. Look

5698
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:47,440
564 lot buy side. All right, huge. Look
 

5699
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,270
564 lot buy side. All right, huge. Look
at the volume. Look at the spike. All

5700
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:49,280
at the volume. Look at the spike. All
 

5701
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,109
at the volume. Look at the spike. All
right, until you get above that,

5702
02:02:51,109 --> 02:02:51,119
right, until you get above that,
 

5703
02:02:51,119 --> 02:02:53,510
right, until you get above that,
everyone who got bullish up there, as in

5704
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:53,520
everyone who got bullish up there, as in
 

5705
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:57,109
everyone who got bullish up there, as in
all 564 of them and the 161 lot below

5706
02:02:57,109 --> 02:02:57,119
all 564 of them and the 161 lot below
 

5707
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:59,990
all 564 of them and the 161 lot below
are all stuck. All right, they are stuck

5708
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,000
are all stuck. All right, they are stuck
 

5709
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,390
are all stuck. All right, they are stuck
now. So, it might be that that is the

5710
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:02,400
now. So, it might be that that is the
 

5711
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,470
now. So, it might be that that is the
end of the auction. We will see. But I

5712
02:03:04,470 --> 02:03:04,480
end of the auction. We will see. But I
 

5713
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:06,950
end of the auction. We will see. But I
would be probably done with this at this

5714
02:03:06,950 --> 02:03:06,960
would be probably done with this at this
 

5715
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:12,149
would be probably done with this at this
point.

5716
02:03:12,149 --> 02:03:12,159

 

5717
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:14,390

No, not sell like well take your profits

5718
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:14,400
No, not sell like well take your profits
 

5719
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:17,430
No, not sell like well take your profits
now but not short sell now. Not short

5720
02:03:17,430 --> 02:03:17,440
now but not short sell now. Not short
 

5721
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,350
now but not short sell now. Not short
sell now.

5722
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,360
sell now.
 

5723
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,189
sell now.
I wouldn't be short selling against at

5724
02:03:21,189 --> 02:03:21,199
I wouldn't be short selling against at
 

5725
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:24,229
I wouldn't be short selling against at
like into this yet. I would for me we

5726
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:24,239
like into this yet. I would for me we
 

5727
02:03:24,239 --> 02:03:25,830
like into this yet. I would for me we
would need to leave leave this and you

5728
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:25,840
would need to leave leave this and you
 

5729
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,990
would need to leave leave this and you
still have this here, right? So maybe if

5730
02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:28,000
still have this here, right? So maybe if
 

5731
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,669
still have this here, right? So maybe if
you're looking for a return back into

5732
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
you're looking for a return back into
 

5733
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,270
you're looking for a return back into
just here or you're looking if we leave

5734
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:31,280
just here or you're looking if we leave
 

5735
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:35,109
just here or you're looking if we leave
that and a return into here. But uh

5736
02:03:35,109 --> 02:03:35,119
that and a return into here. But uh
 

5737
02:03:35,119 --> 02:03:37,109
that and a return into here. But uh
technically we're not going to go on a

5738
02:03:37,109 --> 02:03:37,119
technically we're not going to go on a
 

5739
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,629
technically we're not going to go on a
short rotation until we get under all of

5740
02:03:38,629 --> 02:03:38,639
short rotation until we get under all of
 

5741
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:40,390
short rotation until we get under all of
this. So this is just a pullback

5742
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:40,400
this. So this is just a pullback
 

5743
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,870
this. So this is just a pullback
intraday, right?

5744
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:42,880
intraday, right?
 

5745
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:45,189
intraday, right?
Intraday. But yes, if I was long from

5746
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:45,199
Intraday. But yes, if I was long from
 

5747
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:46,790
Intraday. But yes, if I was long from
this dip, I would be selling into that

5748
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:46,800
this dip, I would be selling into that
 

5749
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:53,430
this dip, I would be selling into that
move. Hopefully that makes sense.

5750
02:03:53,430 --> 02:03:53,440

 

5751
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,830

Like it's hard for me when you say sell

5752
02:03:55,830 --> 02:03:55,840
Like it's hard for me when you say sell
 

5753
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,990
Like it's hard for me when you say sell
now. Let me know what you mean. Do you

5754
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:58,000
now. Let me know what you mean. Do you
 

5755
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,669
now. Let me know what you mean. Do you
mean are you short selling now? And I

5756
02:03:59,669 --> 02:03:59,679
mean are you short selling now? And I
 

5757
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:01,750
mean are you short selling now? And I
also like I need to understand what type

5758
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:01,760
also like I need to understand what type
 

5759
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,109
also like I need to understand what type
of trade you're looking for. If you're

5760
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:03,119
of trade you're looking for. If you're
 

5761
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:05,109
of trade you're looking for. If you're
looking for a scalp back into support,

5762
02:04:05,109 --> 02:04:05,119
looking for a scalp back into support,
 

5763
02:04:05,119 --> 02:04:07,189
looking for a scalp back into support,
sure. If you're looking for an actual

5764
02:04:07,189 --> 02:04:07,199
sure. If you're looking for an actual
 

5765
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:17,030
sure. If you're looking for an actual
breakdown of structure, no.

5766
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:17,040

 

5767
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:21,350

Really?

5768
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:21,360

 

5769
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,430

[\h__\h] hell.

5770
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:23,440
[\h__\h] hell.
 

5771
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:26,790
[\h__\h] hell.
Uh that is the hedge against tonight.

5772
02:04:26,790 --> 02:04:26,800
Uh that is the hedge against tonight.
 

5773
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,510
Uh that is the hedge against tonight.

This Let me check the daily as well. Did
 

5775
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:31,510

Absolutely. What a flipping move. You're

5796
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:54,880
Absolutely. What a flipping move. You're
 

5797
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,790
Absolutely. What a flipping move. You're
right, though. That's why it went quiet.

5798
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:56,800
right, though. That's why it went quiet.
 

5799
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,629
right, though. That's why it went quiet.
Everyone, everyone was like, "Okay, long

Everyone, everyone was like, "Okay, long

Everyone, everyone was like, "Okay, long

Wow. Good eyes there, uh, Peter. Thank

5810
02:05:11,669 --> 02:05:11,679

 

5811
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:13,669

Got you, Joe. Okay, cool. Good. Good to

5814
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:16,000
know. Good to know.
 

5815
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,070
know. Good to know.
So, this gray box is where the volume

5816
02:05:18,070 --> 02:05:18,080
So, this gray box is where the volume
 

5817
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:20,149
So, this gray box is where the volume
was created. Uh, all I'd say is look,

5818
02:05:20,149 --> 02:05:20,159
was created. Uh, all I'd say is look,
 

5819
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:21,990
was created. Uh, all I'd say is look,
all the time we're holding this, bulls

5820
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:22,000
all the time we're holding this, bulls
 

5821
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,589
all the time we're holding this, bulls
still have a chance, but like like we've

5822
02:05:23,589 --> 02:05:23,599
still have a chance, but like like we've
 

5823
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:25,750
still have a chance, but like like we've
talked about. Late bulls are currently

5824
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:25,760
talked about. Late bulls are currently
 

5825
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:27,510
talked about. Late bulls are currently
stuck up here. All right, late bulls

5826
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:27,520
stuck up here. All right, late bulls
 

5827
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,750
stuck up here. All right, late bulls
with big size are stuck up here. This is

5828
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:29,760
with big size are stuck up here. This is
 

5829
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,830
with big size are stuck up here. This is
the rotation where we built and broke

5830
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:31,840
the rotation where we built and broke
 

5831
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:33,510
the rotation where we built and broke
out from. If you lose this, this is

5832
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:33,520
out from. If you lose this, this is
 

5833
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,709
out from. If you lose this, this is
what's going to be really hard. Now, if

5834
02:05:34,709 --> 02:05:34,719
what's going to be really hard. Now, if
 

5835
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:35,990
what's going to be really hard. Now, if
you're looking for short, if you lose

5836
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:36,000
you're looking for short, if you lose
 

5837
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,910
you're looking for short, if you lose
this, you have IB high value area high,

5838
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:39,920
this, you have IB high value area high,
 

5839
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:42,390
this, you have IB high value area high,
current weak profile, point of control.

5840
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:42,400
current weak profile, point of control.
 

5841
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,550
current weak profile, point of control.
So, it's very likely that they find a

5842
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:44,560
So, it's very likely that they find a
 

5843
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:47,030
So, it's very likely that they find a
bid here. We don't go back into

5844
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:47,040
bid here. We don't go back into
 

5845
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,350
bid here. We don't go back into
rotational short until you lose that.

5846
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:49,360
rotational short until you lose that.
 

5847
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:50,790
rotational short until you lose that.
Right? That's what's going to be hard

5848
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:50,800
Right? That's what's going to be hard
 

5849
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,910
Right? That's what's going to be hard
about looking for shorts today, right?

5850
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:53,920
about looking for shorts today, right?
 

5851
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,109
about looking for shorts today, right?
Until you lose this, right? And then

5852
02:05:57,109 --> 02:05:57,119
Until you lose this, right? And then
 

5853
02:05:57,119 --> 02:06:08,602
Until you lose this, right? And then
maybe you repric this whole thing, but

5854
02:06:08,602 --> 02:06:08,612

 

5855
02:06:08,612 --> 02:06:23,830

[snorts]

5856
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:23,840

 

5857
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:26,550

I'm on the downside minus 700. Any

5858
02:06:26,550 --> 02:06:26,560
I'm on the downside minus 700. Any
 

5859
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,229
I'm on the downside minus 700. Any
recommended scalp trades

5860
02:06:30,229 --> 02:06:30,239
recommended scalp trades
 

5861
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:33,510
recommended scalp trades
for me? The setup is still bullish. Um,

5862
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:33,520
for me? The setup is still bullish. Um,
 

5863
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:35,109
for me? The setup is still bullish. Um,
but we know we've got players stuck. See

5864
02:06:35,109 --> 02:06:35,119
but we know we've got players stuck. See
 

5865
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:36,709
but we know we've got players stuck. See
that gray box held? Again, this is what

5866
02:06:36,709 --> 02:06:36,719
that gray box held? Again, this is what
 

5867
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:38,310
that gray box held? Again, this is what
I'm saying about the most you're going

5868
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:38,320
I'm saying about the most you're going
 

5869
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:39,990
I'm saying about the most you're going
to get is a scout down to here until we

5870
02:06:39,990 --> 02:06:40,000
to get is a scout down to here until we
 

5871
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,790
to get is a scout down to here until we
let go of it. So,

5872
02:06:42,790 --> 02:06:42,800
let go of it. So,
 

5873
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:46,149
let go of it. So,
You know,

5874
02:06:46,149 --> 02:06:46,159

 

5875
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:47,510

you can only play what's in front of

5876
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:47,520
you can only play what's in front of
 

5877
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,350
you can only play what's in front of
you. That like you've got to ignore what

5878
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:49,360
you. That like you've got to ignore what
 

5879
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,350
you. That like you've got to ignore what
you're up or you're down. Try and take

5880
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:51,360
you're up or you're down. Try and take
 

5881
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,030
you're up or you're down. Try and take
that out of your trading equation. All

5882
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:53,040
that out of your trading equation. All
 

5883
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:55,910
that out of your trading equation. All
that actually matters is is the volume,

5884
02:06:55,910 --> 02:06:55,920
that actually matters is is the volume,
 

5885
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,669
that actually matters is is the volume,
the price, the setup in front of you.

5886
02:06:57,669 --> 02:06:57,679
the price, the setup in front of you.
 

5887
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:01,910
the price, the setup in front of you.
Nothing else actually matters.

5888
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:01,920

 

5889
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:08,069

Caught shorts there again.

5890
02:07:08,069 --> 02:07:08,079

 

5891
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:10,550

Right. These guys are offside. Tra it

5892
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:10,560
Right. These guys are offside. Tra it
 

5893
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:12,310
Right. These guys are offside. Tra it
back into this guy. This guy. This guy.

5894
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:12,320
back into this guy. This guy. This guy.
 

5895
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:14,790
back into this guy. This guy. This guy.
Caught a bid. That's the gray box. The

5896
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:14,800
Caught a bid. That's the gray box. The
 

5897
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,270
Caught a bid. That's the gray box. The
big bull guy is stuck up here. If we get

5898
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:17,280
big bull guy is stuck up here. If we get
 

5899
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:19,430
big bull guy is stuck up here. If we get
back over him, he's going to be very

5900
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:19,440
back over him, he's going to be very
 

5901
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:22,069
back over him, he's going to be very
comfortable with all that size.

5902
02:07:22,069 --> 02:07:22,079
comfortable with all that size.
 

5903
02:07:22,079 --> 02:07:23,350
comfortable with all that size.
I'm going to use the bathroom here,

5904
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:23,360
I'm going to use the bathroom here,
 

5905
02:07:23,360 --> 02:09:06,069
I'm going to use the bathroom here,
folks. I will be right back.

5906
02:09:06,069 --> 02:09:06,079

 

5907
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:07,510

We're still building out here. Still

5908
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
We're still building out here. Still
 

5909
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:10,310
We're still building out here. Still
above the gray box. They still trying to

5910
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:10,320
above the gray box. They still trying to
 

5911
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,390
above the gray box. They still trying to
come and test up that player we had on

5912
02:09:12,390 --> 02:09:12,400
come and test up that player we had on
 

5913
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:14,390
come and test up that player we had on
the map. All these guys were stuck from

5914
02:09:14,390 --> 02:09:14,400
the map. All these guys were stuck from
 

5915
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:20,709
the map. All these guys were stuck from
405 to 410.

5916
02:09:20,709 --> 02:09:20,719

 

5917
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,470

I don't know if you guys are are

5918
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:24,480
I don't know if you guys are are
 

5919
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,550
I don't know if you guys are are
I can't tell because you're text you're

I can't tell because you're text you're
 

5921
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,709
I can't tell because you're text you're
writing it like if you guys are serious

5922
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:28,719
writing it like if you guys are serious
 

5923
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:34,149
writing it like if you guys are serious
or not. Any any comments on top? I mean

5924
02:09:34,149 --> 02:09:34,159
or not. Any any comments on top? I mean
 

5925
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:35,750
or not. Any any comments on top? I mean
my comments been the same as it has for

5926
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:35,760
my comments been the same as it has for
 

5927
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:38,470
my comments been the same as it has for
a long time. Don't trade with them.

5928
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:38,480
a long time. Don't trade with them.
 

5929
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:43,830
a long time. Don't trade with them.
Simple as that.

5930
02:09:43,830 --> 02:09:43,840

 

5931
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:46,229

Yeah. Live every day. Monday to Friday,

02:09:46,229 --> 02:09:46,239
Yeah. Live every day. Monday to Friday,
 

5933
02:09:46,239 --> 02:09:55,589
Yeah. Live every day. Monday to Friday,
9:15 Eastern, we start.

5934
02:09:55,589 --> 02:09:55,599

 

5935
02:09:55,599 --> 02:09:57,910

How much I'm up or down dictates my risk

5936
02:09:57,910 --> 02:09:57,920
How much I'm up or down dictates my risk
 

5937
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:00,709
How much I'm up or down dictates my risk
size. How choosy I am. If I'm down,

5938
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:00,719
size. How choosy I am. If I'm down,
 

5939
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:04,310
size. How choosy I am. If I'm down,
market size, if I'm up or stay until I

5940
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:04,320
market size, if I'm up or stay until I
 

5941
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:05,910
market size, if I'm up or stay until I
see a Well, that makes sense in

5942
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:05,920
see a Well, that makes sense in
 

5943
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,510
see a Well, that makes sense in
fairness, Joe. That does make sense.

5944
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:07,520
fairness, Joe. That does make sense.
 

5945
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:09,589
fairness, Joe. That does make sense.
You'll risk that does make sense.

5946
02:10:09,589 --> 02:10:09,599
You'll risk that does make sense.
 

5947
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:10,790
You'll risk that does make sense.
Aggressive when you're trading well and

5948
02:10:10,790 --> 02:10:10,800
Aggressive when you're trading well and
 

5949
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,069
Aggressive when you're trading well and
you've built a buffer. That does make

5950
02:10:12,069 --> 02:10:12,079
you've built a buffer. That does make
 

5951
02:10:12,079 --> 02:10:20,069
you've built a buffer. That does make
sense.

5952
02:10:20,069 --> 02:10:20,079

 

5953
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:21,910

Do I use a separate feed for bookmap

5954
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:21,920
Do I use a separate feed for bookmap
 

5955
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:25,189
Do I use a separate feed for bookmap
that shows level two? Um, well, I use

5956
02:10:25,189 --> 02:10:25,199
that shows level two? Um, well, I use
 

5957
02:10:25,199 --> 02:10:32,550
that shows level two? Um, well, I use
their data feed. I pay for it.

5958
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:32,560

 

5959
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:34,069

For the education question, I have a

5960
02:10:34,069 --> 02:10:34,079
For the education question, I have a
 

5961
02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:36,310
For the education question, I have a
good base knowledge of tech analysis,

5962
02:10:36,310 --> 02:10:36,320
good base knowledge of tech analysis,
 

5963
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:37,910
good base knowledge of tech analysis,
but it seems like I need to learn more

5964
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:37,920
but it seems like I need to learn more
 

5965
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:40,629
but it seems like I need to learn more
about auction theory.

5966
02:10:40,629 --> 02:10:40,639
about auction theory.
 

5967
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:43,750
about auction theory.

5970
02:10:49,589 --> 02:10:49,599

 

5971
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:53,350

Mr. Error has come back. When did that

5972
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:53,360
Mr. Error has come back. When did that
 

5973
02:10:53,360 --> 02:11:00,069
Mr. Error has come back. When did that
start? It's completely out the blue.

5974
02:11:00,069 --> 02:11:00,079

 

5975
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:04,470

[\h__\h] mate.

5976

5977
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:06,950

What the f?

5978
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:06,960
What the f?
 

5979
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:09,350
What the f?
What the fudge?

5980
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:09,360
What the fudge?
 

5981
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,030
What the fudge?
I'll do that update after today. I don't

5982
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:11,040
I'll do that update after today. I don't
 

5983
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:11,990
I'll do that update after today. I don't
think I'm going to take another trade

5984
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:12,000
think I'm going to take another trade
 

5985
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,990
think I'm going to take another trade
now. Anyway,

02:11:13,990 --> 02:11:14,000
now. Anyway,
 

5987
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,350
now. Anyway,
that's pretty annoying. It's been

5988
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:15,360
that's pretty annoying. It's been
 

5989
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:31,430
that's pretty annoying. It's been
running really nice all morning.

5990
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:31,440

 

5991
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,189

What is the rainbow chart on the top

5992
02:11:33,189 --> 02:11:33,199
What is the rainbow chart on the top
 

5993
02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:37,189
What is the rainbow chart on the top
right of the screen?

5994
02:11:37,189 --> 02:11:37,199

 

5995
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:41,030

This is part of the flow zone pro.

5996
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:41,040
This is part of the flow zone pro.
 

5997
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:42,629
This is part of the flow zone pro.
All right. So, just a quick reference

5998
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:42,639
All right. So, just a quick reference
 

5999
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:44,149
All right. So, just a quick reference
tells you sentiment right now. Higher

6000
02:11:44,149 --> 02:11:44,159
tells you sentiment right now. Higher
 

6001
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:45,910
tells you sentiment right now. Higher
time frame is trying to move higher.

6002
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:45,920
time frame is trying to move higher.
 

6003
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,589
time frame is trying to move higher.
Lower time frames trying to move higher.

6004
02:11:47,589 --> 02:11:47,599
Lower time frames trying to move higher.
 

6005
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:49,589
Lower time frames trying to move higher.
Alignment is for upside moves. So, if

6006
02:11:49,589 --> 02:11:49,599
Alignment is for upside moves. So, if
 

6007
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:51,750
Alignment is for upside moves. So, if
you're trying to play a bearish move,

6008
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:51,760
you're trying to play a bearish move,
 

6009
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,270
you're trying to play a bearish move,
you're fighting against that until it

6010
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:53,280
you're fighting against that until it
 

6011
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:59,910
you're fighting against that until it
flips.

6012
02:11:59,910 --> 02:11:59,920

 

6013
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,669

Alex, I'm on ES. I'm looking for the

6014
02:12:01,669 --> 02:12:01,679
Alex, I'm on ES. I'm looking for the
 

6015
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:05,030
Alex, I'm on ES. I'm looking for the
test of IB. If it holds, then the long

6016
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:05,040
test of IB. If it holds, then the long
 

6017
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:07,030
test of IB. If it holds, then the long
back up for a scalp sounds like a good

6018
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:07,040
back up for a scalp sounds like a good
 

6019
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:11,750
back up for a scalp sounds like a good
plan. Where's your IB?

6020
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:11,760
plan. Where's your IB?
 

6021
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:12,950
plan. Where's your IB?
Yeah, you've got a bit of structure

6022
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:12,960
Yeah, you've got a bit of structure
 

6023
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:15,990
Yeah, you've got a bit of structure
below. So, your IB is at 55s. So, I'd

6024
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:16,000
below. So, your IB is at 55s. So, I'd
 

6025
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,790
below. So, your IB is at 55s. So, I'd
say 55s to 48. So, you've got 5day

6026
02:12:18,790 --> 02:12:18,800
say 55s to 48. So, you've got 5day
 

6027
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:21,350
say 55s to 48. So, you've got 5day
moving average, initial balance, uh New

6028
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:21,360
moving average, initial balance, uh New
 

6029
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:24,149
moving average, initial balance, uh New
York VWAP, and your pivot from your sort

6030
02:12:24,149 --> 02:12:24,159
York VWAP, and your pivot from your sort
 

6031
02:12:24,159 --> 02:12:26,069
York VWAP, and your pivot from your sort
of 10:00 a.m. high and morning drive

6032
02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:26,079
of 10:00 a.m. high and morning drive
 

6033
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:27,910
of 10:00 a.m. high and morning drive
high. So, that whole area needs to hold

6034
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:27,920
high. So, that whole area needs to hold
 

6035
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:29,830
high. So, that whole area needs to hold
and be absorbed.

6036
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:29,840
and be absorbed.
 

6037
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,790
and be absorbed.
Um the one thing I'd just be aware of is

6038
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:32,800
Um the one thing I'd just be aware of is
 

6039
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:35,990
Um the one thing I'd just be aware of is
the spy. All right, we we keep wicking

6040
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,000
the spy. All right, we we keep wicking
 

6041
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,990
the spy. All right, we we keep wicking
the previous day high. cannot get above

6042
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:38,000
the previous day high. cannot get above
 

6043
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,750
the previous day high. cannot get above
it and you're into a supply zone on the

6044
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:39,760
it and you're into a supply zone on the
 

6045
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:43,990
it and you're into a supply zone on the
spy. So just be aware of that.

6046
02:12:43,990 --> 02:12:44,000
spy. So just be aware of that.
 

6047
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,910
spy. So just be aware of that.
Don't all I'm saying don't be expecting

6048
02:12:45,910 --> 02:12:45,920
Don't all I'm saying don't be expecting
 

6049
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:48,069
Don't all I'm saying don't be expecting
too much more upside today. If we end up

6050
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:48,079
too much more upside today. If we end up
 

6051
02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:49,750
too much more upside today. If we end up
like breaking out and going upside it's

6052
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
like breaking out and going upside it's
 

6053
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:52,310
like breaking out and going upside it's
great but don't expect it because our

6054
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:52,320
great but don't expect it because our
 

6055
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:54,790
great but don't expect it because our
expectation today remember was a range

6056
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:54,800
expectation today remember was a range
 

6057
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,669
expectation today remember was a range
rotation. If we get more than that great

6058
02:12:57,669 --> 02:12:57,679
rotation. If we get more than that great
 

6059
02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:00,629
rotation. If we get more than that great
expectation was a range rotation.

6060
02:13:00,629 --> 02:13:00,639
expectation was a range rotation.
 

6061
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:02,870
expectation was a range rotation.
I'm going to have to [\h__\h] close Ninja

6062
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:02,880
I'm going to have to [\h__\h] close Ninja
 

6063
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:06,310
I'm going to have to [\h__\h] close Ninja
and restart this. This is pretty

6064
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:06,320
and restart this. This is pretty
 

6065
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:11,669
and restart this. This is pretty
upsetting here.

6066
02:13:11,669 --> 02:13:11,679

 

6067
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:13,910

Let's try this again. See if we can get

6068
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:13,920
Let's try this again. See if we can get
 

6069
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:17,189
Let's try this again. See if we can get
that five minute chart working.

6070
02:13:17,189 --> 02:13:17,199
that five minute chart working.
 

6071
02:13:17,199 --> 02:13:18,709
that five minute chart working.
Was fine all morning. I just looked over

6072
02:13:18,709 --> 02:13:18,719
Was fine all morning. I just looked over
 

6073
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:21,189
Was fine all morning. I just looked over
now and it's bathroom break obviously

6074
02:13:21,189 --> 02:13:21,199
now and it's bathroom break obviously
 

6075
02:13:21,199 --> 02:13:22,870
now and it's bathroom break obviously
ruined it. Back to this gray box again.

6076
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:22,880
ruined it. Back to this gray box again.
 

6077
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:25,030
ruined it. Back to this gray box again.
So if you lose this, you've got those

6078
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:25,040
So if you lose this, you've got those
 

6079
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:27,510
So if you lose this, you've got those
levels below. For me, there's I lack

6080
02:13:27,510 --> 02:13:27,520
levels below. For me, there's I lack
 

6081
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:28,950
levels below. For me, there's I lack
edge in this market right now. So it's a

6082
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:28,960
edge in this market right now. So it's a
 

6083
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:40,950
edge in this market right now. So it's a
leave alone for me at this moment.

6084
02:13:40,950 --> 02:13:40,960

 

6085
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,709

I think it's better for Ninja Trader. I

6086
02:13:42,709 --> 02:13:42,719
I think it's better for Ninja Trader. I
 

6087
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:57,510
I think it's better for Ninja Trader. I
think Ninja Trader is cleaner for it.

6088
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:57,520

 

6089
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,270

It's [\h__\h]

6090
02:13:59,270 --> 02:13:59,280
It's [\h__\h]
 

6091
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:06,069
It's [\h__\h]
Absolutely [\h__\h] it. Two days in a row.

6092
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:06,079

 

6093
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:21,669

I have to build a new chart.

6094
02:14:21,669 --> 02:14:21,679

 

6095
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:31,270

How can I do that?

6096
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:31,280

 

6097
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:32,550

Sorry folks, I'm just trying to think

6098
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:32,560
Sorry folks, I'm just trying to think
 

6099
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:34,310
Sorry folks, I'm just trying to think
out loud how I'm going to do this. Um,

6100
02:14:34,310 --> 02:14:34,320
out loud how I'm going to do this. Um,
 

6101
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:37,430
out loud how I'm going to do this. Um,
this what I had to do the other night.

6102
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:37,440
this what I had to do the other night.
 

6103
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:42,310
this what I had to do the other night.
Duplicate.

6104
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:42,320

 

6105
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:45,270

Do I have one here?

6106
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:45,280
Do I have one here?
 

6107
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:58,470
Do I have one here?
Still holding that gray box.

6108
02:14:58,470 --> 02:14:58,480

 

6109
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:01,430

Uh, I can sell like it's an awkward

6110
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:01,440
Uh, I can sell like it's an awkward
 

6111
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:04,390
Uh, I can sell like it's an awkward
question. Um, yes, my my course is all

6112
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:04,400
question. Um, yes, my my course is all
 

6113
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:07,750
question. Um, yes, my my course is all
you need for sure, but I'm sure there's

6114
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:07,760
you need for sure, but I'm sure there's
 

6115
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:09,350
you need for sure, but I'm sure there's
plenty of other people out there who are

6116
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:09,360
plenty of other people out there who are
 

6117
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:13,510
plenty of other people out there who are
also really good. I don't want to um,

6118
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:13,520
also really good. I don't want to um,
 

6119
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:15,430
also really good. I don't want to um,
you know, oversell.

6120
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:15,440
you know, oversell.
 

6121
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:17,270
you know, oversell.
Yeah, I just launched a new course. It's

6122
02:15:17,270 --> 02:15:17,280
Yeah, I just launched a new course. It's
 

6123
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:18,870
Yeah, I just launched a new course. It's
on sale right now because it's a launch

6124
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:18,880
on sale right now because it's a launch
 

6125
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:21,589
on sale right now because it's a launch
price. So, it's uh

6126
02:15:21,589 --> 02:15:21,599
price. So, it's uh
 

6127
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:24,950
price. So, it's uh
299 with code launch. Have to put it in

6128
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:24,960
299 with code launch. Have to put it in
 

6129
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:27,910
299 with code launch. Have to put it in
capitals. 299 with code launch. But it

6130
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:27,920
capitals. 299 with code launch. But it
 

6131
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:30,470
capitals. 299 with code launch. But it
everything's in there that you need.

6132
02:15:30,470 --> 02:15:30,480
everything's in there that you need.
 

6133
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:33,669
everything's in there that you need.
But again, no pressure.

6134
02:15:33,669 --> 02:15:33,679
But again, no pressure.
 

6135
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:38,149
But again, no pressure.
No pressure to do it.

6136
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,159

 

6137
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:39,589

Give me a second here, folks. I'm just

6138
02:15:39,589 --> 02:15:39,599
Give me a second here, folks. I'm just
 

6139
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:41,109
Give me a second here, folks. I'm just
trying to figure out if I can get this

6140
02:15:41,109 --> 02:15:41,119
trying to figure out if I can get this
 

6141
02:15:41,119 --> 02:15:57,189
trying to figure out if I can get this
uh five minute chart fixed.

6142
02:15:57,189 --> 02:15:57,199

 

6143
02:15:57,199 --> 02:15:58,950

still holding that gray box. You can see

6144
02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:58,960
still holding that gray box. You can see
 

6145
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:00,790
still holding that gray box. You can see
we're starting to build thicker and

6146
02:16:00,790 --> 02:16:00,800
we're starting to build thicker and
 

6147
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:02,310
we're starting to build thicker and
thicker volume. So, I'd be less and less

6148
02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:02,320
thicker volume. So, I'd be less and less
 

6149
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:04,229
thicker volume. So, I'd be less and less
interested to see how profiles now moved

6150
02:16:04,229 --> 02:16:04,239
interested to see how profiles now moved
 

6151
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:06,229
interested to see how profiles now moved
up as well. You want to be careful with

6152
02:16:06,229 --> 02:16:06,239
up as well. You want to be careful with
 

6153
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:08,229
up as well. You want to be careful with
this PC now. Everything's moving up. I

6154
02:16:08,229 --> 02:16:08,239
this PC now. Everything's moving up. I
 

6155
02:16:08,239 --> 02:16:09,589
this PC now. Everything's moving up. I
don't like this for buyers at the

6156
02:16:09,589 --> 02:16:09,599
don't like this for buyers at the
 

6157
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:11,350
don't like this for buyers at the
moment. I think it's getting more and

6158
02:16:11,350 --> 02:16:11,360
moment. I think it's getting more and
 

6159
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:16,149
moment. I think it's getting more and
more dangerous.

6160
02:16:16,149 --> 02:16:16,159

 

6161
02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:19,350

Uh Mo,

6162
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:19,360
Uh Mo,
 

6163
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:21,830
Uh Mo,
I I think you're still in chat. What I'm

6164
02:16:21,830 --> 02:16:21,840
I I think you're still in chat. What I'm
 

6165
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,589
I I think you're still in chat. What I'm
finding is when I build a new chart, it

6166
02:16:23,589 --> 02:16:23,599
finding is when I build a new chart, it
 

6167
02:16:23,599 --> 02:16:26,149
finding is when I build a new chart, it
gets rid of all those problems. Have you

6168
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:26,159
gets rid of all those problems. Have you
 

6169
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:34,950
gets rid of all those problems. Have you
had something like that happen?

6170
02:16:34,950 --> 02:16:34,960

 

6171
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:37,750

Try I think I've fixed it just by buying

6172
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:37,760
Try I think I've fixed it just by buying
 

6173
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:40,870
Try I think I've fixed it just by buying
a new chart each time.

6174
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:40,880
a new chart each time.
 

6175
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:51,270
a new chart each time.
Footprint. Okay. Yeah, that fixes it.

6176
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:51,280

 

6177
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:52,870

Only with other footprint indicators,

6178
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:52,880
Only with other footprint indicators,
 

6179
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:55,110
Only with other footprint indicators,
but not this one. But I reinstalled NT.

6180
02:16:55,110 --> 02:16:55,120
but not this one. But I reinstalled NT.
 

6181
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:57,830
but not this one. But I reinstalled NT.
Okay, you can see like keeps offering me

6182
02:16:57,830 --> 02:16:57,840
Okay, you can see like keeps offering me
 

6183
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:00,709
Okay, you can see like keeps offering me
this F5 update. I saw you messaging me

6184
02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:00,719
this F5 update. I saw you messaging me
 

6185
02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:01,910
this F5 update. I saw you messaging me
about that this morning. Maybe I was

6186
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:01,920
about that this morning. Maybe I was
 

6187
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:52,950
about that this morning. Maybe I was
going to have to get that figured out.

6188
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:52,960

 

6189
02:17:52,960 --> 02:18:00,790

doesn't like something.

6190
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:00,800

 

6191
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:02,309

Okay. So, coming back into this box,

6192
02:18:02,309 --> 02:18:02,319
Okay. So, coming back into this box,
 

6193
02:18:02,319 --> 02:18:03,750
Okay. So, coming back into this box,
you're starting, this is why I say I

6194
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:03,760
you're starting, this is why I say I
 

6195
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:04,950
you're starting, this is why I say I
don't like it. The more you visit it,

6196
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:04,960
don't like it. The more you visit it,
 

6197
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:06,790
don't like it. The more you visit it,
you're starting to build out this now.

6198
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:06,800
you're starting to build out this now.
 

6199
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:09,910
you're starting to build out this now.
That's going to become a problem.

6200
02:18:09,910 --> 02:18:09,920
That's going to become a problem.
 

6201
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:12,549
That's going to become a problem.
And we're into thin levels. So, it's

6202
02:18:12,549 --> 02:18:12,559
And we're into thin levels. So, it's
 

6203
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:13,910
And we're into thin levels. So, it's
looking more and more ugly by the

6204
02:18:13,910 --> 02:18:13,920
looking more and more ugly by the
 

6205
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:31,349
looking more and more ugly by the
second. I would say this right now.

6206
02:18:31,349 --> 02:18:31,359

 

6207
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:32,950

Wonder if it's a data issue or

6208
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:32,960
Wonder if it's a data issue or
 

6209
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:38,070
Wonder if it's a data issue or
something.

6210
02:18:38,070 --> 02:18:38,080

 

6211
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:40,709

Series.

6212
02:18:40,709 --> 02:18:40,719
Series.
 

6213
02:18:40,719 --> 02:18:53,589
Series.
Sorry team. Bear with me. Bear with me.

6214
02:18:53,589 --> 02:18:53,599

 

6215
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:55,270

There we go. I think it's a data series

6216
02:18:55,270 --> 02:18:55,280
There we go. I think it's a data series
 

6217
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:58,549
There we go. I think it's a data series
issue. If there's too much

6218
02:18:58,549 --> 02:18:58,559
issue. If there's too much
 

6219
02:18:58,559 --> 02:19:00,389
issue. If there's too much
uh if if I have too much data series,

6220
02:19:00,389 --> 02:19:00,399
uh if if I have too much data series,
 

6221
02:19:00,399 --> 02:19:04,230
uh if if I have too much data series,
too much going back, it's a problem.

6222
02:19:04,230 --> 02:19:04,240
too much going back, it's a problem.
 

6223
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:08,790
too much going back, it's a problem.
I think that's what it is.

6224
02:19:08,790 --> 02:19:08,800

 

6225
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:10,389

Good to know. At least I know what fixes

6226
02:19:10,389 --> 02:19:10,399
Good to know. At least I know what fixes
 

6227
02:19:10,399 --> 02:19:17,669
Good to know. At least I know what fixes
it.

6228
02:19:17,669 --> 02:19:17,679

 

6229
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:19,910

me save this now. Sorry team. All right,

6230
02:19:19,910 --> 02:19:19,920
me save this now. Sorry team. All right,
 

6231
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:21,589
me save this now. Sorry team. All right,
I'm back. Sorry team. I had to focus on

6232
02:19:21,589 --> 02:19:21,599
I'm back. Sorry team. I had to focus on
 

6233
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:25,669
I'm back. Sorry team. I had to focus on
that a minute. Uh D, can you please

6234
02:19:25,669 --> 02:19:25,679
that a minute. Uh D, can you please
 

6235
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:27,589
that a minute. Uh D, can you please
explain the table top? Right. I think I

6236
02:19:27,589 --> 02:19:27,599
explain the table top? Right. I think I
 

6237
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:29,830
explain the table top? Right. I think I
just did. Right.

6238
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:29,840
just did. Right.
 

6239
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,910
just did. Right.
Lower time frame, higher time frame.

6240
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:31,920
Lower time frame, higher time frame.
 

6241
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:33,349
Lower time frame, higher time frame.
Higher time frame at the moment is

6242
02:19:33,349 --> 02:19:33,359
Higher time frame at the moment is
 

6243
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:35,589
Higher time frame at the moment is
trying to move back up to 500, right?

6244
02:19:35,589 --> 02:19:35,599
trying to move back up to 500, right?
 

6245
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:37,030
trying to move back up to 500, right?
That's why it's bullish. lower time

6246
02:19:37,030 --> 02:19:37,040
That's why it's bullish. lower time
 

6247
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,190
That's why it's bullish. lower time
frame is in a bare market because we're

6248
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:39,200
frame is in a bare market because we're
 

6249
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,030
frame is in a bare market because we're
starting I mean this will flip backwards

6250
02:19:41,030 --> 02:19:41,040
starting I mean this will flip backwards
 

6251
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:43,750
starting I mean this will flip backwards
and forwards but we're starting to lose

6252
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:43,760
and forwards but we're starting to lose
 

6253
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:45,349
and forwards but we're starting to lose
these levels. All right. And if we start

6254
02:19:45,349 --> 02:19:45,359
these levels. All right. And if we start
 

6255
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:46,950
these levels. All right. And if we start
to lose this there might be a bigger

6256
02:19:46,950 --> 02:19:46,960
to lose this there might be a bigger
 

6257
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:49,110
to lose this there might be a bigger
drive. This will flip back bullish once

6258
02:19:49,110 --> 02:19:49,120
drive. This will flip back bullish once
 

6259
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,790
drive. This will flip back bullish once
it gets back above here. If we go into a

6260
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:50,800
it gets back above here. If we go into a
 

6261
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:53,190
it gets back above here. If we go into a
liquidity building stage, it's where the

6262
02:19:53,190 --> 02:19:53,200
liquidity building stage, it's where the
 

6263
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,750
liquidity building stage, it's where the
time frames are not necessarily aligned

6264
02:19:55,750 --> 02:19:55,760
time frames are not necessarily aligned
 

6265
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:59,110
time frames are not necessarily aligned
and we might move where's my back down

6266
02:19:59,110 --> 02:19:59,120
and we might move where's my back down
 

6267
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:02,070
and we might move where's my back down
into here. Okay, that will go into a

6268

It might be that you've done someone

It might be that you've done someone
 

6297
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,150
It might be that you've done someone
else's course or you've been around for

a long time and so that you understand
structure and how

6302
02:20:54,469 --> 02:20:54,479

6303
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:57,110

02:20:57,110 --> 02:20:57,120
you think the market works based on how
 

6305
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:59,030
you think the market works based on how
that's not to say like I think one way,

6306
02:20:59,030 --> 02:20:59,040
that's not to say like I think one way,
 

6307
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:00,309
that's not to say like I think one way,
you think the other, I'm right, you're

6308
02:21:00,309 --> 02:21:00,319
you think the other, I'm right, you're
 

6309
02:21:00,319 --> 02:21:01,510
you think the other, I'm right, you're
wrong. There's lots of ways of

6310
02:21:01,510 --> 02:21:01,520
wrong. There's lots of ways of
 

6311
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:03,510
wrong. There's lots of ways of
interpreting it. Um, but it's more like

6312
02:21:03,510 --> 02:21:03,520
interpreting it. Um, but it's more like
 

6313
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:07,110
interpreting it. Um, but it's more like
a supplement for people and I'm adding

6314
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:07,120
a supplement for people and I'm adding
 

6315
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:10,230
a supplement for people and I'm adding
to it every day. But the beginner to

6316
02:21:10,230 --> 02:21:10,240

6317
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:13,270

advanced course makes in my mind is 20

6318
02:21:13,270 --> 02:21:13,280
advanced course makes in my mind is 20
 

6319
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:14,790
advanced course makes in my mind is 20
hours of knowledge to make sure you

6320
02:21:14,790 --> 02:21:14,800
hours of knowledge to make sure you
 

6321
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:17,110
hours of knowledge to make sure you
understand all my teachings on like what

6322
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:17,120
understand all my teachings on like what
 

6323
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:19,270
understand all my teachings on like what
I'm looking at and why and the order

6324
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:19,280
I'm looking at and why and the order
 

6325
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:21,030
I'm looking at and why and the order
flow and volume profile just adds to

6326
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:21,040
flow and volume profile just adds to
 

6327
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,830
flow and volume profile just adds to
that. So the discord is with the 20our

6328
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:23,840
that. So the discord is with the 20our
 

6329
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,990
that. So the discord is with the 20our
course. Um I know that might not be

6330
02:21:25,990 --> 02:21:26,000
course. Um I know that might not be
 

6331
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,070
course. Um I know that might not be
advantageous for some of you but it just

6332
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:28,080
advantageous for some of you but it just
 

6333
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:29,349
advantageous for some of you but it just
means that everyone in the discord is

6334
02:21:29,349 --> 02:21:29,359
means that everyone in the discord is
 

6335
02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:31,670
means that everyone in the discord is
trading the same way. If if I did it for

6336
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:31,680
trading the same way. If if I did it for
 

6337
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:35,349
trading the same way. If if I did it for
the order profile or volume profile and

6338
02:21:35,349 --> 02:21:35,359
the order profile or volume profile and
 

6339
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:37,110
the order profile or volume profile and
orderflow course, it would mean your

6340
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:37,120
orderflow course, it would mean your
 

6341
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,190
orderflow course, it would mean your
interpretation might still be different

6342
02:21:39,190 --> 02:21:39,200
interpretation might still be different
 

6343
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,710
interpretation might still be different
to other people. So that's the only

6344
02:21:40,710 --> 02:21:40,720
to other people. So that's the only
 

6345
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:42,389
to other people. So that's the only
reason.

6346
02:21:42,389 --> 02:21:42,399
reason.
 

6347
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:43,910
reason.
That's the only reason. I did think

6348
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:43,920
That's the only reason. I did think
 

6349
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,510
That's the only reason. I did think
about doing it with it and I was like it

6350
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:45,520
about doing it with it and I was like it
 

6351
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:47,349
about doing it with it and I was like it
might cause issues in Discord where

6352
02:21:47,349 --> 02:21:47,359

6353
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:49,190
might cause issues in Discord where

02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:57,910
people will be looking the other side of
the trade too much. But

That was the the entry was there. I got

6662
02:28:18,230 --> 02:28:18,240
That was the the entry was there. I got
 

6663
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:20,070
That was the the entry was there. I got
caught talking to you guys about other

6664

caught talking to you guys about other
 

6665
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:21,590
caught talking to you guys about other
stuff. Unfortunately, this is what

6666
02:28:21,590 --> 02:28:21,600
stuff. Unfortunately, this is what
 

6667
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:23,750
stuff. Unfortunately, this is what
happens unfortunately when I talk about

6668
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:23,760
happens unfortunately when I talk about
 

6669
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:25,830
happens unfortunately when I talk about
other stuff and then I lose focus and

6670
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:25,840
other stuff and then I lose focus and
 

6671
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:27,510
other stuff and then I lose focus and
now I've missed a trade opportunity. So,

6672
02:28:27,510 --> 02:28:27,520
now I've missed a trade opportunity. So,
 

6673
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,870
now I've missed a trade opportunity. So,
the only other trade opportunity now

6674
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:28,880
the only other trade opportunity now
 

6675
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:30,309
the only other trade opportunity now
would be a breakout and pullback into

6676
02:28:30,309 --> 02:28:30,319
would be a breakout and pullback into
 

6677
02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:31,830
would be a breakout and pullback into
this zone. You'd need aggressive

6678
02:28:31,830 --> 02:28:31,840
this zone. You'd need aggressive
 

6679
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:33,349
this zone. You'd need aggressive
breakout and a pullback to hold the top

6680
02:28:33,349 --> 02:28:33,359
breakout and a pullback to hold the top
 

6681
02:28:33,359 --> 02:28:35,190
breakout and a pullback to hold the top
of this to get up into there. That is

6682
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:35,200
of this to get up into there. That is
 

6683
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,510
of this to get up into there. That is
probably the worst location of the day,

6684
02:28:37,510 --> 02:28:37,520
probably the worst location of the day,
 

6685
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:39,349
probably the worst location of the day,
but you are with momentum. But remember,

6686
02:28:39,349 --> 02:28:39,359
but you are with momentum. But remember,
 

6687
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:40,790
but you are with momentum. But remember,
these guys are all stuck. It needs to be

6688
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:40,800
these guys are all stuck. It needs to be
 

6689
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:43,429
these guys are all stuck. It needs to be
an aggressive breakout and a pullback

6690
02:28:43,429 --> 02:28:43,439
an aggressive breakout and a pullback
 

6691
02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:45,429
an aggressive breakout and a pullback
that holds this level. And your location

6692
02:28:45,429 --> 02:28:45,439
that holds this level. And your location
 

6693
02:28:45,439 --> 02:28:47,349
that holds this level. And your location
is terrible, but that's the only thing

6694
02:28:47,349 --> 02:28:47,359
is terrible, but that's the only thing
 

6695
02:28:47,359 --> 02:28:50,070
is terrible, but that's the only thing
left. Otherwise,

6696
02:28:50,070 --> 02:28:50,080
left. Otherwise,
 

6697

Like I said, I don't like shorts. Even

6698
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:52,080
Like I said, I don't like shorts. Even

though you're building this because this
 

6701

is the weekly point of control that's

02:28:55,990 --> 02:28:56,000
is the weekly point of control that's
 

6703
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,429
is the weekly point of control that's
been developing. This is the level where

6704
02:28:57,429 --> 02:28:57,439
been developing. This is the level where
 

6705
02:28:57,439 --> 02:28:59,190
been developing. This is the level where
they would keep holding. So, we talked

6706
02:28:59,190 --> 02:28:59,200
they would keep holding. So, we talked
 

6707
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,910
they would keep holding. So, we talked
about this numerous times.

6708
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:01,920
about this numerous times.
 

6709
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:04,150
about this numerous times.
This is why I'm not short bias today. Uh

6710
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:04,160
This is why I'm not short bias today. Uh
 

6711
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:05,750
This is why I'm not short bias today. Uh
higher time frame. You see this right

6712
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:05,760
higher time frame. You see this right
 

6713
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:09,110
higher time frame. You see this right
here? Here's your profile, right? They

6714
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,120
here? Here's your profile, right? They
 

6715
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,429
here? Here's your profile, right? They
can keep holding this. They might fail

6716
02:29:11,429 --> 02:29:11,439
can keep holding this. They might fail
 

6717
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:12,950
can keep holding this. They might fail
up here, but they can keep absorbing

6718
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:12,960
up here, but they can keep absorbing
 

6719
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:15,349
up here, but they can keep absorbing
this. So, I'm

6720

this. So, I'm
 

6721

want to be short biased really until we

6735
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:47,510

Why does ES do the same thing as NQ?

6736
02:29:47,510 --> 02:29:47,520
Why does ES do the same thing as NQ?
 

6737
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:49,270
Why does ES do the same thing as NQ?
Does ES have those big players stuck as

Does ES have those big players stuck as

Does ES have those big players stuck as
well? Always confuse me. It Why does it

02:29:51,910 --> 02:29:51,920
well? Always confuse me. It Why does it
 

6741
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:54,230
well? Always confuse me. It Why does it
or why doesn't it?

6742
02:29:54,230 --> 02:29:54,240
or why doesn't it?
 

6743
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:57,510
or why doesn't it?
I mean it if we're moving

6744
02:29:57,510 --> 02:29:57,520
I mean it if we're moving
 

6745
02:29:57,520 --> 02:30:00,150
I mean it if we're moving
if we're moving like well weighted right

6746
02:30:00,150 --> 02:30:00,160
if we're moving like well weighted right
 

6747
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:02,710
if we're moving like well weighted right
if we're if today is a day let's get

6748
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:02,720
if we're if today is a day let's get

if we're if today is a day let's get

which is what we are seeing. All right.

6754
02:30:08,389 --> 02:30:08,399
which is what we are seeing. All right.
 

6755
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:11,110
which is what we are seeing. All right.
So if we look at the breadth today, all

6756
02:30:11,110 --> 02:30:11,120
So if we look at the breadth today, all
 

6757
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:12,710
So if we look at the breadth today, all
right, not much red, like a bit of

02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:12,720
right, not much red, like a bit of
 

6759
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:14,550
right, not much red, like a bit of
energy, but if we were going to think

6760
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:14,560
energy, but if we were going to think
 

6761
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:16,230
energy, but if we were going to think
about ES, if we were going to have a big

6762
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:16,240
about ES, if we were going to have a big

02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:17,750
about ES, if we were going to have a big
divergence day, well, you'd expect

6764
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:17,760

6765
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:19,590

6767
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:22,389
finance to be down or healthcare to be
down. We're not. So if we think about

6768
02:30:22,389 --> 02:30:22,399
down. We're not. So if we think about
 

6769
02:30:22,399 --> 02:30:24,870
down. We're not. So if we think about
all of this, the top 500, everything's

6770
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:24,880
all of this, the top 500, everything's
 

6771
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:27,429
all of this, the top 500, everything's
green. What's really green? Tech. So

6772
02:30:27,429 --> 02:30:27,439
green. What's really green? Tech. So
 

6773
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:29,670
green. What's really green? Tech. So

6779
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:37,910
green. 60% of the NQ heavily weighted,
40% of the ES. So still going to be

6780
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:37,920
40% of the ES. So still going to be
 

6781
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:39,429
40% of the ES. So still going to be
positive.

6782
02:30:39,429 --> 02:30:39,439

6793
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:49,830

you're not seeing it. So the breadth is

6794
02:30:49,830 --> 02:30:49,840
you're not seeing it. So the breadth is
 

6795
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:57,830

you got to do is 1% better each day and
 

6859
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:11,670
you got to do is 1% better each day and
over the course of your career, it will

over the course of your career, it will
 

6861
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:14,389
over the course of your career, it will
really start to make a difference.

6862

Is the trading view order flow indicator

02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,790
Is the trading view order flow indicator

fine. I think it's really good. Like I

Yeah, you can see them. They probably

Yeah, you can see them. They probably
they probably lift, but uh remember we

they probably lift, but uh remember we
 

6879
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,510
they probably lift, but uh remember we
still got that trap player. Uh if we

6880
02:32:43,510 --> 02:32:43,520
still got that trap player. Uh if we

He's still there at 10. So they need to
 

6885
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:50,550
He's still there at 10. So they need to
get above 10 and sweep all this out,

6886
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:50,560
get above 10 and sweep all this out,
 

6887
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:51,670
get above 10 and sweep all this out,
right? That's what they're trying to do.

6888
02:32:51,670 --> 02:32:51,680
right? That's what they're trying to do.
 

6889
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:53,429
right? That's what they're trying to do.
They need to get above 10. That player's

6890
02:32:53,429 --> 02:32:53,439
They need to get above 10. That player's
 

6891
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:55,349
They need to get above 10. That player's
still stuck at 10. If they let him out,

6892
02:32:55,349 --> 02:32:55,359
still stuck at 10. If they let him out,
 

6893
02:32:55,359 --> 02:32:57,590
still stuck at 10. If they let him out,
we probably do like a little swipe up 15

6894
02:32:57,590 --> 02:32:57,600
we probably do like a little swipe up 15
 

6895
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,910
we probably do like a little swipe up 15
20 maybe 30 and then probably settles

6896
02:32:59,910 --> 02:32:59,920
20 maybe 30 and then probably settles
 

6897
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:02,710
20 maybe 30 and then probably settles
back down and sees what it wants to do.

6898
02:33:02,710 --> 02:33:02,720
back down and sees what it wants to do.
 

6899
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:04,230
back down and sees what it wants to do.

6931
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:34,550
refreshing up there. But, you know, if I
had been long off that low, I would have

6932
02:33:34,550 --> 02:33:34,560
had been long off that low, I would have
 

6933
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,910
had been long off that low, I would have
already sold a chunk of my position

need to learn, but I would focus on

7024
02:35:41,429 --> 02:35:41,439
need to learn, but I would focus on
 

7025
02:35:41,439 --> 02:35:44,870
need to learn, but I would focus on
understanding key levels. Uh, WOFF, even

7026
02:35:44,870 --> 02:35:44,880
understanding key levels. Uh, WOFF, even
 

7027
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:48,309
understanding key levels. Uh, WOFF, even
the 21 EMA, people like don't understand

7028
02:35:48,309 --> 02:35:48,319
the 21 EMA, people like don't understand
 

7029
02:35:48,319 --> 02:35:51,270
the 21 EMA, people like don't understand
how useful just have basic EMA is to

7030
02:35:51,270 --> 02:35:51,280
how useful just have basic EMA is to
 

7031
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:53,830
how useful just have basic EMA is to
showing you if price has caught up to

7032
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:53,840
showing you if price has caught up to
 

7033
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:56,070
showing you if price has caught up to
good value or if we're way too extended.

7034
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,080
good value or if we're way too extended.
 

7035
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,070
good value or if we're way too extended.
You know, if we're way away from EMAs on

7036
02:35:58,070 --> 02:35:58,080
You know, if we're way away from EMAs on
 

7037
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,510
You know, if we're way away from EMAs on
any time frame, that should be telling

these flow zones, and the flow zones are

7048
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:13,280
these flow zones, and the flow zones are

still here. You don't want to buy
 

7051
02:36:14,399 --> 02:36:16,710
still here. You don't want to buy
because we're expecting a pull back into

7052
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:16,720
because we're expecting a pull back into

02:36:21,590 --> 02:36:21,600
accelerating away, it's normally a
 

7059
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:22,870
accelerating away, it's normally a
squeeze. You want to wait for the pull

It's a big area here. This 90 is really

7220
02:39:35,190 --> 02:39:35,200
It's a big area here. This 90 is really
 

7221
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:37,190
It's a big area here. This 90 is really
thick. Really, really, really thick

thick. Really, really, really thick
 

7223
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:38,550

7225
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:44,550

out here. Really thick.

7226
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:44,560

 

7227
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:47,910

Yeah, exactly. relative weakness and spy

7228
02:39:47,910 --> 02:39:47,920
Yeah, exactly. relative weakness and spy
 

7229
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:49,270
Yeah, exactly. relative weakness and spy
cannot get through that previous day

7230
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:49,280
cannot get through that previous day
 

7231
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,190
cannot get through that previous day
high and it's back under the 80. If we

7232
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:51,200
high and it's back under the 80. If we
 

7233
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:53,830
high and it's back under the 80. If we
lose 80 like we talked about I can't

7234
02:39:53,830 --> 02:39:53,840
lose 80 like we talked about I can't
 

7235
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:55,110
lose 80 like we talked about I can't
remember some one of you was looking for

7236
02:39:55,110 --> 02:39:55,120
remember some one of you was looking for
 

7237
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:58,469
remember some one of you was looking for
longs on spy you know you need to watch

7238
02:39:58,469 --> 02:39:58,479
longs on spy you know you need to watch
 

7239
02:39:58,479 --> 02:40:02,070
longs on spy you know you need to watch
uh IB high five day and 20 days both at

7240
02:40:02,070 --> 02:40:02,080
uh IB high five day and 20 days both at
 

7241
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:06,150
uh IB high five day and 20 days both at
uh 67850 which is also your sort of uh

7242
02:40:06,150 --> 02:40:06,160
uh 67850 which is also your sort of uh
 

7243
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:08,389
uh 67850 which is also your sort of uh
9:30 10 a.m. high. So I'd be watching

7244
02:40:08,389 --> 02:40:08,399
9:30 10 a.m. high. So I'd be watching
 

7245
02:40:08,399 --> 02:40:10,070
9:30 10 a.m. high. So I'd be watching
for SPY if it wants to trade back into

7246
02:40:10,070 --> 02:40:10,080
for SPY if it wants to trade back into
 

7247
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:11,830
for SPY if it wants to trade back into
that range and hold. VWOP starting to

7248
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:11,840
that range and hold. VWOP starting to
 

7249
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:13,750
that range and hold. VWOP starting to
catch up there as well. So I'd imagine

7250
02:40:13,750 --> 02:40:13,760
catch up there as well. So I'd imagine
 

7251
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:16,230
catch up there as well. So I'd imagine
into that kind of range maybe they find

7252
02:40:16,230 --> 02:40:16,240
into that kind of range maybe they find
 

7253
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:19,270
into that kind of range maybe they find
a bid. But you know, I'm going to keep

7254
02:40:19,270 --> 02:40:19,280
a bid. But you know, I'm going to keep
 

7255
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:21,670
a bid. But you know, I'm going to keep
repeating myself. Remember, today is an

7256
02:40:21,670 --> 02:40:21,680
repeating myself. Remember, today is an
 

7257
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:23,670
repeating myself. Remember, today is an
inside day. Our expectation was

7258
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:23,680
inside day. Our expectation was
 

7259
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:27,110
inside day. Our expectation was
rotation, right? The max max I think we

7260
02:40:27,110 --> 02:40:27,120
rotation, right? The max max I think we
 

7261
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:29,190
rotation, right? The max max I think we
would go to today is 500. But the

7262
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:29,200
would go to today is 500. But the
 

7263
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:31,910
would go to today is 500. But the
expectation is rotation.

7264
02:40:31,910 --> 02:40:31,920
expectation is rotation.
 

7265
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:33,670
expectation is rotation.
Like if we break out of here, let's just

7266
02:40:33,670 --> 02:40:33,680
Like if we break out of here, let's just
 

7267
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:35,190
Like if we break out of here, let's just
think about how much liquidity we've

7268
02:40:35,190 --> 02:40:35,200
think about how much liquidity we've
 

7269
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:37,270
think about how much liquidity we've
built and where we could go. I'm going

7270
02:40:37,270 --> 02:40:37,280
built and where we could go. I'm going
 

7271
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:39,590
built and where we could go. I'm going
to do two types of fibs today. So, let's

7272
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:39,600
to do two types of fibs today. So, let's
 

7273
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:44,309
to do two types of fibs today. So, let's
look at this. No, let's look at you. If

7274
02:40:44,309 --> 02:40:44,319
look at this. No, let's look at you. If
 

7275
02:40:44,319 --> 02:40:46,950
look at this. No, let's look at you. If
we break break out of this range, right?

7276
02:40:46,950 --> 02:40:46,960
we break break out of this range, right?
 

7277
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:49,830
we break break out of this range, right?
So 200% or the 100% move will almost get

7278
02:40:49,830 --> 02:40:49,840
So 200% or the 100% move will almost get
 

7279
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:52,150
So 200% or the 100% move will almost get
get us there. If we look at the initial

7280
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:52,160
get us there. If we look at the initial
 

7281
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:55,590
get us there. If we look at the initial
balance today,

7282
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:55,600
balance today,
 

7283
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:57,670
balance today,
right, 2x initial balance will get us

7284
02:40:57,670 --> 02:40:57,680
right, 2x initial balance will get us
 

7285
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:01,590
right, 2x initial balance will get us
there. And if we look at

7286
02:41:01,590 --> 02:41:01,600
there. And if we look at
 

7287
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:04,070
there. And if we look at
a pullback one,

7288
02:41:04,070 --> 02:41:04,080
a pullback one,
 

7289
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:05,910
a pullback one,
it's looking at that opening range as

7290
02:41:05,910 --> 02:41:05,920
it's looking at that opening range as
 

7291
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:09,670
it's looking at that opening range as
well.

7292
02:41:09,670 --> 02:41:09,680

 

7293
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:11,510

opening range is bang on the money as

7294
02:41:11,510 --> 02:41:11,520
opening range is bang on the money as
 

7295
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:13,349
opening range is bang on the money as
well for a 100% move of the opening

7296
02:41:13,349 --> 02:41:13,359
well for a 100% move of the opening
 

7297
02:41:13,359 --> 02:41:15,910
well for a 100% move of the opening
range. And the last one I just want to

7298
02:41:15,910 --> 02:41:15,920
range. And the last one I just want to
 

7299
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:18,070
range. And the last one I just want to
quick look at

7300
02:41:18,070 --> 02:41:18,080
quick look at
 

7301
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:23,270
quick look at
is do one of these. Okay, so 618. So

7302
02:41:23,270 --> 02:41:23,280
is do one of these. Okay, so 618. So
 

7303
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:25,110
is do one of these. Okay, so 618. So
there's good confluence to get up there

7304
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:25,120
there's good confluence to get up there
 

7305
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:28,230
there's good confluence to get up there
if they can catch a bid. It's a big if,

7306
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:28,240
if they can catch a bid. It's a big if,
 

7307
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:30,469
if they can catch a bid. It's a big if,
but they are doing their best right now.

7308
02:41:30,469 --> 02:41:30,479
but they are doing their best right now.
 

7309
02:41:30,479 --> 02:41:31,670
but they are doing their best right now.
But if they keep trying up here and

7310
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:31,680
But if they keep trying up here and
 

7311
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:33,190
But if they keep trying up here and
getting stuck, they're going to get

7312
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:33,200
getting stuck, they're going to get
 

7313
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:34,630
getting stuck, they're going to get
going to get in trouble. But you can see

7314
02:41:34,630 --> 02:41:34,640
going to get in trouble. But you can see
 

7315
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:36,630
going to get in trouble. But you can see
point control shifted up here. Now,

7316
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:36,640
point control shifted up here. Now,
 

7317
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:38,070
point control shifted up here. Now,
we're not finding acceptance over

7318
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:38,080
we're not finding acceptance over
 

7319
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:40,230
we're not finding acceptance over
values, but this is starting to look

7320
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:40,240
values, but this is starting to look
 

7321
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:41,990
values, but this is starting to look
like a potential trend day, isn't it?

7322
02:41:41,990 --> 02:41:42,000
like a potential trend day, isn't it?
 

7323
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,510
like a potential trend day, isn't it?
Look at this.

7324
02:41:45,510 --> 02:41:45,520

 

7325
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:46,870

If we can get over here, this is

7326
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:46,880
If we can get over here, this is
 

7327
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:47,910
If we can get over here, this is
possible. It's what they're trying to

7328
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:47,920
possible. It's what they're trying to
 

7329
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:49,910
possible. It's what they're trying to
do. But that fourth 10 player, he is the

7330
02:41:49,910 --> 02:41:49,920
do. But that fourth 10 player, he is the
 

7331
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:52,389
do. But that fourth 10 player, he is the
problem right now. The guy who got stuck

7332
02:41:52,389 --> 02:41:52,399
problem right now. The guy who got stuck
 

7333
02:41:52,399 --> 02:42:00,150
problem right now. The guy who got stuck
in this wick up here is your problem.

7334
02:42:00,150 --> 02:42:00,160

 

7335
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:01,910

I wouldn't be playing breakouts in this

7336
02:42:01,910 --> 02:42:01,920
I wouldn't be playing breakouts in this
 

7337
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:03,670
I wouldn't be playing breakouts in this
market. Yeah. Because if you're going to

7338
02:42:03,670 --> 02:42:03,680
market. Yeah. Because if you're going to
 

7339
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:05,510
market. Yeah. Because if you're going to
play, if you're playing the it doesn't

7340
02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:05,520
play, if you're playing the it doesn't
 

7341
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:07,349
play, if you're playing the it doesn't
mean it doesn't work, but if you look at

7342
02:42:07,349 --> 02:42:07,359
mean it doesn't work, but if you look at
 

7343
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:09,030
mean it doesn't work, but if you look at
the hourly chart, look at where you're

7344
02:42:09,030 --> 02:42:09,040
the hourly chart, look at where you're
 

7345
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:11,590
the hourly chart, look at where you're
buying.

7346
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:11,600
buying.
 

7347
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:13,190
buying.
Look at the current week profile. Look

7348
02:42:13,190 --> 02:42:13,200
Look at the current week profile. Look
 

7349
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:14,469
Look at the current week profile. Look
at the hourly chart. Look at where

7350
02:42:14,469 --> 02:42:14,479
at the hourly chart. Look at where
 

7351
02:42:14,479 --> 02:42:18,150
at the hourly chart. Look at where
you're buying. Uh where are you guys?

7352
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:18,160
you're buying. Uh where are you guys?
 

7353
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:19,830
you're buying. Uh where are you guys?
Yeah, it means if you're going to buy

7354
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:19,840
Yeah, it means if you're going to buy
 

7355
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:22,389
Yeah, it means if you're going to buy
410, you're buying the edge of this

7356
02:42:22,389 --> 02:42:22,399
410, you're buying the edge of this
 

7357
02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:24,950
410, you're buying the edge of this
shelf, right? And they might just poke

7358
02:42:24,950 --> 02:42:24,960
shelf, right? And they might just poke
 

7359
02:42:24,960 --> 02:42:26,710
shelf, right? And they might just poke
it and slam it in your face because

7360
02:42:26,710 --> 02:42:26,720
it and slam it in your face because
 

7361
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:29,590
it and slam it in your face because
here's your swing, right? The buys were

7362
02:42:29,590 --> 02:42:29,600
here's your swing, right? The buys were
 

7363
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:32,389
here's your swing, right? The buys were
here, here, and here.

7364
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:32,399
here, here, and here.
 

7365
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:34,230
here, here, and here.
It doesn't mean it can't do it, but it

7366
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:34,240
It doesn't mean it can't do it, but it
 

7367
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:36,309
It doesn't mean it can't do it, but it
you got to ask yourself, is it a good

7368
02:42:36,309 --> 02:42:36,319
you got to ask yourself, is it a good
 

7369
02:42:36,319 --> 02:42:38,630
you got to ask yourself, is it a good
buy? Are you just hoping price moves

7370
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:38,640
buy? Are you just hoping price moves
 

7371
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:40,550
buy? Are you just hoping price moves
high? Are you like, I really want it to

7372
02:42:40,550 --> 02:42:40,560
high? Are you like, I really want it to
 

7373
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:43,830
high? Are you like, I really want it to
do that. Is it a good buy? That was a

7374
02:42:43,830 --> 02:42:43,840
do that. Is it a good buy? That was a
 

7375
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:46,230
do that. Is it a good buy? That was a
good buy. That was a good buy. That was

7376
02:42:46,230 --> 02:42:46,240
good buy. That was a good buy. That was
 

7377
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:48,230
good buy. That was a good buy. That was
a good breakout buy. That was a good

7378
02:42:48,230 --> 02:42:48,240
a good breakout buy. That was a good
 

7379
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:50,389
a good breakout buy. That was a good
breakout buy. That is not a good

7380
02:42:50,389 --> 02:42:50,399
breakout buy. That is not a good
 

7381
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:53,830
breakout buy. That is not a good
breakout buy. Even if it does it, from a

7382
02:42:53,830 --> 02:42:53,840
breakout buy. Even if it does it, from a
 

7383
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:55,830
breakout buy. Even if it does it, from a
technical standpoint, what you are going

7384
02:42:55,830 --> 02:42:55,840
technical standpoint, what you are going
 

7385
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:57,750
technical standpoint, what you are going
to do, let's say you get rewarded on

7386
02:42:57,750 --> 02:42:57,760
to do, let's say you get rewarded on
 

7387
02:42:57,760 --> 02:42:59,750
to do, let's say you get rewarded on
that trade. You trade 410. Let's say you

7388
02:42:59,750 --> 02:42:59,760
that trade. You trade 410. Let's say you
 

7389
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:01,750
that trade. You trade 410. Let's say you
get the 90 points to 500. Let's just say

7390
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:01,760
get the 90 points to 500. Let's just say
 

7391
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:04,070
get the 90 points to 500. Let's just say
you get it. You're going to do that the

7392
02:43:04,070 --> 02:43:04,080
you get it. You're going to do that the
 

7393
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:05,429
you get it. You're going to do that the
next time and it's going to flush on

7394
02:43:05,429 --> 02:43:05,439
next time and it's going to flush on
 

7395
02:43:05,439 --> 02:43:07,429
next time and it's going to flush on
you. You be [\h__\h] Because you're

7396
02:43:07,429 --> 02:43:07,439
you. You be [\h__\h] Because you're
 

7397
02:43:07,439 --> 02:43:09,670
you. You be [\h__\h] Because you're
training your brain to do something you

7398
02:43:09,670 --> 02:43:09,680
training your brain to do something you
 

7399
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:11,990
training your brain to do something you
probably shouldn't do

7400
02:43:11,990 --> 02:43:12,000
probably shouldn't do
 

7401
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,190
probably shouldn't do
in my mind anyway.

7402
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:15,200
in my mind anyway.
 

7403
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:16,469
in my mind anyway.
But each their own. You got to trade

7404
02:43:16,469 --> 02:43:16,479
But each their own. You got to trade
 

7405
02:43:16,479 --> 02:43:18,790
But each their own. You got to trade
your own your own book, your own system.

7406
02:43:18,790 --> 02:43:18,800
your own your own book, your own system.
 

7407

your own your own book, your own system.
Back into this guy. So if they get

7408
02:43:20,309 --> 02:43:20,319
Back into this guy. So if they get
 

7409
02:43:20,319 --> 02:43:23,030
Back into this guy. So if they get
through this 415 420 is on the book.

They are adding. Look 415 just left. So

7412
02:43:26,762 --> 02:43:26,772
They are adding. Look 415 just left. So
 

7413
02:43:26,772 --> 02:43:29,190
They are adding. Look 415 just left. So
[sighs]

7414
02:43:29,190 --> 02:43:29,200

 

7415
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:31,110

410's a problem. Remember, if you were

7416
02:43:31,110 --> 02:43:31,120
410's a problem. Remember, if you were
 

7417
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:34,870
410's a problem. Remember, if you were
stuck at 410, if you bought 5 75 lots at

7418
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:34,880
stuck at 410, if you bought 5 75 lots at
 

7419
02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:37,270
stuck at 410, if you bought 5 75 lots at
410, uh you're probably going to start

7420
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:37,280
410, uh you're probably going to start
 

7421
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:44,630
410, uh you're probably going to start
unloading some.

7422
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:44,640

 

7423
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:46,550

Carla, what I'd look If we got to 500,

7424
02:43:46,550 --> 02:43:46,560
Carla, what I'd look If we got to 500,
 

7425
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:49,269
Carla, what I'd look If we got to 500,
what I'd look for is a break above and

7426
02:43:49,269 --> 02:43:49,279
what I'd look for is a break above and
 

7427
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:51,269
what I'd look for is a break above and
and a drop underneath and then using it

7428
02:43:51,269 --> 02:43:51,279
and a drop underneath and then using it
 

7429
02:43:51,279 --> 02:43:52,790
and a drop underneath and then using it
as resistance. All right. So, if you

7430
02:43:52,790 --> 02:43:52,800
as resistance. All right. So, if you
 

7431
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:55,510
as resistance. All right. So, if you
want to play that short up at 500, if we

7432
02:43:55,510 --> 02:43:55,520
want to play that short up at 500, if we
 

7433
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:58,389
want to play that short up at 500, if we
got there, what I'd be looking for is

7434
02:43:58,389 --> 02:43:58,399
got there, what I'd be looking for is
 

7435
02:43:58,399 --> 02:43:59,910
got there, what I'd be looking for is
something like this where trap buyers

7436
02:43:59,910 --> 02:43:59,920
something like this where trap buyers
 

7437
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:01,750
something like this where trap buyers
come in and then failing underneath and

7438
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:01,760
come in and then failing underneath and
 

7439
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:03,910
come in and then failing underneath and
then using that for the downside move

7440
02:44:03,910 --> 02:44:03,920
then using that for the downside move
 

7441
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:05,910
then using that for the downside move
back to four. Yeah, that's possible, but

7442
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:05,920
back to four. Yeah, that's possible, but
 

7443
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:07,670
back to four. Yeah, that's possible, but
you need them to get trapped above. You

7444
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:07,680
you need them to get trapped above. You
 

7445
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:09,590
you need them to get trapped above. You
don't want to just if we just do one of

7446
02:44:09,590 --> 02:44:09,600
don't want to just if we just do one of
 

7447
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:11,349
don't want to just if we just do one of
these, you don't want to be slamming in

7448
02:44:11,349 --> 02:44:11,359
these, you don't want to be slamming in
 

7449
02:44:11,359 --> 02:44:12,870
these, you don't want to be slamming in
short here. You've got to let it trap,

7450
02:44:12,870 --> 02:44:12,880
short here. You've got to let it trap,
 

7451
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:15,910
short here. You've got to let it trap,
come underneath, roll over. Don't be

7452
02:44:15,910 --> 02:44:15,920
come underneath, roll over. Don't be
 

7453

it's a really good question. Um

7467
02:44:40,800 --> 02:44:44,950

I think

02:44:44,950 --> 02:44:44,960

02:44:44,960 --> 02:44:46,950

I think footprint I'm starting to enjoy
 

7471
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:48,550
I think footprint I'm starting to enjoy
more and more. Traditionally, I've only

7472
02:44:48,550 --> 02:44:48,560
more and more. Traditionally, I've only
 

7473
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:50,389
more and more. Traditionally, I've only
ever used bookmap, but I am actually

7474
02:44:50,389 --> 02:44:50,399
ever used bookmap, but I am actually
 

7475
02:44:50,399 --> 02:44:52,710
ever used bookmap, but I am actually
really enjoying footprint. Um, bookmap,

7476
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:52,720
really enjoying footprint. Um, bookmap,
 

7477
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:53,910
really enjoying footprint. Um, bookmap,
the difference with footprint and

7478
02:44:53,910 --> 02:44:53,920
the difference with footprint and
 

7479
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:56,070
the difference with footprint and
bookmap on the footprint, I can't see

7480
02:44:56,070 --> 02:44:56,080
bookmap on the footprint, I can't see
 

7481
02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:59,030
bookmap on the footprint, I can't see
the levels above, right? And I can't see

7482
02:44:59,030 --> 02:44:59,040
the levels above, right? And I can't see
 

7483
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:01,990
the levels above, right? And I can't see
when people are spoofing and people are

7484
02:45:01,990 --> 02:45:02,000
when people are spoofing and people are
 

7485
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,150
when people are spoofing and people are
legit selling and any of that. You can't

7486
02:45:04,150 --> 02:45:04,160
legit selling and any of that. You can't
 

7487
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:06,389
legit selling and any of that. You can't
see it. Whereas on Bookmap, I can see

7488
02:45:06,389 --> 02:45:06,399
see it. Whereas on Bookmap, I can see
 

7489
02:45:06,399 --> 02:45:08,550
see it. Whereas on Bookmap, I can see
it. And you could get that data on level

7490
02:45:08,550 --> 02:45:08,560
it. And you could get that data on level
 

7491
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:11,590
it. And you could get that data on level
two on the dom. But like I say, the dom,

7492
02:45:11,590 --> 02:45:11,600
two on the dom. But like I say, the dom,
 

7493
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:13,670
two on the dom. But like I say, the dom,
unless you're watching it with like a

7494
02:45:13,670 --> 02:45:13,680
unless you're watching it with like a
 

7495
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:15,750
unless you're watching it with like a
eagle eye, all right, then you're not

7496
02:45:15,750 --> 02:45:15,760
eagle eye, all right, then you're not
 

7497
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:17,349
eagle eye, all right, then you're not
going to see when someone's on and pulls

7498
02:45:17,349 --> 02:45:17,359
going to see when someone's on and pulls
 

7499
02:45:17,359 --> 02:45:19,030
going to see when someone's on and pulls
and ons and pulls. Like this guy at 410

7500
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:19,040
and ons and pulls. Like this guy at 410
 

7501
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:20,630
and ons and pulls. Like this guy at 410
has just come on. If he moves down to

7502
02:45:20,630 --> 02:45:20,640
has just come on. If he moves down to
 

7503
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:22,630
has just come on. If he moves down to
405, now he's moved up to 420. I

7504
02:45:22,630 --> 02:45:22,640
405, now he's moved up to 420. I
 

7505
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:24,150
405, now he's moved up to 420. I
wouldn't see that on the level two. It's

7506
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:24,160
wouldn't see that on the level two. It's
 

7507
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:26,870
wouldn't see that on the level two. It's
moving too quick. I can see it really

7508
02:45:26,870 --> 02:45:26,880
moving too quick. I can see it really
 

7509
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:40,550
moving too quick. I can see it really
quickly and easily on bookm

7510
02:45:40,550 --> 02:45:40,560

 

7511
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:42,550

I I would say that's probably true of M

7512
02:45:42,550 --> 02:45:42,560
I I would say that's probably true of M
 

7513
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:45,269
I I would say that's probably true of M
that 410 player they didn't let him

player he's still stuck up there and
 

7519
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:50,710
player he's still stuck up there and
he's probably the guy starting to dump

7520
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:50,720
he's probably the guy starting to dump
 

7521
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:52,469
he's probably the guy starting to dump
he's probably like [\h__\h] get me out of

he's probably like [\h__\h] get me out of
this why did I buy that hive day what an

7524
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:54,800
this why did I buy that hive day what an
 

7525
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:56,309
this why did I buy that hive day what an
idiot And I was like, "Okay, I'm going

7526
02:45:56,309 --> 02:45:56,319

7528
02:45:58,070 --> 02:45:58,080
to I'm going to dump." And what you had
 

7529
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:59,910
to I'm going to dump." And what you had
there is more people coming in. If you

7530
02:45:59,910 --> 02:45:59,920
there is more people coming in. If you
 

7531
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:03,190
there is more people coming in. If you
look at bookmap, 61 lot, 50 lot, 20 lot,

7532
02:46:03,190 --> 02:46:03,200
look at bookmap, 61 lot, 50 lot, 20 lot,
 

7533
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:05,750
look at bookmap, 61 lot, 50 lot, 20 lot,
11 lot, 7 lot. So their pain right now

7534
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:05,760
11 lot, 7 lot. So their pain right now
 

7535
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:09,030
11 lot, 7 lot. So their pain right now
is 405. So sellers jobs now is to stay

7536
02:46:09,030 --> 02:46:09,040
is 405. So sellers jobs now is to stay
 

7537
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:11,750
is 405. So sellers jobs now is to stay
heavy versus 405, 410. That's the

7538
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:11,760
heavy versus 405, 410. That's the
 

7539
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:15,030
heavy versus 405, 410. That's the
seller's job. Sellers job is to leave

Right. This is a big player.

7558
02:46:53,910 --> 02:46:53,920

 

7559
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:55,670

sellers starting to be aggressive here

7560

02:46:59,750 --> 02:46:59,760
ES coming back down to the level. Can't
 

7565
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:00,790
ES coming back down to the level. Can't
remember which one of you is watching

remember which one of you is watching
it. ES starting starting to do that

7568
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:03,040
it. ES starting starting to do that
 

7569
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:05,190
it. ES starting starting to do that
drift back down into initial balance.

Right. So you got IB 5day 20-day VWOP

7572
02:47:09,349 --> 02:47:09,359
Right. So you got IB 5day 20-day VWOP

Right. So you got IB 5day 20-day VWOP
pivot all between 855 850 on the ES. All

uh, if you look underneath,

7594
02:47:56,469 --> 02:47:56,479
uh, if you look underneath,
 

7595
02:47:56,479 --> 02:47:58,469
uh, if you look underneath,
look at the 9:30, 10:00 a.m. drive, look

7596
02:47:58,469 --> 02:47:58,479
look at the 9:30, 10:00 a.m. drive, look
 

7597
02:47:58,479 --> 02:48:01,429
look at the 9:30, 10:00 a.m. drive, look
at your New York VW, look at the 5day,

7598
02:48:01,429 --> 02:48:01,439
at your New York VW, look at the 5day,
 

7599
02:48:01,439 --> 02:48:02,870
at your New York VW, look at the 5day,
look at the 20-day, look at the initial

7600
02:48:02,870 --> 02:48:02,880
look at the 20-day, look at the initial
 

7601
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:05,510
look at the 20-day, look at the initial
balance. All right, it can it can absorb

7602
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:05,520
balance. All right, it can it can absorb
 

7603
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:06,790
balance. All right, it can it can absorb
in those level. That's what's going to

7604
02:48:06,790 --> 02:48:06,800
in those level. That's what's going to
 

7605
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:09,030
in those level. That's what's going to
be tricky about today is the rotations

7606
02:48:09,030 --> 02:48:09,040
be tricky about today is the rotations
 

7607
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:11,030
be tricky about today is the rotations
can we can drop a little bit, we can

7608
02:48:11,030 --> 02:48:11,040
can we can drop a little bit, we can
 

7609
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:13,030
can we can drop a little bit, we can
absorb, we can go back and back test. I

7610
02:48:13,030 --> 02:48:13,040
absorb, we can go back and back test. I
 

7611
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:14,469
absorb, we can go back and back test. I
don't think you're going to get a big

7612
02:48:14,469 --> 02:48:14,479
don't think you're going to get a big
 

7613
02:48:14,479 --> 02:48:17,349
don't think you're going to get a big
trend move today, but we've had a decent

7614
02:48:17,349 --> 02:48:17,359
trend move today, but we've had a decent
 

7615
02:48:17,359 --> 02:48:20,710
trend move today, but we've had a decent
move out already, right? Like I mean

7616
02:48:20,710 --> 02:48:20,720
move out already, right? Like I mean

stuck uh at 400 and over. So, you

7644
02:49:41,429 --> 02:49:41,439
stuck uh at 400 and over. So, you
 

7645
02:49:41,439 --> 02:49:43,349
stuck uh at 400 and over. So, you
actually you actually want this to drift

7646
02:49:43,349 --> 02:49:43,359
actually you actually want this to drift
 

7647
02:49:43,359 --> 02:49:45,510
actually you actually want this to drift
down here and hold uh for a safer buy

7648
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:45,520
down here and hold uh for a safer buy
 

7649
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:46,710
down here and hold uh for a safer buy
before it does anything else. Yes,

7650
02:49:46,710 --> 02:49:46,720
before it does anything else. Yes,
 

7651
02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:47,910
before it does anything else. Yes,
you're holding the deep flow zone

7652
02:49:47,910 --> 02:49:47,920
you're holding the deep flow zone
 

7653
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:49,830
you're holding the deep flow zone
pullbacks. But yeah, I would be looking

7654
02:49:49,830 --> 02:49:49,840
pullbacks. But yeah, I would be looking
 

7655
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:52,150
pullbacks. But yeah, I would be looking
for this and see if they find a bid here

7656
02:49:52,150 --> 02:49:52,160
for this and see if they find a bid here
 

7657
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:55,030
for this and see if they find a bid here
or get back over this block here into

7658
02:49:55,030 --> 02:49:55,040
or get back over this block here into
 

7659
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:57,670
or get back over this block here into
400 and PC and leave sellers trapped

7660
02:49:57,670 --> 02:49:57,680
400 and PC and leave sellers trapped
 

7661
02:49:57,680 --> 02:49:59,429
400 and PC and leave sellers trapped
underneath here and then maybe but

7662
02:49:59,429 --> 02:49:59,439
underneath here and then maybe but
 

7663
02:49:59,439 --> 02:50:01,269
underneath here and then maybe but
you're going to have to take profit into

7664
02:50:01,269 --> 02:50:01,279
you're going to have to take profit into
 

7665
02:50:01,279 --> 02:50:03,030
you're going to have to take profit into
this move because it's a strong

7666
02:50:03,030 --> 02:50:03,040
this move because it's a strong
 

7667
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:05,910
this move because it's a strong
rejection up there. But that's what I'd

7668
02:50:05,910 --> 02:50:05,920
rejection up there. But that's what I'd
 

7669
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:16,142
rejection up there. But that's what I'd
be watching either here or a reclaim.

7670
02:50:16,142 --> 02:50:16,152

 

7671

I almost did this a job in my 20ies. I

7686
02:50:35,590 --> 02:50:35,600
I almost did this a job in my 20ies. I
 

7687
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:38,950
I almost did this a job in my 20ies. I
went in and interviewed at Deutsche,

7688
02:50:38,950 --> 02:50:38,960
went in and interviewed at Deutsche,
 

7689

went in and interviewed at Deutsche,
Morgan, um everywhere. Got offered a job

Morgan, um everywhere. Got offered a job
 

7691
02:50:42,319 --> 02:50:45,030
Morgan, um everywhere. Got offered a job

7692
02:50:45,030 --> 02:50:45,040
and then ended up having a pretty good
 

7693
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:46,870
and then ended up having a pretty good
career in music. So, didn't do it and

7694
02:50:46,870 --> 02:50:46,880
career in music. So, didn't do it and
 

7695
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:49,269
career in music. So, didn't do it and
then come back to it.

7696
02:50:49,269 --> 02:50:49,279
then come back to it.
 

7697
02:50:49,279 --> 02:50:54,550
then come back to it.
Um,

7698
02:50:54,550 --> 02:50:54,560

 

7699
02:50:54,560 --> 02:50:56,710

yeah, I've guys, it's delayed. I think

7700
02:50:56,710 --> 02:50:56,720
yeah, I've guys, it's delayed. I think
 

7701
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:59,030
yeah, I've guys, it's delayed. I think
it's about six seconds. Unfortunately,

7702
02:50:59,030 --> 02:50:59,040
it's about six seconds. Unfortunately,
 

7703
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:00,870
it's about six seconds. Unfortunately,
it's the quickest. I've got it set to

7704
02:51:00,870 --> 02:51:00,880
it's the quickest. I've got it set to
 

7705
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:02,630
it's the quickest. I've got it set to
the quickest thing possible. If it could

7706
02:51:02,630 --> 02:51:02,640
the quickest thing possible. If it could
 

7707
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:04,469
the quickest thing possible. If it could
do no delay, I would do no delay. I've

7708
02:51:04,469 --> 02:51:04,479
do no delay, I would do no delay. I've
 

7709
02:51:04,479 --> 02:51:05,990
do no delay, I would do no delay. I've
got it set to the quickest thing

7710
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,000
got it set to the quickest thing
 

7711
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,950
got it set to the quickest thing
possible. It's not for my uh benefit.

7712
02:51:08,950 --> 02:51:08,960
possible. It's not for my uh benefit.
 

7713
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:10,790
possible. It's not for my uh benefit.
It's just it's how YouTube do. If you

7714
02:51:10,790 --> 02:51:10,800
It's just it's how YouTube do. If you
 

7715
02:51:10,800 --> 02:51:12,230
It's just it's how YouTube do. If you
watch any streamer, they can't do it

7716
02:51:12,230 --> 02:51:12,240
watch any streamer, they can't do it
 

7717
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:13,910
watch any streamer, they can't do it
quicker than that. So, I think it's six

7718
02:51:13,910 --> 02:51:13,920
quicker than that. So, I think it's six
 

7719
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:15,830
quicker than that. So, I think it's six
seconds. But if they've sped it up, they

7720
02:51:15,830 --> 02:51:15,840
seconds. But if they've sped it up, they
 

7721
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:17,830
seconds. But if they've sped it up, they
sped it back back up. No, I'm not

7722
02:51:17,830 --> 02:51:17,840
sped it back back up. No, I'm not
 

7723
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:19,429
sped it back back up. No, I'm not
looking for a long now. We've got three

7724
02:51:19,429 --> 02:51:19,439
looking for a long now. We've got three
 

7725
02:51:19,439 --> 02:51:21,590
looking for a long now. We've got three
drives.

7726
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:21,600
drives.
 

7727
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,830
drives.
Three drives

7728
02:51:23,830 --> 02:51:23,840
Three drives
 

7729
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:26,630
Three drives
with the same players trapped and we're

7730
02:51:26,630 --> 02:51:26,640
with the same players trapped and we're
 

7731
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:29,590
with the same players trapped and we're
leaving this. I'm not really interested.

7732
02:51:29,590 --> 02:51:29,600
leaving this. I'm not really interested.
 

7733
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:31,429
leaving this. I'm not really interested.
I think we've hit target for the day. I

7734
02:51:31,429 --> 02:51:31,439
I think we've hit target for the day. I
 

7735
02:51:31,439 --> 02:51:33,030
I think we've hit target for the day. I
don't think there's much to do. Like, if

7736
02:51:33,030 --> 02:51:33,040
don't think there's much to do. Like, if
 

7737
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:34,230
don't think there's much to do. Like, if
they lose this, they're going to trade

7738
02:51:34,230 --> 02:51:34,240
they lose this, they're going to trade
 

7739
02:51:34,240 --> 02:51:35,830
they lose this, they're going to trade
back inside. I'm not interested in all

7740
02:51:35,830 --> 02:51:35,840
back inside. I'm not interested in all
 

7741
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:38,150

5day 20-day pivot high from 9:30 10 a.m.

7802

5day 20-day pivot high from 9:30 10 a.m.

And they will need to find a bid there.

7804
02:53:25,990 --> 02:53:26,000
And they will need to find a bid there.
 

7805
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,670
And they will need to find a bid there.
If they find a bid there, if you are

7806
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:27,680
If they find a bid there, if you are
 

7807
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:29,349
If they find a bid there, if you are
going to bid on that and they find a bid

7808
02:53:29,349 --> 02:53:29,359
going to bid on that and they find a bid
 

7809
02:53:29,359 --> 02:53:32,230
going to bid on that and they find a bid
there, you need to now be aware that

7810
02:53:32,230 --> 02:53:32,240
there, you need to now be aware that
 

7811
02:53:32,240 --> 02:53:34,150
there, you need to now be aware that
buyers at higher day are trapped. So if

7812
02:53:34,150 --> 02:53:34,160
buyers at higher day are trapped. So if
 

7813
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:35,750
buyers at higher day are trapped. So if
they return back up there, you want to

7814
02:53:35,750 --> 02:53:35,760
they return back up there, you want to
 

7815
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:37,190
they return back up there, you want to
be selling some, right? You want to be

7816
02:53:37,190 --> 02:53:37,200
be selling some, right? You want to be
 

7817
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:39,429
be selling some, right? You want to be
selling some on that return back in.

7818
02:53:39,429 --> 02:53:39,439
selling some on that return back in.
 

7819
02:53:39,439 --> 02:53:41,190
selling some on that return back in.
Think about who's trapped, where they're

7820
02:53:41,190 --> 02:53:41,200
Think about who's trapped, where they're
 

7821
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:42,630
Think about who's trapped, where they're
trapped. Right now at high day across

7822
02:53:42,630 --> 02:53:42,640
trapped. Right now at high day across
 

7823
02:53:42,640 --> 02:53:44,550
trapped. Right now at high day across
the indexes, we have people trapped. So

7824
02:53:44,550 --> 02:53:44,560
the indexes, we have people trapped. So
 

7825
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:45,750
the indexes, we have people trapped. So
if I was going to look at ES for

7826
02:53:45,750 --> 02:53:45,760
if I was going to look at ES for
 

7827
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:49,030
if I was going to look at ES for
example,

7828
02:53:49,030 --> 02:53:49,040

 

7829
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:51,830

right? You can see participants are now

7830
02:53:51,830 --> 02:53:51,840
right? You can see participants are now
 

7831
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:53,990
right? You can see participants are now
trapped up here. So 5day and 20-day and

7832
02:53:53,990 --> 02:53:54,000
trapped up here. So 5day and 20-day and
 

7833
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,630
trapped up here. So 5day and 20-day and
pivot is here. So buyers will

7834
02:53:56,630 --> 02:53:56,640
pivot is here. So buyers will
 

7835
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:58,389
pivot is here. So buyers will
desperately want to hold this. All

7836
02:53:58,389 --> 02:53:58,399
desperately want to hold this. All
 

7837
02:53:58,399 --> 02:54:00,630
desperately want to hold this. All
right? And then if they do hold it, you

7838
02:54:00,630 --> 02:54:00,640
right? And then if they do hold it, you
 

7839
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:02,230
right? And then if they do hold it, you
want to be selling some back into there

7840
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:02,240
want to be selling some back into there
 

7841
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:04,150
want to be selling some back into there
because if shorts do pile in and if

7842
02:54:04,150 --> 02:54:04,160
because if shorts do pile in and if
 

7843
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:05,750
because if shorts do pile in and if
these buyers are stuck and they say,

7844
02:54:05,750 --> 02:54:05,760
these buyers are stuck and they say,
 

7845
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:07,670
these buyers are stuck and they say,
"Fuck this. I want out." You're going to

7846
02:54:07,670 --> 02:54:07,680
"Fuck this. I want out." You're going to
 

7847
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:09,349
"Fuck this. I want out." You're going to
get a move back down. That's the

02:54:09,349 --> 02:54:09,359
get a move back down. That's the
 

7849
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:12,309
get a move back down. That's the
rotation.

7850
02:54:12,309 --> 02:54:12,319

legacy is best personally, Eddie. I
think legacy is good. I might be missing

8104
03:00:01,349 --> 03:00:01,359
think legacy is good. I might be missing
 

8105
03:00:01,359 --> 03:00:03,110
think legacy is good. I might be missing
it, but I'm not seeing the link to the

8106
03:00:03,110 --> 03:00:03,120
it, but I'm not seeing the link to the
 

8107
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:04,870
it, but I'm not seeing the link to the
new course. Can you post a link? Yeah,

8108
03:00:04,870 --> 03:00:04,880
new course. Can you post a link? Yeah,
 

8109
03:00:04,880 --> 03:00:14,070
new course. Can you post a link? Yeah,
no worries. Um,

8110
03:00:14,070 --> 03:00:14,080

 

8111
03:00:14,080 --> 03:00:15,830

there you go. That's the new new course

8112
03:00:15,830 --> 03:00:15,840
there you go. That's the new new course
 

8113
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:19,030
there you go. That's the new new course
right there.

8114
03:00:19,030 --> 03:00:19,040

 

8115
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:22,469

Um,

8116
03:00:22,469 --> 03:00:22,479

 

8117
03:00:22,479 --> 03:00:24,469

hopefully Wrath, it will come. It will

8118
03:00:24,469 --> 03:00:24,479
hopefully Wrath, it will come. It will
 

8119
03:00:24,479 --> 03:00:28,630
hopefully Wrath, it will come. It will
come. Be nice.

8120
03:00:28,630 --> 03:00:28,640

 

8121
03:00:28,640 --> 03:00:30,790

GC is selling too. Yep. Well, probably

8122
03:00:30,790 --> 03:00:30,800
GC is selling too. Yep. Well, probably
 

8123
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:33,830
GC is selling too. Yep. Well, probably
failed that move. to got slammed into

8124
03:00:33,830 --> 03:00:33,840
failed that move. to got slammed into
 

8125
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:45,750
failed that move. to got slammed into
that uh supply like we talked about.

8126
03:00:45,750 --> 03:00:45,760

 

8127
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:47,670

Could I look at gold again halfway down

8128
03:00:47,670 --> 03:00:47,680
Could I look at gold again halfway down
 

8129
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:53,670
Could I look at gold again halfway down
from the open DC?

8130
03:00:53,670 --> 03:00:53,680

 

8131
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:56,230

Yeah. So, that supply held up and you've

8132
03:00:56,230 --> 03:00:56,240
Yeah. So, that supply held up and you've
 

8133
03:00:56,240 --> 03:00:58,150
Yeah. So, that supply held up and you've
just lost the it needed to hold this

8134
03:00:58,150 --> 03:00:58,160
just lost the it needed to hold this
 

8135
03:00:58,160 --> 03:01:04,070
just lost the it needed to hold this
pivot and you've lost it, right? So,

8136
03:01:04,070 --> 03:01:04,080

 

8137
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:06,790

Right. So, you can see this supply,

8138
03:01:06,790 --> 03:01:06,800
Right. So, you can see this supply,
 

8139
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:08,230
Right. So, you can see this supply,
right? You needed to hold that pivot and

8140
03:01:08,230 --> 03:01:08,240
right? You needed to hold that pivot and
 

8141
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:09,590
right? You needed to hold that pivot and
it's lost it. It's coming down to where

8142
03:01:09,590 --> 03:01:09,600
it's lost it. It's coming down to where
 

8143
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:12,550
it's lost it. It's coming down to where
we last found buyers. Um, but really, if

8144
03:01:12,550 --> 03:01:12,560
we last found buyers. Um, but really, if
 

8145
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:14,230
we last found buyers. Um, but really, if
if if we were going to be strong, even

8146
03:01:14,230 --> 03:01:14,240
if if we were going to be strong, even
 

8147
03:01:14,240 --> 03:01:15,510
if if we were going to be strong, even
if we rejected this, you would have

8148
03:01:15,510 --> 03:01:15,520
if we rejected this, you would have
 

8149
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:17,429
if we rejected this, you would have
wanted to hold this top side, right?

8150
03:01:17,429 --> 03:01:17,439
wanted to hold this top side, right?
 

8151
03:01:17,439 --> 03:01:19,030
wanted to hold this top side, right?
This starts to look like more like a

8152
03:01:19,030 --> 03:01:19,040
This starts to look like more like a
 

8153
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:20,469
This starts to look like more like a
failed breakout. So, you want to be

8154
03:01:20,469 --> 03:01:20,479
failed breakout. So, you want to be
 

8155
03:01:20,479 --> 03:01:22,950
failed breakout. So, you want to be
really careful now on GC. If it finds a

8156
03:01:22,950 --> 03:01:22,960
really careful now on GC. If it finds a
 

8157
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:25,030
really careful now on GC. If it finds a
bid, if we start if you start rejecting

8158
03:01:25,030 --> 03:01:25,040
bid, if we start if you start rejecting
 

8159
03:01:25,040 --> 03:01:27,429
bid, if we start if you start rejecting
this area, that can happen, right? This

8160
03:01:27,429 --> 03:01:27,439
this area, that can happen, right? This
 

8161
03:01:27,439 --> 03:01:29,830
this area, that can happen, right? This
is the edge of that liquidity you've

8162
03:01:29,830 --> 03:01:29,840
is the edge of that liquidity you've
 

8163
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:31,830
is the edge of that liquidity you've
been building since I know 11th of

8164
03:01:31,830 --> 03:01:31,840
been building since I know 11th of
 

8165
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:33,750
been building since I know 11th of
December. Higher lows, higher lows,

8166
03:01:33,750 --> 03:01:33,760
December. Higher lows, higher lows,
 

8167
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:37,349
December. Higher lows, higher lows,
higher lows, trap, go slammed back down.

8168
03:01:37,349 --> 03:01:37,359
higher lows, trap, go slammed back down.
 

8169
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:39,269
higher lows, trap, go slammed back down.
If they reject this, we can rotate all

8170
03:01:39,269 --> 03:01:39,279
If they reject this, we can rotate all
 

8171
03:01:39,279 --> 03:01:41,269
If they reject this, we can rotate all
the way back down. Uh on higher time

8172
03:01:41,269 --> 03:01:41,279
the way back down. Uh on higher time
 

8173
03:01:41,279 --> 03:01:43,910
the way back down. Uh on higher time
frame, so lower time frame, you'd expect

8174
03:01:43,910 --> 03:01:43,920
frame, so lower time frame, you'd expect
 

8175
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:46,550
frame, so lower time frame, you'd expect
some reaction soon. We've caught bids

8176
03:01:46,550 --> 03:01:46,560
some reaction soon. We've caught bids
 

8177
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:49,030
some reaction soon. We've caught bids
there. Did that sweep everyone? It did.

8178
03:01:49,030 --> 03:01:49,040
there. Did that sweep everyone? It did.
 

8179
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:50,710
there. Did that sweep everyone? It did.
All right. So, you'd want that to hold.

8180
03:01:50,710 --> 03:01:50,720
All right. So, you'd want that to hold.
 

8181
03:01:50,720 --> 03:01:52,950
All right. So, you'd want that to hold.
The reaction off the highs is very

8182
03:01:52,950 --> 03:01:52,960
The reaction off the highs is very
 

8183
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:56,070
The reaction off the highs is very
strong. Swept that. I would imagine

8184
03:01:56,070 --> 03:01:56,080
strong. Swept that. I would imagine
 

8185
03:01:56,080 --> 03:01:58,790
strong. Swept that. I would imagine
you'll find a bit of a bid soon. And it

8186
03:01:58,790 --> 03:01:58,800
you'll find a bit of a bid soon. And it
 

8187
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:00,870
you'll find a bit of a bid soon. And it
what you really have to ask is do they

8188
03:02:00,870 --> 03:02:00,880
what you really have to ask is do they
 

8189
03:02:00,880 --> 03:02:02,870
what you really have to ask is do they
sell? Let's pull this out because I

8190
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:02,880
sell? Let's pull this out because I
 

8191
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:06,550
sell? Let's pull this out because I
haven't extended this. There we go. If

8192
03:02:06,550 --> 03:02:06,560
haven't extended this. There we go. If
 

8193
03:02:06,560 --> 03:02:11,429
haven't extended this. There we go. If
you fail to reclaim uh 365,

8194
03:02:11,429 --> 03:02:11,439
you fail to reclaim uh 365,
 

8195
03:02:11,439 --> 03:02:13,190
you fail to reclaim uh 365,
you fail to reclaim this, you're going

8196
03:02:13,190 --> 03:02:13,200
you fail to reclaim this, you're going
 

8197
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:16,630
you fail to reclaim this, you're going
to rotate back into this like pivot low,

8198
03:02:16,630 --> 03:02:16,640
to rotate back into this like pivot low,
 

8199
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:18,309
to rotate back into this like pivot low,
right? And look out below if you start

8200
03:02:18,309 --> 03:02:18,319
right? And look out below if you start
 

8201
03:02:18,319 --> 03:02:20,630
right? And look out below if you start
losing that previous day low. If you

8202
03:02:20,630 --> 03:02:20,640
losing that previous day low. If you
 

8203
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:22,630
losing that previous day low. If you
reclaim this, there's probably a bid

8204
03:02:22,630 --> 03:02:22,640
reclaim this, there's probably a bid
 

8205
03:02:22,640 --> 03:02:24,389
reclaim this, there's probably a bid
back into like some of this area here.

8206
03:02:24,389 --> 03:02:24,399
back into like some of this area here.
 

8207
03:02:24,399 --> 03:02:26,630
back into like some of this area here.
You can think about like the midpoint of

8208
03:02:26,630 --> 03:02:26,640
You can think about like the midpoint of
 

8209
03:02:26,640 --> 03:02:28,790
You can think about like the midpoint of
this range, right? If it claims it,

8210
03:02:28,790 --> 03:02:28,800
this range, right? If it claims it,
 

8211
03:02:28,800 --> 03:02:30,950
this range, right? If it claims it,
reclaims it, right? And you'd expect

8212
03:02:30,950 --> 03:02:30,960
reclaims it, right? And you'd expect
 

8213
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:34,870
reclaims it, right? And you'd expect
this to resell. So, if they hold this or

8214
03:02:34,870 --> 03:02:34,880
this to resell. So, if they hold this or
 

8215
03:02:34,880 --> 03:02:36,630
this to resell. So, if they hold this or
they reclaim this, once you get into

8216
03:02:36,630 --> 03:02:36,640
they reclaim this, once you get into
 

8217
03:02:36,640 --> 03:02:38,309
they reclaim this, once you get into
here, you will probably find that bears

8218
03:02:38,309 --> 03:02:38,319
here, you will probably find that bears
 

8219
03:02:38,319 --> 03:02:39,910
here, you will probably find that bears
will come back in and slam this back

8220
03:02:39,910 --> 03:02:39,920
will come back in and slam this back
 

8221
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:42,469
will come back in and slam this back
down, right? So, that's a strong sell.

8222
03:02:42,469 --> 03:02:42,479
down, right? So, that's a strong sell.
 

8223
03:02:42,479 --> 03:02:44,230
down, right? So, that's a strong sell.
At some point, they will probably bid,

8224
03:02:44,230 --> 03:02:44,240
At some point, they will probably bid,
 

8225
03:02:44,240 --> 03:02:46,389
At some point, they will probably bid,
they need to get through this for that,

8226
03:02:46,389 --> 03:02:46,399
they need to get through this for that,
 

8227
03:02:46,399 --> 03:02:48,150
they need to get through this for that,
maybe a two-leg, and then they will sell

8228
03:02:48,150 --> 03:02:48,160
maybe a two-leg, and then they will sell
 

8229
03:02:48,160 --> 03:02:49,750
maybe a two-leg, and then they will sell
it back. All right? Hopefully, that

8230
03:02:49,750 --> 03:02:49,760
it back. All right? Hopefully, that
 

8231
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:51,990
it back. All right? Hopefully, that
helps.

8232
03:02:51,990 --> 03:02:52,000
helps.
 

8233
03:02:52,000 --> 03:03:01,990
helps.
Very

8234
03:03:01,990 --> 03:03:02,000

 

8235
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:03,910

heavy

8236
03:03:03,910 --> 03:03:03,920
heavy
 

8237
03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:07,349
heavy
very heavy market in rotation.

8238
03:03:07,349 --> 03:03:07,359
very heavy market in rotation.
 

8239
03:03:07,359 --> 03:03:09,510
very heavy market in rotation.
Uh

8240
03:03:09,510 --> 03:03:09,520
Uh
 

8241
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:14,230
Uh
you're in short since 25397. 397.

8242
03:03:14,230 --> 03:03:14,240
you're in short since 25397. 397.
 

8243
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:16,550
you're in short since 25397. 397.
Awesome. Well, once we lost PC, that's

8244
03:03:16,550 --> 03:03:16,560
Awesome. Well, once we lost PC, that's
 

8245
03:03:16,560 --> 03:03:18,070
Awesome. Well, once we lost PC, that's
incredible. It's probably best entry of

8246
03:03:18,070 --> 03:03:18,080
incredible. It's probably best entry of
 

8247
03:03:18,080 --> 03:03:19,269
incredible. It's probably best entry of
the day. I'd say once they couldn't get

8248
03:03:19,269 --> 03:03:19,279
the day. I'd say once they couldn't get
 

8249
03:03:19,279 --> 03:03:22,150
the day. I'd say once they couldn't get
back three to 410 and lost PC. Fantastic

8250
03:03:22,150 --> 03:03:22,160
back three to 410 and lost PC. Fantastic
 

8251
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:26,230
back three to 410 and lost PC. Fantastic
entry. Fantastic entry,

8252
03:03:26,230 --> 03:03:26,240
entry. Fantastic entry,
 

8253
03:03:26,240 --> 03:03:28,070
