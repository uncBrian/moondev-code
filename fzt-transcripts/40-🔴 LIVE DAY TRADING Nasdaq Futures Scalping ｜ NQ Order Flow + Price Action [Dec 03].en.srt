00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
because things are changing quickly in
 

9
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,190
because things are changing quickly in
this market. Like I've warned you, it's

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
this market. Like I've warned you, it's
 

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,109
this market. Like I've warned you, it's
been a low volume move based on

12
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
been a low volume move based on
 

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,270
been a low volume move based on
absolutely nothing. And this is what

14
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
absolutely nothing. And this is what
 

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,350
absolutely nothing. And this is what
happens. and you get one small headline

16
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
happens. and you get one small headline
 

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,550
happens. and you get one small headline
and the tone shifts. Okay? Because

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
and the tone shifts. Okay? Because
 

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,070
and the tone shifts. Okay? Because
there's nothing really to prop us up.

20
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
there's nothing really to prop us up.
 

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,510
there's nothing really to prop us up.
So, let's have a look into this market.

22
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
So, let's have a look into this market.
 

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,270
So, let's have a look into this market.
What if you had drift, low volume,

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
What if you had drift, low volume,
 

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,830
What if you had drift, low volume,
right? Nothing. It's literally nothing.

26
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
right? Nothing. It's literally nothing.
 

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,789
right? Nothing. It's literally nothing.
It's inflated on nothing. There is no

28
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
It's inflated on nothing. There is no
 

29
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,109
It's inflated on nothing. There is no
bullish sentiment here. There's nothing,

30
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
bullish sentiment here. There's nothing,
 

31
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,429
bullish sentiment here. There's nothing,
right? They're pricing back in the rate

32
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
right? They're pricing back in the rate
 

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,830
right? They're pricing back in the rate
cut which was already priced in here.

34
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
cut which was already priced in here.
 

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,510
cut which was already priced in here.
And then we decided we weren't going to

36
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
And then we decided we weren't going to
 

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,270
And then we decided we weren't going to
cut and now we're back into no man's

38
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
cut and now we're back into no man's
 

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,870
cut and now we're back into no man's
land, right? We're just back into the

40
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
land, right? We're just back into the
 

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,270
land, right? We're just back into the
same level. Nothing's changed, folks.

42
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
same level. Nothing's changed, folks.
 

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,109
same level. Nothing's changed, folks.
Nothing's changed. In fact, macro

44
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
Nothing's changed. In fact, macro
 

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,109
Nothing's changed. In fact, macro
sentiment is looking worse and worse.

46
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
sentiment is looking worse and worse.
 

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,109
sentiment is looking worse and worse.
And the lies and smoke and mirrors that

48
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
And the lies and smoke and mirrors that
 

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,870
And the lies and smoke and mirrors that
you're seeing coming out are pretty

50
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
you're seeing coming out are pretty
 

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,389
you're seeing coming out are pretty
horrific right now. And I can give you

52
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
horrific right now. And I can give you
 

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,310
horrific right now. And I can give you
an example. Trump's comment yesterday

54
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
an example. Trump's comment yesterday
 

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,630
an example. Trump's comment yesterday
saying that uh Black Friday sales were

56
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
saying that uh Black Friday sales were
 

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,910
saying that uh Black Friday sales were
massive and the biggest they've ever

58
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
massive and the biggest they've ever
 

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,309
massive and the biggest they've ever
been. Um yes, they might look big, but

60
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
been. Um yes, they might look big, but
 

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,110
been. Um yes, they might look big, but
the price of product was up 7%. The

62
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
the price of product was up 7%. The
 

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,030
the price of product was up 7%. The
amount of products actually bought were

64
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
amount of products actually bought were
 

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,390
amount of products actually bought were
down 11% and 95% of it was bought on

66
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
down 11% and 95% of it was bought on
 

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,550
down 11% and 95% of it was bought on
credit. And we all know at the moment

68
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
credit. And we all know at the moment
 

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,949
credit. And we all know at the moment
that consumers are being unable to pay

70
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
that consumers are being unable to pay
 

71
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,949
that consumers are being unable to pay
off their credit cards. Okay? So, is it

72
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
off their credit cards. Okay? So, is it
 

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,750
off their credit cards. Okay? So, is it
good? No. It's fluff. All right? Don't

74
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
good? No. It's fluff. All right? Don't
 

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,150
good? No. It's fluff. All right? Don't
buy a shitty car with no engine under

76
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
buy a shitty car with no engine under
 

77
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,229
buy a shitty car with no engine under
the hood. Understand what you're buying.

78
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
the hood. Understand what you're buying.
 

79
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,070
the hood. Understand what you're buying.
We want to see if this market can come

80
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
We want to see if this market can come
 

81
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,990
We want to see if this market can come
back down here and hold a good higher

82
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
back down here and hold a good higher
 

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,430
back down here and hold a good higher
low. That and only then will I start to

84
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
low. That and only then will I start to
 

85
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,990
low. That and only then will I start to
become confident in this market. What

86
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
become confident in this market. What
 

87
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,670
become confident in this market. What
we've had this morning is Microsoft come

88
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
we've had this morning is Microsoft come
 

89
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,670
we've had this morning is Microsoft come
out basically saying there's not as much

90
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
out basically saying there's not as much
 

91
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,750
out basically saying there's not as much
demand for AI as they thought there was.

92
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
demand for AI as they thought there was.
 

93
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,750
demand for AI as they thought there was.
Oh dear. Well, this is a market

94
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
Oh dear. Well, this is a market
 

95
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,470
Oh dear. Well, this is a market
ballooned on AI and everyone's freaking

96
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
ballooned on AI and everyone's freaking
 

97
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,550
ballooned on AI and everyone's freaking
out right now. We have to pay attention

98
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
out right now. We have to pay attention
 

99
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,229
out right now. We have to pay attention
to what's actually happening in the

100
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
to what's actually happening in the
 

101
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,670
to what's actually happening in the
charts. Inside bar yet again, we're

102
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
charts. Inside bar yet again, we're
 

103
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,430
charts. Inside bar yet again, we're
going to go and open up inside. Now,

104
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
going to go and open up inside. Now,
 

105
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,110
going to go and open up inside. Now,
what you want to do is reference

106
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
what you want to do is reference
 

107
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,990
what you want to do is reference
yesterday's value areas, yesterday's New

108
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
yesterday's value areas, yesterday's New
 

109
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,149
yesterday's value areas, yesterday's New
York session areas because we are

110
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
York session areas because we are
 

111
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,149
York session areas because we are
potentially going to find support in

112
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
potentially going to find support in
 

113
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,630
potentially going to find support in
this sort of block here. All right, we

114
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
this sort of block here. All right, we
 

115
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,390
this sort of block here. All right, we
will find weakness if we trade under

116
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
will find weakness if we trade under
 

117
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,390
will find weakness if we trade under
this and reject it. All right, and

118
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
this and reject it. All right, and
 

119
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,830
this and reject it. All right, and
that's when I expect there to be a

120
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
that's when I expect there to be a
 

121
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,910
that's when I expect there to be a
rotation to 900 if we do that.

122
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
rotation to 900 if we do that.
 

123
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,550
rotation to 900 if we do that.
Otherwise, right, any drift which comes

124
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
Otherwise, right, any drift which comes
 

125
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,149
Otherwise, right, any drift which comes
down here and reclaims these these

126
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
down here and reclaims these these
 

127
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,910
down here and reclaims these these
levels, we're just going to chop again.

128
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
levels, we're just going to chop again.
 

129
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,910
levels, we're just going to chop again.
And I tell you what, I will not be

130
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
And I tell you what, I will not be
 

131
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,270
And I tell you what, I will not be
trading that. That would be exactly the

132
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
trading that. That would be exactly the
 

133
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,630
trading that. That would be exactly the
same as me yesterday. That will be a

134
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
same as me yesterday. That will be a
 

135
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,430
same as me yesterday. That will be a
leave alone day. I am not interested in

136
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
leave alone day. I am not interested in
 

137
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,509
leave alone day. I am not interested in
trading inside this location here. You

138
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
trading inside this location here. You
 

139
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,390
trading inside this location here. You
are asking to get chopped to death if

140
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
are asking to get chopped to death if
 

141
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,470
are asking to get chopped to death if
you do that. Bulls want to be strong.

142
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
you do that. Bulls want to be strong.
 

143
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,309
you do that. Bulls want to be strong.
They better start breaking out. Bears

144
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
They better start breaking out. Bears
 

145
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,990
They better start breaking out. Bears
want to be strong. They better start

146
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
want to be strong. They better start
 

147
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,789
want to be strong. They better start
holding a lower high under here. Anytime

148
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
holding a lower high under here. Anytime
 

149
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,190
holding a lower high under here. Anytime
we're just doing this sideways, I have

150
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
we're just doing this sideways, I have
 

151
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,350
we're just doing this sideways, I have
zero interest in trading it. I've been

152
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
zero interest in trading it. I've been
 

153
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,910
zero interest in trading it. I've been
around far too long to get pulled into

154
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
around far too long to get pulled into
 

155
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,110
around far too long to get pulled into
nonsense like that. All right, into the

156
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
nonsense like that. All right, into the
 

157
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,190
nonsense like that. All right, into the
hourlys. And you can see how quickly

158
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
hourlys. And you can see how quickly
 

159
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,030
hourlys. And you can see how quickly
that shifted sentiment. All right, I

160
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
that shifted sentiment. All right, I
 

161
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,789
that shifted sentiment. All right, I
think it was in first 2 minutes we

162
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
think it was in first 2 minutes we
 

163
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,550
think it was in first 2 minutes we
dropped over 100 points in 8 minutes.

164
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
dropped over 100 points in 8 minutes.
 

165
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,110
dropped over 100 points in 8 minutes.
We've given up the whole bar from

166
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
We've given up the whole bar from
 

167
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,190
We've given up the whole bar from
yesterday. Right, that shows what

168
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
yesterday. Right, that shows what
 

169
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,190
yesterday. Right, that shows what
happens when there's no volume, folks.

170
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
happens when there's no volume, folks.
 

171
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,630
happens when there's no volume, folks.
All right, when there's no volume, when

172
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
All right, when there's no volume, when
 

173
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,310
All right, when there's no volume, when
there's no structure, this is what

174
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
there's no structure, this is what
 

175
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,789
there's no structure, this is what
happens. So, overnight, what have we

176
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
happens. So, overnight, what have we
 

177
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,949
happens. So, overnight, what have we
had? Well, a whole lot of nothing. All

178
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
had? Well, a whole lot of nothing. All
 

179
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,189
had? Well, a whole lot of nothing. All
right, sideways. Here was yesterday's

180
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
right, sideways. Here was yesterday's
 

181
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,030
right, sideways. Here was yesterday's
dip. Absorbed back up. Sideways,

182
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
dip. Absorbed back up. Sideways,
 

183
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,629
dip. Absorbed back up. Sideways,
sideways, sideways. Did they break out

184
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
sideways, sideways. Did they break out
 

185
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,390
sideways, sideways. Did they break out
and hold? No, they didn't. So, as soon

186
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
and hold? No, they didn't. So, as soon
 

187
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,990
and hold? No, they didn't. So, as soon
as bad news came, what did that mean?

188
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
as bad news came, what did that mean?
 

189
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,510
as bad news came, what did that mean?
All this low volume that we've had.

190
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
All this low volume that we've had.
 

191
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,430
All this low volume that we've had.
Bye-bye. And right back down to the

192
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
Bye-bye. And right back down to the
 

193
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,030
Bye-bye. And right back down to the
bottom side. All right. So, now we're

194
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
bottom side. All right. So, now we're
 

195
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,590
bottom side. All right. So, now we're
testing yesterday's New York session

196
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
testing yesterday's New York session
 

197
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,590
testing yesterday's New York session
low. This is your key pivot and

198
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
low. This is your key pivot and
 

199
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,110
low. This is your key pivot and
sentiment. All right. Maybe they sweep

200
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
sentiment. All right. Maybe they sweep
 

201
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,430
sentiment. All right. Maybe they sweep
it. Maybe today all they do is grind all

202
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
it. Maybe today all they do is grind all
 

203
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,270
it. Maybe today all they do is grind all
the way back. They can easily do that

204
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
the way back. They can easily do that
 

205
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,909
the way back. They can easily do that
and just do a big old inside bar of

206
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
and just do a big old inside bar of
 

207
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,469
and just do a big old inside bar of
nonsense in here. This market will get

208
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
nonsense in here. This market will get
 

209
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,990
nonsense in here. This market will get
fun if we start holding outside or if we

210
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
fun if we start holding outside or if we
 

211
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,469
fun if we start holding outside or if we
back test value and push down back

212
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
back test value and push down back
 

213
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,030
back test value and push down back
towards previous weekly value. That is a

214
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
towards previous weekly value. That is a
 

215
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,749
towards previous weekly value. That is a
trade setup for me.

216
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
trade setup for me.
 

217
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,749
trade setup for me.
Failed look below is potentially a trade

218
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
Failed look below is potentially a trade
 

219
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,670
Failed look below is potentially a trade
setup. Although I really don't want to

220
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
setup. Although I really don't want to
 

221
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,590

trade inside this. I really don't want

222
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
trade inside this. I really don't want
 

223
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,909
trade inside this. I really don't want
to trade inside that. A reclaim of this

224
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
to trade inside that. A reclaim of this
 

225
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,670
to trade inside that. A reclaim of this
or any reclaim of previous day value

226
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
or any reclaim of previous day value
 

227
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,830
or any reclaim of previous day value
area low. That is my no trade zone. I'm

228
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
area low. That is my no trade zone. I'm
 

229
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,390
area low. That is my no trade zone. I'm
not trading inside of yesterday's value

230
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
not trading inside of yesterday's value
 

231
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,510
not trading inside of yesterday's value
and previous uh day's value or overnight

232
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
and previous uh day's value or overnight
 

233
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,830
and previous uh day's value or overnight
value. This is your death chop range.

234
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
value. This is your death chop range.
 

235
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,430
value. This is your death chop range.
All right, it's showing you there's your

236
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
All right, it's showing you there's your
 

237
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,510
All right, it's showing you there's your
death chop. All right, it's telling you

238
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
death chop. All right, it's telling you
 

239
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,270
death chop. All right, it's telling you
that's death drop. I don't want to trade

240
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
that's death drop. I don't want to trade
 

241
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,390
that's death drop. I don't want to trade
inside that. All right, so bears have an

242
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
inside that. All right, so bears have an
 

243
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,629
inside that. All right, so bears have an
opportunity again to take control here.

244
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
opportunity again to take control here.
 

245
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,150
opportunity again to take control here.
If they're going to get really bullish,

246
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
If they're going to get really bullish,
 

247
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,909
If they're going to get really bullish,
they better start breaking out and

248
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
they better start breaking out and
 

249
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,830
they better start breaking out and
holding above key levels, which so far

250
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
holding above key levels, which so far
 

251
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,670
holding above key levels, which so far
they've failed to do. All right. So, I'm

252
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
they've failed to do. All right. So, I'm
 

253
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,189
they've failed to do. All right. So, I'm
going to first be watching this morning

254
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
going to first be watching this morning
 

255
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,350
going to first be watching this morning
any bat test of basically 540 550 to see

256
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
any bat test of basically 540 550 to see
 

257
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,310
any bat test of basically 540 550 to see
if bears come in and defend this for a

258
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
if bears come in and defend this for a
 

259
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,189
if bears come in and defend this for a
retest of this low. All right. If we get

260
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
retest of this low. All right. If we get
 

261
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,790
retest of this low. All right. If we get
follow through, great. But the first

262
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
follow through, great. But the first
 

263
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,150
follow through, great. But the first
trade will be from 550 down to 400. 150

264
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
trade will be from 550 down to 400. 150
 

265
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,150
trade will be from 550 down to 400. 150
pointer. That's what I'm looking for.

266
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
pointer. That's what I'm looking for.
 

267
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,350

Any reclaim of 550 and drift higher. Not

Any reclaim of 550 and drift higher. Not

interest in trading inside yesterday's
value. you're asking for it. We move up

274
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
value. you're asking for it. We move up
 

275
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,629
value. you're asking for it. We move up
to here. You can see it very, very

00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
to here. You can see it very, very
 

277
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,110
to here. You can see it very, very
clearly. All right. This is a whole lot

278
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
clearly. All right. This is a whole lot
 

279
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,790
clearly. All right. This is a whole lot
of [\h__\h] that I was calling for

280
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
of [\h__\h] that I was calling for
 

281
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,870
of [\h__\h] that I was calling for
yesterday. Three drive higher, wash all

282
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
yesterday. Three drive higher, wash all
 

283
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,830
yesterday. Three drive higher, wash all
the way down, reclaim it. One, two,

284
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
the way down, reclaim it. One, two,
 

285
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,150
the way down, reclaim it. One, two,
three, drive higher. Can't go anywhere.

286
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
three, drive higher. Can't go anywhere.
 

287
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,749
three, drive higher. Can't go anywhere.
Wash all the way down. Does that look

288
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
Wash all the way down. Does that look
 

289
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,230
Wash all the way down. Does that look
similar? It's the same move. We're boxed

290
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
similar? It's the same move. We're boxed
 

291
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,430
similar? It's the same move. We're boxed
in, right? I don't want to trade inside

292
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
in, right? I don't want to trade inside
 

293
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,670
in, right? I don't want to trade inside
the top level of this box. I want bears

294
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
the top level of this box. I want bears
 

295
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,230
the top level of this box. I want bears
to come in and offer an actual legit

296
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
to come in and offer an actual legit
 

297
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,670
to come in and offer an actual legit
trade setup now that they've had a

298
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
trade setup now that they've had a
 

299
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,070
trade setup now that they've had a
sentiment shift. That's the play for me.

300
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
sentiment shift. That's the play for me.
 

301
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,309
sentiment shift. That's the play for me.
If it doesn't do it, doesn't do it. It

302
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
If it doesn't do it, doesn't do it. It
 

303
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,189
If it doesn't do it, doesn't do it. It
is what it is. Okay, let's move into

304
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
is what it is. Okay, let's move into
 

305
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,189
is what it is. Okay, let's move into
lower time frames. And we're actually

306
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
lower time frames. And we're actually
 

307
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,430
lower time frames. And we're actually
going to go through quite a few bits

308
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
going to go through quite a few bits
 

309
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,029
going to go through quite a few bits
here today because what's really

310
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
here today because what's really
 

311
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,629
here today because what's really
important for me right now is these

312
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
important for me right now is these
 

313
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,230
important for me right now is these
spiders. All right, you know that the

314
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
spiders. All right, you know that the
 

315
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,309
spiders. All right, you know that the
180s have been a big level. There's a

316
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
180s have been a big level. There's a
 

317
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,830
180s have been a big level. There's a
big gamma level. I talked about it

318
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
big gamma level. I talked about it
 

319
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,510
big gamma level. I talked about it
yesterday. All right, they've got huge

320
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
yesterday. All right, they've got huge
 

321
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,550
yesterday. All right, they've got huge
gamma exposure. Sorry. 180s at 680.

322
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
gamma exposure. Sorry. 180s at 680.
 

323
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,230
gamma exposure. Sorry. 180s at 680.
All the time they're holding 680. This

324
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
All the time they're holding 680. This
 

325
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,469
All the time they're holding 680. This
can squeeze back up. All right. 680 is

326
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
can squeeze back up. All right. 680 is
 

327
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,909
can squeeze back up. All right. 680 is
your overunder. You can see you haven't

328
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
your overunder. You can see you haven't
 

329
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,589
your overunder. You can see you haven't
taken out previous day low. We've got

330
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
taken out previous day low. We've got
 

331
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,270
taken out previous day low. We've got
lots down here. If they want to come and

332
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
lots down here. If they want to come and
 

333
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,870
lots down here. If they want to come and
wash down here, uh let's just call it a

334
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
wash down here, uh let's just call it a
 

335
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,749
wash down here, uh let's just call it a
78, right? 680 breaks and you're looking

336
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
78, right? 680 breaks and you're looking
 

337
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,309
78, right? 680 breaks and you're looking
at 78. And look how ridiculous these

338
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
at 78. And look how ridiculous these
 

339
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,589
at 78. And look how ridiculous these
moves are. This is what I'm trying to

340
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
moves are. This is what I'm trying to
 

341
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,670
moves are. This is what I'm trying to
get through to you at the moment. These

342
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
get through to you at the moment. These
 

343
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,070
get through to you at the moment. These
are not healthy moves. These are asking

344
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
are not healthy moves. These are asking
 

345
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,990
are not healthy moves. These are asking
to get crushed. All right, that's a

346
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
to get crushed. All right, that's a
 

347
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,390
to get crushed. All right, that's a
10point move is available there and it

348
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
10point move is available there and it
 

349
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,309
10point move is available there and it
would not surprise me. It will happen at

350
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
would not surprise me. It will happen at
 

351
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,189
would not surprise me. It will happen at
some point. They cannot sustain this

352
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
some point. They cannot sustain this
 

353
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,990
some point. They cannot sustain this
unless they're really going to break out

354
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
unless they're really going to break out
 

355
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,150
unless they're really going to break out
which they so far have not done. They've

356
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
which they so far have not done. They've
 

357
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,029
which they so far have not done. They've
just gone sideways. We are boxed in in

This still has the potential to roll

This still has the potential to roll
over and maybe here we set a higher low.

00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,750
right, so understand that Dixie starting
to pull back a bit. All right, so failed

433
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,350
it's going to be a problem last uh next
month. Let's have a look at the VIX

434
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
month. Let's have a look at the VIX
 

435
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,710
month. Let's have a look at the VIX
because we're boxed in on the VIX as

436
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
because we're boxed in on the VIX as
 

437
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,910
because we're boxed in on the VIX as
well. So there you go. There's your box

438
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
well. So there you go. There's your box
 

439
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,550
well. So there you go. There's your box
in the VIX. What do I say is dangerous

440
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
in the VIX. What do I say is dangerous
 

441
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,190
in the VIX. What do I say is dangerous
about this? You can see this two drive.

442
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
about this? You can see this two drive.
 

443
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,790
about this? You can see this two drive.
All right, and failure down here and

444
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
All right, and failure down here and
 

445
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,430
All right, and failure down here and
we're making higher lows, right? When

446
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
we're making higher lows, right? When
 

447
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,590
we're making higher lows, right? When
did that last happen? There's your two

448
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
did that last happen? There's your two
 

449
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,829
did that last happen? There's your two
drive to the same point. Two drive and

450
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
drive to the same point. Two drive and
 

451
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,350
drive to the same point. Two drive and
making higher lows. And what happened

452
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
making higher lows. And what happened
 

453
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,509
making higher lows. And what happened
next? A ripup. I'm very concerned about

454
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
next? A ripup. I'm very concerned about
 

455
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,110
next? A ripup. I'm very concerned about
that. It can take months. It might take

456
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
that. It can take months. It might take
 

457
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,590
that. It can take months. It might take
another two two months to happen. But

458
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
another two two months to happen. But
 

459
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,829
another two two months to happen. But
this is concerning. The VIX really needs

460
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
this is concerning. The VIX really needs
 

461
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,590
this is concerning. The VIX really needs
to start breaking down back into this

462
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
to start breaking down back into this
 

463
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,910
to start breaking down back into this
box down here for bulls to really

464
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
box down here for bulls to really
 

465
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,550
box down here for bulls to really
continue this. If we keep holding here,

466
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
continue this. If we keep holding here,
 

467
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,389
continue this. If we keep holding here,
the tighter and the tighter it is, this

468
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
the tighter and the tighter it is, this
 

469
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,829
the tighter and the tighter it is, this
low here. I don't know why they're

470
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
low here. I don't know why they're
 

471
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,670
low here. I don't know why they're
holding that, but they are holding it.

472
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
holding that, but they are holding it.
 

473
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,389
holding that, but they are holding it.
And I'm observing it because this

474
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
And I'm observing it because this
 

475
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,230
And I'm observing it because this
Looks like a bit of a replication and

476
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
Looks like a bit of a replication and
 

477
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,150
Looks like a bit of a replication and
I'm very concerned about this move

478
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
I'm very concerned about this move
 

479
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,310
I'm very concerned about this move
happening. Either this side of Christmas

480
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
happening. Either this side of Christmas
 

481
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,190
happening. Either this side of Christmas
or early January. So I have my eye on

482
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
or early January. So I have my eye on
 

483
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,509
or early January. So I have my eye on
that. All right. This move here is the

484
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
that. All right. This move here is the
 

485
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,350
that. All right. This move here is the
same setup at the moment. So I am

486
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
same setup at the moment. So I am
 

487
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,670
same setup at the moment. So I am
concerned about it. No doubt about it.

488
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
concerned about it. No doubt about it.
 

489
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,750
concerned about it. No doubt about it.
Also got one eye on this 30y year. All

490
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
Also got one eye on this 30y year. All
 

491
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,590
Also got one eye on this 30y year. All
right. if we get back into these levels

492
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
right. if we get back into these levels
 

493
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,949
right. if we get back into these levels
and I am watching uh the JPY trade like

494
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
and I am watching uh the JPY trade like
 

495
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,509
and I am watching uh the JPY trade like
I talked about and looks a bit

496
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
I talked about and looks a bit
 

497
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,269
I talked about and looks a bit
uncontrollable breaking out at the

498
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
uncontrollable breaking out at the
 

499
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,509
uncontrollable breaking out at the
moment. All right, that's it. That's

500
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
moment. All right, that's it. That's
 

501
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,790
moment. All right, that's it. That's
what I'm watching. That's what I'm

502
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
what I'm watching. That's what I'm
 

503
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,630
what I'm watching. That's what I'm
looking for, folks. I couldn't make it

504
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
looking for, folks. I couldn't make it
 

505
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,870
looking for, folks. I couldn't make it
clearer for you this morning. All right,

506
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
clearer for you this morning. All right,
 

507
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,750
clearer for you this morning. All right,
we need to see a rejection of previous

508
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
we need to see a rejection of previous
 

509
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,590
we need to see a rejection of previous
days value. If we see that rejection of

510
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
days value. If we see that rejection of
 

511
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,150
days value. If we see that rejection of
previous days value area low, I'm

512
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
previous days value area low, I'm
 

513
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,230
previous days value area low, I'm
interested. If we don't see it, I'm

514
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
interested. If we don't see it, I'm
 

515
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,550
interested. If we don't see it, I'm
probably not interested in doing much.

516
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
probably not interested in doing much.
 

517
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,069
probably not interested in doing much.
All right. So, I want to see a lower

518
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
All right. So, I want to see a lower
 

519
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,190
All right. So, I want to see a lower
high created either here or in front of

520
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
high created either here or in front of
 

521
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,710
high created either here or in front of
there. I really don't want to see us

522
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
there. I really don't want to see us
 

523
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,630
there. I really don't want to see us
drift back into this. All right. We will

524
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
drift back into this. All right. We will
 

525
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,870
drift back into this. All right. We will
lose edge if we drift back into that.

526
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
lose edge if we drift back into that.
 

527
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,190
lose edge if we drift back into that.
So, that is what we're looking for in

528
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
So, that is what we're looking for in
 

529
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,030
So, that is what we're looking for in
this morning's session. I want to be

530
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
this morning's session. I want to be
 

531
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,030
this morning's session. I want to be
very careful if we start reclaiming it.

532
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
very careful if we start reclaiming it.
 

533
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,550
very careful if we start reclaiming it.
You guys like trading range and you want

534
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
You guys like trading range and you want
 

535
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,990
You guys like trading range and you want
to consider that a look below and fail

536
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
to consider that a look below and fail
 

537
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,910
to consider that a look below and fail
and go, by all means. But again, we

538
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
and go, by all means. But again, we
 

539
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,670
and go, by all means. But again, we
haven't taken out this low, right?

540
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
haven't taken out this low, right?
 

541
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,949
haven't taken out this low, right?
because we've left liquidity there,

542
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
because we've left liquidity there,
 

543
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,670
because we've left liquidity there,
which is why I want to be more focused

544
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
which is why I want to be more focused
 

545
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,670
which is why I want to be more focused
on this trade here before anything else.

546
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
on this trade here before anything else.
 

547
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,590
on this trade here before anything else.
If they protect that low and do this,

548
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
If they protect that low and do this,
 

549
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,269
If they protect that low and do this,
this will be a dirty move, but I won't

550
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
this will be a dirty move, but I won't
 

551
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,470
this will be a dirty move, but I won't
get caught in it because I will not

552
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
get caught in it because I will not
 

553
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,110
get caught in it because I will not
participate up here. All right, that is

554
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
participate up here. All right, that is
 

555
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,750
participate up here. All right, that is
me making it as clear as possible for

556
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
me making it as clear as possible for
 

557
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,670
me making it as clear as possible for
you guys and what I'm going to look for

558
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
you guys and what I'm going to look for
 

559
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,910
you guys and what I'm going to look for
today and the reasons as to why. There

560
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
today and the reasons as to why. There
 

561
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,470
today and the reasons as to why. There
has been a sentiment shift. You know,

562
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
has been a sentiment shift. You know,
 

563
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,230
has been a sentiment shift. You know,
this market, it's very resilient. It

564
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
this market, it's very resilient. It
 

565
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,910
this market, it's very resilient. It
might well just shake it off. It's done

566
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
might well just shake it off. It's done
 

567
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,110
might well just shake it off. It's done
a pretty good job of shaking it off uh

568
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
a pretty good job of shaking it off uh
 

569
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,870
a pretty good job of shaking it off uh
the last few months. I would say a

570
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
the last few months. I would say a
 

571
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,110
the last few months. I would say a
pretty good job.

572
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
pretty good job.
 

573
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,829

morning. Right, let's see what we get.

620
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
morning. Right, let's see what we get.
 

621
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,870
morning. Right, let's see what we get.
See, starting to see a reaction here

622
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
See, starting to see a reaction here
 

623
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,269
See, starting to see a reaction here
without sweeping that low. All right, so

624
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
without sweeping that low. All right, so
 

625
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,430
without sweeping that low. All right, so
same thing here. Let's just see if we

626
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
same thing here. Let's just see if we
 

627
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,230
same thing here. Let's just see if we
can drift up this morning. I guess the

628
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
can drift up this morning. I guess the
 

629
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,990
can drift up this morning. I guess the
one thing we didn't look at actually was

630
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
one thing we didn't look at actually was
 

631
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,670
one thing we didn't look at actually was
the MAC. We can go through very very

632
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
the MAC. We can go through very very
 

633
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,829
the MAC. We can go through very very
quickly. Um, but you would have seen the

634
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
quickly. Um, but you would have seen the
 

635
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,269
quickly. Um, but you would have seen the
same sentiment starting to come off. All

636
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
same sentiment starting to come off. All
 

637
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,829
same sentiment starting to come off. All
right, Apple good sales. All right, so

638
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
right, Apple good sales. All right, so
 

639
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,910
right, Apple good sales. All right, so
that's holding in a range. Going to open

640
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
that's holding in a range. Going to open
 

641
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,590
that's holding in a range. Going to open
up flat. Here comes the weakness. All

781
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,230
I would love to see this squeeze higher
first. I want a straight failure, but we

782
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
first. I want a straight failure, but we
 

783
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,550
first. I want a straight failure, but we
might just get straight furious here.

784
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
might just get straight furious here.
 

785
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,150
might just get straight furious here.
Booklet's heavy.

786
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160

 

787
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,990

Want to let this shake out a bit longer

788
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
Want to let this shake out a bit longer
 

789
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,350
Want to let this shake out a bit longer
before I get involved.

790
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360

 

791
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,350

We did base down here before curling.

792
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
We did base down here before curling.
 

793
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,710
We did base down here before curling.
Sorry, move this up a bit for you.

794
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
Sorry, move this up a bit for you.
 

795
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,509
Sorry, move this up a bit for you.
Would love a retest of 540 before we do

796
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
Would love a retest of 540 before we do
 

797
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,269
Would love a retest of 540 before we do
anything else. Really would, but we

798
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
anything else. Really would, but we
 

799
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,550
anything else. Really would, but we
might not get it. At the moment, we've

800
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
might not get it. At the moment, we've
 

801
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,470
might not get it. At the moment, we've
failed 500s, but I want to see if we can

802
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
failed 500s, but I want to see if we can
 

803
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,789
failed 500s, but I want to see if we can
get up into here. Come on, market. Go

804
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
get up into here. Come on, market. Go
 

805
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,789
get up into here. Come on, market. Go
on, do it. And then see if we can get a

806
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
on, do it. And then see if we can get a
 

807
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,069
on, do it. And then see if we can get a
reaction up there. That's what I'm

808
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
reaction up there. That's what I'm
 

809
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,750
reaction up there. That's what I'm
waiting for. Waiting patiently to see if

810
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
waiting for. Waiting patiently to see if
 

811
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,270
waiting for. Waiting patiently to see if
we can get up into here. Maybe even

812
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
we can get up into here. Maybe even
 

813
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,829
we can get up into here. Maybe even
above, but ideally not above. Ideally a

814
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
above, but ideally not above. Ideally a
 

815
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,270
above, but ideally not above. Ideally a
failure here, but they might drift it

816
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
failure here, but they might drift it
 

817
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,350
failure here, but they might drift it
into VWAP to start the day. Let's see.

818
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
into VWAP to start the day. Let's see.
 

819

not what you want to see across

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:29,669
not what you want to see across
everything right now.

873
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,830

Spiders back over those 680s. So that

874
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
Spiders back over those 680s. So that
 

875
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,669
Spiders back over those 680s. So that
gamma level holding that we talked

876
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
gamma level holding that we talked
 

877
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,510
gamma level holding that we talked
about. Here's the move into the 540s. If

878
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
about. Here's the move into the 540s. If
 

879
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,270
about. Here's the move into the 540s. If
they squeeze through this, they will

880
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
they squeeze through this, they will
 

881
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,710
they squeeze through this, they will
probably go for VWAP. You would want

882
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
probably go for VWAP. You would want
 

883
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,310
probably go for VWAP. You would want
them to sort of fail up here. This is

884
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
them to sort of fail up here. This is
 

885
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,710
them to sort of fail up here. This is
what I'm looking for. Some form of fail

886
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
what I'm looking for. Some form of fail
 

887
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,070
what I'm looking for. Some form of fail
up here. If they squeeze through it,

888
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
up here. If they squeeze through it,
 

889
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,470
up here. If they squeeze through it,
they'll probably go to VWAP. And that's

890
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
they'll probably go to VWAP. And that's
 

891
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,750
they'll probably go to VWAP. And that's
going to make it pretty hard to trade

892
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
going to make it pretty hard to trade
 

893
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,029
going to make it pretty hard to trade
because we're be going to be back inside

894
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
because we're be going to be back inside
 

895
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,710
because we're be going to be back inside
of yesterday's value if they do that,

896
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
of yesterday's value if they do that,
 

897
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,870
of yesterday's value if they do that,
which is not going to be ideal. We are

898
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
which is not going to be ideal. We are
 

899
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,110
which is not going to be ideal. We are
seeing some sellers come and try try and

900
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
seeing some sellers come and try try and
 

901
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,470
seeing some sellers come and try try and
join the tape here. So, let's see if

902
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
join the tape here. So, let's see if
 

903
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,350
join the tape here. So, let's see if
this is the move. These 500s are going

904
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
this is the move. These 500s are going
 

905
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,310
this is the move. These 500s are going
to be key now. Don't trust this market

906
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
to be key now. Don't trust this market
 

907
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,909
to be key now. Don't trust this market
one bit. I've made that very very clear

908
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
one bit. I've made that very very clear
 

909
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,669
one bit. I've made that very very clear
for a few days now. And that has not

910
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
for a few days now. And that has not
 

911
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,430
for a few days now. And that has not
changed this morning. Even worse, I

912
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
changed this morning. Even worse, I
 

913
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,430
changed this morning. Even worse, I
would say this morning even more

914
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
would say this morning even more
 

915
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,950
would say this morning even more
dangerous

916
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
dangerous
 

917
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,310

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
given what they've done the last few
 

919
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,230
given what they've done the last few
days. if they reclaim value, they can go

920
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
days. if they reclaim value, they can go
 

921
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,909
days. if they reclaim value, they can go
right back up to those highs as as if

922
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
right back up to those highs as as if
 

923
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,510
right back up to those highs as as if
nothing happened, as if the news was not

nothing happened, as if the news was not
 

925
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,630
nothing happened, as if the news was not
important. And leaving that um previous

926
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
important. And leaving that um previous
 

927
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,350
important. And leaving that um previous
day New York low is not going to be

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
day New York low is not going to be
 

929
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,070
day New York low is not going to be
pretty if they do that. Let's see here.

930
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080

 

931
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,750

Make your mind up, market.

have a chance here to at least take out

1096
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
have a chance here to at least take out
 

1097
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,350
have a chance here to at least take out
that low and they are just failing to do

1098
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
that low and they are just failing to do
 

1099
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,590
that low and they are just failing to do
anything.

1100
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
anything.
 

1101
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,990
anything.
It's the same story. I feel like we want

1102
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
It's the same story. I feel like we want
 

1103
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,669
It's the same story. I feel like we want
to take out the low but we're just

1104
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
to take out the low but we're just
 

1105
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,110
to take out the low but we're just
failing to do it and that's what's

1106
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
failing to do it and that's what's
 

1107
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,950
failing to do it and that's what's
notable at the moment and it's probably

1108
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
notable at the moment and it's probably
 

1109
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,310
notable at the moment and it's probably
because those sellers this morning got

1110
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
because those sellers this morning got
 

1111
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,070
because those sellers this morning got
trapped at those 70s that we talked

1112
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
trapped at those 70s that we talked
 

1113
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,549
trapped at those 70s that we talked
about. Once they get out the way there's

1114
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
about. Once they get out the way there's
 

1115
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,310
about. Once they get out the way there's
probably a wash but the moment maybe we

1116
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
probably a wash but the moment maybe we
 

1117
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,669
probably a wash but the moment maybe we
want to go all the way back to VWAP at

1118
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
want to go all the way back to VWAP at
 

1119
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,029
want to go all the way back to VWAP at
the moment is what it's starting to feel

1120
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
the moment is what it's starting to feel
 

1121
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,750
the moment is what it's starting to feel
like. Just chop here. Lower highs,

1122
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
like. Just chop here. Lower highs,
 

1123
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,669
like. Just chop here. Lower highs,
higher lows.

1124
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
higher lows.
 

1125
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,149
higher lows.
Once something snaps, it will get nasty.

1126
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159

 

1127
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,990

They've got to get under the 70s, these

1128
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
They've got to get under the 70s, these
 

1129
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,470
They've got to get under the 70s, these
bears. That's what they're looking for.

1130
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
bears. That's what they're looking for.
 

1131
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,470
bears. That's what they're looking for.
If they keep poking down here and being

1132
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
If they keep poking down here and being
 

1133
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,510
If they keep poking down here and being
absorbed, they're going to get

1134
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
absorbed, they're going to get
 

1135
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,230
absorbed, they're going to get
themselves in trouble.

1136
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
themselves in trouble.
 

1137
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:26,230
themselves in trouble.
And again,

1138
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240

 

1139
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,909

no follow through. Okay, we're just

1140
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
no follow through. Okay, we're just
 

1141
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:35,590
no follow through. Okay, we're just
still

1142
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600

 

1143
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,710

here in the 70s. This is the level. This

1144
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
here in the 70s. This is the level. This
 

1145
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,310
here in the 70s. This is the level. This
is the level they've got to get through.

1146
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
is the level they've got to get through.
 

1147
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,590
is the level they've got to get through.
This is where the bears are stuck.

1148
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
This is where the bears are stuck.
 

1149
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,110
This is where the bears are stuck.
They've got to get through this for

1150
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120
They've got to get through this for
 

1151
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,510
They've got to get through this for
downside action.

1152
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
downside action.
 

1153
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,029
downside action.
Like I said, the opening two minutes

1154
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
Like I said, the opening two minutes
 

1155
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,149
Like I said, the opening two minutes
this morning, they got stuck under 76

1156
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
this morning, they got stuck under 76
 

1157
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,110
this morning, they got stuck under 76
776.

1158
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
776.
 

1159
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,110
776.
That's what they got stuck. These two

1160
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
That's what they got stuck. These two
 

1161
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,110
That's what they got stuck. These two
wicks here are full of sell pressure and

1162
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
wicks here are full of sell pressure and
 

1163
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,350
wicks here are full of sell pressure and
there was a buyer absorbing them. They

1164
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
there was a buyer absorbing them. They
 

1165
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,549
there was a buyer absorbing them. They
need this move here. This is what

1166
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
need this move here. This is what
 

1167
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,149
need this move here. This is what
they're looking for. They've got to be

1168
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
they're looking for. They've got to be
 

1169
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,750
they're looking for. They've got to be
very careful cuz I know that they got

1170
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
very careful cuz I know that they got
 

1171
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,230
very careful cuz I know that they got
stuck here. That needs to flip.

1172
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240

 

1173
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,830

There has been a passive buyer here.

1174
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
There has been a passive buyer here.
 

1175
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,269
There has been a passive buyer here.
They're trying again. This is heavy,

1176
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
They're trying again. This is heavy,
 

1177
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,269
They're trying again. This is heavy,
heavy tape and they're being absorbed so

1178
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
heavy tape and they're being absorbed so
 

1179
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,750
heavy tape and they're being absorbed so
far. So, there's definitely been a

1180
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:15,760
far. So, there's definitely been a
 

1181
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,269
far. So, there's definitely been a
passive buyer here. If they snap through

1182
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
passive buyer here. If they snap through
 

1183
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,470
passive buyer here. If they snap through
this, we're going to go for that New

1184
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
this, we're going to go for that New
 

1185

Don't want reclaim of those 70s because

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
Don't want reclaim of those 70s because
 

1201
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,510
Don't want reclaim of those 70s because

1251
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,269

with the cash injection from the Fed

1252
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
with the cash injection from the Fed
 

1253
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,590
with the cash injection from the Fed
into the banks to try and save them and

1254
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
into the banks to try and save them and
 

1255
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,950
into the banks to try and save them and
their positions in Bitcoin. There you

1256
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960
their positions in Bitcoin. There you
 

1257
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,070
their positions in Bitcoin. There you
go. Reclaim this. That's why I didn't

1258
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
go. Reclaim this. That's why I didn't
 

1259
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,110
go. Reclaim this. That's why I didn't
touch it. Still, we're boxed in. All

1260
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
touch it. Still, we're boxed in. All
 

1261
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,909
touch it. Still, we're boxed in. All
right. Still we're boxed in.

1262
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
right. Still we're boxed in.
 

1263
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,190
right. Still we're boxed in.
Just got this feeling they need to get

1264
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
Just got this feeling they need to get
 

1265
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,750
Just got this feeling they need to get
up to VWAP and see what happens. Maybe

1266
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
up to VWAP and see what happens. Maybe
 

1267
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,510
up to VWAP and see what happens. Maybe
even close the gap. But I really don't

1268
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
even close the gap. But I really don't
 

1269
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,510
even close the gap. But I really don't
want to trade like I've talked about.

1270
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
want to trade like I've talked about.
 

1271
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,269
want to trade like I've talked about.
Don't really want to trade up here. They

1272
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:53,279
Don't really want to trade up here. They
 

1273
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,789
Don't really want to trade up here. They
may may be that they need to come up

1274
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:54,799
may may be that they need to come up
 

1275
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,149
may may be that they need to come up
here, but I really don't want to take

1276
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
here, but I really don't want to take
 

1277
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,909
here, but I really don't want to take
that trade. I really need them to reject

1278
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
that trade. I really need them to reject
 

1279
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:15,269
that trade. I really need them to reject
this if we're going to play lower.

1280
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279

 

1281
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,870

The Tesla and Apple the only ones red.

1282
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:16,880
The Tesla and Apple the only ones red.
 

1283
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,149
The Tesla and Apple the only ones red.
Everything else getting hammered here

1284
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
Everything else getting hammered here
 

1285
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,789
Everything else getting hammered here
this morning.

1286
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799

 

1287
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,789

Big still trading downside since the

1288
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:26,799
Big still trading downside since the
 

1289
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:38,390
Big still trading downside since the
open. It's not good.

1290
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,400

 

1291
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,549

Yes, grinding back up to VW up. So that

1292
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
Yes, grinding back up to VW up. So that
 

1293
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,390
Yes, grinding back up to VW up. So that
might come into play here if they start

1294
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:42,400
might come into play here if they start
 

1295
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,390
might come into play here if they start
rejecting VWAP and cause sell pressure

1296
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:44,400
rejecting VWAP and cause sell pressure
 

1297
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,630
rejecting VWAP and cause sell pressure
in the cues here. Might well come into

1298
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
in the cues here. Might well come into
 

1299
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:56,549
in the cues here. Might well come into
play.

1300
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,559

 

1301
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,430

Spy closed its gap I believe. Yes,

1302
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
Spy closed its gap I believe. Yes,
 

1303
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,750
Spy closed its gap I believe. Yes,
closed it gap pretty much there or

1304
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:01,760
closed it gap pretty much there or
 

1305
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,870
closed it gap pretty much there or
thereabouts

1306
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880

 

1307
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,634

and still we're boxed in.

1308
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:06,644
and still we're boxed in.
 

1309
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,310

1311
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,190
[sighs and gasps]
Smaller range there. 85 points range.

1312
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,200

 

1313
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,350

The draw for me is that low that white

1314
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360
The draw for me is that low that white
 

1315
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,070
The draw for me is that low that white
line that is the draw. Like finding a

1316
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
line that is the draw. Like finding a
 

1317
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,830
line that is the draw. Like finding a
way to get get involved in this now has

1318
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
way to get get involved in this now has
 

1319
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,269
way to get get involved in this now has
become hard because of how they've built

1320
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
become hard because of how they've built
 

1321
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:43,269
become hard because of how they've built
it out this morning.

1322
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279

 

1323
00:28:43,279 --> 00:29:04,389

Good rejection of the gap there.

1324
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399

 

1325
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,230

Well, the level was good.

1326
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
Well, the level was good.
 

1327
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,389
Well, the level was good.
The value area high value area low from

1328
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
The value area high value area low from
 

1329
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,750
The value area high value area low from
yesterday was good. Now we're just stuck

1330
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
yesterday was good. Now we're just stuck
 

1331
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,669
yesterday was good. Now we're just stuck
at the open.

1332
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
at the open.
 

1333
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,190
at the open.
Still think this wants to trade lower.

1334
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
Still think this wants to trade lower.
 

1335
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,190
Still think this wants to trade lower.
It's just when is spy done pushing. It's

1336
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
It's just when is spy done pushing. It's
 

1337
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,350
It's just when is spy done pushing. It's
over its VW up. It's pretty much closed

1338
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
over its VW up. It's pretty much closed
 

1339
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,990
over its VW up. It's pretty much closed
this gap. Maybe

1340
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
this gap. Maybe
 

1341
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,389
this gap. Maybe
scent or two away. The VIX is still

1342
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,399
scent or two away. The VIX is still
 

1343
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,149
scent or two away. The VIX is still
dripping downside. Just waiting to see

1344
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,159
dripping downside. Just waiting to see
 

1345
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:33,590
dripping downside. Just waiting to see
if there's a sentiment shift coming.

1346
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600

 

1347
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,870

Yeah, we do have PMI 945 and ISM at 10.

1348
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
Yeah, we do have PMI 945 and ISM at 10.
 

1349
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,870
Yeah, we do have PMI 945 and ISM at 10.
So

1350
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880

 

1351
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,310

yeah, there might be PMI 10 at 9:45 at

1352
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
yeah, there might be PMI 10 at 9:45 at
 

1353
00:29:46,320 --> 00:30:02,070
yeah, there might be PMI 10 at 9:45 at
10. So might well be waiting for that

1354
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080

 

1355
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,389

back down for those lows. Big rejection

1356
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
back down for those lows. Big rejection
 

1357
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,110
back down for those lows. Big rejection
on spiders there. SPY still above its

1358
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,120
on spiders there. SPY still above its
 

1359
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,549
on spiders there. SPY still above its
New York open. So, I'm just watching

1360
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
New York open. So, I'm just watching
 

1361
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,830
New York open. So, I'm just watching
that to see if sentiment comes uh to

1362
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:11,840
that to see if sentiment comes uh to
 

1363
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,470
that to see if sentiment comes uh to
stay heavy for the day. We start losing

1364
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
stay heavy for the day. We start losing
 

1365
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,870
stay heavy for the day. We start losing
those New York opens on the spiders.

1366
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880

 

1367
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,190

So far, it's held that 680 at big gamma

1368
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
So far, it's held that 680 at big gamma
 

1369
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,750
So far, it's held that 680 at big gamma
level on SPY. So, I am aware of that.

1370
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
level on SPY. So, I am aware of that.
 

1371
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,430
level on SPY. So, I am aware of that.
That's been propped up so far. It has

We should be taking out the lows here

We should be taking out the lows here
 

1397
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,990
We should be taking out the lows here

00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
about it, rejection of New York open
 

1409
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,430
about it, rejection of New York open
again there. We really should be taking

1410
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
again there. We really should be taking
 

1411
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,630
again there. We really should be taking
out lows and we're not. So spy back to

1412
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
out lows and we're not. So spy back to
 

1413
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,389
out lows and we're not. So spy back to
VWAP. Let's see if it finds a bid

1414
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
VWAP. Let's see if it finds a bid
 

1415
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,389
VWAP. Let's see if it finds a bid
through VWAP or if they sell it. This is

1416
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
through VWAP or if they sell it. This is
 

1417
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,310
through VWAP or if they sell it. This is
the third attempt it's had here. So, I'm

1418
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,320
the third attempt it's had here. So, I'm
 

1419
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,070
the third attempt it's had here. So, I'm
slightly concerned that a squeeze is

1420
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
slightly concerned that a squeeze is
 

1421
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,230
slightly concerned that a squeeze is
coming here.

1422
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240

 

1423
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,750

I'd love to see some follow through in

1424
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
I'd love to see some follow through in
 

1425
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,669
I'd love to see some follow through in
this market today after a day of no

1426
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
this market today after a day of no
 

1427
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,190
this market today after a day of no
follow through yesterday. Uh here comes

1428
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
follow through yesterday. Uh here comes
 

1429
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,750
follow through yesterday. Uh here comes
the squeeze because reclaimed VWAP and

1430
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:39,760
the squeeze because reclaimed VWAP and
 

1431
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,110
the squeeze because reclaimed VWAP and
we might go all the way back up to

1432
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
we might go all the way back up to
 

1433
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,870
we might go all the way back up to
previous day value area low and if they

1434
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
previous day value area low and if they
 

1435
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,029
previous day value area low and if they
reclaim that VWAP is possible. So,

1436
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:45,039
reclaim that VWAP is possible. So,
 

1437
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,350
reclaim that VWAP is possible. So,
markets

1438
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
markets
 

1439
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,110
markets
just got nothing to do here. No way I'm

1440
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,120
just got nothing to do here. No way I'm
 

1441
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,549
just got nothing to do here. No way I'm
trading this long side. You would have

1442
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:52,559
trading this long side. You would have
 

1443
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,389
trading this long side. You would have
to be a psychopath to trade this

1444
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399
to be a psychopath to trade this
 

1445
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,990
to be a psychopath to trade this
underneath value long side in my

1446
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,000
underneath value long side in my
 

1447
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,990
underneath value long side in my
opinion.

1448
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000

 

1449
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,269

Kind of amazing how how this market's

1450
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
Kind of amazing how how this market's
 

1451
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,230
Kind of amazing how how this market's
acted for I'd say quite a while now.

1452
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:10,240
acted for I'd say quite a while now.
 

1453
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,470
acted for I'd say quite a while now.
These like big moves like these two 300

1454
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
These like big moves like these two 300
 

1455
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,950
These like big moves like these two 300
point moves and then we get served with

1456
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:14,960
point moves and then we get served with
 

1457
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,149
point moves and then we get served with
this

1458
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:22,159

 

1459
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,669

sellers keep trying in these 80s and

1460
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
sellers keep trying in these 80s and
 

1461
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,710
sellers keep trying in these 80s and
they're not getting their way.

1462
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
they're not getting their way.
 

1463
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:36,389
they're not getting their way.
They're not getting their way.

1464
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:36,399

 

1465
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,070

Coming right up to that old pivot from

1466
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,080
Coming right up to that old pivot from
 

1467
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:50,710
Coming right up to that old pivot from
yesterday into these 500s.

1468
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:50,720

 

1469
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,430

Incredible the lack of follow through.

1470
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,440

 

1471
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,110

Market shrugging off the news by the

1472
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,120
Market shrugging off the news by the
 

1473
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,269
Market shrugging off the news by the
looks of it. Nothing to see here. The

1474
00:32:59,269 --> 00:32:59,279
looks of it. Nothing to see here. The
 

1475
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,007
looks of it. Nothing to see here. The
market saying everything's fine.

1476
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:04,017

 

1477
00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:13,430

[sighs]

1478
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,440

 

1479
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,950

Still at this New York open. Nothing's

1480
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
Still at this New York open. Nothing's
 

1481
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,470
Still at this New York open. Nothing's
changed, folks. From the moment we open

1482
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,480
changed, folks. From the moment we open
 

1483
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,230
changed, folks. From the moment we open
New York, we're still just in that same

1484
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
New York, we're still just in that same
 

1485
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,269
New York, we're still just in that same
exact same point. Waiting to see if we

1486
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:21,279
exact same point. Waiting to see if we
 

1487
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,630
exact same point. Waiting to see if we
see a sentiment shift here. Follow

1488
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:22,640
see a sentiment shift here. Follow
 

1489
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,630
see a sentiment shift here. Follow
through. There's I'm telling you now,

1490
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
through. There's I'm telling you now,
 

1491
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,750
through. There's I'm telling you now,
sellers cannot sell under 80. They tried

1492
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:27,760
sellers cannot sell under 80. They tried
 

1493
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,269
sellers cannot sell under 80. They tried
a few times this morning at the 70s.

1494
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:29,279
a few times this morning at the 70s.
 

1495
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,950
a few times this morning at the 70s.
They've been absorbed. I'd say the key

1496
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:30,960
They've been absorbed. I'd say the key
 

1497
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,190
They've been absorbed. I'd say the key
trigger now will will be those 70s. They

1498
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
trigger now will will be those 70s. They
 

1499
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,710
trigger now will will be those 70s. They
need to get followed through under 70s,

1500
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,720
need to get followed through under 70s,
 

1501
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,269
need to get followed through under 70s,
and they're not seeing that still.

1502
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
and they're not seeing that still.
 

1503
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,830
and they're not seeing that still.
Still not seeing that. There's the 80s

1504
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
Still not seeing that. There's the 80s
 

1505
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,590
Still not seeing that. There's the 80s
again.

1506
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600
again.
 

1507
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,509
again.
There's someone absorbing the tape down

1508
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:43,519
There's someone absorbing the tape down
 

1509
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:55,509
There's someone absorbing the tape down
there.

1510
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:55,519

 

1511
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,470

Back to the 500s.

1512
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,480
Back to the 500s.
 

1513
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,149
Back to the 500s.
I'd be very concerned about squeeze out

1514
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:00,159
I'd be very concerned about squeeze out
 

1515
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,149
I'd be very concerned about squeeze out
all the way up here right now. They

1516
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:02,159
all the way up here right now. They
 

1517
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,230
all the way up here right now. They
tried and tried and tried and tried and

1518
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
tried and tried and tried and tried and
 

1519
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,070
tried and tried and tried and tried and
tried and tried and they're trying too

1520
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
tried and tried and they're trying too
 

1521
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:15,430
tried and tried and they're trying too
low and they're not getting their way.

1522
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440

 

1523
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,030

They have the chance to take control,

1524
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
They have the chance to take control,
 

1525
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,710
They have the chance to take control,
but they are struggling.

1526
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720

 

1527
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,950

I want to see if Spy cracks 680, you're

1528
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:24,960
I want to see if Spy cracks 680, you're
 

1529
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,190
I want to see if Spy cracks 680, you're
going to see like more follow through.

1530
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
going to see like more follow through.
 

1531
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,589
going to see like more follow through.
All right, so you can have that alert

1532
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:29,599
All right, so you can have that alert
 

1533

there. I've still got it from yesterday.
 

1535
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,629
there. I've still got it from yesterday.
680 is the level on spy. You get

1536
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:32,639
680 is the level on spy. You get
 

1537
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,190
680 is the level on spy. You get
underneath that and uh know we can see

1538
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
underneath that and uh know we can see
 

1539
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,790
underneath that and uh know we can see
all hell break loose

1540
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:38,800
all hell break loose
 

1541
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,069
all hell break loose
that 70 again here.

1542
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
that 70 again here.
 

1543
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,909
that 70 again here.
Can they trade through this 70 and trade

1544
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,919
Can they trade through this 70 and trade
 

1545
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,230
Can they trade through this 70 and trade
down to these sort of 420s or something?

1546
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
down to these sort of 420s or something?
 

1547
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,310
down to these sort of 420s or something?
They trade under 70 and get down into

1548
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,320
They trade under 70 and get down into
 

1549
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,230
They trade under 70 and get down into
420s. So far this morning the answer has

1550
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240
420s. So far this morning the answer has
 

1551
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,750
420s. So far this morning the answer has
been no.

1552
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:55,760

 

1553
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,510

It's back to that New York open. If it

1554
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
It's back to that New York open. If it
 

1555
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,109
It's back to that New York open. If it
lets go this New York open and it trades

lets go this New York open and it trades
 

1557

But at the moment, you're not seeing

But at the moment, you're not seeing
 

1561

But at the moment, you're not seeing
that.

1563
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,230

They're trying here.

1564
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,240
They're trying here.
 

1565
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,230

Thank you.

Thank you, market. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Nice. All right, watching for

00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280
Thank you. Nice. All right, watching for
 

1725
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,630
Thank you. Nice. All right, watching for
this white line there. Can you hear me

1726
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
this white line there. Can you hear me
 

1727
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,990
this white line there. Can you hear me
say it? Now we're close. Now we're

1728
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
say it? Now we're close. Now we're
 

1729
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,510
say it? Now we're close. Now we're
getting follow through. Can literally

1730
00:38:59,510 --> 00:38:59,520
getting follow through. Can literally
 

1731
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,030
getting follow through. Can literally
see it happen on the tape in front of

1732
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040
see it happen on the tape in front of
 

1733
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,630
see it happen on the tape in front of
me. Right. So you need to see a

1734
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:02,640
me. Right. So you need to see a
 

1735
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,710
me. Right. So you need to see a
rejection of 60 now for follow through.

1736
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:04,720
rejection of 60 now for follow through.
 

1737
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,870
rejection of 60 now for follow through.
White line is your target. This is your

1738
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:06,880
White line is your target. This is your
 

1739
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,870
White line is your target. This is your
target TP1. And then we can get down

1740
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
target TP1. And then we can get down
 

1741
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,990
target TP1. And then we can get down
into these. Boom. Here you go, folks.

1742
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,000
into these. Boom. Here you go, folks.
 

1743
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,030
into these. Boom. Here you go, folks.
Here we go. Just have to be patient.

1744
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040

 

1745
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,790

Much better. Much much better. You're

1746
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800
Much better. Much much better. You're
 

1747
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,550
Much better. Much much better. You're
going to get this low here. So be

1748
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
going to get this low here. So be
 

1749
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,870
going to get this low here. So be
looking for a cover point into 15. And

1750
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
looking for a cover point into 15. And
 

1751
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,109
looking for a cover point into 15. And
then you're looking for 320s and then

1752
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:29,119
then you're looking for 320s and then
 

1753
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,990
then you're looking for 320s and then
previous week value area high 290s and

1754
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,000
previous week value area high 290s and
 

1755
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,550
previous week value area high 290s and
then we see if we get weak.

1756
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:34,560
then we see if we get weak.
 

1757
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,150
then we see if we get weak.
Well, it's a good good first trigger.

1758
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,160
Well, it's a good good first trigger.
 

1759
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,430
Well, it's a good good first trigger.
You need to see this reject now. If they

1760
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
You need to see this reject now. If they
 

1761
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,790
You need to see this reject now. If they
reclaim, you got to be flat on this

1762
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
reclaim, you got to be flat on this
 

1763
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,190
reclaim, you got to be flat on this
position. You just cannot afford this to

1764
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
position. You just cannot afford this to
 

1765
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,349

reclaim and start squeezing

1766
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:14,230

right back to V1. Wow.

1772
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240

 

1773
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,470

Um, well, you're asking for a lot for a

00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
Um, well, you're asking for a lot for a
 

1775
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,589
Um, well, you're asking for a lot for a
25k drop right now. It's 500 points

1776
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
25k drop right now. It's 500 points
 

1777
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,230
25k drop right now. It's 500 points
away, I think. Be realistic.

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:22,240
away, I think. Be realistic.

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,950

We flip on the tape there.

1782

1783
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,950

That delta flip was massive. That was a

That delta flip was massive. That was a

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,190

uh not a good look. I think we'll come

1792
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
uh not a good look. I think we'll come
 

1793
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,030
uh not a good look. I think we'll come
back for it later. There's no way we

1794
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
back for it later. There's no way we
 

1795

1796
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
protect that.
 

1797
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,550
protect that.
There's just no way. But

1798
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
There's just no way. But
 

1799
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,109
There's just no way. But
clearly someone quite happy to absorb

So, we sold hard through that uh seller

1804
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:00,960
So, we sold hard through that uh seller
 

1805
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,750
So, we sold hard through that uh seller
at 7080. Got down to 30. Big sellers

1806
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:03,760
at 7080. Got down to 30. Big sellers
 

1807
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,790
at 7080. Got down to 30. Big sellers
came in from 45 to 30. Then the delta

1808
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:06,800
came in from 45 to 30. Then the delta
 

1809
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,790
came in from 45 to 30. Then the delta
flipped on the next candle. Aggressive

1810
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
flipped on the next candle. Aggressive
 

1811
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,550
flipped on the next candle. Aggressive

1814
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,480
50 60 70 80. And now we just have to
 

1815
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:23,123
50 60 70 80. And now we just have to
wait and see.

1816
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:23,133

 

1817

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,990

Did we just tap? Oh, there we go. That's

1820
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,000
Did we just tap? Oh, there we go. That's
 

1821
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,710
Did we just tap? Oh, there we go. That's
why it's the gamma on spy again. So, we

1822
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720
why it's the gamma on spy again. So, we
 

1823
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,670
why it's the gamma on spy again. So, we
traded under 680. We traded a low for a

1824
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
traded under 680. We traded a low for a
 

1825
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,550
traded under 680. We traded a low for a
number of seconds to 7974 and then we

1826
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560
number of seconds to 7974 and then we
 

1827
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,349
number of seconds to 7974 and then we
closed straight back above it. Right? So

1828
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:41,359
closed straight back above it. Right? So
 

1829
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,190
closed straight back above it. Right? So
that last 5minute candle traded down to

that last 5minute candle traded down to
 

1831
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,390
that last 5minute candle traded down to
7970, got absorbed, closed right back at

7970, got absorbed, closed right back at
 

1833
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,710
7970, got absorbed, closed right back at
68061 and we're currently trading there

1834
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:48,720
68061 and we're currently trading there
 

1835
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,630
68061 and we're currently trading there
right now. It's all about that gamma

1836
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
right now. It's all about that gamma
 

1837
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,589
right now. It's all about that gamma
exposure on SPY right now. It's the

1838
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:53,599
exposure on SPY right now. It's the
 

1839
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,670
exposure on SPY right now. It's the
dealers. They don't want it under that

1840
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
dealers. They don't want it under that
 

1841
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,069

You do not want it under that.

1845
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,630

I did catch my money in that flush

1846
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
I did catch my money in that flush
 

1847
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,069
I did catch my money in that flush
though. I got aggressive with that. So,

1848
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
though. I got aggressive with that. So,
 

1849
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,829
though. I got aggressive with that. So,
I'm up about 600 per account right now.

1850
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:11,839
I'm up about 600 per account right now.
 

1851
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,589
I'm up about 600 per account right now.
So,

1852
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
So,
 

1853
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,349
So,
I'm all right with it. I can show you

1854
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,359
I'm all right with it. I can show you
 

1855
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,430
I'm all right with it. I can show you
before you all like whatever. Yeah. All

00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,440
before you all like whatever. Yeah. All
 

1857
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,390
before you all like whatever. Yeah. All

00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:20,400
right. So, I can just sit still if I
 

1859
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,074
right. So, I can just sit still if I
need to.

1949
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,710

When did I enter the short? Once I saw

1950
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:52,720
When did I enter the short? Once I saw
 

1951
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,390
When did I enter the short? Once I saw
the tape change. It was only a quick

1952
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,400
the tape change. It was only a quick
 

1953
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,990
the tape change. It was only a quick
short somewhere around here. It would

1954
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
short somewhere around here. It would
 

1955
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,390
short somewhere around here. It would
have been once the tape changed and I

1956
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
have been once the tape changed and I
 

1957
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,109
have been once the tape changed and I
saw the pacifier get nailed. So

1958
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
saw the pacifier get nailed. So
 

1959
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,349
saw the pacifier get nailed. So
somewhere in here wherever I called that

1960
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
somewhere in here wherever I called that
 

1961
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,270
somewhere in here wherever I called that
wherever I said the tape started to

1962
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
wherever I said the tape started to
 

1963
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,030
wherever I said the tape started to
shift. Okay, I'm ready. I'm like looking

1964
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,040
shift. Okay, I'm ready. I'm like looking
 

1965
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,030
shift. Okay, I'm ready. I'm like looking
at it now. Here comes the weakness.

1966
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,040
at it now. Here comes the weakness.
 

1967
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,630
at it now. Here comes the weakness.
Probably just in this 2 minutes. That's

1968
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
Probably just in this 2 minutes. That's
 

1969
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,430
Probably just in this 2 minutes. That's
all it was.

1970
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,440

 

1971
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,430

It didn't get to my target. TP1 was

1972
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
It didn't get to my target. TP1 was
 

1973
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,950
It didn't get to my target. TP1 was
here. So I had to take some off on the

1974
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
here. So I had to take some off on the
 

1975
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,109
here. So I had to take some off on the
flush down and never got anywhere near

1976
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:21,119
flush down and never got anywhere near
 

1977
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,309
flush down and never got anywhere near
down here. And we're seeing strength

1978
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:22,319
down here. And we're seeing strength
 

1979
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,309
down here. And we're seeing strength
now. So, I mean, I have to obey the

1980
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:24,319
now. So, I mean, I have to obey the
 

1981
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,230
now. So, I mean, I have to obey the
tape. If the tape doesn't want to move

1982
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
tape. If the tape doesn't want to move
 

1983
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:33,670
tape. If the tape doesn't want to move
lower, then we don't move lower.

1984
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680

 

1985
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,109

Uh, trade whatever you're better at

00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:35,119
Uh, trade whatever you're better at
 

1987
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,589
Uh, trade whatever you're better at

2005
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,750

this, this is the zone I don't want to

2006
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
this, this is the zone I don't want to
 

2007
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,589
this, this is the zone I don't want to
trade in today. Some of you like

2008
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:57,599
trade in today. Some of you like
 

2009
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,150
trade in today. Some of you like
rotation traders, maybe you like this. I

2010
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:00,160
rotation traders, maybe you like this. I
 

2011
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,829
rotation traders, maybe you like this. I
don't like this as a long if we've left

2012
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:01,839
don't like this as a long if we've left
 

2013
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,109
don't like this as a long if we've left
this, right? If we' taken this, then

2014
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
this, right? If we' taken this, then
 

2015
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,870
this, right? If we' taken this, then
maybe I'd be more willing to take this

2016
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
maybe I'd be more willing to take this
 

2017
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,550
maybe I'd be more willing to take this
trade up here. But right now, the fact

2018
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
trade up here. But right now, the fact
 

2019
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,390
trade up here. But right now, the fact
that we've left this in with so much

2020
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,400
that we've left this in with so much
 

2021
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,710
that we've left this in with so much
liquidity built, uh, I'm not taking

2022
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
liquidity built, uh, I'm not taking
 

2023
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,710
liquidity built, uh, I'm not taking
that. That is a high-risisk trade in my

2024
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:14,720
that. That is a high-risisk trade in my
 

2025
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,790
that. That is a high-risisk trade in my
opinion. So, this is previous day's

2026
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:16,800

00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,240
like trading rotation, especially in
 

2183
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,230
like trading rotation, especially in
markets where both sides are trapped.

2184
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:30,240
markets where both sides are trapped.
 

2185
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,430
markets where both sides are trapped.
All right, it's very different to

2186
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:31,440
All right, it's very different to
 

2187
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,910
All right, it's very different to
trading like an IB rotation. This is a

2188
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
trading like an IB rotation. This is a
 

2189
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,230
trading like an IB rotation. This is a
market currently where we have many,

2190
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:36,240
market currently where we have many,
 

2191
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,069
market currently where we have many,
many buyers trapped up here. Remember

2192
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:38,079
many buyers trapped up here. Remember
 

2193
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,230
many buyers trapped up here. Remember
this is a two week balanced range up

2194
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:40,240
this is a two week balanced range up
 

2195
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,950
this is a two week balanced range up
here as well of supply. They got caught

2196
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
here as well of supply. They got caught
 

2197
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,630
here as well of supply. They got caught
washed on. So buyers are trapped over

2198
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:44,640
washed on. So buyers are trapped over
 

2199
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,390
washed on. So buyers are trapped over
here. Sellers are trapped from 80 and

2200
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400
here. Sellers are trapped from 80 and
 

2201
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,470
here. Sellers are trapped from 80 and
below. All right. And now we're in

2202
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:48,480
below. All right. And now we're in
 

2203
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,150
below. All right. And now we're in
between these these levels. All right.

2204
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
between these these levels. All right.
 

2205
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,150
between these these levels. All right.
So you'd expect some reaction up here.

2206
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,160
So you'd expect some reaction up here.
 

2207
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,990
So you'd expect some reaction up here.
But the market's been very very

2208
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,000
But the market's been very very
 

2209
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,230
But the market's been very very
resilient. It has been very very

2210
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,240
resilient. It has been very very
 

2211
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,309
resilient. It has been very very
resilient.

2212
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319

2213
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,030
resilient.
Right. If you're bullish and you like

2214
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,040
Right. If you're bullish and you like
 

2215
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,870
Right. If you're bullish and you like
trading rotation, what you'd want to see

2216
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
trading rotation, what you'd want to see
 

2217
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,190
trading rotation, what you'd want to see
is some hold of this to complete that

2218
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,200
is some hold of this to complete that
 

2219
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,870
is some hold of this to complete that
move to previous day point of control.

2220
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:06,880
move to previous day point of control.
 

2221
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,670
move to previous day point of control.
Now, let's get some volume on here.

2222
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:09,680
Now, let's get some volume on here.
 

2223
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,910
Now, let's get some volume on here.
We've gone [snorts]

2224
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:11,920
We've gone [snorts]
 

2225
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,589
We've gone [snorts]
right. You'd want them to hold previous

2226
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:13,599
right. You'd want them to hold previous
 

2227
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,109
right. You'd want them to hold previous
day value to get to previous day point

2228
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:15,119
day value to get to previous day point
 

2229
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,109
day value to get to previous day point
of control. Gap fill is the yellow line

2230
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:17,119
of control. Gap fill is the yellow line
 

2231
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,549
of control. Gap fill is the yellow line
here and then previous day value area

2232
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559
here and then previous day value area
 

2233
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,230
here and then previous day value area
high. If you are playing a bullish

2234
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,240
high. If you are playing a bullish
 

2235
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,870
high. If you are playing a bullish
rotation, that's what you'd want. I'm

2236
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880
rotation, that's what you'd want. I'm
 

2237
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,430
rotation, that's what you'd want. I'm
somewhat skeptical knowing that above

2238
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:25,440
somewhat skeptical knowing that above
 

2239
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,829
somewhat skeptical knowing that above
this everyone's stuck. All right. So, I

2240
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
this everyone's stuck. All right. So, I
 

2241
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,589
this everyone's stuck. All right. So, I
think that's still possible, but I will

2242
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:29,599
think that's still possible, but I will
 

2243
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,790
think that's still possible, but I will
not just be trying to frontr run this or

2244
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:32,800
not just be trying to frontr run this or
 

2245
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,470
not just be trying to frontr run this or
get front side of it because if they

2246
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:34,480
get front side of it because if they
 

2247
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,630
get front side of it because if they
want to keep going higher, they will.

2248
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:36,640
want to keep going higher, they will.
 

2249
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,390
want to keep going higher, they will.
Bit like yesterday

2250
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:40,400

 

2251
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,630

took the rotation from yesterday's IB

2252
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
took the rotation from yesterday's IB
 

2253
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,549
took the rotation from yesterday's IB
low. There was a buyer there holding it

2254
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:44,559
low. There was a buyer there holding it
 

2255
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,230
low. There was a buyer there holding it
with a with a passion. There was indeed

2256
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:46,240
with a with a passion. There was indeed
 

2257
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,990
with a with a passion. There was indeed
a buyer holding it up with a passion.

2258
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,000
a buyer holding it up with a passion.
 

2259
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,309
a buyer holding it up with a passion.
You're right. Every drop from 70 and

2260
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:50,319
You're right. Every drop from 70 and
 

2261
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,470
You're right. Every drop from 70 and
below he just absorb absorb absorb. So

2262
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:52,480
below he just absorb absorb absorb. So
 

2263
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,390
below he just absorb absorb absorb. So
that's a good read on the tape from you

2264
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
that's a good read on the tape from you
 

2265

that's a good read on the tape from you
forward.

Coming all the way down to 1650. Closed

its own gap now. Coming back down

00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:18,880
its own gap now. Coming back down
 

2285
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,430
its own gap now. Coming back down
towards previous day low on the VIX. So,

2286
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:21,440
towards previous day low on the VIX. So,
 

2287
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,790
towards previous day low on the VIX. So,
if you're bullish, you would want this

if you're bullish, you would want this
 

2289
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,790
if you're bullish, you would want this
to hold this previous day value area low

2290
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:24,800
to hold this previous day value area low
 

2291
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,630
to hold this previous day value area low

00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,069

middle of of the two. So from a
 

2341
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,430

technical point of view, it's not very

technical point of view, it's not very

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,261
technical point of view, it's not very
nice.

00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,470
up there, but uh I would say like I
talked about se 70s. All those candles

00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
talked about se 70s. All those candles
 

2355
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,390
talked about se 70s. All those candles
we had market buying above 70s and we

we had market buying above 70s and we
 

2357
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,750
we had market buying above 70s and we
didn't move higher which means there was

2358
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:05,760
didn't move higher which means there was
 

2359
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,589
didn't move higher which means there was
a passive seller up there. He's actually

2360
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
a passive seller up there. He's actually
 

2361
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,390
a passive seller up there. He's actually
still on the book up there at 80. Let me

So, I maintain what I said on Twitter
last night. I maintain until we see spy

last night. I maintain until we see spy
 

2551
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,430

let go of 680, I don't think you see

2552
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:17,440
let go of 680, I don't think you see
 

2553
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,150
let go of 680, I don't think you see
more pain in the market.

2554
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
more pain in the market.
 

2555
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:31,750

That is definitely a dealer's level.

2556
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760

 

2557

coffee while this shakes out.

2560
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160

 

2561
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,710

Tricky market today, folks. You're still

2562
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
Tricky market today, folks. You're still
 

2563
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,109

inside of the 15minute range. All right,

2564
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
inside of the 15minute range. All right,
 

2565
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,789
inside of the 15minute range. All right,
so

2566
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:22,799
so
 

2567
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,390
so
we're not really finding acceptance

2568
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
we're not really finding acceptance
 

2569
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,309
we're not really finding acceptance

00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:33,109
outside of this right now. All right.
So, that's telling you

2572
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:33,119

 

2573
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,750

sellers have the ability, they have the

2574
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:35,760
sellers have the ability, they have the
 

2575
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,829
sellers have the ability, they have the
ability to finish this, complete this

2576
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:37,839
ability to finish this, complete this
 

2577
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,230
ability to finish this, complete this
rotation. If you took this, I don't

2578
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240
rotation. If you took this, I don't
 

2579
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,750
rotation. If you took this, I don't
blame you in taking this. Like, I'm kind

2580
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:41,760
blame you in taking this. Like, I'm kind
 

2581
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,990
blame you in taking this. Like, I'm kind
of okay with where I'm at at the moment

2582
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,000
of okay with where I'm at at the moment
 

2583
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,390
of okay with where I'm at at the moment
on the day, but I don't blame you for

2584
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:46,400
on the day, but I don't blame you for
 

2585
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,390
on the day, but I don't blame you for
taking that as a sell or look above and

2586
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,400
taking that as a sell or look above and
 

2587
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,390
taking that as a sell or look above and
fail, but that needs to be TP1 and this

2588
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
fail, but that needs to be TP1 and this
 

2589
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,470
fail, but that needs to be TP1 and this
is TP2. And weakness can be all the way

2590
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:52,480
is TP2. And weakness can be all the way
 

2591
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,549
is TP2. And weakness can be all the way
down here. But we're not really seeing a

2592
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:54,559
down here. But we're not really seeing a
 

2593
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,150
down here. But we're not really seeing a
weakness come into the market, broader

2594
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:56,160
weakness come into the market, broader
 

2595
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,829
weakness come into the market, broader
market, which is why I'm just waiting.

2596
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:57,839
market, which is why I'm just waiting.

market, which is why I'm just waiting.
You are starting to see spy come back

2598
00:58:59,670 --> 00:58:59,680
You are starting to see spy come back
 

2599
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,549
You are starting to see spy come back
down and try and test New York open. I

2600
00:59:02,549 --> 00:59:02,559
down and try and test New York open. I
 

2601
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,069
down and try and test New York open. I
think if we start flushing New York

2602
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:04,079
think if we start flushing New York
 

2603
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,950
think if we start flushing New York
open, if we see a rotation out of the

2604
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:06,960
open, if we see a rotation out of the
 

2605
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,630
open, if we see a rotation out of the
broader market, let me just check what's

2606
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:08,640
broader market, let me just check what's
 

2607
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,750
broader market, let me just check what's
going on here.

2608
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:11,760
going on here.
 

2609
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,370
going on here.

Still looking okay. B market is still

Still looking okay. B market is still

these 500s. [sighs] I think there's a

2618
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
these 500s. [sighs] I think there's a
 

2619
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,549
these 500s. [sighs] I think there's a
flush potentially coming in this market.

2620
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:42,559

 

2621
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:51,750

All depends. We get a rotation border.

2622
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,760

 

2623
00:59:51,760 --> 01:00:00,309

still holding on right now. DWP

2624
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:00,319

 

2625
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,069

problem is what we're seeing again just

2626
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:02,079
problem is what we're seeing again just
 

2627
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,750
problem is what we're seeing again just
happened the last two candles sellers

2628
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:03,760
happened the last two candles sellers
 

2629
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,150
happened the last two candles sellers
tried to sell those lows at 500 didn't

2630
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:06,160
tried to sell those lows at 500 didn't
 

2631
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,430
tried to sell those lows at 500 didn't
get their way. So why we're just getting

2632
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:07,440
get their way. So why we're just getting
 

2633
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,750
get their way. So why we're just getting
these whip whip saws. So in here you had

2634
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:11,760
these whip whip saws. So in here you had
 

2635
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,349
these whip whip saws. So in here you had
aggressive selling and we didn't move

2636
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:13,359
aggressive selling and we didn't move
 

2637
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,950
aggressive selling and we didn't move
lower. So you have got that passive

2638
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:14,960
lower. So you have got that passive
 

2639
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,109
lower. So you have got that passive

2643
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,430
70s and 80s probably sat here now trying
to absorb. I'd say all the time this

2644
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:21,440
to absorb. I'd say all the time this
 

2645
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,470
to absorb. I'd say all the time this

That's this is this big participant

01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,990

Okay, we used this buyer's pain, roll

Okay, we used this buyer's pain, roll
 

2715
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,470
Okay, we used this buyer's pain, roll
over, sold back down to the lows, but we

2716
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
over, sold back down to the lows, but we
 

2717
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,150
over, sold back down to the lows, but we
had big selling down here without the

01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,160
had big selling down here without the
 

2719
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,589
had big selling down here without the
ability to move lower, which means there

2720
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:27,599
ability to move lower, which means there
 

2721
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,390
ability to move lower, which means there
was a passive buyer sat down here. He

2722
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:30,400
was a passive buyer sat down here. He
 

2723
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,710
was a passive buyer sat down here. He
got his breakout above 500s. Okay, and

2724
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:32,720
got his breakout above 500s. Okay, and
 

2725
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,470
got his breakout above 500s. Okay, and
we're coming back and testing this same

2726
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
we're coming back and testing this same
 

2727
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,230
we're coming back and testing this same
level where he just absorbed and

2728
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
level where he just absorbed and
 

2729
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,990
level where he just absorbed and
absorbed and absorbed. Right. So, just

2730
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,000
absorbed and absorbed. Right. So, just
 

2731
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,710
absorbed and absorbed. Right. So, just
this level here

2732
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:40,720
this level here
 

2733
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,390
this level here
where he's just been gobbling everything

2734
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400
where he's just been gobbling everything
 

2735
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,670
where he's just been gobbling everything
up. And you can see like he got pained.

2736
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
up. And you can see like he got pained.
 

2737
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,510
up. And you can see like he got pained.
He probably passively bought even more

2738
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:47,520
He probably passively bought even more
 

2739
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,349
He probably passively bought even more
here, came back above. We're still

2740
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:49,359
here, came back above. We're still
 

2741
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:50,789
here, came back above. We're still
holding this level. So, until there's a

01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:50,799
holding this level. So, until there's a
 

2743
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,870
holding this level. So, until there's a
break underneath this level where this

2744
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:52,880
break underneath this level where this
 

2745
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,950
break underneath this level where this
guy's been absorbing the tape, we're not

2747
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,710
guy's been absorbing the tape, we're not
going to get a bigger move. He's

2748
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
going to get a bigger move. He's
 

2749
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,990
going to get a bigger move. He's
basically putting his wall down saying,

2750
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
basically putting his wall down saying,
 

2751
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,430
basically putting his wall down saying,
"Hey, I don't want to move under this

2752
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,440
"Hey, I don't want to move under this
 

2753
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,270
"Hey, I don't want to move under this
right now." And this basically coincides

2754
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:01,280
right now." And this basically coincides
 

2755
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,150

01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,640
the level two and the tape without it.
 

2807
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,309
the level two and the tape without it.
Like if I see the tape, like when you

2808
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:30,319
Like if I see the tape, like when you
 

2809
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,950
Like if I see the tape, like when you
see the tape flash red and it moves

2810
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
see the tape flash red and it moves
 

2811
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,029
see the tape flash red and it moves
really quick,

2812
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:35,039
really quick,
 

2813
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,789
really quick,
I can't see the size going through that

2814
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:36,799
I can't see the size going through that
 

2815
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,390
I can't see the size going through that
quick enough. But I can on bookmark

2816
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:38,400
quick enough. But I can on bookmark
 

2817
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,750
quick enough. But I can on bookmark
because it leaves it there for me to

2818
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,760
because it leaves it there for me to
 

2819
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:46,549
because it leaves it there for me to
hover my mouse over and recheck.

2820
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:46,559

 

2821
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,470

So, I don't care about it like while

2822
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
So, I don't care about it like while
 

2823
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,309
So, I don't care about it like while
we're just sort of doing nothing like we

2824
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:50,319
we're just sort of doing nothing like we
 

2825
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,510
we're just sort of doing nothing like we
are now. I care about it when I come to

2826
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:53,520
are now. I care about it when I come to
 

2827
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,309
are now. I care about it when I come to
a level. So, I care about, you know,

2828
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:56,319
a level. So, I care about, you know,
 

2829
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,150
a level. So, I care about, you know,
bookmap or footprints or anything like

2830
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:58,160
bookmap or footprints or anything like
 

2831
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,589
bookmap or footprints or anything like
that or level two, however you want to

2832
01:04:59,589 --> 01:04:59,599
that or level two, however you want to
 

2833
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,829
that or level two, however you want to
read it. When we come to here, I care

2834
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:01,839
read it. When we come to here, I care
 

2835
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,870
read it. When we come to here, I care
about it when we're around here. When

2836
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:04,880
about it when we're around here. When
 

2837
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,710
about it when we're around here. When
we're around here, in between this, I

2838
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:06,720
we're around here, in between this, I
 

2839
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,990
we're around here, in between this, I
don't really care so much because I

2840
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,000
don't really care so much because I
 

2841
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,109
don't really care so much because I
don't really care about the charts at

2842
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:09,119
don't really care about the charts at
 

2843
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,270
don't really care about the charts at
all at that point. I try and turn my

2844
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:11,280
all at that point. I try and turn my
 

2845
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,990
all at that point. I try and turn my
brain off when we're not at a level,

2846
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,000
brain off when we're not at a level,
 

2847
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,430
brain off when we're not at a level,
wait for it to come to a level of

2848
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,440
wait for it to come to a level of
 

2849
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,430
wait for it to come to a level of
interest, and then I start caring. Same

2850
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
interest, and then I start caring. Same
 

2851
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,710
interest, and then I start caring. Same
about the one minute chart. Like I'm

2852
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:20,720
about the one minute chart. Like I'm
 

2853
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,069
about the one minute chart. Like I'm
looking at the five-minute chart most of

2854
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:22,079
looking at the five-minute chart most of
 

2855
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,390
looking at the five-minute chart most of
the time until we come into a level or

2856
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
the time until we come into a level or
 

2857
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,390
the time until we come into a level or
one or even an hourly chart until we

2858
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:26,400
one or even an hourly chart until we
 

2859
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,349
one or even an hourly chart until we
come into a level.

2860
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359
come into a level.
 

2861
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,910
come into a level.
We have just gone wick to wick on the

2862
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:31,920
We have just gone wick to wick on the
 

2863
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,150
We have just gone wick to wick on the
hourly. We just missed it. All right.

2864
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:34,160
hourly. We just missed it. All right.
 

2865
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,270
hourly. We just missed it. All right.
So, if we go to an hourly,

2866
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:39,280

 

2867
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:46,069

we're trading into this right now,

2868
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:46,079

 

2869
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,270

right? So, we're leaving these

2870
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,280
right? So, we're leaving these
 

2871
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,190
right? So, we're leaving these
participants stuck. Imagine you were a

2872
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
participants stuck. Imagine you were a
 

2873
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,029
participants stuck. Imagine you were a
buyer here overnight or yesterday at the

2874
01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:51,039
buyer here overnight or yesterday at the
 

2875
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,349
buyer here overnight or yesterday at the
close, right? And and just think about

2876
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:53,359
close, right? And and just think about
 

2877
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,150
close, right? And and just think about
what the tone's been. If we go to a

2878
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:56,160
what the tone's been. If we go to a
 

2879
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,990
what the tone's been. If we go to a
daily,

2880
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
daily,
 

2881
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,670
daily,
think about what the tone has been.

2882
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:03,680

 

2883
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,990

Buy the close, buy the open, sell the

2884
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,000
Buy the close, buy the open, sell the
 

2885
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,470
Buy the close, buy the open, sell the
close. Buy the close, buy the open, sell

2886
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,480
close. Buy the close, buy the open, sell
 

2887
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,390
close. Buy the close, buy the open, sell
the close. Buy the previous day close,

2888
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
the close. Buy the previous day close,
 

2889
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,630
the close. Buy the previous day close,
buy the open, sell the close. Rinse,

2890
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
buy the open, sell the close. Rinse,
 

2891
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,549
buy the open, sell the close. Rinse,
repeat, rinse, repeat. Think what

2892
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:14,559
repeat, rinse, repeat. Think what
 

2893
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,069
repeat, rinse, repeat. Think what
happened last night. If you bought the

2894
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
happened last night. If you bought the
 

2895
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,670
happened last night. If you bought the
close or bought the open, that you're

2896
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:17,680
close or bought the open, that you're
 

2897
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,910
close or bought the open, that you're
underwater right now. But the pain's

2898
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
underwater right now. But the pain's
 

2899
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,150
underwater right now. But the pain's
going to come when we trade under 400s.

2900
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
going to come when we trade under 400s.
 

2901
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,990
going to come when we trade under 400s.
That's where we get the move underneath

2902
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,000
That's where we get the move underneath
 

2903
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,990
That's where we get the move underneath
that. Before that, like I talked about,

2904
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:26,000
that. Before that, like I talked about,
 

2905
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,710
that. Before that, like I talked about,
this is still an inside bar. All right,

2906
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:28,720
this is still an inside bar. All right,
 

2907
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,670
this is still an inside bar. All right,
we can if they just want to pin this.

2908
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
we can if they just want to pin this.
 

2909
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,270
we can if they just want to pin this.
All right. If market makers want to pin

2910
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:33,280
All right. If market makers want to pin
 

2911
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,230
All right. If market makers want to pin
this and do this until next Wednesday

2912
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:36,240
this and do this until next Wednesday
 

2913
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,630
this and do this until next Wednesday
and maybe we do the cut, all right, and

2914
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,640
and maybe we do the cut, all right, and
 

2915
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,150
and maybe we do the cut, all right, and
then they drive it up into this and

2916
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:40,160
then they drive it up into this and
 

2917
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,829
then they drive it up into this and
maybe they resell it from there on the

2918
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:41,839
maybe they resell it from there on the
 

2919
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,470
maybe they resell it from there on the
Thursday. Or maybe, you know, Pal says,

2920
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:44,480
Thursday. Or maybe, you know, Pal says,
 

2921
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,789
Thursday. Or maybe, you know, Pal says,
"Fuck your cut. Was only kidding." And

2922
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
"Fuck your cut. Was only kidding." And
 

2923
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,430
"Fuck your cut. Was only kidding." And
we drop down. I don't know. But we can

2924
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:49,440
we drop down. I don't know. But we can
 

2925
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,670
we drop down. I don't know. But we can
pin in here a while. And we can do

2926
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:51,680
pin in here a while. And we can do
 

2927
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,349
pin in here a while. And we can do
something like this. All right. We can

2928
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:53,359
something like this. All right. We can
 

2929
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,829
something like this. All right. We can
do something like this. Pin it in here

2930
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:55,839
do something like this. Pin it in here
 

2931
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,349
do something like this. Pin it in here
all the way into Christmas. It can

2932
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:57,359
all the way into Christmas. It can
 

2933
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:00,549
all the way into Christmas. It can
happen, folks. It can absolutely happen.

2934
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:00,559
happen, folks. It can absolutely happen.
 

2935
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,309
happen, folks. It can absolutely happen.
We're just trading like basically at the

2936
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:02,319
We're just trading like basically at the
 

2937
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,789
We're just trading like basically at the
mean like 5day, 20-day, 50-day. We're

2938
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:04,799
mean like 5day, 20-day, 50-day. We're
 

2939
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,150
mean like 5day, 20-day, 50-day. We're
not at the top bowl. We're not at the

2940
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:06,160
not at the top bowl. We're not at the
 

2941
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,270
not at the top bowl. We're not at the
bottom bowl for me. This pullback is not

2942
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
bottom bowl for me. This pullback is not
 

2943
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,230
bottom bowl for me. This pullback is not
enough. I want to see like a two-day

2944
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:12,240
enough. I want to see like a two-day
 

2945
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,710
enough. I want to see like a two-day
pullback or something into here and have

2946
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:14,720
pullback or something into here and have
 

2947
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,549
pullback or something into here and have
this protected for buyers. And then if

2948
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:16,559
this protected for buyers. And then if
 

2949
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,710
this protected for buyers. And then if
buyers protect that, then I know, okay,

2950
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
buyers protect that, then I know, okay,
 

2951
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,549
buyers protect that, then I know, okay,
game's on. We want to go back to highs.

2952
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:20,559
game's on. We want to go back to highs.
 

2953
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,270
game's on. We want to go back to highs.
But buying up here, I don't think any I

2954
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,280
But buying up here, I don't think any I
 

2955
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,029
But buying up here, I don't think any I
think this is the problem, right? I

2956
01:07:25,029 --> 01:07:25,039
think this is the problem, right? I
 

2957
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,670
think this is the problem, right? I

Yeah, it was it was Microsoft news
 

3233
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,550
Yeah, it was it was Microsoft news
basically saying that I think they've

3234
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
basically saying that I think they've
 

3235
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,630
basically saying that I think they've
just said there's lack of demand for uh

3236
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:56,640
just said there's lack of demand for uh
 

3237
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,470
just said there's lack of demand for uh
the AI products, less than anticipated.

3238
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,480
the AI products, less than anticipated.
 

3239
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,470
the AI products, less than anticipated.
So obviously that affects all the chip

3240
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:02,480
So obviously that affects all the chip
 

3241
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,790
So obviously that affects all the chip
makers

3242
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
makers
 

3243
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,270
makers
because we're investing so heavily into

3244
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:07,280
because we're investing so heavily into
 

3245
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,030
because we're investing so heavily into
chips and data centers and all this

3246
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,040
chips and data centers and all this
 

3247
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,229
chips and data centers and all this
stuff for the AI. So if there's lack of

3248
01:14:12,229 --> 01:14:12,239
stuff for the AI. So if there's lack of
 

3249
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,870
stuff for the AI. So if there's lack of
demand then suddenly your books don't

3250
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
demand then suddenly your books don't
 

3251
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,310
demand then suddenly your books don't
look so good because you're investing in

3252
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:16,320
look so good because you're investing in
 

3253
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,990
look so good because you're investing in
something which isn't as popular as once

3254
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
something which isn't as popular as once
 

3255
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,790
something which isn't as popular as once
thought. So that's what it was. I can

3256
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:20,800
thought. So that's what it was. I can
 

3257
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,470
thought. So that's what it was. I can
try and find the actual headline for

3258
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:22,480
try and find the actual headline for

acceptance into yesterday's range. It is
simple as that. This remember this is my

[snorts] We're starting to see some

3396
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:42,880
[snorts] We're starting to see some
 

3397
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,790
[snorts] We're starting to see some
weakness come in back down to this New

3398
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
weakness come in back down to this New
 

3399
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,229
weakness come in back down to this New
York open again. All right. So, if we

3400
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
York open again. All right. So, if we
 

3401
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,149
York open again. All right. So, if we
don't protect this, we go red and we

3402
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:48,159
don't protect this, we go red and we
 

3403
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,310
don't protect this, we go red and we
come back down probably towards at least

3404
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,320
come back down probably towards at least
 

3405
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,790
come back down probably towards at least
value area low. You can see this is your

3406
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
value area low. You can see this is your
 

3407
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,149
value area low. You can see this is your
level where Mr. Million bids, right,

We haven't seen something like

01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:14,320
We haven't seen something like
 

3581
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,270
We haven't seen something like
this to risk off to come down. Recently,

3582

they've just done these sort of straight

3584
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,040
they've just done these sort of straight
 

3585
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,709
they've just done these sort of straight
moves.

3586
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:20,719
moves.
 

3587
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,390

It wasn't too bad. At least that was a

3588
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:22,400
It wasn't too bad. At least that was a
 

3589
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,030
It wasn't too bad. At least that was a
crack off two sell signals, but it was

3590
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:25,040
crack off two sell signals, but it was
 

3591
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:32,470
crack off two sell signals, but it was
messy.

3592
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:32,480

 

3593
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,629

It's a bigger problem as well is higher

3594
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639
It's a bigger problem as well is higher
 

3595
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,149
It's a bigger problem as well is higher
time frame at the moment remains

3596
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:36,159
time frame at the moment remains
 

3597
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,830
time frame at the moment remains
bullish, doesn't it? Like the daily is

3598
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:37,840
bullish, doesn't it? Like the daily is
 

3599
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,550
bullish, doesn't it? Like the daily is
just in a in general just in a drift

3600
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:40,560
just in a in general just in a drift
 

3601
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,310
just in a in general just in a drift
higher.

3602
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
higher.
 

3603
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,470
higher.
So reversing those drifts higher become

3604
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:44,480
So reversing those drifts higher become
 

3605
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:52,149
So reversing those drifts higher become
quite hard.

3777
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,550
day point of control and the gap fill
right now. The structure is still

3778
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:50,560
right now. The structure is still
 

3779
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,870
right now. The structure is still
bullish though. This is the problem. But

bullish though. This is the problem. But
 

3781
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,550
bullish though. This is the problem. But
this is the contested level that we've

this is the contested level that we've
 

3783
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,470
this is the contested level that we've
drifted into.

3784

drifted into.
 

3785
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,270
drifted into.
Tell me about that.

to clean this up a bit cuz you've got
this here. Anyway, so the rotation now

3798
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:22,400
this here. Anyway, so the rotation now
 

3799
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,229
this here. Anyway, so the rotation now
is between these like we talked about.

3800
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:24,239
is between these like we talked about.
 

3801

is between these like we talked about.
This is the resistance level. This can

3802
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:26,719
This is the resistance level. This can
 

3803
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,310
This is the resistance level. This can
now potentially become a support level

3804
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,320
now potentially become a support level
 

3805
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,550
now potentially become a support level
because now you have VWAP previous day

3806

because now you have VWAP previous day
 

3807
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,430
because now you have VWAP previous day
value, current day value. This is the

3808
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:33,440
value, current day value. This is the
 

3809
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:37,189
value, current day value. This is the
rotation from 600 to sort of 540 in

volume, bulls will look to reclaim this
 

3815
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,790
volume, bulls will look to reclaim this
to get up to previous days value area

3816
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:42,800
to get up to previous days value area
 

3817
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,870
to get up to previous days value area
high. Bears will look to fade underneath

3893
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,030

Just reading the news, I just think it's

3894
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:43,040
Just reading the news, I just think it's
 

3895
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,669
Just reading the news, I just think it's
wild. How can you roll back such a big

3896
01:29:45,669 --> 01:29:45,679
wild. How can you roll back such a big
 

3897
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,737
wild. How can you roll back such a big
statement?

3898
01:29:48,737 --> 01:29:48,747

 

3899
01:29:48,747 --> 01:29:52,870

01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:52,880

 

3901
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,870

We can drift all the way back up. You

3902
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:54,880
We can drift all the way back up. You
 

3903
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,669
We can drift all the way back up. You
know, if the reason we dropped was a

3904
01:29:57,669 --> 01:29:57,679
know, if the reason we dropped was a
 

3905
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,870
know, if the reason we dropped was a
news piece and they're saying, "Hey,

3906
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:00,880
news piece and they're saying, "Hey,
 

3907
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,350

that's not true." We can drift all the

3908
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,360
that's not true." We can drift all the
 

3909
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,910
that's not true." We can drift all the
way back up. And this looks like the

3910
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:05,920
way back up. And this looks like the
 

3911
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,270
way back up. And this looks like the
last few days, doesn't it? We talked

3912
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:07,280
last few days, doesn't it? We talked
 

3913
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,590
last few days, doesn't it? We talked
about this in Discord. You know, these

3914
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:09,600
about this in Discord. You know, these
 

3915
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,590
about this in Discord. You know, these
kind of drifts,

3916
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:11,600
kind of drifts,
 

3917
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,189
kind of drifts,
shallow pullbacks should probably get

3918
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:13,199
shallow pullbacks should probably get
 

3919
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:16,229
shallow pullbacks should probably get
one tug at some point.

3920
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:16,239
one tug at some point.
 

3921
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:24,149

We go back to last few days.

Oh, short at the gap fill. Sorry, I

Oh, short at the gap fill. Sorry, I

Oh, short at the gap fill. Sorry, I

3957
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:28,390
at the previous day point of control and
gap fill with valid target. Would be a

01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,400

there's your gap filled

there's your gap filled

I mean you're front running it

3980
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:07,280
I mean you're front running it
 

3981
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,229
I mean you're front running it
structurally. We're still moving higher.

Like remember you're now short outside

3984
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:11,760
Like remember you're now short outside
 

3985
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,350
Like remember you're now short outside
of initial balance. This can be a

3986
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:13,360
of initial balance. This can be a
 

3987
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,629
of initial balance. This can be a
rotation back up. You're inside

3988
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:14,639
rotation back up. You're inside
 

3989
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,629
rotation back up. You're inside
yesterday's range. Where would a valid

3990
01:32:16,629 --> 01:32:16,639
yesterday's range. Where would a valid
 

3991
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,030
yesterday's range. Where would a valid
target be? I'd say the edge of value.

3992
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:19,040
target be? I'd say the edge of value.
 

3993
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,950

I'd be covering something into 550. If

3994
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:20,960
I'd be covering something into 550. If
 

3995
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,189
I'd be covering something into 550. If
you're short up here, your counter trend

3996
01:32:23,189 --> 01:32:23,199
you're short up here, your counter trend
 

3997
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:24,550
you're short up here, your counter trend
versus what we're seeing currently. If

3998
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:24,560
versus what we're seeing currently. If
 

3999
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,950
versus what we're seeing currently. If
you're short up here, it'd be TP1 point

4000
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:26,960
you're short up here, it'd be TP1 point
 

4001
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,629
you're short up here, it'd be TP1 point
of control TP2 value area low TP3. And

4002
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:30,639
of control TP2 value area low TP3. And
 

4003
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,149
of control TP2 value area low TP3. And
if you get really lucky, you get down

4004
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:32,159
if you get really lucky, you get down
 

4005
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:35,350
if you get really lucky, you get down
here.

4006
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:35,360

 

4007
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,390

But I would imagine any flush gets

4008
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,400
But I would imagine any flush gets
 

4009
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:44,310
But I would imagine any flush gets
gobbled back up now,

4010
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:44,320

 

4011
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,910

unless you see a major shift in

01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:45,920
unless you see a major shift in
 

4013
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,950
unless you see a major shift in
sentiment.

4014
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:48,960

01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:58,870
VIX giving up the whole giving back the
whole 9:00 a.m. push that it's had.

4018
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880

 

4019
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,950

See, I'd be covering if I was you, I'd

4020
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:00,960
See, I'd be covering if I was you, I'd
 

4021
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,870
See, I'd be covering if I was you, I'd
be covering into each value area. You

4022
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:02,880
be covering into each value area. You
 

4023
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,270
be covering into each value area. You
want to see this get underneath IB high.

4024
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:05,280
want to see this get underneath IB high.
 

4025
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,790
want to see this get underneath IB high.
If you do not get under this, this is

4026
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
If you do not get under this, this is
 

4027
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,070
If you do not get under this, this is
going to be a problem for you. So, if

4028
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,080
going to be a problem for you. So, if
 

4029
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,310
going to be a problem for you. So, if
you're short here, you need to see this

4030
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320
you're short here, you need to see this
 

4031
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,390
you're short here, you need to see this
breakdown. If you do not see that, then

4032
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:12,400
breakdown. If you do not see that, then
 

4033
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,189
breakdown. If you do not see that, then
we're basing above IB and it can

4034
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:15,199
we're basing above IB and it can
 

4035
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,830
we're basing above IB and it can
reaccumulate here to go higher.

4036
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:17,840
reaccumulate here to go higher.
 

4037
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:23,510
reaccumulate here to go higher.
Right. So, you need a break under this.

4038
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:23,520

 

4039
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,669

For me, it's not a short right now.

4040
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
For me, it's not a short right now.
 

4041
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,350
For me, it's not a short right now.
We're trend up in a high time frame

4042
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:27,360
We're trend up in a high time frame
 

4043
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,669
We're trend up in a high time frame
liquidity building stage. So, I'd be

4044
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:29,679
liquidity building stage. So, I'd be
 

4045
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:33,404
liquidity building stage. So, I'd be
very, very cautious.

4046
01:33:33,404 --> 01:33:33,414
very, very cautious.
 

4047
01:33:33,414 --> 01:33:37,590
very, very cautious.

4048
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:37,600

 

4049
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,790

If you get under IB and they sustain and

4050
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:40,800
If you get under IB and they sustain and
 

4051
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,390
If you get under IB and they sustain and
walk down the offer, then maybe you get

4052
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
walk down the offer, then maybe you get
 

4053
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,629
walk down the offer, then maybe you get
that flush to view up 550. That would

4054
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
that flush to view up 550. That would
 

4055
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,629
that flush to view up 550. That would
definitely be a cover point if you get

4056
01:33:46,629 --> 01:33:46,639
definitely be a cover point if you get
 

4057
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:49,350
definitely be a cover point if you get
lucky. But right now, it's not showing

4058
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:49,360
lucky. But right now, it's not showing
 

4059
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,590
lucky. But right now, it's not showing
me that it wants to do that move. We're

4060
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:51,600
me that it wants to do that move. We're
 

4061
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,270
me that it wants to do that move. We're
at a point of interest, but I wouldn't

4062
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
at a point of interest, but I wouldn't
 

4063
01:33:53,280 --> 01:34:00,550
at a point of interest, but I wouldn't
say we've had an entry.

4064
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:00,560

 

4065
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,149

Definitely have supply overhead. There's

4066
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
Definitely have supply overhead. There's
 

4067
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,750
Definitely have supply overhead. There's
no doubt about it. What it really comes

4068
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
no doubt about it. What it really comes
 

4069
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,030
no doubt about it. What it really comes
down to, do those buyers at the end of

4070
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
down to, do those buyers at the end of
 

4071
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,750
down to, do those buyers at the end of
day yesterday and in London and Asia

4072
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:09,760
day yesterday and in London and Asia
 

4073
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,270
day yesterday and in London and Asia
want to get rid of their position?

4074
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
want to get rid of their position?
 

4075
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,350
want to get rid of their position?
That's what this comes down to. Do the

4076
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:13,360
That's what this comes down to. Do the
 

4077
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,110
That's what this comes down to. Do the
buyers overnight and at the end of day

4078
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:15,120
buyers overnight and at the end of day
 

4079
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,189
buyers overnight and at the end of day
yesterday want to close out their

4080
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:17,199
yesterday want to close out their
 

4081
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,110
yesterday want to close out their
position or not? If the answer is yes,

4082
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:19,120
position or not? If the answer is yes,
 

4083
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,870
position or not? If the answer is yes,
you will get a move lower. If the answer

4084
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:20,880
you will get a move lower. If the answer
 

4085
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,790
you will get a move lower. If the answer
is no, you're not going to see that

4086
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:22,800
is no, you're not going to see that
 

4087
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,550
is no, you're not going to see that
because it means that supply of ahead

4088
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:24,560
because it means that supply of ahead
 

4089
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:42,390
because it means that supply of ahead
are quite happy to sit in it.

4090
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,400

 

4091
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:48,070

I would say so far

4092
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:48,080

 

4093
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,669

it's first time I've seen selling into

4094
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:49,679
it's first time I've seen selling into
 

4095
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,750
it's first time I've seen selling into
600

4096
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:51,760
600
 

4097
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,510
600
actual market selling. It's the first

4098
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:53,520
actual market selling. It's the first
 

4099
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,669
actual market selling. It's the first
time in this candle.

4100
01:34:55,669 --> 01:34:55,679
time in this candle.
 

4101
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,990
time in this candle.
Not convinced high is in but we'll see.

4102
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
Not convinced high is in but we'll see.
 

4103
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,310
Not convinced high is in but we'll see.
Do you indicate in a trade now in

4104
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
Do you indicate in a trade now in
 

4105
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:05,030
Do you indicate in a trade now in
Discord? Just wondering if I'm in a

4106
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:05,040
Discord? Just wondering if I'm in a
 

4107
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,629
Discord? Just wondering if I'm in a
trade or looking at something. Yes, I

4108
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
trade or looking at something. Yes, I
 

4109
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,030
trade or looking at something. Yes, I
always I always post it in the

4110
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,040
always I always post it in the
 

4111
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,110
always I always post it in the
afternoons. You mean? Always. I don't do

4112
01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:11,120
afternoons. You mean? Always. I don't do
 

4113
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:14,950
afternoons. You mean? Always. I don't do
it while we're live and stream.

4114
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:14,960
it while we're live and stream.
 

4115
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,030
it while we're live and stream.
I think I had two attempts. Was it the

4116
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,040
I think I had two attempts. Was it the
 

4117
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,430
I think I had two attempts. Was it the
day before?

4118
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,440
day before?
 

4119
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,709
day before?
I got stopped out on both,

4120
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:20,719
I got stopped out on both,
 

4121
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,350
I got stopped out on both,
unfortunately. Uh into end of day. I

4122
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:23,360
unfortunately. Uh into end of day. I
 

4123
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,669
unfortunately. Uh into end of day. I
think it was the day before. So, you can

4124
01:35:25,669 --> 01:35:25,679
think it was the day before. So, you can
 

4125
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:30,070
think it was the day before. So, you can
see here. So, [sighs]

4126
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,080

 

4127
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,550

uh when was this on the first? So,

4128
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:32,560
uh when was this on the first? So,
 

4129
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,390
uh when was this on the first? So,
Monday.

4130
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:34,400
Monday.
 

4131
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,270
Monday.
So, I call it first long here needs to

4132
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:37,280
So, I call it first long here needs to
 

4133
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:40,629
So, I call it first long here needs to
punch 420 otherwise a scalp and then say

4134
01:35:40,629 --> 01:35:40,639
punch 420 otherwise a scalp and then say
 

4135
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:41,910
punch 420 otherwise a scalp and then say
that I'm flat and then I have another

4136
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:41,920
that I'm flat and then I have another
 

4137
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,669
that I'm flat and then I have another
attempt at it. It didn't go either time.

4138
01:35:43,669 --> 01:35:43,679
attempt at it. It didn't go either time.
 

4139
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,149
attempt at it. It didn't go either time.
Didn't go either time. So, break even

4140
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
Didn't go either time. So, break even
 

4141
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,669
Didn't go either time. So, break even
both of those. But yeah, if I'm trading

4142
01:35:47,669 --> 01:35:47,679
both of those. But yeah, if I'm trading
 

4143
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,350
both of those. But yeah, if I'm trading
in the afternoon, I will always say what

4144
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:49,360
in the afternoon, I will always say what
 

4145
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,870
in the afternoon, I will always say what
I'm looking at.

4146
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880

 

4147
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,709

Even if I'm not actively trading, I will

4148
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:54,719
Even if I'm not actively trading, I will
 

4149
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,229
Even if I'm not actively trading, I will
say the levels that I'd be looking at

4150
01:35:56,229 --> 01:35:56,239
say the levels that I'd be looking at
 

4151
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:57,350
say the levels that I'd be looking at
and what we're looking for. But you can

4152
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:57,360
and what we're looking for. But you can
 

4153
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,430
and what we're looking for. But you can
see everyone here is where we talk about

4154
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
see everyone here is where we talk about
 

4155
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:08,229
see everyone here is where we talk about
the breakdown of the trades.

4156
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,239

 

4157
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:09,750

The last one I was away most of last

4158
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:09,760
The last one I was away most of last
 

4159
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,669
The last one I was away most of last
week with co so it hasn't it's been a

4160
01:36:11,669 --> 01:36:11,679
week with co so it hasn't it's been a
 

4161
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:14,709
week with co so it hasn't it's been a
little while

4162
01:36:14,709 --> 01:36:14,719
little while
 

4163
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:28,070
little while
and even other people

4164
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:28,080

 

4165
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:36,310

I

4166
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,320

 

4167
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,870

Yes. I show I show it in in the video,

4168
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:38,880
Yes. I show I show it in in the video,
 

4169
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,189
Yes. I show I show it in in the video,
Eric. Yeah, I I won't promote firms

4170
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:41,199
Eric. Yeah, I I won't promote firms
 

4171
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,430
Eric. Yeah, I I won't promote firms
until I get payouts from them. So,

4172
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,440
until I get payouts from them. So,
 

4173
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,430
until I get payouts from them. So,
Funded Next, I passed and got a payout.

4174
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,440
Funded Next, I passed and got a payout.
 

4175
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,830
Funded Next, I passed and got a payout.
I'm currently working on a [sighs]

4176
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:47,840
I'm currently working on a [sighs]
 

4177
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,669
I'm currently working on a [sighs]
few more of their plans. We're actually

4178
01:36:49,669 --> 01:36:49,679
few more of their plans. We're actually
 

4179
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,030
few more of their plans. We're actually
going to do a giveaway. I've got to

4180
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:51,040
going to do a giveaway. I've got to
 

4181
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,629
going to do a giveaway. I've got to
organize it. We're going to do three

4182
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
organize it. We're going to do three
 

4183
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,590
organize it. We're going to do three
Funded Next giveaways a month. We've

4184
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:55,600
Funded Next giveaways a month. We've
 

4185
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,950
Funded Next giveaways a month. We've
done a deal with them. So, we'll be

4186
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:56,960
done a deal with them. So, we'll be
 

4187
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,109
done a deal with them. So, we'll be
doing three giveaways a month. I have to

4188
01:36:59,109 --> 01:36:59,119
doing three giveaways a month. I have to
 

4189
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,550
doing three giveaways a month. I have to
work out how to do it because we can't

4190
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:00,560
work out how to do it because we can't
 

4191
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,229
work out how to do it because we can't
do it live on stream. They do it

4192
01:37:02,229 --> 01:37:02,239
do it live on stream. They do it
 

4193
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,390
do it live on stream. They do it
differently. Um, so it's probably going

4194
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:04,400
differently. Um, so it's probably going
 

4195
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,709
differently. Um, so it's probably going
to have to be a Twitter giveaway or or

4196
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
to have to be a Twitter giveaway or or
 

4197
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:09,510
to have to be a Twitter giveaway or or
maybe we do a YouTube post and people

4198
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,520
maybe we do a YouTube post and people
 

4199
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,669
maybe we do a YouTube post and people
have to comment, but it's just how they

4200
01:37:11,669 --> 01:37:11,679
have to comment, but it's just how they
 

4201
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:13,590
have to comment, but it's just how they
operate. So, a Apex we can give away

4202
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:13,600
operate. So, a Apex we can give away
 

4203
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,510
operate. So, a Apex we can give away
live on stream funding. Next, we're

4204
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:15,520
live on stream funding. Next, we're
 

4205
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,709
live on stream funding. Next, we're
going to have to do giveaways with some

4206
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:16,719
going to have to do giveaways with some
 

4207
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,870
going to have to do giveaways with some
form of competition. Yeah, in the video

4208
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:18,880
form of competition. Yeah, in the video
 

4209
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,149
form of competition. Yeah, in the video
you'll see. I think I take I can't

4210
01:37:20,149 --> 01:37:20,159
you'll see. I think I take I can't
 

4211
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:21,430
you'll see. I think I take I can't
remember two and a half thousand. Same

4212
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:21,440
remember two and a half thousand. Same
 

4213
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,790
remember two and a half thousand. Same
with uh funding ticks. I took the

4214
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:24,800
with uh funding ticks. I took the
 

4215
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,310
with uh funding ticks. I took the
maximum ones available. So, I'm

4216
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:26,320
maximum ones available. So, I'm
 

4217
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,750
maximum ones available. So, I'm
currently working I'll be honest with

4218
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:27,760
currently working I'll be honest with
 

4219
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,350
currently working I'll be honest with
you, I'm working on some funded next and

4220
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:29,360
you, I'm working on some funded next and
 

4221
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,590
you, I'm working on some funded next and
funed tick evals. I want to get fully

4222
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:31,600
funed tick evals. I want to get fully
 

4223
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,350
funed tick evals. I want to get fully
funded for next year.

4224
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:33,360
funded for next year.
 

4225
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,189
funded for next year.
It's my job at the moment. We we just

4226
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:35,199
It's my job at the moment. We we just
 

4227
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:38,470
It's my job at the moment. We we just
took some big payouts in Apex. So,

4228
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,480
took some big payouts in Apex. So,
 

4229
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,270
took some big payouts in Apex. So,
uh I really want to start scaling up

4230
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:41,280
uh I really want to start scaling up
 

4231
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,950
uh I really want to start scaling up
with uh firms where I don't have

4232
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:42,960
with uh firms where I don't have
 

4233
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,870
with uh firms where I don't have
consistency rules. That's that's my uh

4234
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:46,880
consistency rules. That's that's my uh
 

4235
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,070
consistency rules. That's that's my uh
target for next year at the moment is to

4236
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:50,080
target for next year at the moment is to
 

4237
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,910
target for next year at the moment is to
do that and to take some bigger or some

4238
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:51,920
do that and to take some bigger or some
 

4239
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,430
do that and to take some bigger or some
more swing positions. I feel like I've

4240
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:53,440
more swing positions. I feel like I've
 

4241
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,229
more swing positions. I feel like I've
been in cash in this market for most of

4242
01:37:56,229 --> 01:37:56,239
been in cash in this market for most of
 

4243
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:58,390
been in cash in this market for most of
the year. At the moment, that's where I

4244
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400
the year. At the moment, that's where I
 

4245
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,070
the year. At the moment, that's where I
normally traditionally make a lot of

4246
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:00,080
normally traditionally make a lot of
 

4247
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,310
normally traditionally make a lot of
money. This year has been a good year,

4248
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,320
money. This year has been a good year,
 

4249
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,550
money. This year has been a good year,
but I feel like I've way underachieved.

4250
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:04,560
but I feel like I've way underachieved.
 

4251
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,910
but I feel like I've way underachieved.
So, my only positions I'm still long

4252
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
So, my only positions I'm still long
 

4253
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,709
So, my only positions I'm still long
Apple from 202. So, and I'm with size.

4254
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:10,719
Apple from 202. So, and I'm with size.
 

4255
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:13,750
Apple from 202. So, and I'm with size.
So, that's a good one. Um AMD, I'm still

4256
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:13,760
So, that's a good one. Um AMD, I'm still
 

4257
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,590
So, that's a good one. Um AMD, I'm still
long, but I'm down to very small size in

4258
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:15,600
long, but I'm down to very small size in
 

4259
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:20,310
long, but I'm down to very small size in
that. I was long from 58, 158s. So,

4260
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:20,320
that. I was long from 58, 158s. So,
 

4261
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,229
that. I was long from 58, 158s. So,
still up nice on that, but I sold most

4262
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:22,239
still up nice on that, but I sold most
 

4263
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:23,830
still up nice on that, but I sold most
of my position into that alltime high

4264
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
of my position into that alltime high
 

4265
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,229
of my position into that alltime high
push. Amazon, I'm still long, but I'm

4266
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:26,239
push. Amazon, I'm still long, but I'm
 

4267
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:29,830
push. Amazon, I'm still long, but I'm
barely up on that. Um up 7%. That's a

4268
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:29,840
barely up on that. Um up 7%. That's a
 

4269
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,910
barely up on that. Um up 7%. That's a
long-term position for me. Meta, I took

4270
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:31,920
long-term position for me. Meta, I took
 

4271
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,310
long-term position for me. Meta, I took
a starter position. I'm up just under 7%

4272
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:34,320
a starter position. I'm up just under 7%
 

4273
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,030
a starter position. I'm up just under 7%
on that and that's it. So, I'm really

4274
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,040
on that and that's it. So, I'm really
 

4275
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,030
on that and that's it. So, I'm really
want wanting a bleed out in this market.

4276
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,040
want wanting a bleed out in this market.
 

4277
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,550
want wanting a bleed out in this market.
I'm going to be honest with you, but I

4278
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:40,560
I'm going to be honest with you, but I
 

4279
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,910
I'm going to be honest with you, but I
don't think it's going to give it to me.

4280
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:41,920
don't think it's going to give it to me.
 

4281
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,510
don't think it's going to give it to me.
This feels to me like this market is

4282
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:45,520
This feels to me like this market is
 

4283
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,470
This feels to me like this market is
very very very resilient and uh all the

4284
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:48,480
very very very resilient and uh all the
 

4285
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,709
very very very resilient and uh all the
time people are calling for top and a

4286
01:38:50,709 --> 01:38:50,719
time people are calling for top and a
 

4287
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:52,310
time people are calling for top and a
bleed out. I just think it's going to

4288
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
bleed out. I just think it's going to
 

4289
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,350
bleed out. I just think it's going to
keep going higher. The point of max pain

4290
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:55,360
keep going higher. The point of max pain
 

4291
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,109
keep going higher. The point of max pain
is higher right now, I think, rather

4292
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:57,119
is higher right now, I think, rather
 

4293
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,629
is higher right now, I think, rather
than lower. I think you've got probably

4294
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:58,639
than lower. I think you've got probably
 

4295
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:01,510
than lower. I think you've got probably
more shorts trying to force this lower

4296
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
more shorts trying to force this lower
 

4297
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,910
more shorts trying to force this lower
and uh so a good chance we go higher

4298
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:03,920
and uh so a good chance we go higher
 

4299
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,910
and uh so a good chance we go higher

4304
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
alltime high in cues don't I don't know
 

4305
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,750
alltime high in cues don't I don't know
and we'll see what it all depends how we

4306
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:11,760
and we'll see what it all depends how we
 

4307
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,270
and we'll see what it all depends how we
close out this year and how we open next

4308
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,280
close out this year and how we open next
 

4309

close out this year and how we open next
year January can be nasty in the market

4310
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:15,600
year January can be nasty in the market
 

4311
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,430
year January can be nasty in the market
but we'll see um I have my own concerns

4312
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:19,440
but we'll see um I have my own concerns
 

4313

the Fed injecting capital into banks is

the Fed injecting capital into banks is
 

4319
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,870
the Fed injecting capital into banks is
not quantitive easing. That is because

4320
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:30,880
not quantitive easing. That is because
 

4321
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,270
not quantitive easing. That is because
there is a liquidity and credit issue.

4322
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:33,280
there is a liquidity and credit issue.
 

4323
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,629
there is a liquidity and credit issue.
All right? So, they are protecting the

4324
01:39:34,629 --> 01:39:34,639
All right? So, they are protecting the
 

4325
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,629
All right? So, they are protecting the
banks which are clearly overleveraged. I

4326
01:39:36,629 --> 01:39:36,639
banks which are clearly overleveraged. I
 

4327
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,109
banks which are clearly overleveraged. I
think especially in crypto, I don't

4328
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:39,119
think especially in crypto, I don't
 

4329
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:40,550
think especially in crypto, I don't
think I don't see that as a positive

4330
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:40,560
think I don't see that as a positive
 

4331
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,070
think I don't see that as a positive
thing. People like, "Oh, yeah, we're in

4332
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:42,080
thing. People like, "Oh, yeah, we're in
 

4333
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,470
thing. People like, "Oh, yeah, we're in
quantitive easing." We shouldn't need to

4334
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:44,480
quantitive easing." We shouldn't need to
 

4335
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,709
quantitive easing." We shouldn't need to
do it. All right? We shouldn't need to

4336
01:39:46,709 --> 01:39:46,719
do it. All right? We shouldn't need to
 

4337
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:48,629
do it. All right? We shouldn't need to
do it. Which means there's a problem

4338
01:39:48,629 --> 01:39:48,639
do it. Which means there's a problem
 

4339
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,350
do it. Which means there's a problem
under the hood. Uh can't remember which

4340
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:51,360
under the hood. Uh can't remember which
 

4341
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,430
under the hood. Uh can't remember which
one of you was short uh from PDC and

4342
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:53,440
one of you was short uh from PDC and
 

4343
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,950
one of you was short uh from PDC and
Gapatville, but I would take a little

4344
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:54,960
Gapatville, but I would take a little
 

4345
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,350
Gapatville, but I would take a little
piece off in this sort of area we're at

4346
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:57,360
piece off in this sort of area we're at
 

4347
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,669
piece off in this sort of area we're at
now. Especially if we reclaim this. If

4348
01:39:59,669 --> 01:39:59,679
now. Especially if we reclaim this. If
 

4349
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,430
now. Especially if we reclaim this. If
we sell this little node here, you're

4350
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:01,440
we sell this little node here, you're
 

4351
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,470
we sell this little node here, you're
going to be okay. But I would reduce

4352
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:04,480
going to be okay. But I would reduce
 

4353
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,830
going to be okay. But I would reduce
your size a little bit. And if you

4354
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:07,840
your size a little bit. And if you
 

4355
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,390
your size a little bit. And if you
complete this rotation, you can hold on.

here that's where a bigger rotation can
 

4371
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,189
here that's where a bigger rotation can
happen but I would pay yourself along

exhausted um energy wise. So, I've been

4424
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,440
exhausted um energy wise. So, I've been
 

4425
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,270
exhausted um energy wise. So, I've been
struggling to make the content. So, what

4426
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,280
struggling to make the content. So, what
 

4427
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,750
struggling to make the content. So, what
I've got left to do is uh bookmat and

4428
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:45,760
I've got left to do is uh bookmat and
 

4429
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,390
I've got left to do is uh bookmat and
level two and footprints and then the

4430
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:48,400
level two and footprints and then the
 

4431
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,629
level two and footprints and then the
setups. So, it's not that much left to

4432
01:41:50,629 --> 01:41:50,639
setups. So, it's not that much left to
 

4433
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:52,870
setups. So, it's not that much left to
do. It's just

4434
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:52,880
do. It's just
 

4435
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,109
do. It's just
because I've not been well. I wanted it

4436
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:55,119
because I've not been well. I wanted it
 

4437
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:56,870
because I've not been well. I wanted it
pretty much done by now. That's a good

4438
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:56,880
pretty much done by now. That's a good
 

4439
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,109
pretty much done by now. That's a good
rejection of that gray box there. We

4440
01:41:59,109 --> 01:41:59,119
rejection of that gray box there. We
 

4441
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,709
rejection of that gray box there. We
just put this in this gray box. So, that

4442
01:42:00,709 --> 01:42:00,719
just put this in this gray box. So, that
 

4443
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,229
just put this in this gray box. So, that
shelf is starting to reject. So, your

4444
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:02,239
shelf is starting to reject. So, your
 

4445
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:03,750
shelf is starting to reject. So, your
short now is looking pretty good. All

4446
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:03,760
short now is looking pretty good. All
 

4447
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,430
short now is looking pretty good. All
right. So, now I'd say we're getting

4448
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:05,440
right. So, now I'd say we're getting
 

4449
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,030
right. So, now I'd say we're getting
confirmation of trap buyers up here.

4450
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:07,040
confirmation of trap buyers up here.
 

4451
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,750
confirmation of trap buyers up here.
Here's your TP1. You must must must take

4452
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:09,760
Here's your TP1. You must must must take
 

4453
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,830
Here's your TP1. You must must must take
some profit off here. Even if you took

4454
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:11,840
some profit off here. Even if you took
 

4455
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,109
some profit off here. Even if you took
some there, that was a reload

4456
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:13,119
some there, that was a reload
 

4457
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:14,950
some there, that was a reload
opportunity. Profit off here and then

4458
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:14,960
opportunity. Profit off here and then
 

4459
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,430
opportunity. Profit off here and then
hold in case they let this thing go. But

4460
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:17,440
hold in case they let this thing go. But
 

4461
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,070
hold in case they let this thing go. But
don't expect it to be let go. But you

4462
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:20,080
don't expect it to be let go. But you
 

4463
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,669
don't expect it to be let go. But you
can hold some runners in case they do.

4464
01:42:21,669 --> 01:42:21,679
can hold some runners in case they do.
 

4465
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:24,950
can hold some runners in case they do.
But here is a big TP. Same as here. So

4466
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960
But here is a big TP. Same as here. So
 

4467
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,750
But here is a big TP. Same as here. So
VWAP and shelf here. This is the edge of

4468
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:27,760
VWAP and shelf here. This is the edge of
 

4469
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,310
VWAP and shelf here. This is the edge of
value right now. And here is a TP. And

4470
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:30,320
value right now. And here is a TP. And
 

4471
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,709
value right now. And here is a TP. And
here is a TP. All right. But this was a

4472
01:42:32,709 --> 01:42:32,719
here is a TP. All right. But this was a
 

4473
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:34,550
here is a TP. All right. But this was a
nice rejection of this shelf. Really

4474
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:34,560
nice rejection of this shelf. Really
 

4475
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:37,270
nice rejection of this shelf. Really
nice. Right. It came back up, rejected

4476
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:37,280
nice. Right. It came back up, rejected
 

4477
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,870
nice. Right. It came back up, rejected
it. You would not want to see them

4478
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:38,880
it. You would not want to see them
 

4479
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,550
it. You would not want to see them
reclaim that shelf. All right. For those

4480
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:40,560
reclaim that shelf. All right. For those
 

4481
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,390
reclaim that shelf. All right. For those
of you who took the short here or took

4482
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:42,400
of you who took the short here or took
 

4483
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,189
of you who took the short here or took
this back here, you do not want to see a

4484
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:45,199
this back here, you do not want to see a
 

4485
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:49,109
this back here, you do not want to see a
recla reclaim of sort of 75s to 80s.

4486
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:49,119
recla reclaim of sort of 75s to 80s.
 

4487
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:56,550
recla reclaim of sort of 75s to 80s.
That must stay heavy.

4488
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:56,560

 

4489
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,310

When I'm passing different props, do I

When I'm passing different props, do I
 

4491
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,070
When I'm passing different props, do I
execute at the same time or take your

4493
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:03,430
execute at the same time or take your
time by passing one by one? Uh, normally

4494
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:03,440
time by passing one by one? Uh, normally
 

4495
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,310
time by passing one by one? Uh, normally
do most at the same time to be honest.

4496
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:06,320
do most at the same time to be honest.
 

4497
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,470
do most at the same time to be honest.
Most at the same time. I quite like the

01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:08,480
Most at the same time. I quite like the
 

4499
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,669
Most at the same time. I quite like the
new um and this isn't a sales pitch, use

4504
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:15,760
like about the new affordable indicators
 

4505
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,470
like about the new affordable indicators
trade copier is you can put in the

4506
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:18,480
trade copier is you can put in the
 

4507
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,189

trading

4510
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:22,800
trading
 

4511
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,709
trading
accounts which are different, say for

4512
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:24,719
accounts which are different, say for
 

4513
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,149
accounts which are different, say for
example, if I'm trading one which my

4514
01:43:26,149 --> 01:43:26,159
example, if I'm trading one which my
 

4515
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:30,310
example, if I'm trading one which my
target is 2500 or uh and I can pass it

4516
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:30,320
target is 2500 or uh and I can pass it
 

4517
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,709
target is 2500 or uh and I can pass it
in one shot, I can put that in. If other

4518
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:32,719
in one shot, I can put that in. If other
 

4519
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:35,030
in one shot, I can put that in. If other
ones my target is I've got 40%

4520
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,040
ones my target is I've got 40%
 

4521
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,189
ones my target is I've got 40%
consistency rule, I can put in like $600

4522
01:43:37,189 --> 01:43:37,199
consistency rule, I can put in like $600
 

4523
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:40,709
consistency rule, I can put in like $600
or $800 target for example. So I think

4524
01:43:40,709 --> 01:43:40,719
or $800 target for example. So I think
 

4525
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:51,669
or $800 target for example. So I think
they can be quite useful.

4526
01:43:51,669 --> 01:43:51,679

 

4527
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:53,189

Still rejecting that box. It's still

4528
01:43:53,189 --> 01:43:53,199
Still rejecting that box. It's still
 

4529
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:54,390
Still rejecting that box. It's still
looking good. I don't know why it's gone

4530
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,400
looking good. I don't know why it's gone
 

4531
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,990
looking good. I don't know why it's gone
blue. I don't remember doing that.

4532
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:58,000
blue. I don't remember doing that.
 

4533
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,030
blue. I don't remember doing that.
Still looking good.

4534
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:01,040
Still looking good.
 

4535
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,030
Still looking good.
What I'd be looking for here is this to

4536
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:03,040
What I'd be looking for here is this to
 

4537
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:06,790
What I'd be looking for here is this to
stay heavy. This area here is your TP1.

4538
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:06,800
stay heavy. This area here is your TP1.
 

4539
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,470
stay heavy. This area here is your TP1.
Hopefully, you've already got some off.

4540
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:08,480
Hopefully, you've already got some off.
 

4541
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,590
Hopefully, you've already got some off.
Point of control TP2. New York open. And

4542
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:11,600
Point of control TP2. New York open. And
 

4543
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,470
Point of control TP2. New York open. And
I think if we come, in all honesty, if

4544
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:14,480
I think if we come, in all honesty, if
 

4545
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,750
I think if we come, in all honesty, if
we come under this, they're going to be

4546
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:15,760
we come under this, they're going to be
 

4547
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,070
we come under this, they're going to be
in big trouble. I would be somewhat

4548
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:18,080
in big trouble. I would be somewhat
 

4549
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,750
in big trouble. I would be somewhat
surprised if they let that happen now.

4550
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:19,760
surprised if they let that happen now.
 

4551
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,229
surprised if they let that happen now.
But you never know. You've got a new

4552
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:22,239
But you never know. You've got a new
 

4553
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,790
But you never know. You've got a new
hourly bar coming in about 90 seconds or

4554
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:24,800
hourly bar coming in about 90 seconds or
 

4555
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,629
hourly bar coming in about 90 seconds or
something, maybe less, 70 seconds. Just

4556
01:44:26,629 --> 01:44:26,639
something, maybe less, 70 seconds. Just
 

4557
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:30,550
something, maybe less, 70 seconds. Just
be aware of that.

4558
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:30,560

 

4559
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,149

They have a better rhythmic sync too.

4560
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:32,159
They have a better rhythmic sync too.
 

4561
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,830
They have a better rhythmic sync too.
Yeah, they've uh fixed lots of issues

4562
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:33,840
Yeah, they've uh fixed lots of issues
 

4563
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,750
Yeah, they've uh fixed lots of issues
and they now have it so you can trade if

4564
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:35,760
and they now have it so you can trade if
 

4565
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,229
and they now have it so you can trade if
you want to trade on uh trading view you

4566
01:44:38,229 --> 01:44:38,239
you want to trade on uh trading view you
 

4567
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,950
you want to trade on uh trading view you
can execute on there as well. Quite like

4568
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:40,960
can execute on there as well. Quite like
 

4569
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:53,430
can execute on there as well. Quite like
it. It's quite easy to manage.

4570
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:53,440

 

4571
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:57,350

Just be aware new hourly bar coming.

4572
01:44:57,350 --> 01:44:57,360
Just be aware new hourly bar coming.
 

4573
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,550
Just be aware new hourly bar coming.
Think about this last hourly bar. We are

4574
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:00,560
Think about this last hourly bar. We are
 

4575
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,550
Think about this last hourly bar. We are
uh definitely confirming supply above,

4576
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:02,560
uh definitely confirming supply above,
 

4577
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,390
uh definitely confirming supply above,
which is good. All right, so think about

4578
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:04,400
which is good. All right, so think about
 

4579
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,910
which is good. All right, so think about
this. We talked about this this morning.

4580
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:05,920
this. We talked about this this morning.
 

4581
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,470
this. We talked about this this morning.
This is where buyers are stuck above.

4582
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:08,480
This is where buyers are stuck above.
 

4583
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:09,590
This is where buyers are stuck above.
All right, this is why I said if we're

4584
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:09,600
All right, this is why I said if we're
 

4585
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,270
All right, this is why I said if we're
going to rotate, this would be the

4586
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:11,280
going to rotate, this would be the
 

4587
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,030
going to rotate, this would be the
maximum level I'd want to see us rotate

4588
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:13,040
maximum level I'd want to see us rotate
 

4589
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,350
maximum level I'd want to see us rotate
to. If we sell this now, you'd want to

4590
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,360
to. If we sell this now, you'd want to
 

4591
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,350
to. If we sell this now, you'd want to
sell back into these lows. And then

4592
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:17,360
sell back into these lows. And then
 

4593
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,790
sell back into these lows. And then
you're holding runner for a breakdown

4594
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:18,800
you're holding runner for a breakdown
 

4595
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,790
you're holding runner for a breakdown
because we have equal lows down here.

4596
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:20,800
because we have equal lows down here.
 

4597
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,310
because we have equal lows down here.
But they might well just pin this. They

4598
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320
But they might well just pin this. They
 

4599
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:31,990
But they might well just pin this. They
can pin this here today.

4600
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:32,000

 

4601
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,550

passing apex yesterday. Now focused on

4602
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:34,560
passing apex yesterday. Now focused on
 

4603
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,550
passing apex yesterday. Now focused on
passing TPT counts, but I feel like the

4604
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:36,560
passing TPT counts, but I feel like the
 

4605
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,430
passing TPT counts, but I feel like the
jump between

4606
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:39,440
jump between
 

4607
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,910
jump between
the two, it would be too much,

4608
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:41,920
the two, it would be too much,
 

4609
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,270
the two, it would be too much,
especially when I haven't passed the

4610
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:43,280
especially when I haven't passed the
 

4611
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,430
especially when I haven't passed the
buffer yet. What do you mean the jump

4612
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:45,440
buffer yet. What do you mean the jump
 

4613
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,978
buffer yet. What do you mean the jump
between the two, Danny?

4614
01:45:48,978 --> 01:45:48,988
between the two, Danny?
 

4615
01:45:48,988 --> 01:45:53,669
between the two, Danny?
[cough]

4616
01:45:53,669 --> 01:45:53,679

 

4617
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:55,910

Yeah, it's so much better. I agree.

4618
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:55,920
Yeah, it's so much better. I agree.
 

4619
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,270
Yeah, it's so much better. I agree.
That's what I've started using. I need

4620
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:57,280
That's what I've started using. I need
 

4621
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,990
That's what I've started using. I need
to do a video on it again. Just COVID

4622
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,000
to do a video on it again. Just COVID
 

4623
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,669
to do a video on it again. Just COVID
has really just zapped it out of me.

4624
01:46:03,669 --> 01:46:03,679
has really just zapped it out of me.
 

4625
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:05,750
has really just zapped it out of me.
Zapped the energy out of me. Be careful

4626
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:05,760
Zapped the energy out of me. Be careful
 

4627
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,070
Zapped the energy out of me. Be careful
on a reclaim here. You need this level

4628
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:08,080
on a reclaim here. You need this level
 

4629
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:09,830
on a reclaim here. You need this level
here that we've just traded into to stay

4630
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:09,840
here that we've just traded into to stay
 

4631
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,669
here that we've just traded into to stay
heavy. If this level stays heavy, you

4632
01:46:11,669 --> 01:46:11,679
heavy. If this level stays heavy, you
 

4633
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:13,910
heavy. If this level stays heavy, you
can possibly get rotation lower.

4634
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:13,920
can possibly get rotation lower.
 

4635
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,910
can possibly get rotation lower.
Remember, your overall trend is bullish.

4636
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:17,920
Remember, your overall trend is bullish.
 

4637
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:21,430
Remember, your overall trend is bullish.
But here is your count. I would say

4638
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:21,440
But here is your count. I would say
 

4639
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:25,830
But here is your count. I would say
your legs currently. This is internal.

4640
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:25,840
your legs currently. This is internal.
 

4641
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:28,470
your legs currently. This is internal.
Did we make a new high there? Yes. All

4642
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:28,480
Did we make a new high there? Yes. All
 

4643
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,550
Did we make a new high there? Yes. All
right. So, we're trading inside this.

4644
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:30,560
right. So, we're trading inside this.
 

4645
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,350
right. So, we're trading inside this.
You want this to see a rotation in here.

4646
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:33,360
You want this to see a rotation in here.
 

4647
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:36,149
You want this to see a rotation in here.
If you're if you're bearish any reclaim

4648
01:46:36,149 --> 01:46:36,159
If you're if you're bearish any reclaim
 

4649
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:38,310
If you're if you're bearish any reclaim
up here, I would leave it alone. I would

4650
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:38,320
up here, I would leave it alone. I would
 

4651
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,910
up here, I would leave it alone. I would
cut cut the trade. You start to reclaim

4652
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:39,920
cut cut the trade. You start to reclaim
 

4653
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,109
cut cut the trade. You start to reclaim
this. I would leave it alone because

4654
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:41,119
this. I would leave it alone because
 

4655
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:44,070
this. I would leave it alone because
they can try and force a squeeze.

4656
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,080
they can try and force a squeeze.
 

4657
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,990
they can try and force a squeeze.
So you want this to stay heavy versus

4658
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:46,000
So you want this to stay heavy versus
 

4659
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:56,709
So you want this to stay heavy versus
basically IB

4660
01:46:56,709 --> 01:46:56,719

 

4661
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:58,550

like having trade of eight open on both

4662
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:58,560
like having trade of eight open on both
 

4663
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,310
like having trade of eight open on both

How do I manage the integer draw with
 

4675
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,109
How do I manage the integer draw with
multiple contracts? Are you using

4676
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:15,119
multiple contracts? Are you using

01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:18,070
multiple contracts? Are you using
micros? Uh yeah.

4678
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:18,080
micros? Uh yeah.
 

4679
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,669
micros? Uh yeah.
Well, it depends on the account size. On

4680
01:47:19,669 --> 01:47:19,679
Well, it depends on the account size. On
 

4681
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:23,830
Well, it depends on the account size. On
50ks, I use micros.

4682
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:23,840

 

4683
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,870

How do I manage the intraday draw? Just
don't oversize. Simple as that. Build

4686
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:28,719
don't oversize. Simple as that. Build
 

4687
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:44,070
don't oversize. Simple as that. Build
your buffer.

4688
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:44,080

 

4689
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,229

So you've reclaimed now be I'd be risk

4690
01:47:46,229 --> 01:47:46,239
So you've reclaimed now be I'd be risk
 

4691
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:47,910
So you've reclaimed now be I'd be risk
off at this point. I wouldn't like what

4692
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:47,920
off at this point. I wouldn't like what
 

4693
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,590
off at this point. I wouldn't like what
I'm seeing. You can always re-enter.

4694
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:49,600
I'm seeing. You can always re-enter.
 

4695
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,270
I'm seeing. You can always re-enter.
Well, some of you are short versus five

4696
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:51,280
Well, some of you are short versus five
 

4697
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:54,790
Well, some of you are short versus five
days. So you want to hold to that point

4698
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:54,800
days. So you want to hold to that point
 

4699
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,950
days. So you want to hold to that point
because you're taking a TP then that

4700
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:56,960
because you're taking a TP then that
 

4701
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,709
because you're taking a TP then that
makes sense, I guess. So those of you

4702
01:47:58,709 --> 01:47:58,719
makes sense, I guess. So those of you
 

4703
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,950
makes sense, I guess. So those of you
who are short here risking this, you got

4704
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:00,960
who are short here risking this, you got
 

4705
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,790
who are short here risking this, you got
the TP1 off, I guess that makes sense.

4706
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:02,800
the TP1 off, I guess that makes sense.
 

4707
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,270
the TP1 off, I guess that makes sense.
But I'd be somewhat concerned now they

4708
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:05,280
But I'd be somewhat concerned now they
 

4709
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,870
But I'd be somewhat concerned now they
hold this that they're not going to come

4710
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:06,880
hold this that they're not going to come
 

4711
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,189
hold this that they're not going to come
higher.

4712
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:09,199
higher.
 

4713
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:10,709
higher.
They have the chance to reject here and

4714
01:48:10,709 --> 01:48:10,719
They have the chance to reject here and
 

4715
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:12,390
They have the chance to reject here and
they didn't. You can see multiple

4716
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:12,400
they didn't. You can see multiple
 

4717
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,470
they didn't. You can see multiple
attempts, right? And shorts didn't get

4718
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:14,480
attempts, right? And shorts didn't get
 

4719
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:54,070
attempts, right? And shorts didn't get
their way. And now we're reclaiming

4720
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:54,080

 

4721
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,550

I am seriously thinking about selling.

4722
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
I am seriously thinking about selling.
 

4723
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,149
I am seriously thinking about selling.
everything in London given the new

4724
01:48:58,149 --> 01:48:58,159
everything in London given the new
 

4725
01:48:58,159 --> 01:49:00,070
everything in London given the new
budget. I'm just going to get hammered

4726
01:49:00,070 --> 01:49:00,080
budget. I'm just going to get hammered
 

4727
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:03,030
budget. I'm just going to get hammered
now on tax.

4728
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,040
now on tax.
 

4729
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:41,830
now on tax.
What a bunch of knobs.

4730
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:41,840

 

4731
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,910

So bulls will want to defend this box

4732
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:43,920
So bulls will want to defend this box
 

4733
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,669
So bulls will want to defend this box
here now. All right, bulls will want

4734
01:49:45,669 --> 01:49:45,679
here now. All right, bulls will want
 

4735
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:46,950
here now. All right, bulls will want
this to hold. That will leave these

4736
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:46,960
this to hold. That will leave these
 

4737
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,550
this to hold. That will leave these
shorts stuck. So if bulls hold this,

4738
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:48,560
shorts stuck. So if bulls hold this,
 

4739
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,270
shorts stuck. So if bulls hold this,
they will look to complete higher.

4740
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:51,280
they will look to complete higher.
 

4741
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,470
they will look to complete higher.
So they're still in control. It's why

4742
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:52,480
So they're still in control. It's why
 

4743
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,229
So they're still in control. It's why
it's saying structurally we're still

4744
01:49:54,229 --> 01:49:54,239
it's saying structurally we're still
 

4745
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:57,910
it's saying structurally we're still
bullish.

4746
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:57,920

 

4747
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,430

This is what they're trying to do now.

4748
01:49:59,430 --> 01:49:59,440
This is what they're trying to do now.
 

4749
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,870
This is what they're trying to do now.
And if they get back through this

question. Remember, they've just unwound
 

4757
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,910

this whole thing. The reason that's

caused this from a macro point of view,
 

4761
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:13,189
caused this from a macro point of view,
they've just said doesn't exist. So they

4762
01:50:13,189 --> 01:50:13,199
they've just said doesn't exist. So they
 

4763
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:14,950
they've just said doesn't exist. So they
are trying to do this. I don't know

4764
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:14,960
are trying to do this. I don't know
 

4765
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:16,390
are trying to do this. I don't know
whether they succeed or not, but that's

4766
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:16,400
whether they succeed or not, but that's
 

4767
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,790
whether they succeed or not, but that's
what they're attempting to do. This why

4768
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:18,800
what they're attempting to do. This why
 

4769
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:21,109
what they're attempting to do. This why
I say on that short, it was very much

I say on that short, it was very much
 

4771
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:22,629
I say on that short, it was very much

01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:28,629
you had to take some profit off the
table because you were front running it.

4774
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:28,639

 

4775
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:31,030

There's so many there's so many issues

4781
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,870
big sale came in there at 600. They just
defended that aggressively. No follow

4782

defended that aggressively. No follow
 

4783
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:47,830

4785
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,070

So I'm just watching the tape here. That

4786
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:50,080
So I'm just watching the tape here. That
 

4787
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,550
So I'm just watching the tape here. That
was really aggressive.

4788

you're from
 

4941
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,709
you're from
North Africa in a suppressed state but

4942
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:52,719
North Africa in a suppressed state but
 

4943
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:54,310
North Africa in a suppressed state but
actually if you move from Western world

4944
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:54,320
actually if you move from Western world
 

4945
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:58,390
actually if you move from Western world
to Dubai it's fairly restrictive

4946
01:53:58,390 --> 01:53:58,400
to Dubai it's fairly restrictive
 

4947
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,830
to Dubai it's fairly restrictive
it's pretty and the taxes are good but

4948
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:01,840
it's pretty and the taxes are good but
 

4949
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,270
it's pretty and the taxes are good but
actually beyond that in terms of being

4950
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,280
actually beyond that in terms of being
 

4951
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,750
actually beyond that in terms of being
able to do things freely

4952
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:07,760
able to do things freely
 

4953
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,589
able to do things freely
It's not the best. Remember, I used to

4954
01:54:09,589 --> 01:54:09,599
It's not the best. Remember, I used to
 

4955
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:11,910
It's not the best. Remember, I used to
DJ there and go there four or five times

4956
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:11,920
DJ there and go there four or five times
 

4957
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:14,070
DJ there and go there four or five times
a year. I I've seen it all. I've seen

4958
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:14,080
a year. I I've seen it all. I've seen
 

4959
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:17,109
a year. I I've seen it all. I've seen
how much it's changed. But

4960
01:54:17,109 --> 01:54:17,119
how much it's changed. But
 

4961
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:19,350
how much it's changed. But
short stint, maybe good for tax, but

4962
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:19,360
short stint, maybe good for tax, but
 

4963
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:22,229
short stint, maybe good for tax, but
beyond that,

4964
01:54:22,229 --> 01:54:22,239
beyond that,
 

4965
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:26,470
beyond that,
pretty tough.

4966
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:26,480

 

4967
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,310

You're not having a good blowout party.

4968
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:28,320
You're not having a good blowout party.
 

4969
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:34,950
You're not having a good blowout party.
Put it that way.

thick node here. So we can rotate in

5124
01:57:57,750 --> 01:57:57,760
thick node here. So we can rotate in
 

5125
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,830
thick node here. So we can rotate in
here for a little bit. Once they lose

5547
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,629
as well. I would say this market's
looking dangerous for a give back. If we

5548
02:08:28,629 --> 02:08:28,639
looking dangerous for a give back. If we
 

5549
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:33,430
looking dangerous for a give back. If we
look at the equally weighted,

5550
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:33,440

 

5551
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,750

yeah, starting to look dangerous equally

5552
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:35,760
yeah, starting to look dangerous equally
 

5553
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:38,550
yeah, starting to look dangerous equally
weighted on the cues. So, if mag starts

5554
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:38,560
weighted on the cues. So, if mag starts
 

5555
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:39,990
weighted on the cues. So, if mag starts
to roll, you're going to see heaviness

5556
02:08:39,990 --> 02:08:40,000
to roll, you're going to see heaviness
 

5557
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:47,750
to roll, you're going to see heaviness
come to the market.

02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:50,950
While we're doing that, it started to

that we could buy everything really

rotation height. I don't know which they
 

5703

rotation height. I don't know which they
want to do. I just don't no way of

knowing that right now. You can see that

5719
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:25,990

we are probably still within the

we are probably still within the

02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,910
we are probably still within the

5723
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:30,310
previous two weeks balance range. Let's
have a look.

5724
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:30,320
have a look.
 

5725
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,069
have a look.
Uh, actually need to get to higher time

5726
02:15:32,069 --> 02:15:32,079
Uh, actually need to get to higher time
 

5727
02:15:32,079 --> 02:15:35,350
Uh, actually need to get to higher time
frames.

5728
02:15:35,350 --> 02:15:35,360

 

5729
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:37,350

Yes.

5730
02:15:37,350 --> 02:15:37,360
Yes.
 

5731
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:40,870
Yes.
Right. So, we're still

5732
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:40,880
Right. So, we're still
 

5733
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:45,109
Right. So, we're still
within this big section here of supply.

5734
02:15:45,109 --> 02:15:45,119
within this big section here of supply.
 

5735
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:47,510
within this big section here of supply.
All right. But the longer we're here,

5736
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:47,520
All right. But the longer we're here,
 

5737
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,430
All right. But the longer we're here,
the more likely this move is because

5738
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:49,440
the more likely this move is because
 

5739
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,109
the more likely this move is because
we're not seeing, for example, a drive

5740
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:51,119
we're not seeing, for example, a drive
 

5741
02:15:51,119 --> 02:15:53,189
we're not seeing, for example, a drive
back in and a big reaction. So, the

5742
02:15:53,189 --> 02:15:53,199
back in and a big reaction. So, the
 

5743
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:55,830
back in and a big reaction. So, the
longer we're there, the more chance

5744
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:55,840
longer we're there, the more chance
 

5745
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:57,750
longer we're there, the more chance
there is. the longer we're here of

5746
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:57,760
there is. the longer we're here of
 

5747
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:00,149
there is. the longer we're here of
chewing through this

5748
02:16:00,149 --> 02:16:00,159
chewing through this
 

5749
02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:02,149
chewing through this
and they if they find acceptance over

5750
02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:02,159
and they if they find acceptance over
 

5751
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:05,109
and they if they find acceptance over
the 900s, then I have no doubt all high

5752
02:16:05,109 --> 02:16:05,119
the 900s, then I have no doubt all high
 

5753
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:07,589
the 900s, then I have no doubt all high
is coming. But

5754
02:16:07,589 --> 02:16:07,599
is coming. But
 

5755
02:16:07,599 --> 02:16:09,510
is coming. But
we're just at a decision-making point at

5756
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:09,520
we're just at a decision-making point at
 

5757
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:10,790
we're just at a decision-making point at
the moment. And you can see it right

5758
02:16:10,790 --> 02:16:10,800
the moment. And you can see it right
 

5759
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,390
the moment. And you can see it right
here. I mean, look how gross this is.

5760
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:12,400
here. I mean, look how gross this is.
 

5761
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,790
here. I mean, look how gross this is.
Think about it. Dump yesterday, drive it

5762
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:14,800
Think about it. Dump yesterday, drive it
 

5763
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:17,030
Think about it. Dump yesterday, drive it
back up. Dump this morning, drive it

5764
02:16:17,030 --> 02:16:17,040
back up. Dump this morning, drive it
 

5765
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:20,470
back up. Dump this morning, drive it
back up. No lows taken, no highs taken.

5766
02:16:20,470 --> 02:16:20,480
back up. No lows taken, no highs taken.
 

5767
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,629
back up. No lows taken, no highs taken.
You're at the midpoint. This is very

5768
02:16:22,629 --> 02:16:22,639
You're at the midpoint. This is very
 

5769
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:23,990
You're at the midpoint. This is very
tricky to trade. Like I said this

5770
02:16:23,990 --> 02:16:24,000
tricky to trade. Like I said this
 

5771
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,669
tricky to trade. Like I said this
morning, I made it really clear. I don't

5772
02:16:25,669 --> 02:16:25,679
morning, I made it really clear. I don't
 

5773
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:28,229
morning, I made it really clear. I don't
want to trade in this zone here. I don't

5774
02:16:28,229 --> 02:16:28,239
want to trade in this zone here. I don't
 

5775
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:31,270
want to trade in this zone here. I don't
I want to see reactions to trade lower

5776
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:31,280
I want to see reactions to trade lower
 

5777
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:33,509
I want to see reactions to trade lower
or reactions to trade higher. I don't

5778
02:16:33,509 --> 02:16:33,519
or reactions to trade higher. I don't
 

5779
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:35,990
or reactions to trade higher. I don't
want to get caught up in this. This is

5780
02:16:35,990 --> 02:16:36,000
want to get caught up in this. This is
 

5781
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,309
want to get caught up in this. This is
pretty much like the same thing I posted

5782
02:16:38,309 --> 02:16:38,319
pretty much like the same thing I posted
 

5783
02:16:38,319 --> 02:16:40,870
pretty much like the same thing I posted
in Discord yesterday, folks.

5784
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:40,880
in Discord yesterday, folks.
 

5785
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:43,110
in Discord yesterday, folks.
Um, if we go over what I talked about

5786
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:43,120
Um, if we go over what I talked about
 

5787
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:46,150
Um, if we go over what I talked about
yesterday, the no trade zone yesterday

5788
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:46,160
yesterday, the no trade zone yesterday
 

5789
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,990
yesterday, the no trade zone yesterday
for the same reasons because we don't

5790
02:16:47,990 --> 02:16:48,000
for the same reasons because we don't
 

5791
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,750
for the same reasons because we don't
want to get caught in liquidity being

5792
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:49,760
want to get caught in liquidity being
 

5793
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:57,830
want to get caught in liquidity being
built,

5794
02:16:57,830 --> 02:16:57,840

 

5795
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:00,950

right? Same thing yesterday.

5796
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:00,960
right? Same thing yesterday.
 

5797
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:06,309
right? Same thing yesterday.
Same kind of zone sort of 500s to 600s.

5798
02:17:06,309 --> 02:17:06,319
Same kind of zone sort of 500s to 600s.
 

5799
02:17:06,319 --> 02:17:10,070
Same kind of zone sort of 500s to 600s.
Same zone, right? Same zone. 500s

600s. Same zone. Dangerous. Dangerous.
Dangerous zone. Looks like they're

5804
02:17:15,589 --> 02:17:15,599
Dangerous zone. Looks like they're
 

5805
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:18,469
Dangerous zone. Looks like they're
trying to force this now,

5806
02:17:18,469 --> 02:17:18,479
trying to force this now,
 

5807
02:17:18,479 --> 02:17:26,150
trying to force this now,
but it's not something I want to touch.

5808
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:26,160

 

5809
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,500

Yeah, exactly. Rosco. Yeah, super close.

5815
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:51,110

Well, that that's the bit, Adam, that

5816
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:51,120
Well, that that's the bit, Adam, that
 

5817
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:52,950
Well, that that's the bit, Adam, that
makes me laugh. This whole line of we're

5818
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:52,960
makes me laugh. This whole line of we're
 

5819
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:56,709
makes me laugh. This whole line of we're
lifting kids out of poverty.

5820
02:17:56,709 --> 02:17:56,719
lifting kids out of poverty.
 

5821
02:17:56,719 --> 02:17:58,230
lifting kids out of poverty.
Bollocks.

5822
02:17:58,230 --> 02:17:58,240
Bollocks.
 

5823
02:17:58,240 --> 02:17:59,830
Bollocks.
You think that money is going to be

5824
02:17:59,830 --> 02:17:59,840
You think that money is going to be
 

5825
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,150
You think that money is going to be
spent on the kids?

5826
02:18:02,150 --> 02:18:02,160
spent on the kids?
 

5827
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:04,230
spent on the kids?
Get out of it.

5828
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:04,240
Get out of it.
 

5829
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:07,750
Get out of it.
Get out of it. What a load of crap.

02:18:07,750 --> 02:18:07,760
Get out of it. What a load of crap.
 

5831
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:09,429
Get out of it. What a load of crap.
Can't wait to see these kids lifted out

5832
02:18:09,429 --> 02:18:09,439
Can't wait to see these kids lifted out
 

5833
02:18:09,439 --> 02:18:12,309
Can't wait to see these kids lifted out
of poverty. And also, you're stifling

5834
02:18:12,309 --> 02:18:12,319
of poverty. And also, you're stifling
 

5835
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:14,950
of poverty. And also, you're stifling
people's,

5836
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:14,960
people's,
 

5837
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:17,110
people's,
I don't know, want or need to have

5838
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:17,120
I don't know, want or need to have
 

5839
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:18,790
I don't know, want or need to have
success.

5840
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:18,800
success.
 

5841
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:20,309
success.
You know, if I want to sell all my

5842
02:18:20,309 --> 02:18:20,319
You know, if I want to sell all my
 

5843
02:18:20,319 --> 02:18:21,589
You know, if I want to sell all my
assets because I don't want to be there

5844
02:18:21,589 --> 02:18:21,599
assets because I don't want to be there
 

5845
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:23,669
assets because I don't want to be there
anymore and I'm going to close down if

5846
02:18:23,669 --> 02:18:23,679
anymore and I'm going to close down if
 

5847
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:25,270
anymore and I'm going to close down if
I'm going to close down my record label,

5848
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:25,280
I'm going to close down my record label,
 

5849
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,429
I'm going to close down my record label,
that's going to affect five to 10 people

5850
02:18:27,429 --> 02:18:27,439
that's going to affect five to 10 people
 

5851
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:29,110
that's going to affect five to 10 people
who I'm no longer going to give money

5852
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:29,120
who I'm no longer going to give money
 

5853
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:32,230
who I'm no longer going to give money
to. All right? So, times that by

5854
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:32,240
to. All right? So, times that by
 

5855
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,309
to. All right? So, times that by
millions of people, you know, you've got

5856
02:18:34,309 --> 02:18:34,319
millions of people, you know, you've got
 

5857
02:18:34,319 --> 02:18:36,469
millions of people, you know, you've got
a vacuum. You've got money leaving the

5858
02:18:36,469 --> 02:18:36,479
a vacuum. You've got money leaving the
 

5859
02:18:36,479 --> 02:18:38,549
a vacuum. You've got money leaving the
UK and going elsewhere. And you've got

5860
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:38,559
UK and going elsewhere. And you've got
 

5861
02:18:38,559 --> 02:18:40,709
UK and going elsewhere. And you've got
less people making money because people

5862
02:18:40,709 --> 02:18:40,719
less people making money because people
 

5863
02:18:40,719 --> 02:18:43,910
less people making money because people
like me are taking jobs away.

5864
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:43,920
like me are taking jobs away.
 

5865
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:49,750
like me are taking jobs away.
Who are you taxing then?

5866
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:49,760

 

5867
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:52,230

It's just stupid. It's just stupid.

5868
02:18:52,230 --> 02:18:52,240
It's just stupid. It's just stupid.
 

5869
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:56,709
It's just stupid. It's just stupid.
Stupid. Stupid government. Stupid.

5870
02:18:56,709 --> 02:18:56,719
Stupid. Stupid government. Stupid.
 

5871
02:18:56,719 --> 02:18:59,030
Stupid. Stupid government. Stupid.
But what do we expect? You know, they're

5872
02:18:59,030 --> 02:18:59,040
But what do we expect? You know, they're
 

5873
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:00,950
But what do we expect? You know, they're
all a bunch of idiots. Doesn't matter

5874
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:00,960
all a bunch of idiots. Doesn't matter
 

5875
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:02,629
all a bunch of idiots. Doesn't matter
what party they are, where they're from,

5876
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:02,639
what party they are, where they're from,
 

5877
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:04,790
what party they are, where they're from,
they're all a bunch of pricks.

5878
02:19:04,790 --> 02:19:04,800
they're all a bunch of pricks.
 

5879
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:07,509
they're all a bunch of pricks.
All right, squeeze squeeze up now. So,

5880
02:19:07,509 --> 02:19:07,519
All right, squeeze squeeze up now. So,
 

5881
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:09,270
All right, squeeze squeeze up now. So,
failed to break lower. They had a re

5882
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:09,280
failed to break lower. They had a re
 

5883
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,950
failed to break lower. They had a re
attempt to break lower, failed to break

5884
02:19:10,950 --> 02:19:10,960
attempt to break lower, failed to break
 

5885
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:13,910
attempt to break lower, failed to break
lower. That's the continuation. And

5886
02:19:13,910 --> 02:19:13,920
lower. That's the continuation. And
 

5887
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,429
lower. That's the continuation. And
they're going to look to come all the

5888
02:19:15,429 --> 02:19:15,439
they're going to look to come all the
 

5889
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:17,030
they're going to look to come all the
way up here to test previous day value

5890
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:17,040
way up here to test previous day value
 

5891
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:18,709
way up here to test previous day value
area high, previous day high, and

5892
02:19:18,709 --> 02:19:18,719
area high, previous day high, and
 

5893
02:19:18,719 --> 02:19:20,790
area high, previous day high, and
GlobeEx. So, they're going to try and

5894
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:20,800
GlobeEx. So, they're going to try and
 

5895
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:22,950
GlobeEx. So, they're going to try and
walk back this whole move, right? This

5896
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:22,960
walk back this whole move, right? This
 

5897
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,190
walk back this whole move, right? This
was probably heavily manipulated so that

5898
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:25,200
was probably heavily manipulated so that
 

5899
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:26,629
was probably heavily manipulated so that
they can buy it cheap to get all the way

5900
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:26,639
they can buy it cheap to get all the way
 

5901
02:19:26,639 --> 02:19:28,469
they can buy it cheap to get all the way
back up.

5902
02:19:28,469 --> 02:19:28,479
back up.
 

5903
02:19:28,479 --> 02:19:30,790
back up.
It's just

5904
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:30,800
It's just
 

5905
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:33,589
It's just
like we said, we're trading a small cap.

5906
02:19:33,589 --> 02:19:33,599
like we said, we're trading a small cap.
 

5907
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:35,030
like we said, we're trading a small cap.
We're trading the biggest small cap in

5908
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:35,040
We're trading the biggest small cap in
 

5909
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:41,466
We're trading the biggest small cap in
the world. That's what we're trading.

5910
02:19:41,466 --> 02:19:41,476

[sighs]

5914
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:55,200

 

5915
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,030

What level do we need to break to call

5916
02:19:57,030 --> 02:19:57,040
What level do we need to break to call
 

5917
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:59,590
What level do we need to break to call
this a bare higher time frame? Oh god.

5918
02:19:59,590 --> 02:19:59,600
this a bare higher time frame? Oh god.
 

5919
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,429
this a bare higher time frame? Oh god.
Uh, a lot. I mean, it's not bearish

5920
02:20:01,429 --> 02:20:01,439
Uh, a lot. I mean, it's not bearish
 

5921
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:04,230
Uh, a lot. I mean, it's not bearish
higher time frame. I mean,

5922
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:04,240
higher time frame. I mean,
 

5923
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:07,349
higher time frame. I mean,
bulls have the impetus right now.

5924
02:20:07,349 --> 02:20:07,359
bulls have the impetus right now.
 

5925
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:11,510
bulls have the impetus right now.
Uh, I would need to see a breakdown

5926
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:11,520
Uh, I would need to see a breakdown
 

5927
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:13,750
Uh, I would need to see a breakdown
inside of previous week's value and

5928
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:13,760
inside of previous week's value and
 

5929
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:16,150
inside of previous week's value and
really like let go of 950s. If we start

5930
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:16,160
really like let go of 950s. If we start
 

5931
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:18,150
really like let go of 950s. If we start
let go of 950s, then I think bears have

5932
02:20:18,150 --> 02:20:18,160
let go of 950s, then I think bears have
 

5933
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:20,710
let go of 950s, then I think bears have
got a case. But, you know what? All I

5934
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:20,720
got a case. But, you know what? All I
 

5935
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:22,710
got a case. But, you know what? All I
want to see is a pull back to 950 to buy

5936
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:22,720
want to see is a pull back to 950 to buy
 

5937
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:24,469
want to see is a pull back to 950 to buy
it at the moment. And we're just not

5938
02:20:24,469 --> 02:20:24,479
it at the moment. And we're just not
 

5939
02:20:24,479 --> 02:20:26,389
it at the moment. And we're just not
seeing that. Bears

5940
02:20:26,389 --> 02:20:26,399
seeing that. Bears
 

5941
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:29,030
seeing that. Bears
failing to do

5942
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:29,040
failing to do
 

5943
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:32,550
failing to do
their job. Um,

5944
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:32,560
their job. Um,
 

5945
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:34,630
their job. Um,
and this just seems like it was a big

5946
02:20:34,630 --> 02:20:34,640
and this just seems like it was a big
 

5947
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:38,389
and this just seems like it was a big
manipulative trap. Release some PR,

5948
02:20:38,389 --> 02:20:38,399
manipulative trap. Release some PR,
 

5949
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:41,110
manipulative trap. Release some PR,
which is [\h__\h]

5950
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:41,120
which is [\h__\h]

Protect the low knowing that everyone

5952
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:43,040
Protect the low knowing that everyone
 

5953
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:45,270
Protect the low knowing that everyone
will look for that rotation.

5954
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:45,280
will look for that rotation.
 

5955
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:46,950
will look for that rotation.
And then release an article saying,

5956
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:46,960
And then release an article saying,
 

5957
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:49,910
And then release an article saying,
"Hey, this up here was wrong."

5958
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:49,920
"Hey, this up here was wrong."
 

5959
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:56,230
"Hey, this up here was wrong."
Okay. And up we go.

5960
02:20:56,230 --> 02:20:56,240

 

5961
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:59,510

If there was a governing body,

5962
02:20:59,510 --> 02:20:59,520
If there was a governing body,
 

5963
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:02,469
If there was a governing body,
wouldn't you investigate this?

5964
02:21:02,469 --> 02:21:02,479
wouldn't you investigate this?
 

5965
02:21:02,479 --> 02:21:04,230
wouldn't you investigate this?
Problem is the people doing this, people

5966
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:04,240
Problem is the people doing this, people
 

5967
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:06,617
Problem is the people doing this, people
in charge of the market.

5971
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:24,150

Dirty dirty games.

5972
02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:24,160

 

5973
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:27,190

So, back above the close price. VIX is

5974
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:27,200
So, back above the close price. VIX is
 

5975
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,790
So, back above the close price. VIX is
getting absolutely pummeled right now,

02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:28,800
getting absolutely pummeled right now,
 

5977
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:32,950
getting absolutely pummeled right now,
folks. And ES is not too far or SPY not

folks. And ES is not too far or SPY not
 

5979
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:35,270

too far from previous day high. Where's

5980
02:21:35,270 --> 02:21:35,280
too far from previous day high. Where's
 

5981
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:36,870
too far from previous day high. Where's
ES? Is it there? It's not too far

5982
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:36,880
ES? Is it there? It's not too far
 

5983
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,990
ES? Is it there? It's not too far
either. It's at GlobeEx.

5984
02:21:39,990 --> 02:21:40,000

So, you've got like a triple top up here

5986
02:21:41,830 --> 02:21:41,840
So, you've got like a triple top up here
 

5987
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:46,309
So, you've got like a triple top up here
on ES. So, every push into 64, 63, and

5988
02:21:46,309 --> 02:21:46,319
on ES. So, every push into 64, 63, and
 

5989
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:48,950
on ES. So, every push into 64, 63, and
62 so far has been sold into over the

02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:48,960
62 so far has been sold into over the

5993
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:53,670

But, you know, we've been up here many,

5994
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:53,680
But, you know, we've been up here many,
 

5995
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:56,309
But, you know, we've been up here many,
many, many times. At some point, it's

5996
02:21:56,309 --> 02:21:56,319
many, many times. At some point, it's
 

5997
02:21:56,319 --> 02:21:58,309
many, many times. At some point, it's
probably going to bust through it. Can't

5998
02:21:58,309 --> 02:21:58,319
probably going to bust through it. Can't
 

5999
02:21:58,319 --> 02:22:10,153
probably going to bust through it. Can't
keep doing this forever.

What a market.

6005
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:51,419

Who's in control right now?

6006
02:22:51,419 --> 02:22:51,429

 

6007
02:22:51,429 --> 02:23:02,790

>> [sighs]

6009
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:53,510

>> 20 minutes left. Get out of it.

6010
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:53,520

 

6011
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:54,950

Sorry, I'm just catching up on the news

6012
02:23:54,950 --> 02:23:54,960
Sorry, I'm just catching up on the news
 

6013
02:23:54,960 --> 02:24:06,950
Sorry, I'm just catching up on the news
here.

6014
02:24:06,950 --> 02:24:06,960

 

6015
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,030

I don't know why everyone gives a [\h__\h]

6016
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:09,040
I don't know why everyone gives a [\h__\h]
 

6017
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:10,630
I don't know why everyone gives a [\h__\h]
so much about this fed appointment.

6018
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:10,640
so much about this fed appointment.
 

6019
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:14,150
so much about this fed appointment.
Like,

6020
02:24:14,150 --> 02:24:14,160

 

6021
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,670

we know who it's going to be and we know

6022
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:15,680
we know who it's going to be and we know
 

6023
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:17,190
we know who it's going to be and we know
he's going to be a puppet. So, why does

6024
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:17,200
he's going to be a puppet. So, why does
 

6025
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,510
he's going to be a puppet. So, why does
it matter?

6026
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,520
it matter?
 

6027
02:24:19,520 --> 02:25:04,870
it matter?
So stupid.

6028
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:04,880

 

6029
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:06,790

We won't need a 50-year mortgage if they

6030
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:06,800
We won't need a 50-year mortgage if they
 

6031
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:09,190
We won't need a 50-year mortgage if they
lower rates. And I don't think the

6032
02:25:09,190 --> 02:25:09,200
lower rates. And I don't think the
 

6033
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,630
lower rates. And I don't think the
mortgage has got anything to do with

6034
02:25:10,630 --> 02:25:10,640
mortgage has got anything to do with
 

6035
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:12,389
mortgage has got anything to do with
rates. It's to do with the housing

6036
02:25:12,389 --> 02:25:12,399
rates. It's to do with the housing
 

6037
02:25:12,399 --> 02:25:14,550
rates. It's to do with the housing
prices and the lack of capital. I don't

6038
02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:14,560
prices and the lack of capital. I don't
 

6039
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:16,790
prices and the lack of capital. I don't
think that's going to make a difference.

6040
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:16,800
think that's going to make a difference.
 

6041
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:19,190
think that's going to make a difference.
Save one or two% on the mortgage, it's

6042
02:25:19,190 --> 02:25:19,200
Save one or two% on the mortgage, it's
 

6043
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:36,550
Save one or two% on the mortgage, it's
not going to make a difference.

6044
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:36,560

 

6045
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:38,150

Do you guys think they actually get rid

6046
02:25:38,150 --> 02:25:38,160
Do you guys think they actually get rid
 

6047
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:44,469
Do you guys think they actually get rid
of inflation of inflation in um

6048
02:25:44,469 --> 02:25:44,479

 

6049
02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:48,950

saying he's going to get rid of it. Do
 

6057
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:57,190
saying he's going to get rid of it. Do
you think that actually happens because

6058
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:57,200
you think that actually happens because
 

6059
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:59,270
you think that actually happens because
they're making so much money? What they

6060
02:25:59,270 --> 02:25:59,280
they're making so much money? What they
 

6061
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:10,870
they're making so much money? What they
said?

6062

6063
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:19,910

You don't think so, Miguel?

6064
02:26:19,910 --> 02:26:19,920

 

6065
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:23,190

That be it' be great if they did.

6066
02:26:23,190 --> 02:26:23,200
That be it' be great if they did.
 

6067
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:24,630
That be it' be great if they did.
I don't think there's a hope in hell of

I don't think there's a hope in hell of
 

6069
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:28,710
I don't think there's a hope in hell of
it happening, but

02:26:28,710 --> 02:26:28,720

 

6071
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:35,030

they'd find it somewhere else. No doubt.

6072
02:26:35,030 --> 02:26:35,040

 

6073
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:36,630

Oh, still in control here. They just

6074
02:26:36,630 --> 02:26:36,640
Oh, still in control here. They just
 

6075
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:38,389
Oh, still in control here. They just
held previous day point of control there

6076
02:26:38,389 --> 02:26:38,399
held previous day point of control there
 

6077
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:40,070
held previous day point of control there
and the close the 600s. That's your

6078
02:26:40,070 --> 02:26:40,080
and the close the 600s. That's your
 

6079
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:43,030
and the close the 600s. That's your
overunder for a resqueeze higher. they

6080
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:43,040
overunder for a resqueeze higher. they
 

6081
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:45,270
overunder for a resqueeze higher. they
can afford a drift back into this gray

6082
02:26:45,270 --> 02:26:45,280
can afford a drift back into this gray
 

6083
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:46,790
can afford a drift back into this gray
box and shelf. So you can see current

6084
02:26:46,790 --> 02:26:46,800
box and shelf. So you can see current
 

6085
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:48,870
box and shelf. So you can see current
value on the day. They're now trying to

6086
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:48,880
value on the day. They're now trying to
 

6087
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:50,630
value on the day. They're now trying to
hold current value on the day. So bears

6088
02:26:50,630 --> 02:26:50,640
hold current value on the day. So bears
 

6089
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:52,870
hold current value on the day. So bears
had the chance for this rotation here.

6090
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:52,880
had the chance for this rotation here.
 

6091

We got absorbed at the time. This was

We got absorbed at the time. This was
 

6093
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:57,270
We got absorbed at the time. This was
value low on the day. I'm pretty sure

6094
02:26:57,270 --> 02:26:57,280
value low on the day. I'm pretty sure
 

6095
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:58,950
value low on the day. I'm pretty sure
there's your higher low and they've gone

6096
02:26:58,950 --> 02:26:58,960
there's your higher low and they've gone
 

6097
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:01,110
there's your higher low and they've gone
for a squeeze. There's your continuation

6098
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:01,120
for a squeeze. There's your continuation
 

6099
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:02,790
for a squeeze. There's your continuation
pattern. Now if they hold this, the

6100
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:02,800
pattern. Now if they hold this, the
 

6101
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:04,469
pattern. Now if they hold this, the
completion will be previous day value

6102
02:27:04,469 --> 02:27:04,479
completion will be previous day value
 

6103
02:27:04,479 --> 02:27:06,950
completion will be previous day value
high. Previous day high globeex. That's

02:27:06,950 --> 02:27:06,960
high. Previous day high globeex. That's
 

6105
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:07,990

what they're trying to do for a

as we've done here. Right? It's just
level to level. It's back test level to

6230
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:55,120
level to level. It's back test level to
 

6231
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:57,429
level to level. It's back test level to
level. Buyers still in control for me.

6232
02:31:57,429 --> 02:31:57,439
level. Buyers still in control for me.
 

6233
02:31:57,439 --> 02:31:59,270
level. Buyers still in control for me.
Right. main pivots sort of like this

6234
02:31:59,270 --> 02:31:59,280
Right. main pivots sort of like this
 

6235
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:02,150
Right. main pivots sort of like this
right now. Right. So, all the time this

6236
02:32:02,150 --> 02:32:02,160
right now. Right. So, all the time this
 

6237
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:04,150
right now. Right. So, all the time this
is being held by is still technically in

6238
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:04,160
is being held by is still technically in
 

6239
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:06,230
is being held by is still technically in
control. And I'd say they'd want to hold

6240
02:32:06,230 --> 02:32:06,240
control. And I'd say they'd want to hold
 

6241
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:09,270
control. And I'd say they'd want to hold
definitely this and possibly this.

6242
02:32:09,270 --> 02:32:09,280
definitely this and possibly this.
 

6243
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:15,910
definitely this and possibly this.
And you're running out of time.

6244
02:32:15,910 --> 02:32:15,920

 

6245
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:18,389

Yes. Coming into that zone where and spy

6246
02:32:18,389 --> 02:32:18,399
Yes. Coming into that zone where and spy
 

6247
02:32:18,399 --> 02:32:19,830
Yes. Coming into that zone where and spy
where it's sold off every time it's

6248
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:19,840
where it's sold off every time it's
 

6249
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:21,190
where it's sold off every time it's
approached it. At some point that's

6250
02:32:21,190 --> 02:32:21,200
approached it. At some point that's
 

6251
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:22,630
approached it. At some point that's
going to give. I don't know if it's

6252
02:32:22,630 --> 02:32:22,640
going to give. I don't know if it's
 

6253
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:25,110
going to give. I don't know if it's
today.

6254
02:32:25,110 --> 02:32:25,120
today.
 

6255
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:33,110
today.
Let me check the daily.

6256
02:32:33,110 --> 02:32:33,120

 

6257
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,910

They close it.

6258
02:32:35,910 --> 02:32:35,920
They close it.
 

6259
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:40,790
They close it.
I'd say break 673 opens you up for 720

6260
02:32:40,790 --> 02:32:40,800
I'd say break 673 opens you up for 720
 

6261
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:52,230
I'd say break 673 opens you up for 720
and then 830.

6262
02:32:52,230 --> 02:32:52,240

 

6263
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:54,790

This is your old box. Just do on a five

6264
02:32:54,790 --> 02:32:54,800
This is your old box. Just do on a five
 

6265
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:56,790
This is your old box. Just do on a five
minute All

6266
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:56,800
minute All
 

6267
02:32:56,800 --> 02:33:01,590
minute All
right, that's your supply.

6268
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:01,600

 

6269
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:05,349

Never broke the low. This is gross.

6270
02:33:05,349 --> 02:33:05,359
Never broke the low. This is gross.
 

6271
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:12,630
Never broke the low. This is gross.
Never broke the low.

6272
02:33:12,630 --> 02:33:12,640

 

6273
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:15,590

Held this old volume edge. Clearly

6274
02:33:15,590 --> 02:33:15,600
Held this old volume edge. Clearly
 

6275
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:17,110
Held this old volume edge. Clearly
didn't want to let this go. So, we know

6276
02:33:17,110 --> 02:33:17,120
didn't want to let this go. So, we know
 

6277
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:20,150
didn't want to let this go. So, we know
this is big demand pocket down here.

6278
02:33:20,150 --> 02:33:20,160
this is big demand pocket down here.
 

6279
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:21,830
this is big demand pocket down here.
The only thing left for them to do is

6280
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:21,840
The only thing left for them to do is
 

6281
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:27,830
The only thing left for them to do is
try and get through this.

6282
02:33:27,830 --> 02:33:27,840

 

6283
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:33,349

and start this squeeze and then attack

6284
02:33:33,349 --> 02:33:33,359

 

6285
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:35,429

some stops from here. All right. So,

6286
02:33:35,429 --> 02:33:35,439
some stops from here. All right. So,
 

6287
02:33:35,439 --> 02:33:37,429
some stops from here. All right. So,
sort of 716

6288
02:33:37,429 --> 02:33:37,439
sort of 716
 

6289
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:39,429
sort of 716
and 8:30. That's what they want to do.

6290
02:33:39,429 --> 02:33:39,439
and 8:30. That's what they want to do.
 

6291
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:40,870
and 8:30. That's what they want to do.
Whether they can do it today session or

6292
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:40,880
Whether they can do it today session or
 

6293
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:43,670
Whether they can do it today session or
not will have to remain to be seen. We

6294
02:33:43,670 --> 02:33:43,680
not will have to remain to be seen. We
 

6295
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:50,389
not will have to remain to be seen. We
can see it's a big big thick area.

6296
02:33:50,389 --> 02:33:50,399

 

6297
02:33:50,399 --> 02:33:54,630

02:35:16,630 --> 02:35:16,640
it rotates in this area. Rotates,
 

6351
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:21,190

Really big area. It's why I'm trying not

6356
02:35:26,870 --> 02:35:26,880
Really big area. It's why I'm trying not
 

6357
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:29,349
Really big area. It's why I'm trying not
to trade in it. It's what I've said all

6358
02:35:29,349 --> 02:35:29,359
to trade in it. It's what I've said all

6360
02:35:30,710 --> 02:35:30,720
day. I'm not going to trade in that
 

6361
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:34,469
day. I'm not going to trade in that
zone. It's uh I don't like trading

6362
02:35:34,469 --> 02:35:34,479
zone. It's uh I don't like trading
 

6363
02:35:34,479 --> 02:35:36,790
zone. It's uh I don't like trading
rotation. I like markets which have trap

6364
02:35:36,790 --> 02:35:36,800
rotation. I like markets which have trap
 

6365
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:39,190
rotation. I like markets which have trap
traders in or in breakout. Here we go.

6366
02:35:39,190 --> 02:35:39,200
traders in or in breakout. Here we go.
 

6367
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:41,429
traders in or in breakout. Here we go.
So, rotation starting again. And if it

6368
02:35:41,429 --> 02:35:41,439
So, rotation starting again. And if it
 

6369
02:35:41,439 --> 02:35:42,950
So, rotation starting again. And if it
loses gray box, it's going to come down

6370
02:35:42,950 --> 02:35:42,960
loses gray box, it's going to come down
 

6371
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:44,630
loses gray box, it's going to come down
to this blue box like I just said. All

6372
02:35:44,630 --> 02:35:44,640
to this blue box like I just said. All
 

6373
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:46,550
to this blue box like I just said. All
right, so you're late in the day trying

6374
02:35:46,550 --> 02:35:46,560
right, so you're late in the day trying
 

6375
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:49,349
right, so you're late in the day trying
to long here and you're liable

6376
02:35:49,349 --> 02:35:49,359
to long here and you're liable
 

6377
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:52,950
to long here and you're liable
to come down into this node here.

6378
02:35:52,950 --> 02:35:52,960
to come down into this node here.
 

6379
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,550
to come down into this node here.
All right, so they might reject this and

6380
02:35:54,550 --> 02:35:54,560
All right, so they might reject this and
 

6381
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:56,309
All right, so they might reject this and
come down into this. Now, if they fail

6382
02:35:56,309 --> 02:35:56,319
come down into this. Now, if they fail
 

6383
02:35:56,319 --> 02:35:57,830
come down into this. Now, if they fail
that, they come right back down into

6384
02:35:57,830 --> 02:35:57,840
that, they come right back down into
 

6385
02:35:57,840 --> 02:35:59,110
that, they come right back down into
here because this is where you've

6386
02:35:59,110 --> 02:35:59,120
here because this is where you've
 

6387
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:01,110
here because this is where you've
rotated all day and every look above

6388
02:36:01,110 --> 02:36:01,120
rotated all day and every look above
 

6389
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:03,510
rotated all day and every look above
here so far has failed. No different

6390
02:36:03,510 --> 02:36:03,520
here so far has failed. No different
 

6391
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:05,429
here so far has failed. No different
now.

6392
02:36:05,429 --> 02:36:05,439
now.
 

6393
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:07,670
now.
And S&P just failed that same level.

6394
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:07,680
And S&P just failed that same level.
 

6395
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:10,550
And S&P just failed that same level.
It's failed four times now over the last

6396
02:36:10,550 --> 02:36:10,560
It's failed four times now over the last
 

6397
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:13,110
It's failed four times now over the last
I know five, six days, [snorts]

6398
02:36:13,110 --> 02:36:13,120
I know five, six days, [snorts]
 

6399
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:14,550
I know five, six days, [snorts]
right? And there's the rotation again.

6400
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:14,560
right? And there's the rotation again.
 

6401
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:15,670
right? And there's the rotation again.
This is why I don't want to trade in

6402
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:15,680
This is why I don't want to trade in
 

6403
02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:17,990
This is why I don't want to trade in
this area, folks. This is exactly why I

6404
02:36:17,990 --> 02:36:18,000
this area, folks. This is exactly why I
 

6405
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,030
this area, folks. This is exactly why I
don't want to trade in this area. So,

6406
02:36:19,030 --> 02:36:19,040
don't want to trade in this area. So,
 

6407
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:21,270
don't want to trade in this area. So,
here's your blue box. If they fail this,

6408
02:36:21,270 --> 02:36:21,280
here's your blue box. If they fail this,
 

6409
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:22,550
here's your blue box. If they fail this,
they keep coming down to the gray box

6410
02:36:22,550 --> 02:36:22,560
they keep coming down to the gray box
 

6411
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:23,910
they keep coming down to the gray box
underneath. If they find a bid here,

6412
02:36:23,910 --> 02:36:23,920
underneath. If they find a bid here,
 

6413
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,670
underneath. If they find a bid here,
they're coming back and back test that

6414
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:25,680
they're coming back and back test that
 

6415
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:33,190
they're coming back and back test that
gray box above.

6416
02:36:33,190 --> 02:36:33,200

 

6417
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:35,110

It's just understanding the conditions.

6418
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:35,120
It's just understanding the conditions.
 

6419
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:37,030
It's just understanding the conditions.
This is a rotational market. These are

6420
02:36:37,030 --> 02:36:37,040
This is a rotational market. These are
 

6421
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:39,270
This is a rotational market. These are
the conditions we are being dealt at the

6422
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:39,280
the conditions we are being dealt at the
 

6423
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:40,790
the conditions we are being dealt at the
moment.

6424
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:40,800
moment.
 

6425
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:43,030
moment.
I find these very frustrating. So, I try

6426
02:36:43,030 --> 02:36:43,040
I find these very frustrating. So, I try
 

6427
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:45,910
I find these very frustrating. So, I try
and get my bag and uh leave the rest

6428
02:36:45,910 --> 02:36:45,920
and get my bag and uh leave the rest
 

6429
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:49,270
and get my bag and uh leave the rest
alone cuz if you're trying to sit unless

6430
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:49,280
alone cuz if you're trying to sit unless
 

6431
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,990
alone cuz if you're trying to sit unless
you are the guy with the knowledge who's

6432
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:52,000
you are the guy with the knowledge who's
 

6433
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,790
you are the guy with the knowledge who's
like look this is all [\h__\h] and then

6434
02:36:54,790 --> 02:36:54,800
like look this is all [\h__\h] and then
 

6435
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:56,309
like look this is all [\h__\h] and then
we're not going to take this out. If we'

6436
02:36:56,309 --> 02:36:56,319
we're not going to take this out. If we'
 

6437
02:36:56,319 --> 02:36:58,309
we're not going to take this out. If we'
taken that out and then reclaimed, I

6438
02:36:58,309 --> 02:36:58,319
taken that out and then reclaimed, I
 

6439
02:36:58,319 --> 02:36:59,670
taken that out and then reclaimed, I
would have been happy about taking a

6440
02:36:59,670 --> 02:36:59,680
would have been happy about taking a
 

6441
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:01,670
would have been happy about taking a
long because we'd have no reason to come

6442
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:01,680
long because we'd have no reason to come
 

6443
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:03,110
long because we'd have no reason to come
back down here. The fact that we left

6444
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:03,120
back down here. The fact that we left
 

6445
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:05,190
back down here. The fact that we left
that made very hard to think about

6446
02:37:05,190 --> 02:37:05,200
that made very hard to think about
 

6447
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:07,190
that made very hard to think about
taking longs.

6448
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:07,200
taking longs.
 

6449
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:10,550
taking longs.
But if we think about the structure,

6450
02:37:10,550 --> 02:37:10,560
But if we think about the structure,
 

6451
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:12,790
But if we think about the structure,
rebase,

6452
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:12,800
rebase,
 

6453
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,790
rebase,
rebase,

6454
02:37:14,790 --> 02:37:14,800
rebase,
 

6455
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:18,150
rebase,
tried to rebase, failed down into here.

6456
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:18,160
tried to rebase, failed down into here.
 

6457
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:20,309
tried to rebase, failed down into here.
Tried it again, failed down into here.

6458
02:37:20,309 --> 02:37:20,319
Tried it again, failed down into here.
 

6459
02:37:20,319 --> 02:37:23,590
Tried it again, failed down into here.
All right, this is still moving upside.

6460
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:23,600
All right, this is still moving upside.
 

6461
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:25,190
All right, this is still moving upside.
This whole thing, if they want to

6462
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:25,200
This whole thing, if they want to
 

6463
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:26,630
This whole thing, if they want to
collapse this whole thing and come down

6464
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:26,640
collapse this whole thing and come down
 

6465
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:28,710
collapse this whole thing and come down
for here, they can because they haven't

6466
02:37:28,710 --> 02:37:28,720
for here, they can because they haven't
 

6467
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:31,030
for here, they can because they haven't
taken out this low. That makes it very

6468
02:37:31,030 --> 02:37:31,040
taken out this low. That makes it very
 

6469
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:33,670
taken out this low. That makes it very
hard for me to be convinced about taking

6470
02:37:33,670 --> 02:37:33,680
hard for me to be convinced about taking
 

6471
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:38,150
hard for me to be convinced about taking
a uh big bullish move higher right now.

6472
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:38,160
a uh big bullish move higher right now.
 

6473
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:44,309
a uh big bullish move higher right now.
They've got targets above.

6474
02:37:44,309 --> 02:37:44,319

 

6475
02:37:44,319 --> 02:37:45,750

Think about the spy. It keeps failing

6476
02:37:45,750 --> 02:37:45,760
Think about the spy. It keeps failing
 

6477
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:51,910
Think about the spy. It keeps failing
these same levels.

6478
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:51,920

 

6479
02:37:51,920 --> 02:38:00,550

The same level just talked about it.

6480
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:00,560

 

6481
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:03,030

This is your box.

6482
02:38:03,030 --> 02:38:03,040
This is your box.
 

6483
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:04,550
This is your box.
Think about those in Discord. Think

6484
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:04,560
Think about those in Discord. Think
 

6485
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:06,309
Think about those in Discord. Think
about what we went over this morning.

6486
02:38:06,309 --> 02:38:06,319
about what we went over this morning.
 

6487
02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:10,950
about what we went over this morning.
Here's your box on Spy.

6488
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:10,960
Here's your box on Spy.
 

6489
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:12,710
Here's your box on Spy.
Where's my Discord? Where is this

6490
02:38:12,710 --> 02:38:12,720
Where's my Discord? Where is this
 

6491
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:15,030
Where's my Discord? Where is this
morning?

6492
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:15,040
morning?
 

6493
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:16,630
morning?
There's your box. All right, we talked

02:38:16,630 --> 02:38:16,640
There's your box. All right, we talked
 

6495
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:18,070
There's your box. All right, we talked
about it this morning. We're still boxed

6496
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:18,080
about it this morning. We're still boxed
 

6497
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:21,750
about it this morning. We're still boxed
in. Nothing's changed. We're boxed in.

6498
02:38:21,750 --> 02:38:21,760
in. Nothing's changed. We're boxed in.
 

6499
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:23,110
in. Nothing's changed. We're boxed in.
We've traded to the top side of that

6500
02:38:23,110 --> 02:38:23,120
We've traded to the top side of that
 

6501
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:25,670
We've traded to the top side of that
box. We failed that box.

6502
02:38:25,670 --> 02:38:25,680
box. We failed that box.
 

6503
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:27,429
box. We failed that box.
VIX still boxed in as well. It's

6504
02:38:27,429 --> 02:38:27,439
VIX still boxed in as well. It's
 

6505
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:28,950
VIX still boxed in as well. It's
dripping lower, but it's still boxed in.

6506
02:38:28,950 --> 02:38:28,960
dripping lower, but it's still boxed in.
 

6507
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:31,349
dripping lower, but it's still boxed in.
We're not breaking out, right? So, we're

6508
02:38:31,349 --> 02:38:31,359
We're not breaking out, right? So, we're
 

6509
02:38:31,359 --> 02:38:33,110
We're not breaking out, right? So, we're
just seeing exactly what we expected

6510
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:33,120
just seeing exactly what we expected
 

6511
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:35,349
just seeing exactly what we expected
today.

6512
02:38:35,349 --> 02:38:35,359
today.
 

6513
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:37,190
today.
It's all about how much frustration can

6514
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:37,200
It's all about how much frustration can
 

6515
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:41,670
It's all about how much frustration can
you deal with

6516
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:41,680

 

6517
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:44,630

because right here

6518
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:44,640
because right here
 

6519
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:46,710
because right here
we're building liquidity higher time

6520
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:46,720
we're building liquidity higher time
 

6521
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:57,270
we're building liquidity higher time
frame.

6522
02:38:57,270 --> 02:38:57,280

 

6523
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:01,030

big head and shoulders on a daily.

6524
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:01,040
big head and shoulders on a daily.
 

6525
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:03,670
big head and shoulders on a daily.
That's what everyone's calling for. Um,

6526
02:39:03,670 --> 02:39:03,680
That's what everyone's calling for. Um,
 

6527
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:07,190
That's what everyone's calling for. Um,
but you know, until we break down,

6528
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:07,200
but you know, until we break down,
 

6529
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:10,550
but you know, until we break down,
I think it's very hard to call for that.

6530
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:10,560
I think it's very hard to call for that.
 

6531
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:13,190
I think it's very hard to call for that.
It's what everyone's trying to call for.

6532
02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:13,200
It's what everyone's trying to call for.
 

6533
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:16,870
It's what everyone's trying to call for.
But I would argue, right, the big loud

6534
02:39:16,870 --> 02:39:16,880
But I would argue, right, the big loud
 

6535
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:18,870
But I would argue, right, the big loud
mouths on Twitter who were calling for

6536
02:39:18,870 --> 02:39:18,880
mouths on Twitter who were calling for
 

6537
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:20,309
mouths on Twitter who were calling for
that here saying, "Oh, we're going to go

6538
02:39:20,309 --> 02:39:20,319
that here saying, "Oh, we're going to go
 

6539
02:39:20,319 --> 02:39:21,429
that here saying, "Oh, we're going to go
back up and we're going to form the

6540
02:39:21,429 --> 02:39:21,439
back up and we're going to form the
 

6541
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:22,790
back up and we're going to form the
right shoulder." Right? You're already

6542
02:39:22,790 --> 02:39:22,800
right shoulder." Right? You're already
 

6543
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:26,070
right shoulder." Right? You're already
above that right shoulder line. I'd say

6544
02:39:26,070 --> 02:39:26,080
above that right shoulder line. I'd say
 

6545
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:28,070
above that right shoulder line. I'd say
there's two problems with this. One, we

6546
02:39:28,070 --> 02:39:28,080
there's two problems with this. One, we
 

6547
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:31,670
there's two problems with this. One, we
swept this low. Damage was done. Lower

6548
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:31,680
swept this low. Damage was done. Lower
 

6549
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:33,910
swept this low. Damage was done. Lower
Ballinger band. Two, we're above the

6550
02:39:33,910 --> 02:39:33,920
Ballinger band. Two, we're above the
 

6551
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:37,270
Ballinger band. Two, we're above the
shoulder line.

6552
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:37,280

 

6553
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:38,870

doesn't look too good because if they

6554
02:39:38,870 --> 02:39:38,880
doesn't look too good because if they
 

6555
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:41,590
doesn't look too good because if they
keep holding this all these guys who are

6556
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:41,600
keep holding this all these guys who are
 

6557
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,030
keep holding this all these guys who are
like we're going to go back to lows,

6558
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:43,040
like we're going to go back to lows,
 

6559
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:44,150
like we're going to go back to lows,
we're going to go back to lows. We're

6560
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:44,160
we're going to go back to lows. We're
 

6561
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:45,349
we're going to go back to lows. We're
short. We're short. We're short. We're

6562
02:39:45,349 --> 02:39:45,359
short. We're short. We're short. We're
 

6563
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:47,270
short. We're short. We're short. We're
short. We're short. If we go here for a

6564
02:39:47,270 --> 02:39:47,280
short. We're short. If we go here for a
 

6565
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:49,670
short. We're short. If we go here for a
week and then we break out above this,

6566
02:39:49,670 --> 02:39:49,680
week and then we break out above this,
 

6567
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:53,190
week and then we break out above this,
guess what happens.

6568
02:39:53,190 --> 02:39:53,200

 

6569
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:55,429

All right. So, this is why I'm

6570
02:39:55,429 --> 02:39:55,439
All right. So, this is why I'm
 

6571
02:39:55,439 --> 02:39:58,150
All right. So, this is why I'm
apprehensive right now about having too

6572
02:39:58,150 --> 02:39:58,160
apprehensive right now about having too
 

6573
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:01,030
apprehensive right now about having too
much bias because I know how many people

6574
02:40:01,030 --> 02:40:01,040
much bias because I know how many people
 

6575
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,510
much bias because I know how many people
are short calling for the collapse of

6576
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:03,520
are short calling for the collapse of
 

6577
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:05,910
are short calling for the collapse of
this whole thing. Oh, it's the end of

6578
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:05,920
this whole thing. Oh, it's the end of
 

6579
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:09,110
this whole thing. Oh, it's the end of
the market. It's the AI bubble. All it's

6580
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:09,120
the market. It's the AI bubble. All it's
 

6581
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:10,950
the market. It's the AI bubble. All it's
done or like I had the same argument

6582
02:40:10,950 --> 02:40:10,960
done or like I had the same argument
 

6583
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:12,950
done or like I had the same argument
with my dad yesterday, right? He's like,

6584
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:12,960
with my dad yesterday, right? He's like,
 

6585
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:15,190
with my dad yesterday, right? He's like,
it's this is going to nothing. All I

6586
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:15,200
it's this is going to nothing. All I
 

6587
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:18,389
it's this is going to nothing. All I
know is we swept that liquidity. That

6588
02:40:18,389 --> 02:40:18,399
know is we swept that liquidity. That
 

6589
02:40:18,399 --> 02:40:20,389
know is we swept that liquidity. That
was a big kill candle on volume and the

6590
02:40:20,389 --> 02:40:20,399
was a big kill candle on volume and the
 

6591
02:40:20,399 --> 02:40:22,150
was a big kill candle on volume and the
next day we came back with a big buy

6592
02:40:22,150 --> 02:40:22,160
next day we came back with a big buy
 

6593
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:24,150
next day we came back with a big buy
candle and since then we've drifted

6594
02:40:24,150 --> 02:40:24,160
candle and since then we've drifted
 

6595
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:26,309
candle and since then we've drifted
higher. There have been bears have had

6596
02:40:26,309 --> 02:40:26,319
higher. There have been bears have had
 

6597
02:40:26,319 --> 02:40:27,830
higher. There have been bears have had
the opportunity. They could have come in

6598
02:40:27,830 --> 02:40:27,840
the opportunity. They could have come in
 

6599
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:29,190
the opportunity. They could have come in
in the holiday week. They could have

6600
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:29,200
in the holiday week. They could have
 

6601
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:30,469
in the holiday week. They could have
come in on Monday and Tuesday. They've

6602
02:40:30,469 --> 02:40:30,479
come in on Monday and Tuesday. They've
 

6603
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:32,790
come in on Monday and Tuesday. They've
had plenty of opportunity to come in and

6604
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:32,800
had plenty of opportunity to come in and
 

6605
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:35,429
had plenty of opportunity to come in and
slap this back down. All I know is we

6606
02:40:35,429 --> 02:40:35,439
slap this back down. All I know is we
 

6607
02:40:35,439 --> 02:40:38,630
slap this back down. All I know is we
swept liquidity and we've traded higher.

6608
02:40:38,630 --> 02:40:38,640
swept liquidity and we've traded higher.
 

6609
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:40,389
swept liquidity and we've traded higher.
We're through that right shoulder line.

6610
02:40:40,389 --> 02:40:40,399
We're through that right shoulder line.
 

6611
02:40:40,399 --> 02:40:42,389
We're through that right shoulder line.
If they build out liquidity here for

6612
02:40:42,389 --> 02:40:42,399
If they build out liquidity here for
 

6613
02:40:42,399 --> 02:40:44,150
If they build out liquidity here for
long enough, those bears are going to

6614
02:40:44,150 --> 02:40:44,160
long enough, those bears are going to
 

6615
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:47,190
long enough, those bears are going to
get themselves caught in big, big, big

6616
02:40:47,190 --> 02:40:47,200
get themselves caught in big, big, big
 

6617
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:48,950
get themselves caught in big, big, big
trouble. Would I like it to come down

6618
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:48,960
trouble. Would I like it to come down
 

6619
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:50,630
trouble. Would I like it to come down
here? I absolutely would love it to come

6620
02:40:50,630 --> 02:40:50,640
here? I absolutely would love it to come
 

6621
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:52,630
here? I absolutely would love it to come
down here because then I think we can

6622
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:52,640
down here because then I think we can
 

6623
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:55,110
down here because then I think we can
make a better decision, higher time

6624
02:40:55,110 --> 02:40:55,120
make a better decision, higher time
 

6625
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:57,590
make a better decision, higher time
frame about what we want to do. But all

6626
02:40:57,590 --> 02:40:57,600
frame about what we want to do. But all
 

6627
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:59,270
frame about what we want to do. But all
I can do is what's in front of me. We're

6628
02:40:59,270 --> 02:40:59,280
I can do is what's in front of me. We're
 

6629
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:01,349
I can do is what's in front of me. We're
not doing that. And beyond that, if we

6630
02:41:01,349 --> 02:41:01,359
not doing that. And beyond that, if we
 

6631
02:41:01,359 --> 02:41:03,429
not doing that. And beyond that, if we
look at the spiders,

6632
02:41:03,429 --> 02:41:03,439
look at the spiders,
 

6633
02:41:03,439 --> 02:41:04,710
look at the spiders,
don't look like a head and shoulder to

6634
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:04,720
don't look like a head and shoulder to
 

6635
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:08,230
don't look like a head and shoulder to
me on the spiders, right?

6636
02:41:08,230 --> 02:41:08,240
me on the spiders, right?
 

6637
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:10,710
me on the spiders, right?
Same story. If it holds this, this is a

6638
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:10,720
Same story. If it holds this, this is a
 

6639
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:13,590
Same story. If it holds this, this is a
bullish rotation back to highs. And

6640
02:41:13,590 --> 02:41:13,600
bullish rotation back to highs. And
 

6641
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:16,309
bullish rotation back to highs. And
markets can stay rational. And this is

6642
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:16,319
markets can stay rational. And this is
 

6643
02:41:16,319 --> 02:41:19,349
markets can stay rational. And this is
building out a huge range. Now, if you

6644
02:41:19,349 --> 02:41:19,359
building out a huge range. Now, if you
 

6645
02:41:19,359 --> 02:41:20,630
building out a huge range. Now, if you
think about what we've actually done

6646
02:41:20,630 --> 02:41:20,640
think about what we've actually done
 

6647
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:23,750
think about what we've actually done
since September, this is just a giant

6648
02:41:23,750 --> 02:41:23,760
since September, this is just a giant
 

6649
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:26,469
since September, this is just a giant
range. Okay, tops do take a long time to

6650
02:41:26,469 --> 02:41:26,479
range. Okay, tops do take a long time to
 

6651
02:41:26,479 --> 02:41:29,910
range. Okay, tops do take a long time to
form. If this is going to be a top, all

6652
02:41:29,910 --> 02:41:29,920
form. If this is going to be a top, all
 

6653
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:32,389
form. If this is going to be a top, all
right, you don't need to pick it up here

6654
02:41:32,389 --> 02:41:32,399
right, you don't need to pick it up here
 

6655
02:41:32,399 --> 02:41:35,030
right, you don't need to pick it up here
because once we break this liquidity, it

6656
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:35,040
because once we break this liquidity, it
 

6657
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:36,630
because once we break this liquidity, it
will offer that trade back down to the

6658
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:36,640
will offer that trade back down to the
 

6659
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:38,469
will offer that trade back down to the
200.

6660
02:41:38,469 --> 02:41:38,479
200.
 

6661
02:41:38,479 --> 02:41:40,950
200.
We don't need to be trying to force away

6662
02:41:40,950 --> 02:41:40,960
We don't need to be trying to force away
 

6663
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:43,190
We don't need to be trying to force away
being like this is going back down to

6664
02:41:43,190 --> 02:41:43,200
being like this is going back down to
 

6665
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:45,670
being like this is going back down to
here. There is nothing in this right now

6666
02:41:45,670 --> 02:41:45,680
here. There is nothing in this right now
 

6667
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:47,190
here. There is nothing in this right now
to suggest it's doing that. I'm just

6668
02:41:47,190 --> 02:41:47,200
to suggest it's doing that. I'm just
 

6669
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:48,870
to suggest it's doing that. I'm just
being honest. I'm a bear at heart, but

6670
02:41:48,870 --> 02:41:48,880
being honest. I'm a bear at heart, but
 

6671
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:51,510
being honest. I'm a bear at heart, but
there is absolutely nothing in this

6672
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:51,520
there is absolutely nothing in this
 

6673
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:53,190
there is absolutely nothing in this
market suggesting that's what it's going

6674
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:53,200
market suggesting that's what it's going
 

6675
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:55,190
market suggesting that's what it's going
to do. And we have to be observant of

6676
02:41:55,190 --> 02:41:55,200
to do. And we have to be observant of
 

6677
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:58,550
to do. And we have to be observant of
that. Now,

6678
02:41:58,550 --> 02:41:58,560
that. Now,
 

6679
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:00,550
that. Now,
can the Japanese bonds cause a liquidity

6680
02:42:00,550 --> 02:42:00,560
can the Japanese bonds cause a liquidity
 

6681
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:02,790
can the Japanese bonds cause a liquidity
problem? Yes. Have we probably already

6682
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:02,800
problem? Yes. Have we probably already
 

6683
02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:05,030
problem? Yes. Have we probably already
priced in a rate cut? Yes. Is it

6684
02:42:05,030 --> 02:42:05,040
priced in a rate cut? Yes. Is it
 

6685
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:07,510
priced in a rate cut? Yes. Is it
possible we have a freak event and find

6686
02:42:07,510 --> 02:42:07,520
possible we have a freak event and find
 

6687
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:10,630
possible we have a freak event and find
weakness? Yes. But we don't trade

6688
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:10,640
weakness? Yes. But we don't trade
 

6689
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:12,309
weakness? Yes. But we don't trade
possibilities. We trade what's in front

6690
02:42:12,309 --> 02:42:12,319
possibilities. We trade what's in front
 

6691
02:42:12,319 --> 02:42:21,990
possibilities. We trade what's in front
of us.

6692
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:22,000

 

6693
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:23,110

So, you go, there's your second

6694
02:42:23,110 --> 02:42:23,120
So, you go, there's your second
 

6695
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:24,870
So, you go, there's your second
rotation. So there's the flush to the

6696
02:42:24,870 --> 02:42:24,880
rotation. So there's the flush to the
 

6697
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:26,630
rotation. So there's the flush to the
blue box that we talked about. There's

6698
02:42:26,630 --> 02:42:26,640
blue box that we talked about. There's
 

6699
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:28,630
blue box that we talked about. There's
the failure of the gray box. There's the

6700
02:42:28,630 --> 02:42:28,640
the failure of the gray box. There's the
 

6701
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:30,790
the failure of the gray box. There's the
flush through the gray blue box down to

6702
02:42:30,790 --> 02:42:30,800
flush through the gray blue box down to
 

6703
02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:32,550
flush through the gray blue box down to
the next gray box. And your rotation is

6704
02:42:32,550 --> 02:42:32,560
the next gray box. And your rotation is
 

6705
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:34,389
the next gray box. And your rotation is
between here now. And if they start to

6706
02:42:34,389 --> 02:42:34,399
between here now. And if they start to
 

6707
02:42:34,399 --> 02:42:37,030
between here now. And if they start to
let go of this, you have this is your

6708
02:42:37,030 --> 02:42:37,040
let go of this, you have this is your
 

6709
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:38,630
let go of this, you have this is your
target down here. And if they let go of

6710
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:38,640
target down here. And if they let go of
 

6711
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:39,910
target down here. And if they let go of
this, I think you have unfinished

6712
02:42:39,910 --> 02:42:39,920
this, I think you have unfinished
 

6713
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:41,830
this, I think you have unfinished
business down here. But it all depends

6714
02:42:41,830 --> 02:42:41,840
business down here. But it all depends
 

6715
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:43,349
business down here. But it all depends
if and what they want to do because

6716
02:42:43,349 --> 02:42:43,359
if and what they want to do because
 

6717
02:42:43,359 --> 02:42:45,030
if and what they want to do because
we're in a rotational market. We are

6718
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,040
we're in a rotational market. We are
 

6719
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:46,710
we're in a rotational market. We are
still trading inside of yesterday's

6720
02:42:46,710 --> 02:42:46,720
still trading inside of yesterday's
 

6721
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:49,270
still trading inside of yesterday's
value. Until we let go of that and see a

6722
02:42:49,270 --> 02:42:49,280
value. Until we let go of that and see a
 

6723
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:50,950
value. Until we let go of that and see a
sustained auction lower into these

6724
02:42:50,950 --> 02:42:50,960
sustained auction lower into these
 

6725
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:53,750
sustained auction lower into these
levels, I'd be cautious.

6726
02:42:53,750 --> 02:42:53,760
levels, I'd be cautious.
 

6727
02:42:53,760 --> 02:43:01,830
levels, I'd be cautious.
be cautious.

6728
02:43:01,830 --> 02:43:01,840

 

6729
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:03,910

So, if it drops to bottom of gray box,

6730
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:03,920
So, if it drops to bottom of gray box,
 

6731
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:09,429
So, if it drops to bottom of gray box,
would you consider a long uh on the spy?

6732
02:43:09,429 --> 02:43:09,439

 

6733
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:11,190

Yeah, I mean, you'd have to technically

6734
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:11,200
Yeah, I mean, you'd have to technically
 

6735
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:15,110
Yeah, I mean, you'd have to technically
all the time it's holding it, but uh

6736
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,120
all the time it's holding it, but uh
 

6737
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:17,590
all the time it's holding it, but uh
you know that like you're looking at

6738
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:17,600
you know that like you're looking at
 

6739
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:20,150
you know that like you're looking at
it's basically the 680s, right? The

6740
02:43:20,150 --> 02:43:20,160
it's basically the 680s, right? The
 

6741
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:22,309
it's basically the 680s, right? The
gamma level. If we start getting closes

6742
02:43:22,309 --> 02:43:22,319
gamma level. If we start getting closes
 

6743
02:43:22,319 --> 02:43:24,389
gamma level. If we start getting closes
underneath that gamma level and we start

6744
02:43:24,389 --> 02:43:24,399
underneath that gamma level and we start
 

6745
02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:26,469
underneath that gamma level and we start
rejecting that gamma level, then I think

6746
02:43:26,469 --> 02:43:26,479
rejecting that gamma level, then I think
 

6747
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:28,550
rejecting that gamma level, then I think
you know the market might find some

6748
02:43:28,550 --> 02:43:28,560
you know the market might find some
 

6749
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:29,990
you know the market might find some
problems and then you're going to see a

6750
02:43:29,990 --> 02:43:30,000
problems and then you're going to see a
 

6751
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:35,910
problems and then you're going to see a
rotation to 78, 75 and maybe even 70 and

6752
02:43:35,910 --> 02:43:35,920
rotation to 78, 75 and maybe even 70 and
 

6753
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:37,429
rotation to 78, 75 and maybe even 70 and
then we get a deeper pullback in the

6754
02:43:37,429 --> 02:43:37,439
then we get a deeper pullback in the
 

6755
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:41,590
then we get a deeper pullback in the
market. But yeah, I mean

6756
02:43:41,590 --> 02:43:41,600

 

6757
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:43,510

how many times we going to test 680? I

6758
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:43,520
how many times we going to test 680? I
 

6759
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:48,150
how many times we going to test 680? I
don't know.

6760
02:43:48,150 --> 02:43:48,160

Lovely. So, you took you went from you

Lovely. So, you took you went from you

Lovely. So, you took you went from you
took that. Really nice. Great trade

6768
02:43:59,110 --> 02:43:59,120

02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:01,990

Expect it to try and test here.
Otherwise, if they build out here and

02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:07,680
Otherwise, if they build out here and
 

6777
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:09,349
Otherwise, if they build out here and
you find weakness, New York open and

you find weakness, New York open and

you find weakness, New York open and

6784
02:44:29,269 --> 02:44:29,279

 

6785
02:44:29,279 --> 02:44:35,190

couple minutes left for lunch now.

6786
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:35,200

 

6787
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:36,550

So, nothing's really changed, right?

6788
02:44:36,550 --> 02:44:36,560
So, nothing's really changed, right?
 

6789
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:39,030
So, nothing's really changed, right?
Zoom out. Nothing's really changed. Just

6790
02:44:39,030 --> 02:44:39,040
Zoom out. Nothing's really changed. Just
 

6791
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:40,309
Zoom out. Nothing's really changed. Just
a bit of a dunk like we talked about.

6792
02:44:40,309 --> 02:44:40,319
a bit of a dunk like we talked about.
 

6793
02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:42,070
a bit of a dunk like we talked about.
Grind up, grind up, grind up, dunk.

6794
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:42,080
Grind up, grind up, grind up, dunk.
 

6795
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:45,030
Grind up, grind up, grind up, dunk.
Probably grind up. That test of 75ish is

6796
02:44:45,030 --> 02:44:45,040
Probably grind up. That test of 75ish is
 

6797
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:46,469
Probably grind up. That test of 75ish is
going to be key. Now, do they sell that

6798
02:44:46,469 --> 02:44:46,479
going to be key. Now, do they sell that
 

6799
02:44:46,479 --> 02:44:48,550
going to be key. Now, do they sell that
or not? That's what I would have in my

6800
02:44:48,550 --> 02:44:48,560
or not? That's what I would have in my
 

6801
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:50,710
or not? That's what I would have in my
mind. Do they sell

6802
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:50,720
mind. Do they sell
 

6803
02:44:50,720 --> 02:44:52,950
mind. Do they sell
that blue box above you where the red

6804
02:44:52,950 --> 02:44:52,960
that blue box above you where the red
 

6805
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:54,469
that blue box above you where the red
line is the point of control on the

6806
02:44:54,469 --> 02:44:54,479
line is the point of control on the
 

6807
02:44:54,479 --> 02:44:56,230
line is the point of control on the
session? Do they sell this or not? If

6808
02:44:56,230 --> 02:44:56,240
session? Do they sell this or not? If
 

6809
02:44:56,240 --> 02:44:57,670
session? Do they sell this or not? If
they recover this, then guess what?

6810
02:44:57,670 --> 02:44:57,680
they recover this, then guess what?
 

6811
02:44:57,680 --> 02:44:59,030
they recover this, then guess what?
We're going to go back for rotation

6812
02:44:59,030 --> 02:44:59,040
We're going to go back for rotation
 

6813
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:00,950
We're going to go back for rotation
again. This is just washing backwards

6814
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:00,960
again. This is just washing backwards
 

6815
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:04,790
again. This is just washing backwards
and forwards. These are uh if you like

6816
02:45:04,790 --> 02:45:04,800
and forwards. These are uh if you like
 

6817
02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:06,630
and forwards. These are uh if you like
trading trend or continuation, these are

6818
02:45:06,630 --> 02:45:06,640
trading trend or continuation, these are
 

6819
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:08,630
trading trend or continuation, these are
not your markets. All right? If you like

6820
02:45:08,630 --> 02:45:08,640
not your markets. All right? If you like
 

6821
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:10,309
not your markets. All right? If you like
trading trend or continuation, these are

6822
02:45:10,309 --> 02:45:10,319
trading trend or continuation, these are
 

6823
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:11,590
trading trend or continuation, these are
not your markets. You just need to

6824
02:45:11,590 --> 02:45:11,600
not your markets. You just need to
 

6825
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:13,429
not your markets. You just need to
understand that and respect it. Just

6826
02:45:13,429 --> 02:45:13,439
understand that and respect it. Just
 

6827
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:15,510
understand that and respect it. Just
don't try and force a trade in a market

6828
02:45:15,510 --> 02:45:15,520
don't try and force a trade in a market
 

6829
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:17,429
don't try and force a trade in a market
which is not there to be traded if

6830
02:45:17,429 --> 02:45:17,439
which is not there to be traded if
 

6831
02:45:17,439 --> 02:45:18,790
which is not there to be traded if
that's what you're looking for. If you

6832
02:45:18,790 --> 02:45:18,800
that's what you're looking for. If you
 

6833
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:21,670
that's what you're looking for. If you
are looking for continuation, this ain't

6834
02:45:21,670 --> 02:45:21,680
are looking for continuation, this ain't
 

6835
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:32,524
are looking for continuation, this ain't
it.

6836
02:45:32,524 --> 02:45:32,534

 

6837
02:45:32,534 --> 02:45:50,710

[snorts]

6838
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:50,720

 

6839
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:52,230

coming in to fill some of these

6840
02:45:52,230 --> 02:45:52,240
coming in to fill some of these
 

6841
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:58,870
coming in to fill some of these
imbalances. Now,

6842
02:45:58,870 --> 02:45:58,880

 

6843
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:01,670

Spy just found a bid on PDC and VWAP, by

6844
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:01,680
Spy just found a bid on PDC and VWAP, by
 

6845
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:03,590
Spy just found a bid on PDC and VWAP, by
the way. So, it's got an imbalance all

6846
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:03,600
the way. So, it's got an imbalance all
 

6847
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:09,510
the way. So, it's got an imbalance all
the way up to sort of 83 now on spy.

6848
02:46:09,510 --> 02:46:09,520

 

6849
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:11,110

Does it make sense how we go level to

6850
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:11,120
Does it make sense how we go level to
 

6851
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:13,030
Does it make sense how we go level to
level, level to level? Are you able to

6852
02:46:13,030 --> 02:46:13,040
level, level to level? Are you able to
 

6853
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:14,230
level, level to level? Are you able to
identify that? That's what really

6854
02:46:14,230 --> 02:46:14,240
identify that? That's what really
 

6855
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:15,990
identify that? That's what really
matters

6856
02:46:15,990 --> 02:46:16,000
matters
 

6857
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,429
matters
because that's the market we're in. And

6858
02:46:17,429 --> 02:46:17,439
because that's the market we're in. And
 

6859
02:46:17,439 --> 02:46:19,510
because that's the market we're in. And
until that changes, that's that's what

6860
02:46:19,510 --> 02:46:19,520
until that changes, that's that's what
 

6861
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:35,670
until that changes, that's that's what
you've got to get used to.

6862
02:46:35,670 --> 02:46:35,680

 

6863
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:38,550

So they're trying to uh defend this blue

6864
02:46:38,550 --> 02:46:38,560
So they're trying to uh defend this blue
 

6865
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:41,110
So they're trying to uh defend this blue
box here. Now that I say they're trying

6866
02:46:41,110 --> 02:46:41,120
box here. Now that I say they're trying
 

6867
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:42,630
box here. Now that I say they're trying
to defend it, that will be their

6868
02:46:42,630 --> 02:46:42,640
to defend it, that will be their
 

6869
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:44,790
to defend it, that will be their
ambitions. Bears will be to defend this

6870
02:46:44,790 --> 02:46:44,800
ambitions. Bears will be to defend this
 

6871
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:46,469
ambitions. Bears will be to defend this
blue box. All right. Somewhere around

6872
02:46:46,469 --> 02:46:46,479
blue box. All right. Somewhere around
 

6873
02:46:46,479 --> 02:46:47,990
blue box. All right. Somewhere around
here. they fail to defend this, then

6874
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:48,000
here. they fail to defend this, then
 

6875
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,429
here. they fail to defend this, then
we're going to go right back up to the

6876
02:46:49,429 --> 02:46:49,439
we're going to go right back up to the
 

6877
02:46:49,439 --> 02:46:51,750
we're going to go right back up to the
600s. If we go through that, you could

6878
02:46:51,750 --> 02:46:51,760
600s. If we go through that, you could
 

6879
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:54,710
600s. If we go through that, you could
see a new high day. It's very, very

6880
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:54,720
see a new high day. It's very, very
 

6881
02:46:54,720 --> 02:46:59,670
see a new high day. It's very, very
possible.

6882
02:46:59,670 --> 02:46:59,680

 

6883
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:01,830

Uh I all I do is I look at the options

6884
02:47:01,830 --> 02:47:01,840
Uh I all I do is I look at the options
 

6885
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:04,150
Uh I all I do is I look at the options
data the day before the before the open

6886
02:47:04,150 --> 02:47:04,160
data the day before the before the open
 

6887
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:05,750
data the day before the before the open
and I just look at like the most heavily

6888
02:47:05,750 --> 02:47:05,760
and I just look at like the most heavily
 

6889
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:07,750
and I just look at like the most heavily
traded level. Where are where's the call

6890
02:47:07,750 --> 02:47:07,760
traded level. Where are where's the call
 

6891
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:10,230
traded level. Where are where's the call
wall? Where's the put? All I know is the

6892
02:47:10,230 --> 02:47:10,240
wall? Where's the put? All I know is the
 

6893
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:12,710
wall? Where's the put? All I know is the
most traded thing in the market is the

6894
02:47:12,710 --> 02:47:12,720
most traded thing in the market is the
 

6895
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:14,950
most traded thing in the market is the
spy, right? So, what I care about is

6896
02:47:14,950 --> 02:47:14,960
spy, right? So, what I care about is
 

6897
02:47:14,960 --> 02:47:16,870
spy, right? So, what I care about is
that spy level, that 680 level. That

6898
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:16,880
that spy level, that 680 level. That
 

6899
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:19,910
that spy level, that 680 level. That
that's just basically my guide at the

6900
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:19,920
that's just basically my guide at the
 

6901
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:22,309
that's just basically my guide at the
moment, right? The spy is basically my

6902
02:47:22,309 --> 02:47:22,319
moment, right? The spy is basically my
 

6903
02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:25,269
moment, right? The spy is basically my
guide for whatever might happen next in

6904
02:47:25,269 --> 02:47:25,279
guide for whatever might happen next in
 

6905
02:47:25,279 --> 02:47:28,230
guide for whatever might happen next in
the market.

6906
02:47:28,230 --> 02:47:28,240
the market.
 

6907
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:29,910
the market.
All you want to do is look for the

6908
02:47:29,910 --> 02:47:29,920
All you want to do is look for the
 

6909
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:32,950
All you want to do is look for the
biggest chunkiest levels. All right? And

6910
02:47:32,950 --> 02:47:32,960
biggest chunkiest levels. All right? And
 

6911
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:34,870
biggest chunkiest levels. All right? And
look at how we've reacted there for

6912
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:34,880
look at how we've reacted there for
 

6913
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:37,110
look at how we've reacted there for
quite a few times. Look at 680 on the

6914
02:47:37,110 --> 02:47:37,120
quite a few times. Look at 680 on the
 

6915
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:40,389
quite a few times. Look at 680 on the
spy. They do not want to let it close

6916
02:47:40,389 --> 02:47:40,399
spy. They do not want to let it close
 

6917
02:47:40,399 --> 02:47:43,830
spy. They do not want to let it close
under that level.

6918
02:47:43,830 --> 02:47:43,840
under that level.
 

6919
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:45,190
under that level.
We talked about that same level

6920
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:45,200
We talked about that same level
 

6921
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:48,070
We talked about that same level
yesterday, blue box.

6922
02:47:48,070 --> 02:47:48,080
yesterday, blue box.
 

6923
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:51,269
yesterday, blue box.
They do not want it under this level. It

6924
02:47:51,269 --> 02:47:51,279
They do not want it under this level. It
 

6925
02:47:51,279 --> 02:47:55,590
They do not want it under this level. It
is clear as day. Look, every single time

6926
02:47:55,590 --> 02:47:55,600
is clear as day. Look, every single time
 

6927
02:47:55,600 --> 02:47:58,230
is clear as day. Look, every single time
once we got over it, that was it. So

6928
02:47:58,230 --> 02:47:58,240
once we got over it, that was it. So
 

6929
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:00,950
once we got over it, that was it. So
from the 26th of November, they have not

6930
02:48:00,950 --> 02:48:00,960
from the 26th of November, they have not
 

6931
02:48:00,960 --> 02:48:04,070
from the 26th of November, they have not
wanted the spy underneath this level.

6932
02:48:04,070 --> 02:48:04,080
wanted the spy underneath this level.
 

6933
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:06,790
wanted the spy underneath this level.
They've saved it every time.

6934
02:48:06,790 --> 02:48:06,800
They've saved it every time.
 

6935
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:10,870
They've saved it every time.
Right? So that is your telling you

6936
02:48:10,870 --> 02:48:10,880
Right? So that is your telling you
 

6937
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:12,630
Right? So that is your telling you
funds don't want it under here. If we

6938
02:48:12,630 --> 02:48:12,640
funds don't want it under here. If we
 

6939
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:14,870
funds don't want it under here. If we
trade under and reject it, sure we can

6940
02:48:14,870 --> 02:48:14,880
trade under and reject it, sure we can
 

6941
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:16,550
trade under and reject it, sure we can
see downside like I said to 70. It's

6942
02:48:16,550 --> 02:48:16,560
see downside like I said to 70. It's
 

6943
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:18,070
see downside like I said to 70. It's
probably a 10point move in that. But

6944
02:48:18,070 --> 02:48:18,080
probably a 10point move in that. But
 

6945
02:48:18,080 --> 02:48:19,269
probably a 10point move in that. But
that's not what we're seeing. So all

6946
02:48:19,269 --> 02:48:19,279
that's not what we're seeing. So all
 

6947
02:48:19,279 --> 02:48:21,910
that's not what we're seeing. So all
we've got to do is respect what we're

6948
02:48:21,910 --> 02:48:21,920
we've got to do is respect what we're
 

6949
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:32,230
we've got to do is respect what we're
actually seeing.

6950
02:48:32,230 --> 02:48:32,240

 

6951
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:34,150

So back towards the gray box now.

6952
02:48:34,150 --> 02:48:34,160
So back towards the gray box now.
 

6953
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:37,990
So back towards the gray box now.
Previous day point of control.

6954
02:48:37,990 --> 02:48:38,000
Previous day point of control.
 

6955
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:41,269
Previous day point of control.
drifting all the way back up, isn't it?

6956
02:48:41,269 --> 02:48:41,279
drifting all the way back up, isn't it?
 

6957
02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:43,269
drifting all the way back up, isn't it?
And if they don't meet this with some

6958
02:48:43,269 --> 02:48:43,279
And if they don't meet this with some
 

6959
02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:45,190
And if they don't meet this with some
heavy volume, then we probably reclaim

6960
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:45,200
heavy volume, then we probably reclaim
 

6961
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:47,750
heavy volume, then we probably reclaim
it all. So sellers need to come in

6962
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:47,760
it all. So sellers need to come in
 

6963
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:49,030
it all. So sellers need to come in
around this level that we're at now.

6964
02:48:49,030 --> 02:48:49,040
around this level that we're at now.
 

6965
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:50,550
around this level that we're at now.
It's current point of control on the

6966
02:48:50,550 --> 02:48:50,560
It's current point of control on the
 

6967
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:52,630
It's current point of control on the
day, I think. Yes, it is. Which is means

6968
02:48:52,630 --> 02:48:52,640
day, I think. Yes, it is. Which is means
 

6969
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:55,269
day, I think. Yes, it is. Which is means
it's the most traded level of the day

6970
02:48:55,269 --> 02:48:55,279
it's the most traded level of the day
 

6971
02:48:55,279 --> 02:49:00,070
it's the most traded level of the day
where we are now into lunch.

6972
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:00,080

 

6973
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:01,910

Yeah, exactly. Same same for me, Rosco.

6974
02:49:01,910 --> 02:49:01,920
Yeah, exactly. Same same for me, Rosco.
 

6975
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:03,429
Yeah, exactly. Same same for me, Rosco.
I'm going to try and drag myself to the

6976
02:49:03,429 --> 02:49:03,439
I'm going to try and drag myself to the
 

6977
02:49:03,439 --> 02:49:05,429
I'm going to try and drag myself to the
gym. Really struggled postco. have lost

6978
02:49:05,429 --> 02:49:05,439
gym. Really struggled postco. have lost
 

6979

gym. Really struggled postco. have lost
so much weight. Gross gross amount of

02:49:08,309 --> 02:49:08,319
so much weight. Gross gross amount of
 

6981
02:49:08,319 --> 02:49:11,269
so much weight. Gross gross amount of
weight lost lost. Losted.

6982
02:49:11,269 --> 02:49:11,279
weight lost lost. Losted.
 

6983
02:49:11,279 --> 02:49:13,830
weight lost lost. Losted.
Um all right, folks. That's it. I will

02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:13,840
Um all right, folks. That's it. I will
 

6985
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:15,670
Um all right, folks. That's it. I will
set some price alerts, but until we move

6986
02:49:15,670 --> 02:49:15,680
set some price alerts, but until we move
 

6987
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:18,070
set some price alerts, but until we move
outside of value from yesterday, I'm not

6988
02:49:18,070 --> 02:49:18,080
outside of value from yesterday, I'm not
 

6989
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:19,429
outside of value from yesterday, I'm not
really interested in touching this. I've

6990
02:49:19,429 --> 02:49:19,439
really interested in touching this. I've
 

6991
02:49:19,439 --> 02:49:23,030
really interested in touching this. I've
made that abundantly clear um pre-market

6992
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:23,040
made that abundantly clear um pre-market
 

6993

02:49:24,790 --> 02:49:24,800
and during the session. This is not
 

6995
02:49:24,800 --> 02:49:26,550
and during the session. This is not
something I want to touch. Not when

6996
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:26,560
something I want to touch. Not when
 

6997
02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:27,990
something I want to touch. Not when
we're doing these kind of things. You

6998
02:49:27,990 --> 02:49:28,000
we're doing these kind of things. You
 

6999

we're doing these kind of things. You
can see it here. It's just you're
