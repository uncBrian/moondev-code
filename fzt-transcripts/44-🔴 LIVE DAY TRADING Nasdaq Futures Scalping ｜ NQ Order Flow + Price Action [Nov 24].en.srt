Morning everyone.

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080

 

3
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,350

Morning. Morning. Morning. As you can

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
Morning. Morning. Morning. As you can

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,430
Morning. Morning. Morning. As you can
probably hear, still not uh nowhere near

6
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
probably hear, still not uh nowhere near
 

7
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,749
probably hear, still not uh nowhere near
fully better. Actually felt possibly the

8
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
fully better. Actually felt possibly the
 

9
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,110
fully better. Actually felt possibly the
worst I've felt today, which is

10
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
worst I've felt today, which is
 

11
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,870
worst I've felt today, which is
surprising. So, I probably pushed it a

12
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
surprising. So, I probably pushed it a
 

13
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,670
surprising. So, I probably pushed it a
little bit too hard yesterday, but so be

14
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
little bit too hard yesterday, but so be
 

15
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,070
little bit too hard yesterday, but so be
it. We are where we are. So, I'll do my

16
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
it. We are where we are. So, I'll do my
 

17
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,990
it. We are where we are. So, I'll do my
best to stay with you for at least an

18
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
best to stay with you for at least an
 

19
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,029
best to stay with you for at least an
hour or two today. We'll see how we go.

20
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
hour or two today. We'll see how we go.
 

21
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,909
hour or two today. We'll see how we go.
But hopefully you had a good weekend.

22
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
But hopefully you had a good weekend.
 

23
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,990
But hopefully you had a good weekend.
Okay, starting off on the daily chart

24
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay, starting off on the daily chart
 

25
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,469
Okay, starting off on the daily chart
then and we're opening up with a bit of

26
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
then and we're opening up with a bit of
 

27
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,550
then and we're opening up with a bit of
a gap up here.

28
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
a gap up here.
 

29
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,790
a gap up here.
Last week, we can have a look at last

30
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
Last week, we can have a look at last
 

31
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,909
Last week, we can have a look at last
week's levels

32
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
week's levels
 

33
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,670
week's levels
of

34
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
of
 

35
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,350
of
Monday's high into Friday low. We're

36
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
Monday's high into Friday low. We're
 

37
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,110
Monday's high into Friday low. We're
coming to back test 50% of it. All

38
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
coming to back test 50% of it. All
 

39
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,469
coming to back test 50% of it. All
right, that 50% level is basically 640.

40
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
right, that 50% level is basically 640.
 

41
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,390
right, that 50% level is basically 640.
All right. So, we're right in the middle

42
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
All right. So, we're right in the middle
 

43
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,870
All right. So, we're right in the middle
of the previous week range right now.

44
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
of the previous week range right now.
 

45
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,350
of the previous week range right now.
Might seem uh like we're fading hard,

46
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
Might seem uh like we're fading hard,
 

47
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,110
Might seem uh like we're fading hard,
but we're actually just stuck inside a

48
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
but we're actually just stuck inside a
 

49
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,710
but we're actually just stuck inside a
box. We're bearish overall, but we're

50
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
box. We're bearish overall, but we're
 

51
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,430
box. We're bearish overall, but we're
stuck inside last week's box at the 50%

52
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
stuck inside last week's box at the 50%
 

53
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,270
stuck inside last week's box at the 50%
mark. So, I'm interested how we react

54
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
mark. So, I'm interested how we react
 

55
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,350
mark. So, I'm interested how we react
there and also into the volume that

56
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
there and also into the volume that
 

57
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,150
there and also into the volume that
we've created here uh over a number of

58
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
we've created here uh over a number of
 

59
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,629
we've created here uh over a number of
weeks now. So, 50% 6 uh what's this? 640

60
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
weeks now. So, 50% 6 uh what's this? 640
 

61
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,550
weeks now. So, 50% 6 uh what's this? 640
and then into the 800s if we're going to

62
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
and then into the 800s if we're going to
 

63
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,029
and then into the 800s if we're going to
get into those fibs.

64
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
get into those fibs.
 

65
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,990
get into those fibs.
So aware of that. Structure- wise, we're

66
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
So aware of that. Structure- wise, we're
 

67
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,749
So aware of that. Structure- wise, we're
definitely making lower highs and lower

68
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
definitely making lower highs and lower
 

69
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,390
definitely making lower highs and lower
lows. All right, just a little bear trap

70
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
lows. All right, just a little bear trap
 

71
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,150
lows. All right, just a little bear trap
there and a slam down. So interested how

72
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
there and a slam down. So interested how
 

73
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,029
there and a slam down. So interested how
we act into this 640 to 800 level. Do we

74
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
we act into this 640 to 800 level. Do we
 

75
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,510
we act into this 640 to 800 level. Do we
reject that for a rollover or at least a

76
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
reject that for a rollover or at least a
 

77
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,830
reject that for a rollover or at least a
retest of that or are bulls going to

78
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
retest of that or are bulls going to
 

79
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,710
retest of that or are bulls going to
reclaim that shelf, this shelf here?

80
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720

 

81
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,629

All right. To see if they can build

82
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
All right. To see if they can build
 

83
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,230
All right. To see if they can build
something like this to come and clean

84
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
something like this to come and clean
 

85
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,909
something like this to come and clean
out some of these levels. And then we'll

86
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
out some of these levels. And then we'll
 

87
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,350
out some of these levels. And then we'll
have to see. remember buyers are still

88
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
have to see. remember buyers are still
 

89
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,110
have to see. remember buyers are still
very much trapped up there but that's

90
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
very much trapped up there but that's
 

91
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,469
very much trapped up there but that's
what we're watching right so sort of 640

92
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
what we're watching right so sort of 640
 

93
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,950
what we're watching right so sort of 640
into the 800s and if we really get going

94
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
into the 800s and if we really get going
 

95
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,589
into the 800s and if we really get going
we we can talk about those 2523s

96
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
we we can talk about those 2523s
 

97
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,190
we we can talk about those 2523s
if and when that happens

98
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
if and when that happens
 

99
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,070
if and when that happens
let's move you over to uh the hourly

100
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
let's move you over to uh the hourly
 

101
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,589
let's move you over to uh the hourly
here

102
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599

 

103
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,870

just focus on this chart here with me

104
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
just focus on this chart here with me
 

105
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,590
just focus on this chart here with me
for a moment

106
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
for a moment
 

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,350
for a moment
right previous week levels marked out

108
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
right previous week levels marked out
 

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,030
right previous week levels marked out
here if you want to take note of those

110
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
here if you want to take note of those
 

111
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,030
here if you want to take note of those
of you who haven't used volume profile

112
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
of you who haven't used volume profile
 

113
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,350
of you who haven't used volume profile
before. Those are your previous week

114
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
before. Those are your previous week
 

115
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,350
before. Those are your previous week
edges. Like we talked about, we're

116
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
edges. Like we talked about, we're
 

117
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,550
edges. Like we talked about, we're
coming into a very thick area up here

118
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
coming into a very thick area up here
 

119
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,070
coming into a very thick area up here
into the previous week point of control.

120
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
into the previous week point of control.
 

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,509
into the previous week point of control.
You can see this is where we built out

122
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
You can see this is where we built out
 

123
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,030
You can see this is where we built out
the most distribution, right? So we

124
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
the most distribution, right? So we
 

125
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,230
the most distribution, right? So we
distributed up here, huge distribution

126
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
distributed up here, huge distribution
 

127
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,550
distributed up here, huge distribution
here and then a little bit down here. A

128
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
here and then a little bit down here. A
 

129
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,990
here and then a little bit down here. A
bit more like accumulation to go and

130
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
bit more like accumulation to go and
 

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,389
bit more like accumulation to go and
back test. So this is starting to get

132
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
back test. So this is starting to get
 

133
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,070
back test. So this is starting to get
interesting how we act here. This is

134
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
interesting how we act here. This is
 

135
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,389
interesting how we act here. This is
this is your contested zone. All right.

136
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
this is your contested zone. All right.
 

137
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,870
this is your contested zone. All right.
sellers will want to remain having sell

138
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
sellers will want to remain having sell
 

139
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,790
sellers will want to remain having sell
pressure versus this zone, right? They

140
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
pressure versus this zone, right? They
 

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,670
pressure versus this zone, right? They
won't want bulls to reclaim these zones,

142
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
won't want bulls to reclaim these zones,
 

143
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,190
won't want bulls to reclaim these zones,
right? They just won't because that just

144
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
right? They just won't because that just
 

145
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,150
right? They just won't because that just
gives too much momentum back to bulls.

146
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
gives too much momentum back to bulls.
 

147
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,670
gives too much momentum back to bulls.
If you start reclaiming these pockets

148
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
If you start reclaiming these pockets
 

149
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,829
If you start reclaiming these pockets
here, bulls can start looking for these

150
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
here, bulls can start looking for these
 

151
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,590
here, bulls can start looking for these
drives higher to come and repric some of

152
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
drives higher to come and repric some of
 

153
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,750
drives higher to come and repric some of
the old imbalances.

154
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
the old imbalances.
 

155
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,269
the old imbalances.
So, we're watching these zones here. You

156
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
So, we're watching these zones here. You
 

157
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,150
So, we're watching these zones here. You
can see overnight all we've done gap up,

158
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
can see overnight all we've done gap up,
 

159
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,550
can see overnight all we've done gap up,
push, fail, double top, fill the gap

160
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
push, fail, double top, fill the gap
 

161
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,310
push, fail, double top, fill the gap
back to the same level. So we're trading

162
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
back to the same level. So we're trading
 

163
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,350
back to the same level. So we're trading
inside this edge right now. Basically

164
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
inside this edge right now. Basically
 

165
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,829
inside this edge right now. Basically
600 down to the bottom of that gap would

166
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:49,839
600 down to the bottom of that gap would
 

167
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,829
600 down to the bottom of that gap would
be 360 and the top of that gap is

168
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
be 360 and the top of that gap is
 

169
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,630
be 360 and the top of that gap is
basically 450s, right? Most of price has

170
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
basically 450s, right? Most of price has
 

171
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,310
basically 450s, right? Most of price has
held to 450 450 600 failed to the bottom

172
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
held to 450 450 600 failed to the bottom
 

173
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,670
held to 450 450 600 failed to the bottom
reclaim 450 600. There's your box. That

174
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
reclaim 450 600. There's your box. That
 

175
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,630
reclaim 450 600. There's your box. That
is your box. Um it's big box. All right.

176
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
is your box. Um it's big box. All right.
 

177
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,949
is your box. Um it's big box. All right.
Considering that was done in Globex, you

178
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
Considering that was done in Globex, you
 

179
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,070
Considering that was done in Globex, you
know, you're trading in

180
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,080
know, you're trading in
 

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,150
know, you're trading in
150 to 250 point ranges. It's not small.

182
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
150 to 250 point ranges. It's not small.
 

183
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,350
150 to 250 point ranges. It's not small.
All right. So, just you're gonna have to

184
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
All right. So, just you're gonna have to
 

185
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,550
All right. So, just you're gonna have to
watch your sizing. You would have seen

186
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
watch your sizing. You would have seen
 

187
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,949
watch your sizing. You would have seen
last week that uh

188
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
last week that uh
 

189
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,870
last week that uh
it was uh moving very fast, especially

190
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
it was uh moving very fast, especially
 

191
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,590
it was uh moving very fast, especially
on those days I wasn't here on Friday. I

192
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
on those days I wasn't here on Friday. I
 

193
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,069
on those days I wasn't here on Friday. I
was in insane volume traded on Friday

194
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
was in insane volume traded on Friday
 

195
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,710
was in insane volume traded on Friday
for OPEX. If you move up into the five

196
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
for OPEX. If you move up into the five
 

197
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,670
for OPEX. If you move up into the five
minute, you can see what we've done

198
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
minute, you can see what we've done
 

199
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,949
minute, you can see what we've done
overnight. All right, we're starting to

200
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
overnight. All right, we're starting to
 

201
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,550
overnight. All right, we're starting to
actually build out what's what's a bit

202
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
actually build out what's what's a bit
 

203
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,630
actually build out what's what's a bit
concerning is one of these. Right,

204
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
concerning is one of these. Right,
 

205
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,829
concerning is one of these. Right,
that's definitely what we're building

206
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
that's definitely what we're building
 

207
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,310
that's definitely what we're building
out at the moment, I would say. Um, so I

208
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
out at the moment, I would say. Um, so I
 

209
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,670
out at the moment, I would say. Um, so I
wouldn't be surprised to see a wash down

210
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
wouldn't be surprised to see a wash down
 

211
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,670
wouldn't be surprised to see a wash down
here and a price back up and a wash back

212
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
here and a price back up and a wash back
 

213
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,190
here and a price back up and a wash back
down and a price back up and that can

214
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
down and a price back up and that can
 

215
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,630
down and a price back up and that can
develop over a number of days. Remember,

216
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
develop over a number of days. Remember,
 

217
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,870
develop over a number of days. Remember,
we've got no news today. All the news is

218
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
we've got no news today. All the news is
 

219
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,470
we've got no news today. All the news is
coming Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday's

220
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
coming Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday's
 

221
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,710
coming Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday's
off. Some people might come back Friday.

222
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
off. Some people might come back Friday.
 

223
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,710
off. Some people might come back Friday.
Unlikely there's too much volume there.

224
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
Unlikely there's too much volume there.
 

225
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,790
Unlikely there's too much volume there.
All right, so the the big contested days

226
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
All right, so the the big contested days
 

227
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,230
All right, so the the big contested days
are going to be Tuesday, Wednesday this

228
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
are going to be Tuesday, Wednesday this
 

229
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,310
are going to be Tuesday, Wednesday this
week. Um, and they probably want to get

230
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
week. Um, and they probably want to get
 

231
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,990
week. Um, and they probably want to get
off their desks early on Wednesday. All

232
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
off their desks early on Wednesday. All
 

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,150
off their desks early on Wednesday. All
right, so just be aware of that. No news

234
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
right, so just be aware of that. No news
 

235
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,190
right, so just be aware of that. No news
Monday, not uh high probability setups,

236
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
Monday, not uh high probability setups,
 

237
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,350
Monday, not uh high probability setups,
but that is definitely possible that we

238
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
but that is definitely possible that we
 

239
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,430
but that is definitely possible that we
go into rotation while we build

240
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
go into rotation while we build
 

241
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,350
go into rotation while we build
liquidity with a higher time frame to

242
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
liquidity with a higher time frame to
 

243
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,790
liquidity with a higher time frame to
make its decision if we're going to sell

244
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
make its decision if we're going to sell
 

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,110
make its decision if we're going to sell
down or hold the volume to print back

246
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
down or hold the volume to print back
 

247
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,269
down or hold the volume to print back
up. So, be watching those rotation

248
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
up. So, be watching those rotation
 

249
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,350
up. So, be watching those rotation
levels.

250
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
levels.
 

251
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,750
levels.
Um, let's get into the right one. Here

252
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
Um, let's get into the right one. Here
 

253
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,389
Um, let's get into the right one. Here
we go. Right, let's have a look what the

254
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
we go. Right, let's have a look what the
 

255
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:37,670
we go. Right, let's have a look what the
other indexes are doing.

256
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680

 

257
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,230

Yeah. Yeah. Same kind of story. The

258
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
Yeah. Yeah. Same kind of story. The
 

259
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,710
Yeah. Yeah. Same kind of story. The
danger is like lower time frame bulls

260
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
danger is like lower time frame bulls
 

261
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,710
danger is like lower time frame bulls
have broken out of this. Is this just

262
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
have broken out of this. Is this just
 

263
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,269
have broken out of this. Is this just
like your leg that gets sold into for a

264
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
like your leg that gets sold into for a
 

265
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,110
like your leg that gets sold into for a
retest of this low would be my question.

266
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
retest of this low would be my question.
 

267
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,389
retest of this low would be my question.
All right. They're looking to repric

268
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
All right. They're looking to repric
 

269
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,470
All right. They're looking to repric
some of this. Same thing as ENQ. Not a

270
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
some of this. Same thing as ENQ. Not a
 

271
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,310
some of this. Same thing as ENQ. Not a
big difference. I do want to have a look

272
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
big difference. I do want to have a look
 

273
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,389
big difference. I do want to have a look
at the ETFs very quickly. Um,

274
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
at the ETFs very quickly. Um,
 

275
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,630
at the ETFs very quickly. Um,
this 650 down here was a huge,

276
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:02,640
this 650 down here was a huge,
 

277
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,790
this 650 down here was a huge,
huge, huge, huge, huge, huge option

278
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
huge, huge, huge, huge, huge option
 

279
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,590
huge, huge, huge, huge, huge option
level. Huge.

280
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
level. Huge.
 

281
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,030
level. Huge.
Biggest we've seen for a long time.

282
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
Biggest we've seen for a long time.
 

283
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,910
Biggest we've seen for a long time.
Probably remains thick. So, all the time

284
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
Probably remains thick. So, all the time
 

285
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,470
Probably remains thick. So, all the time
we're holding that. Uh, maybe we can

286
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
we're holding that. Uh, maybe we can
 

287
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,310
we're holding that. Uh, maybe we can
have a rotation back up. Not I'm not

288
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
have a rotation back up. Not I'm not
 

289
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,750
have a rotation back up. Not I'm not
talking about a huge move back up. I'm

290
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
talking about a huge move back up. I'm
 

291
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,110
talking about a huge move back up. I'm
talking about like the moves like we've

292
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
talking about like the moves like we've
 

293
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,430
talking about like the moves like we've
done here. If we start failing 650s,

294
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
done here. If we start failing 650s,
 

295
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,670
done here. If we start failing 650s,
then um I think the next level was

296
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
then um I think the next level was
 

297
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,550
then um I think the next level was
actually 642 on the options chart, but

298
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
actually 642 on the options chart, but
 

299
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,949
actually 642 on the options chart, but
I'll have to check in a bit. Q's, same

300
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
I'll have to check in a bit. Q's, same
 

301
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,870
I'll have to check in a bit. Q's, same
kind of story. That 580s was a big

302
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
kind of story. That 580s was a big
 

303
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,949
kind of story. That 580s was a big
level. All right, so worth marking those

304
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
level. All right, so worth marking those
 

305
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,190
level. All right, so worth marking those
out. 650s,

306
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
out. 650s,
 

307
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,350
out. 650s,
580s, those are huge, huge option levels

308
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
580s, those are huge, huge option levels
 

309
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,590
580s, those are huge, huge option levels
right now. Um Q's just looking to do the

310
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
right now. Um Q's just looking to do the
 

311
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,750
right now. Um Q's just looking to do the
same thing. It's trying to repric this

312
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
same thing. It's trying to repric this
 

313
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,150
same thing. It's trying to repric this
sort of swing midpoint at the moment and

314
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
sort of swing midpoint at the moment and
 

315
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,750
sort of swing midpoint at the moment and
we're there or thereabouts. You can see

316
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
we're there or thereabouts. You can see
 

317
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,829
we're there or thereabouts. You can see
after that we get into a golden zone.

318
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
after that we get into a golden zone.
 

319
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,110
after that we get into a golden zone.
Um, on the way down 600 was a massive

320
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
Um, on the way down 600 was a massive
 

321
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,990
Um, on the way down 600 was a massive
level. So, I'm assume it will be on the

322
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
level. So, I'm assume it will be on the
 

323
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,389
level. So, I'm assume it will be on the
way back up as well. Uh, Dixie starting

324
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
way back up as well. Uh, Dixie starting
 

325
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,829
way back up as well. Uh, Dixie starting
starting to really go now. This is what

326
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
starting to really go now. This is what
 

327
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,790
starting to really go now. This is what
I was talking about for a while.

328
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
I was talking about for a while.
 

329
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,870
I was talking about for a while.
Everyone was calling for Dixie lower and

330
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
Everyone was calling for Dixie lower and
 

331
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,310
Everyone was calling for Dixie lower and
I saying it was setting up for a

332
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
I saying it was setting up for a
 

333
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,389
I saying it was setting up for a
squeeze. Um, that is what we're starting

334
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
squeeze. Um, that is what we're starting
 

335
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,870
squeeze. Um, that is what we're starting
to see now.

336
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
to see now.
 

337
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,750
to see now.
And if we start breaking out, we can uh

338
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
And if we start breaking out, we can uh
 

339
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,829
And if we start breaking out, we can uh
really get going. Everyone, it was a it

340
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
really get going. Everyone, it was a it
 

341
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,990
really get going. Everyone, it was a it
was a down here. Everyone was too

342
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
was a down here. Everyone was too
 

343
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,150
was a down here. Everyone was too
shortsided and uh they they got

344
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
shortsided and uh they they got
 

345
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,590
shortsided and uh they they got
themselves a little bit caught in that

346
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
themselves a little bit caught in that
 

347
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,870
themselves a little bit caught in that
move. Let's have a look at the mag see

348
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
move. Let's have a look at the mag see
 

349
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,310
move. Let's have a look at the mag see
how we've recovered. Uh relative

350
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
how we've recovered. Uh relative
 

351
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,590
how we've recovered. Uh relative
strength in Apple which has been great

352
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
strength in Apple which has been great
 

353
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,670
strength in Apple which has been great
for me. That remains because they've not

354
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
for me. That remains because they've not
 

355
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,509
for me. That remains because they've not
heavily invested in the chips like all

356
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
heavily invested in the chips like all
 

357
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,030
heavily invested in the chips like all
the other companies. So as we've had a

358
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040
the other companies. So as we've had a
 

359
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,990
the other companies. So as we've had a
rotation out of AI they're still being

360
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
rotation out of AI they're still being
 

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,590
rotation out of AI they're still being
seen as a bit of a safe haven and you

362
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
seen as a bit of a safe haven and you
 

363
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,350
seen as a bit of a safe haven and you
can see we're just still in a big old

364
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
can see we're just still in a big old
 

365
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,670
can see we're just still in a big old
range here on Apple. Right? That was off

366
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
range here on Apple. Right? That was off
 

367
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,389
range here on Apple. Right? That was off
the earnings move and this is still a

368
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,399
the earnings move and this is still a
 

369
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,829
the earnings move and this is still a
range. So, until we see a breakdown

370
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
range. So, until we see a breakdown
 

371
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,430
range. So, until we see a breakdown
under this range, I'm not going to be

372
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
under this range, I'm not going to be
 

373
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,870
under this range, I'm not going to be
forced to sell the remainder of my

374
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
forced to sell the remainder of my
 

375
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,670
forced to sell the remainder of my
position. We look pretty good. If we

376
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
position. We look pretty good. If we
 

377
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,030
position. We look pretty good. If we
start breaking down, then maybe I'll

378
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
start breaking down, then maybe I'll
 

379
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,550
start breaking down, then maybe I'll
start trimming some more profits, but

380
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
start trimming some more profits, but
 

381
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,949
start trimming some more profits, but
I'm trying to give it a chance. Uh,

382
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
I'm trying to give it a chance. Uh,
 

383
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,829
I'm trying to give it a chance. Uh,
Amazon

384
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
Amazon
 

385
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,310
Amazon
gapping up here on Amazon, and it looks

386
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
gapping up here on Amazon, and it looks
 

387
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,829
gapping up here on Amazon, and it looks
like it's tried to find a base there on

388
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
like it's tried to find a base there on
 

389
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,910
like it's tried to find a base there on
Friday.

390
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
Friday.
 

391
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,670
Friday.
And I'd say any pullback that holds 219s

392
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
And I'd say any pullback that holds 219s
 

393
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,310
And I'd say any pullback that holds 219s
can be a bullish rotation.

394
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
can be a bullish rotation.
 

395
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,829
can be a bullish rotation.
And they want to test this supply up

396
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
And they want to test this supply up
 

397
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,350
And they want to test this supply up
here. Very simple. So, very much like

398
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
here. Very simple. So, very much like
 

399
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,110
here. Very simple. So, very much like
the ENQ, balls in control down here.

400
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120
the ENQ, balls in control down here.
 

401
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,269
the ENQ, balls in control down here.
Bears in control bank down here. This is

402
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
Bears in control bank down here. This is
 

403
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,870
Bears in control bank down here. This is
kind of your no man's land. You really

404
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
kind of your no man's land. You really
 

405
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,829
kind of your no man's land. You really
want to be trading an edge or an edge. I

406
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
want to be trading an edge or an edge. I
 

407
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,430
want to be trading an edge or an edge. I
don't really want to play the middle of

408
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
don't really want to play the middle of
 

409
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,949
don't really want to play the middle of
the range. Remember, we're opening up

410
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
the range. Remember, we're opening up
 

411
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,790
the range. Remember, we're opening up
that 50% of the previous week range

412
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
that 50% of the previous week range
 

413
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,829
that 50% of the previous week range
right now. Goo on an absolute tear at

414
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
right now. Goo on an absolute tear at
 

415
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,030
right now. Goo on an absolute tear at
the moment. Let me Wow.

416
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040

 

417
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,069

Fair play, mate. Fair play. So, ever

418
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
Fair play, mate. Fair play. So, ever
 

419
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,189
Fair play, mate. Fair play. So, ever
since they uh won that law case, which

420
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
since they uh won that law case, which
 

421
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,870
since they uh won that law case, which
was like way down here somewhere here,

422
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
was like way down here somewhere here,
 

423
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,350
was like way down here somewhere here,
it was and it's just been risk on on

424
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
it was and it's just been risk on on
 

425
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,350
it was and it's just been risk on on
Google and that thing is pushing.

426
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
Google and that thing is pushing.
 

427
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,150
Google and that thing is pushing.
Impressive. Big old gap up on Google. I

428
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
Impressive. Big old gap up on Google. I
 

429
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,990
Impressive. Big old gap up on Google. I
imagine you will see some profit taking

430
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
imagine you will see some profit taking
 

431
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,829
imagine you will see some profit taking
soon

432
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
soon
 

433
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,870
soon
because that looks pretty extended to

434
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
because that looks pretty extended to
 

435
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,350
because that looks pretty extended to
me. I'd have to check on the daily for

436
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
me. I'd have to check on the daily for
 

437
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,030
me. I'd have to check on the daily for
the standards, but big gap up on Google.

438
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
the standards, but big gap up on Google.
 

439
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,629
the standards, but big gap up on Google.
So, gapping up on Amazon, gapping up on

440
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
So, gapping up on Amazon, gapping up on
 

441
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,910
So, gapping up on Amazon, gapping up on
Google,

442
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920

 

443
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,829

gapping up on Meta. Um, I've got a

444
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
gapping up on Meta. Um, I've got a
 

445
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,670
gapping up on Meta. Um, I've got a
feeler on Meta at the moment. So, I

446
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
feeler on Meta at the moment. So, I
 

447
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,470
feeler on Meta at the moment. So, I
started a feeler down here. Just a small

448
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
started a feeler down here. Just a small
 

449
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,150
started a feeler down here. Just a small
size. I still think we can trade lower,

450
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
size. I still think we can trade lower,
 

451
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,470
size. I still think we can trade lower,
but I just wanted to get something small

452
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
but I just wanted to get something small
 

453
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,150
but I just wanted to get something small
on for a long position just to see how

454
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
on for a long position just to see how
 

455
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,150
on for a long position just to see how
it trades out, but I think there's still

456
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,160
it trades out, but I think there's still
 

457
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,949
it trades out, but I think there's still
a chance to move down into this uh

458
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
a chance to move down into this uh
 

459
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,750
a chance to move down into this uh
anywhere from 400s is where I'm really

460
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
anywhere from 400s is where I'm really
 

461
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,310
anywhere from 400s is where I'm really
interested in. 380s maybe midpoint of

462
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
interested in. 380s maybe midpoint of
 

463
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,670
interested in. 380s maybe midpoint of
this. If we can get a move like that,

464
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
this. If we can get a move like that,
 

465
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,069
this. If we can get a move like that,
I'd be absolutely delighted for a

466

slight gap ups giving some of its gains

476
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
slight gap ups giving some of its gains
 

477
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,870
slight gap ups giving some of its gains
back from the pre-market. That's in a

479
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,949
back from the pre-market. That's in a
range from Friday. So, just inside of

00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
range from Friday. So, just inside of
 

481
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,870
range from Friday. So, just inside of
Friday's range. So, no gap up outside of

482
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
Friday's range. So, no gap up outside of
 

483
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,389
Friday's range. So, no gap up outside of
Friday's range. So, weaker compared to

00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
Friday's range. So, weaker compared to
 

485
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,069

bulls take control above uh previous
 

767
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,710
bulls take control above uh previous
week point control, but if they do,

768
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
week point control, but if they do,
 

769
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,470
week point control, but if they do,
their target will be previous week value

770
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
their target will be previous week value
 

771
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,870
their target will be previous week value
area high. But that would be a quite a

Okay, so through previous day high

840
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
Okay, so through previous day high
 

841
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,950
Okay, so through previous day high
target would be up here into previous

842
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
target would be up here into previous
 

843
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,190
target would be up here into previous
week point control right now. That's

844
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
week point control right now. That's
 

845
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,669
week point control right now. That's
where they're trying to squeeze to.

846
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
where they're trying to squeeze to.
 

847
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,630
where they're trying to squeeze to.
And uh if they get through that

848
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
And uh if they get through that
 

849
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,149
And uh if they get through that
uh we start basically we start getting

850
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
uh we start basically we start getting
 

851
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,110
uh we start basically we start getting
thick um from 660s like we talked about

852
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
thick um from 660s like we talked about
 

853
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,110
thick um from 660s like we talked about
all the way up into 700s. If they get

854
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
all the way up into 700s. If they get
 

855
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,510
all the way up into 700s. If they get
through 700s they can trade to 775. If

856
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
through 700s they can trade to 775. If
 

857
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,390
through 700s they can trade to 775. If
they get through that they can go all

858
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
they get through that they can go all
 

859
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,390
they get through that they can go all
the way up to 8 and 900s which will be

860
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
the way up to 8 and 900s which will be
 

861
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,230
the way up to 8 and 900s which will be
an impressive move. Um we're already

862
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
an impressive move. Um we're already
 

863
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,789
an impressive move. Um we're already
moving skipping and very fast out the

864
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
moving skipping and very fast out the
 

865
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,630
moving skipping and very fast out the
gate folks. All right we're skipping and

866
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
gate folks. All right we're skipping and
 

867
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,990
gate folks. All right we're skipping and
moving very fast out the gate again.

868
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000

 

869
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,549

So, just be careful.

870
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559

 

871
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,710

Yeah, I got my withdrawals from TPT and

872
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
Yeah, I got my withdrawals from TPT and
 

873
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,270
Yeah, I got my withdrawals from TPT and
and I took uh what did I take last night

874
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:51,280
and I took uh what did I take last night
 

875
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,350
and I took uh what did I take last night
from Apex? Took 18,000 out of two

876
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
from Apex? Took 18,000 out of two
 

877
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,190
from Apex? Took 18,000 out of two
accounts last night on Apex. Just wait

878
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
accounts last night on Apex. Just wait
 

879
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,789
accounts last night on Apex. Just wait
for that to come through. So, a payout

880
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
for that to come through. So, a payout
 

881
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:09,350
for that to come through. So, a payout
number sevens on Apex.

882
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360

 

883
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,669

886
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
the one doing the alltime high breakout
 

887
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,549
the one doing the alltime high breakout
here. 4.42% up. Tesla having a big day

888
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
here. 4.42% up. Tesla having a big day
 

889
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,510
here. 4.42% up. Tesla having a big day
or big morning as well. I'd watch Tesla

890
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
or big morning as well. I'd watch Tesla
 

891
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,590
or big morning as well. I'd watch Tesla
into the 420 if we can get there. That

892
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
into the 420 if we can get there. That
 

893
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,149
into the 420 if we can get there. That
was always the level. How does it there?

894
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
was always the level. How does it there?
 

895
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,950
was always the level. How does it there?
VIX sliding lower

896
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
VIX sliding lower
 

897
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,350
VIX sliding lower
as expected really after an elevated I

898
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
as expected really after an elevated I
 

899
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,990
as expected really after an elevated I
don't know five sessions from VIX. So I'

900
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
don't know five sessions from VIX. So I'
 

901
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,669
don't know five sessions from VIX. So I'
watch Rick Vicks into 21s and 20

902
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679

 

903
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,269

pivot into around 2125 if it fails that

904
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:41,279
pivot into around 2125 if it fails that
 

905
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,190
pivot into around 2125 if it fails that
all the way down. Well, it can go down

906
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
all the way down. Well, it can go down
 

907
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:53,590
all the way down. Well, it can go down
to 1928 if it really wants to.

908
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600

 

909
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:05,669

Thanks, Endo.

910
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679

 

911
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,149

Still we trade higher. Straight up since

912
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
Still we trade higher. Straight up since
 

913
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,990
Still we trade higher. Straight up since
the open.

914
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
the open.
 

915
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,990
the open.
No chill. Squeezy squeeze. And that

916
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
No chill. Squeezy squeeze. And that
 

917
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,549
No chill. Squeezy squeeze. And that
previous week point of control looks

918
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
previous week point of control looks
 

919
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,350
previous week point of control looks
like a big area for them to trade into.

920
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360

 

921
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,029

And then I'd say if we get through that

922
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
And then I'd say if we get through that
 

923
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,470
And then I'd say if we get through that
this next red box and if we get through

924
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,480
this next red box and if we get through
 

925
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,990
this next red box and if we get through
that all the way up here, which is

926
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
that all the way up here, which is
 

927
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:36,310
that all the way up here, which is
bonkers, but this market is bonkers.

928
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320

 

929
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,269

big big thick area up here. This will be

930
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
big big thick area up here. This will be
 

931
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,830
big big thick area up here. This will be
contested as we get up here. I think be

932
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:41,840
contested as we get up here. I think be
 

933
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,029
contested as we get up here. I think be
interesting if they blow straight

934
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
interesting if they blow straight
 

935
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,110
interesting if they blow straight
through it. That's um well that's saying

936
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
through it. That's um well that's saying
 

937
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,269
through it. That's um well that's saying
something because this is the biggest

938
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
something because this is the biggest
 

939
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,830
something because this is the biggest
volume that we traded last week is into

940
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:49,840
volume that we traded last week is into
 

941
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,990
volume that we traded last week is into
here right now. Uh on Ninja Trader, I

942
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
here right now. Uh on Ninja Trader, I
 

943
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,870
here right now. Uh on Ninja Trader, I
have it just above into sort of 13s. So

944
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
have it just above into sort of 13s. So
 

945
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,029
have it just above into sort of 13s. So
I'll be watching up here to see if they

946
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
I'll be watching up here to see if they
 

947
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,510
I'll be watching up here to see if they
fail. All right, I'm watching up here to

948
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
fail. All right, I'm watching up here to
 

949
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:11,510
fail. All right, I'm watching up here to
see if they fail. They're

950
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520

 

951
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,390

very close. Here's point of control on

952
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
very close. Here's point of control on
 

953
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,830
very close. Here's point of control on
Ninja. Sorry. So, I'm just watching

954
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
Ninja. Sorry. So, I'm just watching
 

955
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,350
Ninja. Sorry. So, I'm just watching
between the two different ones.

956
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
between the two different ones.
 

957
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,510
between the two different ones.
720s. Now, if they continue to squeeze

958
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
720s. Now, if they continue to squeeze
 

959
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,110
720s. Now, if they continue to squeeze
upside through the point of control, the

960
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
upside through the point of control, the
 

961
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,710
upside through the point of control, the
next area, what's this edge?

962
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
next area, what's this edge?
 

963
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,630
next area, what's this edge?
Yeah, 720s and then 760s. But I imagine

964
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,640
Yeah, 720s and then 760s. But I imagine
 

965
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,990
Yeah, 720s and then 760s. But I imagine
there will be some pressure up here.

966
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,000
there will be some pressure up here.
 

967
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,630
there will be some pressure up here.
Um, and if not, well, I think bears are

968
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
Um, and if not, well, I think bears are
 

969
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,070
Um, and if not, well, I think bears are
going to get themselves very, very

970
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
going to get themselves very, very
 

971
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,350
going to get themselves very, very
caught, but we will see. So, definitely

972
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
caught, but we will see. So, definitely
 

973
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,950
caught, but we will see. So, definitely
some profit taking up here. Watching

974
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
some profit taking up here. Watching
 

975
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,750
some profit taking up here. Watching
this to see if they fade it. Small

976
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
this to see if they fade it. Small
 

977
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,750
this to see if they fade it. Small
position in this now. Just small size

978
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
position in this now. Just small size
 

979
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,909
position in this now. Just small size
because I'm really not feeling too good.

980
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
because I'm really not feeling too good.
 

981
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,149
because I'm really not feeling too good.
Already locking in some money there.

982
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
Already locking in some money there.
 

983
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,990
Already locking in some money there.
Watching if they hold 700s, I'll cut the

984
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
Watching if they hold 700s, I'll cut the
 

985
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,310
Watching if they hold 700s, I'll cut the
rest. Cut the rest there. Can always get

986
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
rest. Cut the rest there. Can always get
 

987
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,149
rest. Cut the rest there. Can always get
back in again. and I'm not feeling too

988
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
back in again. and I'm not feeling too
 

989
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,190
back in again. and I'm not feeling too
good. So, I'm just going to take my

990
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
good. So, I'm just going to take my
 

991
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,830
good. So, I'm just going to take my
money when it's available today.

992
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840

 

993
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,269

Failing that previous week point of

994
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
Failing that previous week point of
 

995
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,269
Failing that previous week point of
control and they can offer a rotation

996
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
control and they can offer a rotation
 

997
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,710
control and they can offer a rotation
all the way down to here. You can hold

998
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
all the way down to here. You can hold
 

999
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,149
all the way down to here. You can hold
this guys. So, I'm just really not

1000
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
this guys. So, I'm just really not
 

1001
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,590
this guys. So, I'm just really not
fitting up to it. So, any profit I see

1002
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
fitting up to it. So, any profit I see
 

1003
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,430
fitting up to it. So, any profit I see
today or will take it.

1004
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,440
today or will take it.
 

1005
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,029
today or will take it.
But yeah, if they fail this, I'll be

1006
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:17,039
But yeah, if they fail this, I'll be
 

1007
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,390
But yeah, if they fail this, I'll be
watching for this rotation down here. If

1008
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:18,400
watching for this rotation down here. If
 

1009
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,669
watching for this rotation down here. If
they reclaim, the next level will be

1010
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:19,679
they reclaim, the next level will be
 

1011
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,110
they reclaim, the next level will be
760. I'm already out of this. Like I

1012
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
760. I'm already out of this. Like I
 

1013
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,950
760. I'm already out of this. Like I
said, reclaim 700. Don't want to sit in

1014
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
said, reclaim 700. Don't want to sit in
 

1015
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,909
said, reclaim 700. Don't want to sit in
it. But if they fail a repush there,

1016
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
it. But if they fail a repush there,
 

1017
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,549
it. But if they fail a repush there,
sellers came in there into 690 680.

1018
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
sellers came in there into 690 680.
 

1019
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,990
sellers came in there into 690 680.
They're caught offside at the moment. So

1020
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,000
They're caught offside at the moment. So
 

1021
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,669
They're caught offside at the moment. So
maybe one more squeeze above. We trade

1022
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
maybe one more squeeze above. We trade
 

1023
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,590
maybe one more squeeze above. We trade
under 680s, then I think you'll see some

1024
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
under 680s, then I think you'll see some
 

1025
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:45,909
under 680s, then I think you'll see some
weakness based on order flow.

1026
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919

 

1027
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,909

680s is the level I'd say at the moment.

1028
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:47,919
680s is the level I'd say at the moment.
 

1029
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,070
680s is the level I'd say at the moment.
Let's get um some volume on here.

1030
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
Let's get um some volume on here.
 

1031
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,549
Let's get um some volume on here.
No, that's the wrong one.

1032
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:58,559

 

1033
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,389

There you go. 680s. That's the shelf

1034
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
There you go. 680s. That's the shelf
 

1035
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,549
There you go. 680s. That's the shelf
being built.

1036
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:04,559

 

1037
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,990

I'd watch 700s and 680s. Sellers keep

1038
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,000
I'd watch 700s and 680s. Sellers keep
 

1039
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,590
I'd watch 700s and 680s. Sellers keep
trying to sell at the low of this

1040
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
trying to sell at the low of this
 

1041
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,430
trying to sell at the low of this
candle. You actually want failure under

1042
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
candle. You actually want failure under
 

1043
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,950
candle. You actually want failure under
this. That was what will confirm it.

1044
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
this. That was what will confirm it.
 

1045
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,549
this. That was what will confirm it.
It's the 80s. If you fail here, you can

1046
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
It's the 80s. If you fail here, you can
 

1047
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,190
It's the 80s. If you fail here, you can
snap. Potential to snap lower if you

1048
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
snap. Potential to snap lower if you
 

1049
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,269
snap. Potential to snap lower if you
fail here. Lots of sellers coming in

1050
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
fail here. Lots of sellers coming in
 

1051
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,789
fail here. Lots of sellers coming in
here trying to force this market lower.

1052
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
here trying to force this market lower.
 

1053
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,870
here trying to force this market lower.
That back down to 600 is their target at

1054
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:24,880
That back down to 600 is their target at
 

1055
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,149
That back down to 600 is their target at
the moment. Here's 80s. So if you if

1056
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:28,159
the moment. Here's 80s. So if you if
 

1057
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,549
the moment. Here's 80s. So if you if
you're in this, you need 700 to stay

1058
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
you're in this, you need 700 to stay
 

1059
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,789
you're in this, you need 700 to stay
heavy. Really, you want 80s to snap and

1060
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
heavy. Really, you want 80s to snap and
 

1061
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,510
heavy. Really, you want 80s to snap and
that trade down to 600 for you. You must

1062
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
that trade down to 600 for you. You must
 

1063
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,950

today. You don't want to be caught the
 

1067
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,950
today. You don't want to be caught the
wrong side of this.

1068
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:40,960
wrong side of this.
 

1069
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,230
wrong side of this.
You don't want them to reclaim

1070
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
You don't want them to reclaim
 

1071
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,350
You don't want them to reclaim

1075
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,950
there at 695s under 700s. Here's the
flush for you guys. It's looking great.

this environment and then hold runners.
If you can get down to uh 600s, think it

1084
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:00,640
If you can get down to uh 600s, think it
 

1085
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,710
If you can get down to uh 600s, think it
looks good.

1086
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
looks good.
 

1087
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,389
looks good.
You don't want a reclaim of 700.

1088
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399
You don't want a reclaim of 700.
 

1089
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,990
You don't want a reclaim of 700.
Needs to be an instant cut because they

1090
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
Needs to be an instant cut because they
 

1091
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:18,470
Needs to be an instant cut because they
can resqueeze it above that.

1092
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480

 

1093
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,630

If you guys can hear that. My ears so
bad.

1096
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:28,399

 

1097
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,190

Uh Marrick, that's a very um good
 

1099
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,950
Uh Marrick, that's a very um good
question, but it honestly comes down to

1100
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
question, but it honestly comes down to
 

1101
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,789
question, but it honestly comes down to
personal traders. For me personally, I

1102
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
personal traders. For me personally, I
 

1103
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,430
personal traders. For me personally, I
would always buy Trader 8 because then

1104
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440

1105
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,269

1115
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,789
based and mobile and and link up to
other accounts. You look really good

1116
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:48,799
other accounts. You look really good
 

1117
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,750
other accounts. You look really good
here, folks. Look really good. Big TP

1118
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
here, folks. Look really good. Big TP
 

1119
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,750
here, folks. Look really good. Big TP
coming up here. Um, once we start

1120
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:53,760
coming up here. Um, once we start
 

1121
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,070
coming up here. Um, once we start
flushing under 650, it gets a bit weaker

1122
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,080
flushing under 650, it gets a bit weaker
 

1123
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,310
flushing under 650, it gets a bit weaker
down into 630. So, you can take a little

1124
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
down into 630. So, you can take a little
 

1125
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,870
down into 630. So, you can take a little
bit of a TP into 650. Got an imbalance

1126
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:00,880
bit of a TP into 650. Got an imbalance
 

1127
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,230
bit of a TP into 650. Got an imbalance
there. And if they fail that, you're

1128
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,240
there. And if they fail that, you're
 

1129
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,549
there. And if they fail that, you're
looking for 630 and VWAP. Looks really

1130
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
looking for 630 and VWAP. Looks really
 

1131
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,269
looking for 630 and VWAP. Looks really
good, though.

1132
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
good, though.
 

1133
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,350
good, though.

1137
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,110

1149
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,430

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,269
Watch this BW coming up here, folks. You
can take some off into this. Make sure

1154
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
can take some off into this. Make sure
 

1155
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,630
can take some off into this. Make sure
you've already paid yourself some. There

1156
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
you've already paid yourself some. There
 

1157
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,310
you've already paid yourself some. There
is a shelf here. They can support the

1158
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
is a shelf here. They can support the
 

1159
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,870
is a shelf here. They can support the
bid here if they want to. And then you

1160
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
bid here if they want to. And then you
 

1161
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,070
bid here if they want to. And then you
can hold runners. If they get really

1162
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
can hold runners. If they get really
 

1163
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,350
can hold runners. If they get really
weak, then you know where we're going.

1164
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
weak, then you know where we're going.
 

1165
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,630
weak, then you know where we're going.
All the way back down to the New York

1166
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
All the way back down to the New York
 

1167
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:47,350
All the way back down to the New York
Open.

1168
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360

1173
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,750

Really nice, mate.
 

1175
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,110
Really nice, mate.
Okay, so they're trying to find a bid

1176
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
Okay, so they're trying to find a bid
 

1177
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,590
Okay, so they're trying to find a bid
here.

1178
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:01,600

 

1179
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,149

Vick's also finding a bid. The timing is

1180
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
Vick's also finding a bid. The timing is
 

1181
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,909
Vick's also finding a bid. The timing is
good. If Vic starts reclaiming New York

1182
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
good. If Vic starts reclaiming New York
 

1183
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,430
good. If Vic starts reclaiming New York
open,

1184
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
open,
 

1185
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:16,070
open,
we'll get some more weakness.

1186
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,080

 

1187
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,909

Looking good. Looking really good.

1188
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:17,919
Looking good. Looking really good.
 

1189
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,669
Looking good. Looking really good.
There's your VWAP and come down to these

1190
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:19,679
There's your VWAP and come down to these
 

1191
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,909
There's your VWAP and come down to these
600 retest like I talked about. That

1192
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
600 retest like I talked about. That
 

1193
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,430
600 retest like I talked about. That
would be a 100 point trade for you guys

1194
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,440
would be a 100 point trade for you guys
 

1195
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,269
would be a 100 point trade for you guys
basically. Or if you took the 80s break,

1196
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:25,279
basically. Or if you took the 80s break,
 

1197
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,430
basically. Or if you took the 80s break,
it would be 80 point trade. We have some

1198
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,440
it would be 80 point trade. We have some
 

1199
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,470
it would be 80 point trade. We have some
imbalances here into 620 to 600. So you

1200
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480
imbalances here into 620 to 600. So you
 

1201
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,389
imbalances here into 620 to 600. So you
need to be taking the majority of your

1202
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
need to be taking the majority of your
 

1203
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,710
need to be taking the majority of your
position off there.

1204
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720

 

1205
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,750

Really nice.

1206
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
Really nice.
 

1207
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,950
Really nice.
Why am I in a position? What?

1208
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960

 

1209
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,710

I'm literally not in a position and it

1210
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
I'm literally not in a position and it
 

1211
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,070
I'm literally not in a position and it
says I'm in a position.

1212
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,080
says I'm in a position.
 

1213
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,909
says I'm in a position.
Uh

1214
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919

 

1215
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,070

uh.

1216
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080

 

1217
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,350

Well, that's weird.

1218
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
Well, that's weird.
 

1219
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,509
Well, that's weird.
Flattened that. But I'm not in anything.

1220
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:07,519
Flattened that. But I'm not in anything.
 

1221
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,909
Flattened that. But I'm not in anything.
Bizarre.

1222
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
Bizarre.
 

1223
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,990
Bizarre.
This is why I can't trade when I'm sick.

1224
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
This is why I can't trade when I'm sick.
 

1225
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,350
This is why I can't trade when I'm sick.
That exact reason. That is bizarre.

1226
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
That exact reason. That is bizarre.
 

1227
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,149
That exact reason. That is bizarre.
Where would that order have been out?

1228
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:18,159
Where would that order have been out?
 

1229
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,870
Where would that order have been out?
We got any resting orders?

1230
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
We got any resting orders?
 

1231
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,630
We got any resting orders?
Cancelled orders.

1239
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,029
Who knows?
Okay. So, they're finding a bid in this

1240
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,039
Okay. So, they're finding a bid in this
 

1241
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,789
Okay. So, they're finding a bid in this
shelf. All right. Value for the day.

1242
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
shelf. All right. Value for the day.
 

1243
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,190
shelf. All right. Value for the day.
Like we said, there was an imbalance

1244
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
Like we said, there was an imbalance
 

1245
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,549
Like we said, there was an imbalance
there to hold. Now, they're going to

1246
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
there to hold. Now, they're going to
 

1247
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,389
there to hold. Now, they're going to
trade back up and try and test that sort

1248
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:46,399
trade back up and try and test that sort
 

1249
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,630
trade back up and try and test that sort
of 680 to 700. And if they squeeze

1250
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:48,640
of 680 to 700. And if they squeeze
 

1251
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,750
of 680 to 700. And if they squeeze
through that, they're going to go for

1252
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
through that, they're going to go for
 

1253
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,710
through that, they're going to go for
leg high because that's your first

1254
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:50,720
leg high because that's your first
 

1255
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,909
leg high because that's your first
pullback. So that was yourself from

1256
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
pullback. So that was yourself from
 

1257
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,430
pullback. So that was yourself from
previous week point control down to this

1258
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
previous week point control down to this
 

1259
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,590
previous week point control down to this
area. See money take money. If they fail

1260
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
area. See money take money. If they fail
 

1261
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,110
area. See money take money. If they fail
this, we'll make a lower low or attempt

1262
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,120
this, we'll make a lower low or attempt
 

1263
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,870
this, we'll make a lower low or attempt
to go lower low. If they hold this, then

1264
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
to go lower low. If they hold this, then
 

1265
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,310
to go lower low. If they hold this, then
there is a new squeeze available there.

1266
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
there is a new squeeze available there.
 

1267
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,310
there is a new squeeze available there.
Look to trade into 760s and then maybe

1268
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,320
Look to trade into 760s and then maybe
 

1269
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,669
Look to trade into 760s and then maybe
all the way up here if they really want.

1270
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
all the way up here if they really want.
 

1271
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,870
all the way up here if they really want.
But remember, this is a heavily

1272
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
But remember, this is a heavily
 

1273
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,830
But remember, this is a heavily
contested area like I said.

1274
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840

 

1275
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,149

Yeah. And the weird thing is though, I I

1276
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:12,159
Yeah. And the weird thing is though, I I
 

1277
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,470
Yeah. And the weird thing is though, I I
have my um lead account open and there's

1278
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:14,480
have my um lead account open and there's
 

1279
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,190
have my um lead account open and there's
no orders on it. So there shouldn't be

1280
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200

 

1281
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,230

can't see anything. But hey, it whatever

1282
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
can't see anything. But hey, it whatever
 

1283
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,110
can't see anything. But hey, it whatever
it's fine. I I caught it and I closed it

1284
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
it's fine. I I caught it and I closed it
 

1285
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,990
it's fine. I I caught it and I closed it
instantly. But it's just uh

1286
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
instantly. But it's just uh
 

1287
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,310
instantly. But it's just uh
always a bit of a worry.

1288
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,320

 

1289
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,549

It's a retesting the 80s and 700s like

1290
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
It's a retesting the 80s and 700s like
 

1291
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,549
It's a retesting the 80s and 700s like
we talked about. Sellers will need to

1292
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:42,559
we talked about. Sellers will need to
 

1293
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,110
we talked about. Sellers will need to
defend this. If they don't defend this,

1294
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,120
defend this. If they don't defend this,
 

1295
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,789
defend this. If they don't defend this,
then I think we can potentially squeeze.

1296
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
then I think we can potentially squeeze.
 

1297
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,710
then I think we can potentially squeeze.
If they successfully defend this, then

1298
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:48,720
If they successfully defend this, then
 

1299
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,350
If they successfully defend this, then
probably a rotation, look to retest this

1300
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
probably a rotation, look to retest this
 

1301
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,630
probably a rotation, look to retest this
previous day high. And if they fail

1302
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,640
previous day high. And if they fail
 

1303
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,909
previous day high. And if they fail
that, all the way back down to New York

1304
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
that, all the way back down to New York
 

1305
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,350
that, all the way back down to New York
open. So there you go. There's a retest

1306
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
open. So there you go. There's a retest
 

1307
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,789
open. So there you go. There's a retest
of those levels. That's why order flow

1308
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:58,799
of those levels. That's why order flow
 

1309
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,389
of those levels. That's why order flow
is important. Failing into 680 to 700.

1310
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:02,399
is important. Failing into 680 to 700.
 

1311
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,669
is important. Failing into 680 to 700.
That was the key level that we broke

1312
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:03,679
That was the key level that we broke
 

1313
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,789
That was the key level that we broke
down from. And you're seeing sell

1314
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:04,799
down from. And you're seeing sell
 

1315
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,070
down from. And you're seeing sell
pressure come in there. All right. And

1316
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
pressure come in there. All right. And
 

1317
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,830
pressure come in there. All right. And
they're going to battle it out here in

1318
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
they're going to battle it out here in
 

1319
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,589
they're going to battle it out here in
this rotation. This is value on the day.

1320
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:09,599
this rotation. This is value on the day.
 

1321
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,270
this rotation. This is value on the day.
Now failing this value would test

1322
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:11,280
Now failing this value would test
 

1323
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,030
Now failing this value would test
previous day high, GlobeEx, and New York

1324
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
previous day high, GlobeEx, and New York
 

1325
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,710
previous day high, GlobeEx, and New York
open. All right. So, this is where

1326
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:14,720
open. All right. So, this is where
 

1327
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,470
open. All right. So, this is where
sellers are in control right now. Right

1328
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
sellers are in control right now. Right
 

1329
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,790
sellers are in control right now. Right
here is where they came in heavy here,

1330
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:18,800
here is where they came in heavy here,
 

1331
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,909
here is where they came in heavy here,
right? And they're trying to defend

1332
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:19,919
right? And they're trying to defend
 

1333
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,909
right? And they're trying to defend
this. If they get successful, you're

1334
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:21,919
this. If they get successful, you're
 

1335
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,750
this. If they get successful, you're
going to get a retest of these levels,

1336
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
going to get a retest of these levels,
 

1337
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,669
going to get a retest of these levels,
right? If they're not successful and you

1338
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
right? If they're not successful and you
 

1339
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,109
right? If they're not successful and you
get one of these, you want to be very

1340
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
get one of these, you want to be very
 

1341
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,550
get one of these, you want to be very
careful that you don't get squeezed out.

1342
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:28,560
careful that you don't get squeezed out.
 

1343
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,230
careful that you don't get squeezed out.
So, it's why I'm saying see money, take

1344
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
So, it's why I'm saying see money, take
 

1345
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,710
So, it's why I'm saying see money, take
money, because also you're moving fast.

1346
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
money, because also you're moving fast.
 

1347
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,230
money, because also you're moving fast.
Like, we're at 206 points in the first

1348
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
Like, we're at 206 points in the first
 

1349
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,430
Like, we're at 206 points in the first
13 minutes already.

1350
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:41,440

 

1351
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,589

Nice, Richard. Nice. Yeah. Did any of

1352
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
Nice, Richard. Nice. Yeah. Did any of
 

1353
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,349
Nice, Richard. Nice. Yeah. Did any of
you get it with me?

1354
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:49,359

 

1355
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,629

Hopefully some of you got it. Some of

1356
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:50,639
Hopefully some of you got it. Some of
 

1357
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,829
Hopefully some of you got it. Some of
you might still be in it.

1358
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
you might still be in it.
 

1359
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,389
you might still be in it.
It's rejecting the key levels very very

1360
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,399
It's rejecting the key levels very very
 

1361
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,510
It's rejecting the key levels very very
well.

1362
00:34:59,510 --> 00:34:59,520

 

1363
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,190

Yeah. W's in chat if you caught it.

1364
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,200

 

1365
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,630

Ah, here we go. Amazing.

1366
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640

 

1367
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,230

Okay, you might have seen at the bottom

1368
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,240
Okay, you might have seen at the bottom
 

1369
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,270
Okay, you might have seen at the bottom
of the screen there is a funded next

1370
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,280
of the screen there is a funded next
 

1371
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,790
of the screen there is a funded next
sign which has been here you go

1372
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
sign which has been here you go
 

1373
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,710
sign which has been here you go
continuation of sale here. So lock, if

1374
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:18,720
continuation of sale here. So lock, if
 

1375
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,150
continuation of sale here. So lock, if
you haven't paid yourself some, lock

1376
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,160
you haven't paid yourself some, lock
 

1377
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,470
you haven't paid yourself some, lock
some in here now, please. All right,

1378
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,480
some in here now, please. All right,
 

1379
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,069
some in here now, please. All right,
because we have an imbalance here. And

1380
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
because we have an imbalance here. And
 

1381
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,190
because we have an imbalance here. And
if you can keep going, we can come down

1382
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
if you can keep going, we can come down
 

1383
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,510
if you can keep going, we can come down
to retest these previous highs from

1384
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
to retest these previous highs from
 

1385
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,589
to retest these previous highs from
GloEx, the New York Open, and VWAP. So

1386
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
GloEx, the New York Open, and VWAP. So
 

1387
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,270
GloEx, the New York Open, and VWAP. So
as long as you paid yourself, this is

1388
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,280
as long as you paid yourself, this is
 

1389
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,030
as long as you paid yourself, this is
your first lower high. This is now a

1390
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,040
your first lower high. This is now a
 

1391
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,030
your first lower high. This is now a

a trading draw down, um they are

1444
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:45,359
a trading draw down, um they are
 

1445
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,270
a trading draw down, um they are
probably the easiest ones.

1446
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
probably the easiest ones.
 

1447
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,790
probably the easiest ones.
I don't know. I've never traded them

1448
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,800
I don't know. I've never traded them
 

1449
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,069
I don't know. I've never traded them
with them this this trust traded. So, I

1450
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:54,079
with them this this trust traded. So, I
 

1451
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,230
with them this this trust traded. So, I
only only talk about firms that I trade

1452
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240
only only talk about firms that I trade
 

1453
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,750
only only talk about firms that I trade
with. I'm sure they're good, but I just

1454
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:57,760
with. I'm sure they're good, but I just
 

1455
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,030
with. I'm sure they're good, but I just
haven't traded with them. So, Funded

1456
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
haven't traded with them. So, Funded
 

1457
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,870
haven't traded with them. So, Funded
Next, they they go sort top five, top

Next, they they go sort top five, top
 

1459

them. Apex and TPT at the moment for me

1462
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,280
them. Apex and TPT at the moment for me
 

1463
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,230
them. Apex and TPT at the moment for me
are very very good.

1464
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,240
are very very good.
 

1465
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,310
are very very good.
I think it's both.

1466
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,320
I think it's both.
 

1467
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,670
I think it's both.
If you want to do the rapids, I think

1468
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:13,680
If you want to do the rapids, I think
 

1469
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,470
If you want to do the rapids, I think
it's both right now. Um, but if you use

1470
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480
it's both right now. Um, but if you use
 

1471
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,990
it's both right now. Um, but if you use
code uh FCT gets you an extra 10%.

1472
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,000
code uh FCT gets you an extra 10%.
 

1473
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,630
code uh FCT gets you an extra 10%.
Funded next. Funding ticks are good.

I said 680s has to hold. Do do not bite

1520
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,320
I said 680s has to hold. Do do not bite
 

1521
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,589
I said 680s has to hold. Do do not bite
the tape. If they want to squeeze

1522
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
the tape. If they want to squeeze
 

1523
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,349
the tape. If they want to squeeze
through it, you just have to cut the

1524
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:43,359
through it, you just have to cut the
 

1525
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,430
through it, you just have to cut the
rest of your position out.

1526
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:47,440

do not get the breakdown, they will get
 

1531
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,829
do not get the breakdown, they will get
squeezed out. So 680 to 700 was the

1532
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
squeezed out. So 680 to 700 was the
 

1533
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,829
squeezed out. So 680 to 700 was the
level. If they reclaim it, cut the rest

1534
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:55,839
level. If they reclaim it, cut the rest
 

1535
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,510
level. If they reclaim it, cut the rest
of your position. You should have made

1537
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:06,550

00:42:51,280 --> 00:43:10,069

Oh gosh.

1702
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079

 

1703
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,190

So, continuing to rotate.

1704
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,200
So, continuing to rotate.
 

1705
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,870
So, continuing to rotate.

Holding those deep pullback flow zones,

1718
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:27,599
Holding those deep pullback flow zones,
 

1719
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,349
Holding those deep pullback flow zones,
isn't it? Holding that blue box, that

1720
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
isn't it? Holding that blue box, that
 

1721
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,910
isn't it? Holding that blue box, that
cover box as we rotate higher. Remember,

1722
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920
cover box as we rotate higher. Remember,
 

1723
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,870

680 to 700 is the squeeze trigger.

1724
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,880
680 to 700 is the squeeze trigger.
 

1725
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,870
680 to 700 is the squeeze trigger.
All those balls.

1726
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880

1730
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:42,480
the day. That was a one and done for me.
 

1731
00:43:42,480 --> 00:44:06,470
the day. That was a one and done for me.
I'm really not feeling up to it.

1732
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480

Uh, I use a mix between um, Trading

1736
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:15,359

 

1737
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,430

sorry, my brain is struggling to think.

1738
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
sorry, my brain is struggling to think.

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,030
sorry, my brain is struggling to think.
Uh, Tide from Unusual Wales.

1740
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040

 

1741
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,790

It doesn't like and normally I don't

1742
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:24,800
It doesn't like and normally I don't
 

1743
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,630
It doesn't like and normally I don't
really care about it if I'm honest, but

1744
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
really care about it if I'm honest, but
 

1745
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,190
really care about it if I'm honest, but
the thing is we've moved so violently

1746
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
the thing is we've moved so violently
 

1747
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,470
the thing is we've moved so violently
and we were in uh OPEX that I knew the

1748
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:32,480
and we were in uh OPEX that I knew the
 

1749
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,990
and we were in uh OPEX that I knew the
GEX levels would actually matter. Um and

1750
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
GEX levels would actually matter. Um and
 

1751
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,390
GEX levels would actually matter. Um and
that's the only reason why like we're

1752
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
that's the only reason why like we're
 

1753
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,990
that's the only reason why like we're
now into new contracts now. Probably

1754
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,000
now into new contracts now. Probably
 

1755
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,670
now into new contracts now. Probably
won't matter so much in the next week or

1756
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680
won't matter so much in the next week or
 

1757
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,589
won't matter so much in the next week or
two.

1758
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,599

 

1759
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,790

Okay, so they're trying to squeeze

1760
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
Okay, so they're trying to squeeze
 

1761
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,309
Okay, so they're trying to squeeze
through 68700s for that squeeze back up.

1762
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
through 68700s for that squeeze back up.
 

1763
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,750
through 68700s for that squeeze back up.
All right. And if they can complete this

1764
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
All right. And if they can complete this
 

1765
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,550
All right. And if they can complete this
squeeze back up after sort of a two-leg,

1766
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:54,560
squeeze back up after sort of a two-leg,
 

1767
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,670
squeeze back up after sort of a two-leg,
this is the question that they're

1768
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:55,680
this is the question that they're
 

1769
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,870
this is the question that they're
asking. Can they do this now or even

1770
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:58,880
asking. Can they do this now or even
 

1771
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,190
asking. Can they do this now or even
this if they really get going? But 680

1772
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,200
this if they really get going? But 680
 

1773
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,030
this if they really get going? But 680
to 700 is a huge level.

1774
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,040

 

1775
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:21,589

just did fail. New York Open

1776
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599

 

1777
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,790

there's lots of places you can look at

1778
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:22,800
there's lots of places you can look at
 

1779
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,710
there's lots of places you can look at
it. I think Cheddar Flow is another one.

1780
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
it. I think Cheddar Flow is another one.
 

1781
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,230
it. I think Cheddar Flow is another one.
Um,

1782
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
Um,
 

1783
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,390
Um,
Tide,

1784
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:28,400
Tide,
 

1785
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,710
Tide,
uh,

1786
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
uh,
 

1787
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:43,030
uh,
I think of them all.

1788
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040

 

1789
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,309

So still failing at 680700. Bears still

1790
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:46,319
So still failing at 680700. Bears still
 

1791
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,990
So still failing at 680700. Bears still
defending it. This rotation still

1792
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
defending it. This rotation still
 

1793
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,230
defending it. This rotation still
happening. Right. So you're just in a

1794
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,240
happening. Right. So you're just in a
 

1795
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,470
happening. Right. So you're just in a
100 point rotation right now. 680 keeps

1796
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,480
100 point rotation right now. 680 keeps
 

1797
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,630
100 point rotation right now. 680 keeps
failing and they keep finding bids at

1798
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:54,640
failing and they keep finding bids at
 

1799
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,750
failing and they keep finding bids at
580s. Right. So literally between these

1800
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
580s. Right. So literally between these
 

1801
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,190
580s. Right. So literally between these
blue and red boxes. Remember these have

1802
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
blue and red boxes. Remember these have
 

1803
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,630
blue and red boxes. Remember these have
been on your charts all day. This was

1804
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:00,640
been on your charts all day. This was
 

1805
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,150
been on your charts all day. This was
always red. This was red at one point.

1806
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,160
always red. This was red at one point.
 

1807
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,750
always red. This was red at one point.
We got through it. It becomes blue. This

1808
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
We got through it. It becomes blue. This
 

1809
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,589
We got through it. It becomes blue. This
is your rotation. They will have to make

1810
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:05,599
is your rotation. They will have to make
 

1811
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,349
is your rotation. They will have to make
a decision. If bulls win, they get this.

1812
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
a decision. If bulls win, they get this.
 

1813
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,349
a decision. If bulls win, they get this.
If bears win, they get this. And this is

1814
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:09,359
If bears win, they get this. And this is
 

1815
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,030
If bears win, they get this. And this is
the rotation. Edge to edge to edge to

1816
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,040
the rotation. Edge to edge to edge to
 

1817
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,430
the rotation. Edge to edge to edge to
edge. Edge to edge. Eventually something

1818
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
edge. Edge to edge. Eventually something
 

1819
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,069
edge. Edge to edge. Eventually something
will give. We got the first test. Oh,

1820
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:16,079
will give. We got the first test. Oh,
 

1821
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,670
will give. We got the first test. Oh,
that's it. Mental Q. Yeah, it's supposed

1822
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
that's it. Mental Q. Yeah, it's supposed
 

1823
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,349
that's it. Mental Q. Yeah, it's supposed
to be very good. Then that prints

1824
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359
to be very good. Then that prints
 

1825
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,510
to be very good. Then that prints
automatically onto Trading View or

1826
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
automatically onto Trading View or
 

1827
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:29,910
automatically onto Trading View or
bookmap as well. I think

1828
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920

 

1829
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,430

some big selling coming in there on that

1830
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
some big selling coming in there on that
 

1831
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,390
some big selling coming in there on that
last shove up.

1832
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:34,400
last shove up.
 

1833
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,630
last shove up.
Bulls can't get through that 680. It's

1834
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:36,640
Bulls can't get through that 680. It's
 

1835
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,829
Bulls can't get through that 680. It's
been very very very well defended so

1836
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:39,839
been very very very well defended so
 

1837
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:47,990
been very very very well defended so
far.

1838
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000

 

1839
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,950

Just seems like a dangerous uh liquidity

1840
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:50,960
Just seems like a dangerous uh liquidity
 

1841
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:57,589
Just seems like a dangerous uh liquidity
build out at the moment.

1842
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599

 

1843
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,309

Where is that buy side down to left? 55.

1844
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:00,319
Where is that buy side down to left? 55.
 

1845
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,829
Where is that buy side down to left? 55.
I think I just saw it.

1846
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:05,839

 

1847
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,990

Right into him.

1848
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
Right into him.
 

1849
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,630
Right into him.
Is there anyone above? Stop moving so

1850
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:10,640
Is there anyone above? Stop moving so
 

1851
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,630
Is there anyone above? Stop moving so
quick. Tape. Uh 650s. What's this block

1852
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:14,640
quick. Tape. Uh 650s. What's this block
 

1853
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,750
quick. Tape. Uh 650s. What's this block
up here? Slow down. Tape. Jesus Christ.

Can't move up. Level two.

1856
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:21,760
Can't move up. Level two.
 

1857
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,109
Can't move up. Level two.

there.
Side delta keeps getting smacked there.

1862
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,359
Side delta keeps getting smacked there.
 

1863
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,109
Side delta keeps getting smacked there.
Biggest level. Big big level traded up

1864

traded at
Yeah. 50s, 52s, and 55s.

1872
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920

 

1873
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,430

Moving fast though. The tape right now.

1874
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440

 

1875
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,349

A RTY breaking out. Yeah, it's not

1876
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:53,359
A RTY breaking out. Yeah, it's not
 

1877
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,230
A RTY breaking out. Yeah, it's not
surprising. Bit of a rotation back into

1878
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
surprising. Bit of a rotation back into
 

1879
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:05,829
surprising. Bit of a rotation back into
some small cap names.

1880
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:05,839

 

1881
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,309

Yeah, relative weakness YM red on the

1882
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:08,319
Yeah, relative weakness YM red on the
 

1883
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,670
Yeah, relative weakness YM red on the
day, but it's trying to go red to green

1884
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
day, but it's trying to go red to green
 

1885
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:21,589
day, but it's trying to go red to green
at the moment. Tried to play catch up.

1886
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599

 

1887
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,950

Nothing's really happening here, folks.

1888
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
Nothing's really happening here, folks.
 

1889
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,069
Nothing's really happening here, folks.
She's just trading between the two

1890
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:24,079
She's just trading between the two
 

1891
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,470
She's just trading between the two
levels.

1892
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480

 

1893
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,390

VIX is failing. This has got the ability

1894
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:32,400
VIX is failing. This has got the ability
 

1895
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,309
VIX is failing. This has got the ability
to squeeze here. If it can get through,

1896
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
to squeeze here. If it can get through,
 

1897
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,549
to squeeze here. If it can get through,
it's got to get through the 680s.

1898
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
it's got to get through the 680s.
 

1899
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,069
it's got to get through the 680s.
There's a chance they try and squeeze it

1900
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:38,079
There's a chance they try and squeeze it
 

1901
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,750
There's a chance they try and squeeze it
out for a high day push. It's not

1902
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:39,760
out for a high day push. It's not
 

1903
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,430
out for a high day push. It's not
something I would trade, but just making

1904
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:41,440
something I would trade, but just making
 

1905
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,510
something I would trade, but just making
you aware what is currently setting up.

1906
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:45,520
you aware what is currently setting up.
 

1907
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:55,190
you aware what is currently setting up.
2 minutes until a new H1 and H4.

1908
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200

 

1909
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,349

I'd say sort of 780 785. This level up

1910
00:48:59,349 --> 00:48:59,359
I'd say sort of 780 785. This level up
 

1911
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,710
I'd say sort of 780 785. This level up
here is interesting. That's like the

1912
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
here is interesting. That's like the
 

1913
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,549
here is interesting. That's like the
edge of the volume from last week. After

1914
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
edge of the volume from last week. After
 

1915
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:38,549
edge of the volume from last week. After
that, it gets very very thin up to 890.

1916
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:38,559

 

1917
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,470

Still rejecting that level. Still

1918
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
Still rejecting that level. Still
 

1919
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,349
Still rejecting that level. Still
defending getting tight here. Someone's

1920
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
defending getting tight here. Someone's
 

1921
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,470
defending getting tight here. Someone's
going to get hurt soon enough.

1922
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
going to get hurt soon enough.
 

1923
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:57,990
going to get hurt soon enough.
Someone's going to get hurt.

1924
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,000

 

1925
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,710

What's up, Tyson? Morning, buddy.

1926
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:02,720

 

1927
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,549

Everyone's names seem to have changed. I

1928
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:04,559
Everyone's names seem to have changed. I
 

1929
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:05,990
Everyone's names seem to have changed. I
think it's that YouTube thing where it

1930
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
think it's that YouTube thing where it
 

1931
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,390
think it's that YouTube thing where it
changes it, isn't it? To your handle

1932
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:08,400
changes it, isn't it? To your handle
 

1933
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,470
changes it, isn't it? To your handle
rather than your name.

1934
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:14,480

 

1935
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,190

Nice, Andrew. Great work. Yeah, that's

1936
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:17,200
Nice, Andrew. Great work. Yeah, that's
 

1937
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,309
Nice, Andrew. Great work. Yeah, that's
it. hit your goal in a market which is

1938
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:20,319
it. hit your goal in a market which is
 

1939
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,150
it. hit your goal in a market which is
not particularly pleasant. I would say I

1940
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,160
not particularly pleasant. I would say I
 

1941
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,510
not particularly pleasant. I would say I
think great work. We got 100 points very

1942
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:25,520
think great work. We got 100 points very
 

1943
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,430
think great work. We got 100 points very
early this morning. First I made 20

1944
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:27,440
early this morning. First I made 20
 

1945
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:45,109
early this morning. First I made 20
minutes made a 100 point trade.

1946
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:45,119

 

1947
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,870

Okay. UH1 here. Here comes the high. So

1948
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:48,880
Okay. UH1 here. Here comes the high. So
 

1949
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,710
Okay. UH1 here. Here comes the high. So
through the 680s and 700. This is the

1950
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,720
through the 680s and 700. This is the
 

1951
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,829
through the 680s and 700. This is the
squeeze I was talking about. They

1952
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:51,839
squeeze I was talking about. They
 

1953
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,109
squeeze I was talking about. They
probably come and take out these highs

1954
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:53,119
probably come and take out these highs
 

1955
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,230
probably come and take out these highs
at this point. This high here, right?

1956
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
at this point. This high here, right?
 

1957
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,470
at this point. This high here, right?
Because they've taken out this level

1958
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:58,480
Because they've taken out this level
 

1959
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,030
Because they've taken out this level
here, 680, 700. They should complete

1960
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
here, 680, 700. They should complete
 

1961
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,630
here, 680, 700. They should complete
this rotation. If they're lucky, they

1962
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,640
this rotation. If they're lucky, they
 

1963
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,829
this rotation. If they're lucky, they
get a squeeze up to here. And then you

1964
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:03,839
get a squeeze up to here. And then you
 

1965
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,349
get a squeeze up to here. And then you
have to see if they sell from there. But

1966
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:05,359
have to see if they sell from there. But
 

1967
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,630
have to see if they sell from there. But
that bulls defended this RBS zone really

1968
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:08,640
that bulls defended this RBS zone really
 

1969
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,710
that bulls defended this RBS zone really
well. Remember this was resistance

1970
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:10,720
well. Remember this was resistance
 

1971
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,790
well. Remember this was resistance
becomes support. That was the dip that

1972
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800
becomes support. That was the dip that
 

1973
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,710
becomes support. That was the dip that
held. This is first higher low. And

1974
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
held. This is first higher low. And
 

1975
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,870
held. This is first higher low. And
there's your squeeze and break out now.

1976
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:16,880
there's your squeeze and break out now.
 

1977
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,309
there's your squeeze and break out now.
So if you took the bullish play here

1978
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
So if you took the bullish play here
 

1979
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:19,990
So if you took the bullish play here
with the flow zones or deep pullbacks,

1980
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,000
with the flow zones or deep pullbacks,
 

1981
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,230
with the flow zones or deep pullbacks,
don't blame you.

1982
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,240
don't blame you.
 

1983
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,549
don't blame you.
You must be TP1 into this now and then

1984
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:24,559
You must be TP1 into this now and then
 

1985
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,150
You must be TP1 into this now and then
hold uh for 760 to 780. And then if you

1986
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
hold uh for 760 to 780. And then if you
 

1987
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,470
hold uh for 760 to 780. And then if you
get really really lucky, you might get

1988
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:30,480
get really really lucky, you might get
 

1989
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,950
get really really lucky, you might get
940s or 950s.

1990
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:32,960
940s or 950s.
 

1991
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,270
940s or 950s.
That would be a hell of a move.

1992
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,280

 

1993
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,870

But just remember, yeah, we get very

1994
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:40,880
But just remember, yeah, we get very
 

1995
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,190
But just remember, yeah, we get very
thin

1996
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200

 

1997
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,109

over 780s. So you can call it the whole

1998
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,119
over 780s. So you can call it the whole
 

1999
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,230
over 780s. So you can call it the whole
number 800s, but after 800s, it's very,

2000
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:50,240
number 800s, but after 800s, it's very,
 

2001
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,150
number 800s, but after 800s, it's very,
very thin because if we zoom out,

2002
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
very thin because if we zoom out,
 

2003
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,150
very thin because if we zoom out,
we were straight down and we were also

2004
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
we were straight down and we were also
 

2005
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,670
we were straight down and we were also
straight up. All right. So, this is

2006
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:01,680

 

2007
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,910

no structure up, no structure down

2008
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:05,920
no structure up, no structure down
 

2009
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,790
no structure up, no structure down
through here. Very thin to the next

2010
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:08,800
through here. Very thin to the next
 

2011
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,710
through here. Very thin to the next
point. All right. So, you want to be

2012
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:10,720
point. All right. So, you want to be
 

2013
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:19,349
point. All right. So, you want to be
cognizant of that.

2014
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:19,359

 

2015
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:27,829

Where is it? Lost it all.

2016
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:27,839

always looking for a new leg higher
 

2019
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,390
always looking for a new leg higher
here. If you did, like I said, if you

2020
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:30,400
here. If you did, like I said, if you
 

2021
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,190
here. If you did, like I said, if you
took the bullish move off the RBS or

2022
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,200
took the bullish move off the RBS or
 

2023

it set at the 680, 700, make sure you're

2026
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:38,319
it set at the 680, 700, make sure you're
 

2027
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,309
it set at the 680, 700, make sure you're
paying yourself into this high day and

2028
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
paying yourself into this high day and
 

2029
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,270
paying yourself into this high day and
then hold for this next block up here

2030
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:43,280
then hold for this next block up here
 

2031
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,950
then hold for this next block up here
and then if you get lucky all the way up

2032
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:44,960
and then if you get lucky all the way up
 

2033
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,270
and then if you get lucky all the way up
here. There you go. Here comes the

2034
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:47,280
here. There you go. Here comes the
 

2035
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,589
here. There you go. Here comes the
squeeze. So, squeeze through 68700s.

2036
00:52:51,589 --> 00:52:51,599
squeeze. So, squeeze through 68700s.
 

2037
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,870
squeeze. So, squeeze through 68700s.
Like we said, that's your squeeze level

2038
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:54,880
Like we said, that's your squeeze level
 

2039
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,349
Like we said, that's your squeeze level
cuz that's where bears try to defend. So

2040
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359
cuz that's where bears try to defend. So
 

2041
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,950
cuz that's where bears try to defend. So
once they fail to defend it, they are

2042
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:58,960
once they fail to defend it, they are
 

2043
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:16,150
once they fail to defend it, they are
forced to cover.

2044
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:16,160

 

2045
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,430

Looking good. Looking good here.

2046
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,440
Looking good. Looking good here.

2053
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,309
which will help if it actually is able

2054
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
to do that. Just be careful here. Lots
 

2055
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,190
to do that. Just be careful here. Lots
of buyers coming in this last candle. We

2056
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
of buyers coming in this last candle. We
 

2057
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,349
of buyers coming in this last candle. We
need to complete the rotation.

2058
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:35,359

 

2059
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,750

Some passive selling into 40s, 50s, and

2060
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:37,760
Some passive selling into 40s, 50s, and
 

2061
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:45,190
Some passive selling into 40s, 50s, and
70s here.

2062
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:45,200

 

2063
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,910

Like I said, over this red box. Okay,

2064
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:47,920
Like I said, over this red box. Okay,
 

2065
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,510
Like I said, over this red box. Okay,
we've got the whole number 800, but over

2066
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,520
we've got the whole number 800, but over
 

2067
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,349
we've got the whole number 800, but over
that there is basically 100 point

2068
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:51,359
that there is basically 100 point
 

2069
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,750
that there is basically 100 point
squeeze available if they do not defend

2070
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
squeeze available if they do not defend
 

2071
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,589
squeeze available if they do not defend
here. So if we think about this, if we

2072
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:55,599
here. So if we think about this, if we
 

2073
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,030
here. So if we think about this, if we
were going to do a profile on this,

2074
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,040
were going to do a profile on this,
 

2075
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,870
were going to do a profile on this,
we're basically thick like this and then

2076
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:58,880
we're basically thick like this and then
 

2077
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,549
we're basically thick like this and then
we're thin and then thicken out. All

2078
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:00,559
we're thin and then thicken out. All
 

2079
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,950
we're thin and then thicken out. All
right, so this is thin in here from two

2080
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:02,960
right, so this is thin in here from two
 

2081
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,430
right, so this is thin in here from two
sessions. So bears will want to defend

2082
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
sessions. So bears will want to defend
 

2083
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,589
sessions. So bears will want to defend
this. If they get through this, they can

2084
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:07,599
this. If they get through this, they can
 

2085
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,069
this. If they get through this, they can
repric very very very quickly. It's very

2086
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
repric very very very quickly. It's very
 

2087
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:29,109
repric very very very quickly. It's very
thin that move.

2088
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119

I think he probably get one more little

00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:24,319
I think he probably get one more little
 

2103
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:34,549
I think he probably get one more little
shove up, but we'll see.

2104
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:34,559

 

2105
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,790

2111
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,390

pretty bullish right now. So if you're

2112
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:44,400
pretty bullish right now. So if you're
 

2113
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,109
pretty bullish right now. So if you're
in this long from 780,

2114
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:47,119
in this long from 780,
 

2115
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,230
in this long from 780,
look good. Just make sure you pace

2116
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,240
look good. Just make sure you pace
 

2117
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,069
look good. Just make sure you pace
yourself here because it is a big shelf.

It's red blocking above you

2120
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,040
It's red blocking above you
 

2121
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,750
It's red blocking above you
and they will defend a level at some

2122
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:55,760
and they will defend a level at some
 

2123
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,430
and they will defend a level at some
point whether it's today or tomorrow.

2124
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:57,440
point whether it's today or tomorrow.
 

2125
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,789
point whether it's today or tomorrow.
And it can be very aggressive when

2126
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
And it can be very aggressive when
 

2127
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:36,630
And it can be very aggressive when
they're ready.

2128
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640

 

2129
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,630

lots of balls came in at um

2130
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
lots of balls came in at um
 

2131
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,030
lots of balls came in at um
those 750s. That's going to be a massive

2132
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,040
those 750s. That's going to be a massive
 

2133
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,470
those 750s. That's going to be a massive
level now. And they just got caught on

2134
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:44,480
level now. And they just got caught on
 

2135
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,470
level now. And they just got caught on
that last little push a little bit. See

2136
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
that last little push a little bit. See
 

2137
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,270
that last little push a little bit. See
if they repric it above again. So very

2138
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
if they repric it above again. So very
 

2139
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,950
if they repric it above again. So very
aggressive buying up there. They might

2140
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:50,960
aggressive buying up there. They might
 

2141
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,829
aggressive buying up there. They might
have got themselves a little caught.

2142
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:53,839
have got themselves a little caught.
 

2143
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,069
have got themselves a little caught.
I'd say under 750s is the more

2144
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:56,079
I'd say under 750s is the more
 

2145
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,230
I'd say under 750s is the more
interesting level.

2146
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:58,240
interesting level.
 

2147
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,270
interesting level.
Balls came flying in at 750.

2148
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,280

 

2149
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,950

Here you go. Is the test of it. This is

2150
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,960
Here you go. Is the test of it. This is
 

2151
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,710
Here you go. Is the test of it. This is
where they came flying in.

2152
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720

 

2153
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,030

Big transactions here. This is fast

2154
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,040
Big transactions here. This is fast
 

2155
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,870
Big transactions here. This is fast
moving tape now at this point. Big big

2156
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
moving tape now at this point. Big big
 

2157
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:24,710
moving tape now at this point. Big big
transactions.

2158
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:24,720

 

2159
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:35,270

in balance down to those 720s.

2160
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280

 

2161
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,829

So, sort of holding that sort of 50ish.

2162
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:37,839
So, sort of holding that sort of 50ish.
 

2163
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,910
So, sort of holding that sort of 50ish.
Didn't feel the imbalance.

2164
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:41,920

 

2165
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,349

Haven't quite Well, we have made that

2166
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:43,359
Haven't quite Well, we have made that
 

2167
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,270
Haven't quite Well, we have made that
red box to be fair. We have made it to

2168
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
red box to be fair. We have made it to
 

2169
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,549
red box to be fair. We have made it to
it.

2170
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:48,559

 

2171
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,230

Psychological level would be 800. This

2172
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,240
Psychological level would be 800. This
 

2173
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,990
Psychological level would be 800. This
is the top of the shelf really. 780

2174
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:52,000
is the top of the shelf really. 780
 

2175
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,750
is the top of the shelf really. 780
psychological 800 um through that then a

2176
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:55,760
psychological 800 um through that then a
 

2177
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,630
psychological 800 um through that then a
uh 900 point squeeze can't be a squeeze

2178
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:58,640
uh 900 point squeeze can't be a squeeze
 

2179
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,109
uh 900 point squeeze can't be a squeeze
to 900 can't be ignored at the moment.

2180
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:01,119
to 900 can't be ignored at the moment.
 

2181
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,789
to 900 can't be ignored at the moment.
You're seeing bears trying to defend

2182
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:02,799
You're seeing bears trying to defend
 

2183
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,710
You're seeing bears trying to defend
this top of the shelf. So if we start

2184
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:04,720
this top of the shelf. So if we start
 

2185
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,230
this top of the shelf. So if we start
losing 50s here, there's a bigger sell,

2186
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:08,240
losing 50s here, there's a bigger sell,
 

2187
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,510
losing 50s here, there's a bigger sell,
which is what you're starting to see

2188
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:09,520
which is what you're starting to see
 

2189
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,030
which is what you're starting to see
now.

2190
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
now.
 

2191
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:18,789
now.
That's strong selling just came in.

2192
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:18,799

 

2193
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,750

starting to lose 50s imbalance here down

2194
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:21,760
starting to lose 50s imbalance here down
 

2195
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,230
starting to lose 50s imbalance here down
to the seven sort of tens. So remember

2196
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
to the seven sort of tens. So remember
 

2197
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,950
to the seven sort of tens. So remember
the squeeze happened from 680 to 700. We

2198
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:26,960
the squeeze happened from 680 to 700. We
 

2199
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,390
the squeeze happened from 680 to 700. We
squeeze right the way up to the top of

2200
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
squeeze right the way up to the top of
 

2201
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,309
squeeze right the way up to the top of
this red block which we know is the edge

2202
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:30,319
this red block which we know is the edge
 

2203
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,390
this red block which we know is the edge
of volume and supply based on the

2204
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
of volume and supply based on the
 

2205
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,230
of volume and supply based on the
previous week. We're starting to see

2206
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
previous week. We're starting to see
 

2207
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,309
previous week. We're starting to see
some selling up there. We're just

2208
00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:36,319
some selling up there. We're just
 

2209
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,510

2211
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,270
waiting now. If you're going to play the
reversal, you just need these bulls to

2212
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:39,280
reversal, you just need these bulls to
 

2213
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,349
reversal, you just need these bulls to
get stuck.

2214
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:41,359
get stuck.
 

2215
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,870
get stuck.
You have to know their imbalances on the

2216
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:42,880
You have to know their imbalances on the
 

2217
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,710
You have to know their imbalances on the
way up. has been a bit of a squeeze out

2218

so far this morning, but they have been

2220
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:48,160
so far this morning, but they have been
 

2221
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,150
so far this morning, but they have been
supporting bids. We starting to see some

2222
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
supporting bids. We starting to see some
 

2223
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,829
supporting bids. We starting to see some
more aggressive bears trying to bend

2224
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:51,839
more aggressive bears trying to bend
 

2225
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,109
more aggressive bears trying to bend
here. This is the imbalance right here.

2226
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:55,119
here. This is the imbalance right here.
 

2227
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,950
here. This is the imbalance right here.

2228
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:56,960
720
 

2229
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,630
720
720 down to the teens previous week

2231
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,230
720 down to the teens previous week
point of control. Do they hold a bid

2232
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:02,240
point of control. Do they hold a bid
 

2233
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:14,870
point of control. Do they hold a bid
here or not?

2234
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880

 

2235
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,589

Mag all bullish still pulling back to

2236
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:17,599
Mag all bullish still pulling back to
 

2237
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,390
Mag all bullish still pulling back to
flow zones right now. Big contested

2238
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:20,400
flow zones right now. Big contested
 

2239
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,390
flow zones right now. Big contested
level here.

2240
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:22,400
level here.
 

2241
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,309
level here.
This is the imbalance that we held. They

2242
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:24,319
This is the imbalance that we held. They
 

2243
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:25,670
This is the imbalance that we held. They
sell through this is a bigger wash

2244
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
sell through this is a bigger wash
 

2245
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,150
sell through this is a bigger wash
coming. So we have to see how we act

2246
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:28,160
coming. So we have to see how we act
 

2247
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,069
coming. So we have to see how we act
here.

2248
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
here.
 

2249
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,430
here.
Back to that previous week point

2250
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
Back to that previous week point
 

2251
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,309
Back to that previous week point
control. bulls uh defend that

2252
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:36,319

 

2253
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,230

and maybe they've got bigger ambitions

2254
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:38,240
and maybe they've got bigger ambitions
 

2255
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,630
and maybe they've got bigger ambitions
back to the uh sort of 900s the previous

2256
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:40,640
back to the uh sort of 900s the previous
 

2257
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:48,390
back to the uh sort of 900s the previous
week uh value area high.

2258
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400

 

2259
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,390

See bears want to defend 50s now because

2260
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
See bears want to defend 50s now because
 

2261
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,230
See bears want to defend 50s now because
we traded under 50s. Bulls are stuck

2262
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:52,240
we traded under 50s. Bulls are stuck
 

2263
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,589
we traded under 50s. Bulls are stuck
over 50s

2264
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:55,599

 

2265
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,510

and if they can't defend 50s there is

2266
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:57,520
and if they can't defend 50s there is
 

2267
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,990
and if they can't defend 50s there is
probably a bigger squeeze going going to

2268
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
probably a bigger squeeze going going to
 

2269
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,470
probably a bigger squeeze going going to
come and happen.

2270
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,480

 

2271
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,990

trying to defend it. It's more

2272
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:10,000
trying to defend it. It's more
 

2273
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,990
trying to defend it. It's more
aggressive here.

2274
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,000

 

2275
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,670

Got a small little piece on this just to

2276
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:15,680
Got a small little piece on this just to
 

2277
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,910
Got a small little piece on this just to
see if we fail here

2278
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
see if we fail here
 

2279
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,069
see if we fail here
on that last push up to 50. Already

2280
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:20,079
on that last push up to 50. Already
 

2281
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,069
on that last push up to 50. Already
locking some in. We're holding flow

2282
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:22,079
locking some in. We're holding flow
 

2283
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,190
locking some in. We're holding flow
zones at the moment. I want to be

2284
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:23,200
zones at the moment. I want to be
 

2285
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,789
zones at the moment. I want to be
cognizant of this is previous week point

2286
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:24,799
cognizant of this is previous week point
 

2287
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,589
cognizant of this is previous week point
control and flow zones, but I think this

2288
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
control and flow zones, but I think this
 

2289
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,109
control and flow zones, but I think this
is the area that they wanted to defend.

2290
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:29,119
is the area that they wanted to defend.
 

2291
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,309
is the area that they wanted to defend.
That's the shelf. If they squeeze

2292
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:30,319
That's the shelf. If they squeeze
 

2293
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:31,430
That's the shelf. If they squeeze
through that, then they can come out all

2294
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:31,440
through that, then they can come out all
 

2295
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,190
through that, then they can come out all
the way up here. Again, you might say

2296
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:33,200
the way up here. Again, you might say
 

2297
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,630
the way up here. Again, you might say
I'm playing counter trend. I'm trying to

2298
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:34,640
I'm playing counter trend. I'm trying to
 

2299
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,789
I'm playing counter trend. I'm trying to
time when the multi-time frame alignment

2300
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:36,799
time when the multi-time frame alignment
 

2301
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:41,750
time when the multi-time frame alignment
goes into agreement here.

2302
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:41,760

 

2303
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,270

Nice.

2304
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:43,280
Nice.
 

2305
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,510
Nice.
Down towards these 700s. Blocking some

2306
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520
Down towards these 700s. Blocking some
 

2307
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:51,589
Down towards these 700s. Blocking some
in here. Let's see if we trade 680s now.

2308
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:51,599

 

2309
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,870

Any reclaim of this last level up here?

2310
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,880
Any reclaim of this last level up here?
 

2311
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:05,030
Any reclaim of this last level up here?
42. I will cut.

2312
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040

 

2313
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,910

I felt sorry for the McLarens, man.

2314
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
I felt sorry for the McLarens, man.
 

2315
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,230
I felt sorry for the McLarens, man.
Like, well, especially for Lando. It

2316
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:10,240
Like, well, especially for Lando. It
 

2317
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,270
Like, well, especially for Lando. It
doesn't really affect uh Astria at a

2318
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,280
doesn't really affect uh Astria at a
 

2319
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,270
doesn't really affect uh Astria at a
[\h__\h] race.

2320
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:15,280
[\h__\h] race.
 

2321
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,990
[\h__\h] race.
I mean, blows that title wide open,

2322
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
I mean, blows that title wide open,
 

2323
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,829
I mean, blows that title wide open,
doesn't it?

2324
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:23,839

 

2325
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,990

So, if they hold 700s, I'm not

2326
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,000
So, if they hold 700s, I'm not
 

2327
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,510
So, if they hold 700s, I'm not
interested.

2328
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
interested.
 

2329
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,349
interested.
I want to see a wash to 80s to get any

2330
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:29,359
I want to see a wash to 80s to get any
 

2331
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,990
I want to see a wash to 80s to get any
more size off. Want to be careful here

2332
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,000
more size off. Want to be careful here
 

2333
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,109
more size off. Want to be careful here
because they keep trying to sell the

2334
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:33,119
because they keep trying to sell the
 

2335
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,990
because they keep trying to sell the
lows. So, I'm going to trim a bit more

2336
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:36,000
lows. So, I'm going to trim a bit more
 

2337
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,750
lows. So, I'm going to trim a bit more
here just from what I'm seeing on the

2338
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
here just from what I'm seeing on the
 

2339
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,710
here just from what I'm seeing on the
tape. Keep trying to sell 700 and not

2340
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:40,720
tape. Keep trying to sell 700 and not
 

2341
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,109
tape. Keep trying to sell 700 and not
selling through it. I want to see a wash

2342
01:01:43,109 --> 01:01:43,119
selling through it. I want to see a wash
 

2343
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,510
selling through it. I want to see a wash
down. Here we go. Come on. Can we wash

2344
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:45,520
down. Here we go. Come on. Can we wash
 

2345
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,470
down. Here we go. Come on. Can we wash
through it? They're trying to sell it

2346
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:46,480
through it? They're trying to sell it
 

2347
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,230
through it? They're trying to sell it
again. There we go. Fantastic. Right,

2348
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
again. There we go. Fantastic. Right,
 

2349
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,829
again. There we go. Fantastic. Right,
there's the 80s. It's locking some more

2350
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:49,839
there's the 80s. It's locking some more
 

2351
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,710
there's the 80s. It's locking some more
in here. I'm watching this shelf now

2352
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720
in here. I'm watching this shelf now
 

2353
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,829
in here. I'm watching this shelf now
into 60s.

2354
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:55,839
into 60s.
 

2355
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,030
into 60s.
Beautiful. Cognizant of New York VW up

2356
01:01:59,030 --> 01:01:59,040
Beautiful. Cognizant of New York VW up
 

2357

Beautiful. Cognizant of New York VW up
and point of control. And if we get

2358
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
and point of control. And if we get
 

2359
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,430
and point of control. And if we get
lucky, we come down here. But we're

2360
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:01,440
lucky, we come down here. But we're
 

2361
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,589
lucky, we come down here. But we're
locking some more in here. Again, just

2362
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
locking some more in here. Again, just
 

2363
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,950
locking some more in here. Again, just
playing the tape when it happens in

2364
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:04,960
playing the tape when it happens in
 

2365
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,109
playing the tape when it happens in
front of us at key levels when we see

2366
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:07,119
front of us at key levels when we see
 

2367
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,190
front of us at key levels when we see
participants get trapped. Trying to time

2368
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:09,200
participants get trapped. Trying to time
 

2369
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,870
participants get trapped. Trying to time
that higher time frame, lower time frame

2370
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:10,880
that higher time frame, lower time frame
 

2371
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:20,630
that higher time frame, lower time frame
alignment. Really nice. Beautiful.

2372
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:20,640

 

2373
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,190

Remember 68700 was the squeeze point. We

2374
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:23,200
Remember 68700 was the squeeze point. We
 

2375
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,990
Remember 68700 was the squeeze point. We
repriced that.

2376
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,000
repriced that.
 

2377
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,430
repriced that.
Don't want to see them hold bids here. I

2378
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:27,440
Don't want to see them hold bids here. I
 

2379
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,710
Don't want to see them hold bids here. I
just want straight flushes. If we're

2380
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:28,720
just want straight flushes. If we're
 

2381
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,470
just want straight flushes. If we're
going to see weakness now, it it's going

2382
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,480
going to see weakness now, it it's going
 

2383
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,109
going to see weakness now, it it's going
to have to happen here. Otherwise, it's

2384
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
to have to happen here. Otherwise, it's
 

2385
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,789
to have to happen here. Otherwise, it's
just a scout back down for them to bid

2386
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:34,799
just a scout back down for them to bid
 

2387
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:45,910
just a scout back down for them to bid
off,

2388
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:45,920

 

2389
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,109

which it might be. Going to watch

2390
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:47,119
which it might be. Going to watch
 

2391
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,309
which it might be. Going to watch
previous week point of control.

2392
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
previous week point of control.
 

2393
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,829
previous week point of control.
Basically, use that as my risk at the

2394
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:49,839
Basically, use that as my risk at the
 

2395
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,390
Basically, use that as my risk at the
moment. See if we get a big old wash

2396
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:52,400
moment. See if we get a big old wash
 

2397
01:02:52,400 --> 01:03:07,589
moment. See if we get a big old wash
here.

2398
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:07,599

 

2399
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:14,150

nice. We can trade to 30s and the teens

2400
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,160
nice. We can trade to 30s and the teens
 

2401
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,510
nice. We can trade to 30s and the teens
if they're going to if they're going to

01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:15,520
if they're going to if they're going to
 

2403
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,349
if they're going to if they're going to
stay heavy. 30s and teens would be my

2404
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:17,359
stay heavy. 30s and teens would be my
 

2405
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:21,349
stay heavy. 30s and teens would be my
next cover point.

2406

this off. Basically tap me. Uh it's
 

2417
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,230

slightly different on Ninja Trader. So

2418
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:34,240
slightly different on Ninja Trader. So
 

2419
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,390
slightly different on Ninja Trader. So
that's why. And I'm out. Out on a

2424
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:42,880
trade. So that 50's rejection and we got
 

2425
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,710
trade. So that 50's rejection and we got
as low as we've almost got another 100

01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
as low as we've almost got another 100
 

2427
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,270
as low as we've almost got another 100
points there. It's not bad.

2428
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
points there. It's not bad.
 

2429
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:58,069
points there. It's not bad.
Scalping away.

2431
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,990

No worries, Kevin. Yeah, it's just a see

Yes, I am taking technically counter

01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,950
Yes, I am taking technically counter
trend on the day, but I'm trying. I

01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
trend on the day, but I'm trying. I
 

2443
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,829
trend on the day, but I'm trying. I
don't want to really be long

2444
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:11,839
don't want to really be long
 

2445
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:14,950
don't want to really be long
when we're uh where we are based on the

01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:14,960
when we're uh where we are based on the
 

2447
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,230
when we're uh where we are based on the
previous week's value and trading

previous week's value and trading
 

2449
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,390
previous week's value and trading
upside. Uh the long here was probably

2450
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:18,400
upside. Uh the long here was probably
 

2451
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,829
upside. Uh the long here was probably
good. Maybe I should have flipped and

2452
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:19,839
good. Maybe I should have flipped and
 

2453
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,510
good. Maybe I should have flipped and
took that long up and then resold that.

2454
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
took that long up and then resold that.
 

2455
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,390
took that long up and then resold that.
But don't really have the capacity this

2456
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,400
But don't really have the capacity this
 

2457
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,510
But don't really have the capacity this
morning to be uh taking too many trades.

2458
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:27,520
morning to be uh taking too many trades.
 

2459

morning to be uh taking too many trades.
So two for two now.

2460
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,440

 

2461
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,270

So reclaiming that point of control,

2462
01:04:59,270 --> 01:04:59,280
So reclaiming that point of control,
 

2463
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,549
So reclaiming that point of control,
testing value on the day.

2464
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:02,559
testing value on the day.
 

2465
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,230
testing value on the day.
Do they want to go higher? Have they got

2466
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
Do they want to go higher? Have they got
 

2467
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,069
Do they want to go higher? Have they got
ambitions for 800? And if they break

2471
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,029
800, 900.
As the rotation continues, they're still

2472
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:11,039
As the rotation continues, they're still
 

2473
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,710
As the rotation continues, they're still
bidding us up. Just a slow drift up

2474
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,720
bidding us up. Just a slow drift up
 

2475
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,710
bidding us up. Just a slow drift up
today. Really no follow through from

bears. Balls are in total control. You
 

2479
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,630
bears. Balls are in total control. You
can see they pinned V up again,

2480
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:18,640
can see they pinned V up again,
 

2481
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,750
can see they pinned V up again,
reclaiming key levels.

2482
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:21,760
reclaiming key levels.
 

2483
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,349
reclaiming key levels.

2759
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,950
selling on the tape here. It's the first
time today I'd say there'd been a bit

2760
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:26,960
time today I'd say there'd been a bit
 

2761
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,830
time today I'd say there'd been a bit
more strong selling on the tape here. Be

2762
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:29,840
more strong selling on the tape here. Be

2765
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,510

Watching this to see how we now. Much

2766
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
Watching this to see how we now. Much
 

2767
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,189
Watching this to see how we now. Much
stronger selling coming in here under

2768
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:37,199
stronger selling coming in here under
 

2769
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,030
stronger selling coming in here under
700.

2770
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
700.
 

2771
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,470
700.
There's an imbalance here.

2772
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:42,480
There's an imbalance here.
 

2773
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,030
There's an imbalance here.
So, watching

2774
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
So, watching
 

2775
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,870
So, watching
much stronger selling. They're being way

2776
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
much stronger selling. They're being way
 

2777
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,709
much stronger selling. They're being way
more aggressive now on the tape. So,

2778
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
more aggressive now on the tape. So,
 

2779
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,149
more aggressive now on the tape. So,
let's see if there's a buyer trying to

2780
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:50,159
let's see if there's a buyer trying to
 

2781
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,310
let's see if there's a buyer trying to
soak or if this just gives back and

2782
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:52,320
soak or if this just gives back and
 

2783
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,990
soak or if this just gives back and
collapses. You'd be watching that VWAP

2784
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
collapses. You'd be watching that VWAP
 

2785
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,110
collapses. You'd be watching that VWAP
again.

2797
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,990

What is an internal high or low? Like

2798
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,000
What is an internal high or low? Like
 

2799
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,110
What is an internal high or low? Like
this would be an internal high.

2800
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
this would be an internal high.
 

2801
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,709
this would be an internal high.
Yeah, because your swing points on the

01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:28,719
Yeah, because your swing points on the
 

2803
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,630
Yeah, because your swing points on the

that has been defended into this edge of
 

2839
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,030

2889
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,189

What time frame do I use primarily for

2890
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:25,199
What time frame do I use primarily for
 

2891
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:32,470
What time frame do I use primarily for
executions like one or five minute?

2892
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:32,480

 

2893
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,669

I'm watching order flow um every like

I'm watching order flow um every like
 

2895
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:37,750
I'm watching order flow um every like
every tick, every second, right? So,

2896
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:37,760
every tick, every second, right? So,
 

2897
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,990
every tick, every second, right? So,
what I care about is where we're coming

2898
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:40,000
what I care about is where we're coming
 

2899
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,910
what I care about is where we're coming
into key levels on like an hourly or a

2900
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:41,920
into key levels on like an hourly or a
 

2901
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,709
into key levels on like an hourly or a
daily or a weekly and then I'm focused

2902
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
daily or a weekly and then I'm focused
 

2903
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,390
daily or a weekly and then I'm focused
in once look like like look at these

2904
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:46,400
in once look like like look at these
 

2905
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,750
in once look like like look at these
levels. These have been up here all

2906
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,760
levels. These have been up here all
 

2907
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,750
levels. These have been up here all
morning. I'm focused in once we get up

2908
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:49,760
morning. I'm focused in once we get up
 

2909
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,510
morning. I'm focused in once we get up
there, how do we act? What happens to

2910
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:51,520
there, how do we act? What happens to
 

2911
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,630
there, how do we act? What happens to
the order flow? Right? Same as we took

2912
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:54,640
the order flow? Right? Same as we took
 

2913
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,070
the order flow? Right? Same as we took
this short here. Once we got up there

2914
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:56,080
this short here. Once we got up there
 

2915
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,430
this short here. Once we got up there
into previous week's point of control,

2916
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:57,440
into previous week's point of control,
 

2917
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,350
into previous week's point of control,
how do we act? Then I'll take a

2918
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,360
how do we act? Then I'll take a
 

2919
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,750
how do we act? Then I'll take a
position. Then I'm zoomed in into like a

2920
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:01,760
position. Then I'm zoomed in into like a
 

2921
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,510
position. Then I'm zoomed in into like a
one minute or watching tick by tick. But

2922
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:05,520
one minute or watching tick by tick. But
 

2923
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,750
one minute or watching tick by tick. But
in between, I just try and relax and

2924
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:07,760
in between, I just try and relax and
 

2925
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,350
in between, I just try and relax and
give my eyes a break and let it do

2926
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
give my eyes a break and let it do
 

2927
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,709
give my eyes a break and let it do
whatever it is it wants to do. When

2928
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:10,719
whatever it is it wants to do. When
 

2929
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,470
whatever it is it wants to do. When
we're not at a level, I don't really

2930
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
we're not at a level, I don't really
 

2931
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,070
we're not at a level, I don't really
care because then you're just trading no

2932
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,080
care because then you're just trading no
 

2933
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,149
care because then you're just trading no
man's land. When we're at a level, how

2934
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
man's land. When we're at a level, how
 

2935
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,990
man's land. When we're at a level, how
we act becomes important. Then I'm

2936
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
we act becomes important. Then I'm
 

2937
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,870
we act becomes important. Then I'm
zoomed in. But people get confused with

2938
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:20,880
zoomed in. But people get confused with
 

2939
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,310
zoomed in. But people get confused with
that. They watch the one minute all the

2940
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
that. They watch the one minute all the
 

2941
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,910
that. They watch the one minute all the
time. like you will get exhausted if

Set price alert for a key level, let it

01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,000
Set price alert for a key level, let it
 

2951

Set price alert for a key level, let it
get to the key level, come to your

get to the key level, come to your
computer, then dial in and watch it.

2954
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:41,920

 

2955
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,590

Oh my god, man. My right ear.

Oh my god, man. My right ear.
 

2957
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,270
Oh my god, man. My right ear.
This is the one I'm partially deaf in

2958
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:47,280
This is the one I'm partially deaf in
 

2959
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:53,270
This is the one I'm partially deaf in
from DJing, but it really really hurts.

2960
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280

 

2961
01:19:53,280 --> 01:20:00,229

Every time I get an infection, it kills.

2962
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239

 

2963
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,070

I just want all the stuff to come out.
It's just all stuck in here and

01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,600
It's just all stuck in here and
 

2967
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,110
It's just all stuck in here and
nothing's coming out. It's the worst

2968
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:05,120
nothing's coming out. It's the worst
 

2969
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:11,270
nothing's coming out. It's the worst
feeling.

you got passive sellers up here sat on
 

2983

2985
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,590

I was looking to complete a squeeze by

I was looking to complete a squeeze by
 

2987
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,870
I was looking to complete a squeeze by
the looks of it to trade to the edge of

01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:34,880
the looks of it to trade to the edge of
 

2989
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,790
the looks of it to trade to the edge of
this volume. Remember after that 800

They are still holding it up. This guy
 

3019

at 700 is soaking this tape so far this
morning. He might maybe he's got an

3022
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:12,800
morning. He might maybe he's got an
 

3023
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,550
morning. He might maybe he's got an
ambition of where he needs to get it to.

3024
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
ambition of where he needs to get it to.
 

3025

3027
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,910
We We don't know, do we? We He can do
whatever he wants to do. I'd say once he

3028
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:19,920
whatever he wants to do. I'd say once he
 

3029
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,750
whatever he wants to do. I'd say once he
gets out the way it might get a little

3030
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
gets out the way it might get a little
 

3031
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,510
gets out the way it might get a little
bit nasty because he has been here all

3032
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:23,520
bit nasty because he has been here all
 

3033
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:29,030
bit nasty because he has been here all
day.

3034

3035
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,630

Sorry, I know I'm pulling weird faces,

3036
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:30,640
Sorry, I know I'm pulling weird faces,
 

3037
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,590
Sorry, I know I'm pulling weird faces,
but I cannot explain the pressure in my

3038
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:33,600
but I cannot explain the pressure in my
 

3039
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,229
but I cannot explain the pressure in my
ears right now. Should not be sat here

3040
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
ears right now. Should not be sat here
 

3041
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:43,350
ears right now. Should not be sat here
really.

3042
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:43,360

 

3043
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,189

Our trend is bullish. Uh, not for me.

3044
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:47,199
Our trend is bullish. Uh, not for me.
 

3045
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,750
Our trend is bullish. Uh, not for me.
Not for me. It's just a repric. I I

3046
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:49,760
Not for me. It's just a repric. I I
 

3047
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,590
Not for me. It's just a repric. I I
would say your swing, if you look at

3048
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
would say your swing, if you look at
 

3049
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,470
would say your swing, if you look at
your swing high for me, the hourly does

3050
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480
your swing high for me, the hourly does
 

3051
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:59,750
your swing high for me, the hourly does
not change until we get above 25,300.

3052
01:21:59,750 --> 01:21:59,760

 

3053
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,910

Yeah. So, we're in a repric level here.

3054
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:01,920
Yeah. So, we're in a repric level here.
 

3055
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,950
Yeah. So, we're in a repric level here.
Let me show you. Uh

3056
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:04,960
Let me show you. Uh
 

3057
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,629
Let me show you. Uh
if we think about legs, you got to think

3058
01:22:06,629 --> 01:22:06,639
if we think about legs, you got to think
 

3059
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:07,750
if we think about legs, you got to think
about legs. Someone asked about

3060
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:07,760
about legs. Someone asked about
 

3061
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,430
about legs. Someone asked about
internals and externals earlier. This is

3062
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:09,440
internals and externals earlier. This is
 

3063
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,229
internals and externals earlier. This is
a good way to to look at it, right?

3064
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239
a good way to to look at it, right?
 

3065
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,990
a good way to to look at it, right?
This was the liquidity built out and

3066
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
This was the liquidity built out and
 

3067
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,149
This was the liquidity built out and
then we fail. Okay. Swing low. Swing

3068
01:22:18,149 --> 01:22:18,159
then we fail. Okay. Swing low. Swing
 

3069
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:22,629
then we fail. Okay. Swing low. Swing
high. Swing low. Swing high. Swing low.

3070
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:22,639
high. Swing low. Swing high. Swing low.
 

3071
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,830
high. Swing low. Swing high. Swing low.
Swing high. Swing low. Swing high. Swing

3072
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:25,840
Swing high. Swing low. Swing high. Swing
 

3073
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,470
Swing high. Swing low. Swing high. Swing
low. Okay. Where are we bullish above?

3074
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:28,480
low. Okay. Where are we bullish above?
 

3075
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,910
low. Okay. Where are we bullish above?
We're not bullish until we take out the

3076
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:29,920
We're not bullish until we take out the
 

3077
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,910
We're not bullish until we take out the
swing high.

3078
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:31,920
swing high.
 

3079
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,510
swing high.
Right. We're not technically bullish on

3080
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:33,520
Right. We're not technically bullish on
 

3081
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,870
Right. We're not technically bullish on
the hourly until we take out a swing

3082
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880
the hourly until we take out a swing
 

3083
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,030
the hourly until we take out a swing
high. Yes, we've created liquidity here.

3084
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:37,040
high. Yes, we've created liquidity here.
 

3085
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,870
high. Yes, we've created liquidity here.
Yes, this is two leg moving higher, but

3086
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
Yes, this is two leg moving higher, but
 

3087
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,990
Yes, this is two leg moving higher, but
this is your counter trend leg which is

3088
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
this is your counter trend leg which is
 

3089
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,470
this is your counter trend leg which is
liable to be sold into to make a new

3090
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:44,480
liable to be sold into to make a new
 

3091
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,030
liable to be sold into to make a new
low. The hourly shifts bullish when we

3092
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:47,040
low. The hourly shifts bullish when we
 

3093
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,590
low. The hourly shifts bullish when we
print above this, right? When we take

3094
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:49,600
print above this, right? When we take
 

3095
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,189
print above this, right? When we take
that out and we shift to bullish

3096
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:51,199
that out and we shift to bullish
 

3097
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:55,189
that out and we shift to bullish
structure. That make sense?

3098
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:55,199

 

3099
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,629

And you make it really simple. There's

3100
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:56,639
And you make it really simple. There's
 

3101
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,030
And you make it really simple. There's
your downtrend. We're in a channel,

3102
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,040
your downtrend. We're in a channel,
 

3103
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,470
your downtrend. We're in a channel,
right? We're printing up for this

3104
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:00,480
right? We're printing up for this
 

3105
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,669
right? We're printing up for this
channel. We're probably going to get

3106
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:01,679
channel. We're probably going to get
 

3107
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:05,270
channel. We're probably going to get
sold into at some point.

3108
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
sold into at some point.
 

3109
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,629
sold into at some point.
So, you have to understand the swing

3110
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:06,639
So, you have to understand the swing
 

3111
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:14,149
So, you have to understand the swing

Who was it that asked that? Peter, does
 

3115
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,070
Who was it that asked that? Peter, does
that make sense to you, Peter? I can

01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,080
that make sense to you, Peter? I can
 

3117
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,070
that make sense to you, Peter? I can

draw it out for you if you want like in
a simplified terms. It's really

3120
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:22,639
a simplified terms. It's really
 

3121
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:23,830
a simplified terms. It's really
important that you understand that

3122
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:23,840
important that you understand that
 

3123
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:42,629
important that you understand that
though. A lot of traders get that wrong.

3124
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:42,639

 

3125
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,030

They're

They're
trying to squeeze this. They are

attempting to squeeze this. There's a
passive seller up here at 60s and then

01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:50,239
passive seller up here at 60s and then
 

3133
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,470
passive seller up here at 60s and then
800s. All clear. Yeah, no worries. Yeah.

as you get it, mate. Really important
you understand that.

3140
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
you understand that.
 

3141
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,790
you understand that.
Guys, I'm going to be honest. I don't

3142
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
Guys, I'm going to be honest. I don't
 

3143
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,310
Guys, I'm going to be honest. I don't
know how much more I've got in me here.

3144
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:00,320
know how much more I've got in me here.
 

3145
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,310
know how much more I've got in me here.
I'm starting to um sort of sweat and

3146
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:02,320
I'm starting to um sort of sweat and
 

3147
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,470
I'm starting to um sort of sweat and
shiver a bit. So, I'll do my best to

3148
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,480
shiver a bit. So, I'll do my best to
 

3149
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,310
shiver a bit. So, I'll do my best to
stay here. I don't think I'm going to

3150
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:06,320
stay here. I don't think I'm going to
 

3151
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,350
stay here. I don't think I'm going to
make it to lunch. If the sooner I get

3152
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,360
make it to lunch. If the sooner I get
 

3153
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,709
make it to lunch. If the sooner I get
off, the sooner I'm going to get better.

3154
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:10,719
off, the sooner I'm going to get better.
 

3155
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:13,510
off, the sooner I'm going to get better.
I'm really sorry. I thought yesterday I

3156
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:13,520
I'm really sorry. I thought yesterday I
 

3157
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,070
I'm really sorry. I thought yesterday I
was going to be absolutely fine today. I

3158
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
was going to be absolutely fine today. I
 

3159
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,550
was going to be absolutely fine today. I
couldn't believe that slept like I did

3160
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:18,560
couldn't believe that slept like I did
 

3161
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,310
couldn't believe that slept like I did
and woke up feeling so crap. But I will

3162
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:20,320
and woke up feeling so crap. But I will
 

3163
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,669
and woke up feeling so crap. But I will
do my best to stay here as long as

3164
01:24:21,669 --> 01:24:21,679
do my best to stay here as long as
 

3165
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:26,709
do my best to stay here as long as
possible.

3166
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:26,719

 

3167
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,149

Let's look at that fib as well from

3168
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:30,159
Let's look at that fib as well from
 

3169
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:33,350
Let's look at that fib as well from
wherever that was it Thursday cell

3170
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:33,360
wherever that was it Thursday cell
 

3171
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:37,110
wherever that was it Thursday cell
bull trap high down to the low

3172
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,120
bull trap high down to the low
 

3173
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,669
bull trap high down to the low
and we're coming right into 785 is the

3174
01:24:39,669 --> 01:24:39,679
and we're coming right into 785 is the
 

3175
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,350
and we're coming right into 785 is the
start of the golden zone fib. So if you

3176
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
start of the golden zone fib. So if you
 

3177
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,030
start of the golden zone fib. So if you
go from that high on Thursday down to

3178
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:43,040
go from that high on Thursday down to
 

3179
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,550
go from that high on Thursday down to
the low on Friday we have traced

3180
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
the low on Friday we have traced
 

3181
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,110
the low on Friday we have traced
retraced now 61%. This is a golden zone

3182
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:47,120
retraced now 61%. This is a golden zone
 

3183
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:51,430
retraced now 61%. This is a golden zone
fib, right? So the fib starts here.

3184
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:51,440
fib, right? So the fib starts here.
 

3185
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,950
fib, right? So the fib starts here.
It's why I don't want to be bullish.

3186
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:52,960
It's why I don't want to be bullish.
 

3187
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,030
It's why I don't want to be bullish.
It's not a good location to be bullish,

3188
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,040
It's not a good location to be bullish,
 

3189
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,350
It's not a good location to be bullish,
unfortunately.

3190
01:24:59,350 --> 01:24:59,360

 

3191
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,350

I know we're squeezing higher like not

3192
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:01,360
I know we're squeezing higher like not
 

3193
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,310
I know we're squeezing higher like not
going to fight it.

3194
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:04,320
going to fight it.
 

3195
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:12,229
going to fight it.
Location not great.

3196
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:12,239

 

3197
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:21,110

Doing my best here.

3198
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:21,120

 

3199
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,470

You're looking for a sale, Kevin. Yeah,

3200
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
You're looking for a sale, Kevin. Yeah,
 

3201
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,149
You're looking for a sale, Kevin. Yeah,
it's not a bad area, but there's still

3202
01:25:24,149 --> 01:25:24,159
it's not a bad area, but there's still
 

3203
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:25,669
it's not a bad area, but there's still
bulls are still coming in here at the

3204
01:25:25,669 --> 01:25:25,679
bulls are still coming in here at the
 

3205
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,910
bulls are still coming in here at the
moment. You need to wait for an exchange

3206
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:27,920
moment. You need to wait for an exchange
 

3207
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,669
moment. You need to wait for an exchange
and bulls to get trapped in some form of

3208
01:25:29,669 --> 01:25:29,679
and bulls to get trapped in some form of
 

3209
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,910
and bulls to get trapped in some form of
displacement. It might come soon. That's

3210
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:31,920
displacement. It might come soon. That's
 

3211
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:46,070
displacement. It might come soon. That's
what I'd be waiting for if I was you.

3212
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080

 

3213
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,870

Exactly. Wait. Exactly. Wait for the

01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
Exactly. Wait. Exactly. Wait for the
 

3215
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,390
Exactly. Wait. Exactly. Wait for the
direction confirmation. Wait for a buyer

3216
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:50,400
direction confirmation. Wait for a buyer
 

3217
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,750
direction confirmation. Wait for a buyer
to get trapped. like a little blowout

3218
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:51,760
to get trapped. like a little blowout
 

3219
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,470
to get trapped. like a little blowout
top or an exchange where we leave a key

3220
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,480
top or an exchange where we leave a key
 

3221
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,149
top or an exchange where we leave a key
level. Otherwise, you're just fighting

3222
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:56,159
level. Otherwise, you're just fighting
 

3223
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,390
level. Otherwise, you're just fighting
it so far today.

3224
01:25:58,390 --> 01:25:58,400
it so far today.
 

3225
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,910
it so far today.
You know, bulls are in control, aren't

3226
01:25:59,910 --> 01:25:59,920
You know, bulls are in control, aren't
 

3227
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,189
You know, bulls are in control, aren't
they? All right. So, if you bought that

3228
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,199
they? All right. So, if you bought that
 

3229
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,709
they? All right. So, if you bought that
RBS, you're in control. If you bought

3230
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:02,719
RBS, you're in control. If you bought
 

3231
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:04,950
RBS, you're in control. If you bought
this RBS, you're in control, right?

3232
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:04,960
this RBS, you're in control, right?
 

3233
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,189
this RBS, you're in control, right?
We're in higher prices here. So, if you

3234
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
We're in higher prices here. So, if you
 

3235
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,510
We're in higher prices here. So, if you
don't mind joining momentum longs, they

3236
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:09,520
don't mind joining momentum longs, they
 

3237
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,870
don't mind joining momentum longs, they
are playing for you. Flow zones are

3238
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:10,880
are playing for you. Flow zones are
 

3239
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,629
are playing for you. Flow zones are
holding. We haven't seen a blowoff and a

3240
01:26:12,629 --> 01:26:12,639
holding. We haven't seen a blowoff and a
 

3241
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,310
holding. We haven't seen a blowoff and a
let go of volume. We might not see it.

3242
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:14,320
let go of volume. We might not see it.
 

3243
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,790
let go of volume. We might not see it.
Might might not come today. We're in a

3244
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:16,800
Might might not come today. We're in a
 

3245
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,790
Might might not come today. We're in a
no news day. No news days often just

3246
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:18,800
no news day. No news days often just
 

3247
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,750
no news day. No news days often just
drift higher. They often often drift

3248
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:21,760
drift higher. They often often drift
 

3249
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:31,750
drift higher. They often often drift
higher is uh very possible.

3250
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:31,760

 

3251
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,590

800 looks like a sort of target here.

3252
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
800 looks like a sort of target here.
 

3253
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,350
800 looks like a sort of target here.
But like we talked about, it's thin.

3254
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:35,360
But like we talked about, it's thin.
 

3255
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,990
But like we talked about, it's thin.
After this on a weekly, it's very thin.

3256
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:38,000
After this on a weekly, it's very thin.
 

3257
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,750
After this on a weekly, it's very thin.
Previous week value area is basically

3258
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,760
Previous week value area is basically
 

3259
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,750
Previous week value area is basically
930s,

3260
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:41,760
930s,
 

3261
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,709
930s,
940s, but actually we don't really get

3262
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:44,719
940s, but actually we don't really get
 

3263
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:47,669
940s, but actually we don't really get
thicker until we approach those 25,000.

3264
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:47,679
thicker until we approach those 25,000.
 

3265
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:49,350
thicker until we approach those 25,000.
So, you want to be careful if we get

3266
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:49,360
So, you want to be careful if we get
 

3267
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,430
So, you want to be careful if we get
through here that if they really want to

3268
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:51,440
through here that if they really want to
 

3269
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,030
through here that if they really want to
squeeze this, they'll squeeze straight

3270
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:53,040
squeeze this, they'll squeeze straight
 

3271
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,310
squeeze this, they'll squeeze straight
upside, which would be a nasty move.

3272
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:56,320
upside, which would be a nasty move.
 

3273
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,870
upside, which would be a nasty move.
Basically, repricing Thursday very

3274
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:58,880
Basically, repricing Thursday very
 

3275
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,070
Basically, repricing Thursday very
quickly.

3276
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080

 

3277
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:06,390

Big transactions happening here.

3278
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:06,400

 

3279
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,070

Big market orders. So, it's probably

3280
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,080
Big market orders. So, it's probably
 

3281
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,750
Big market orders. So, it's probably
shorts getting stopped out here. So, I'd

3282
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:09,760
shorts getting stopped out here. So, I'd
 

3283
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,430
shorts getting stopped out here. So, I'd
say the top might come soon if this uh

3284
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:13,440
say the top might come soon if this uh
 

3285
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:17,189
say the top might come soon if this uh
gives that look above and fail. Okay.

3286
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
gives that look above and fail. Okay.
 

3287
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,669
gives that look above and fail. Okay.
Lots of guys got popped there. Lots and

3288
01:27:19,669 --> 01:27:19,679
Lots of guys got popped there. Lots and
 

3289
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,510
Lots of guys got popped there. Lots and
lots and lots of guys. And see what they

3290
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:21,520
lots and lots of guys. And see what they
 

3291
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,070
lots and lots of guys. And see what they
do, how they react. We watching, you can

3292
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:24,080
do, how they react. We watching, you can
 

3293
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,510
do, how they react. We watching, you can
watch initial balance. It's still got

3294
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,520
watch initial balance. It's still got
 

3295
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,110
watch initial balance. It's still got
more juice in it potentially, but I'd

3296
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,120
more juice in it potentially, but I'd
 

3297
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,470
more juice in it potentially, but I'd
just be uh very cautious because we're

3298
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:30,480
just be uh very cautious because we're
 

3299
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,149
just be uh very cautious because we're
at that shelf that I've been talking

3300
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:32,159
at that shelf that I've been talking
 

3301
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,990
at that shelf that I've been talking
about all day. The top of that red box

3302
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:34,000
about all day. The top of that red box
 

3303
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,750
about all day. The top of that red box
is the edge of that shelf. And you saw a

3304
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:35,760
is the edge of that shelf. And you saw a
 

3305
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,910
is the edge of that shelf. And you saw a
lot of market buyers coming in trying to

3306
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:37,920
lot of market buyers coming in trying to
 

3307
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,629
lot of market buyers coming in trying to
buy outside of initial balance. If it is

3308
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
buy outside of initial balance. If it is
 

3309
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,110
buy outside of initial balance. If it is
a massive big if, if they fail here,

3310
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:43,120
a massive big if, if they fail here,
 

3311
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,070
a massive big if, if they fail here,
there's that rotation back down. if if

3312
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
there's that rotation back down. if if
 

3313
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,669
there's that rotation back down. if if
they do the look above and fail. So far,

3314
01:27:47,669 --> 01:27:47,679
they do the look above and fail. So far,
 

3315
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,149
they do the look above and fail. So far,
they're holding bids and they've got 800

3316
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
they're holding bids and they've got 800
 

3317
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,430
they're holding bids and they've got 800
to aim for and then above that

3318
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:53,440
to aim for and then above that
 

3319
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,189
to aim for and then above that
925,000. But that would be um a hell of

3320
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:57,199
925,000. But that would be um a hell of
 

3321
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:02,550
925,000. But that would be um a hell of
an impressive move. I'll be honest.

3322
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:02,560

 

3323
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,149

So far, looks like a bit of a look above

3324
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:04,159
So far, looks like a bit of a look above
 

3325
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:10,629
So far, looks like a bit of a look above
and fail with buyers caught up there.

3326
01:28:10,629 --> 01:28:10,639

 

3327
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,669

Definitely seeing some selling here.

3328
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:13,679
Definitely seeing some selling here.
 

3329
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:16,790
Definitely seeing some selling here.
Yep. Look above and fail so far by the

Yep. Look above and fail so far by the
 

3331
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,510
Yep. Look above and fail so far by the
looks of it. Small short position is

3332
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:19,520
looks of it. Small short position is
 

3333
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,189
looks of it. Small short position is
what I'm looking to take here. If I can

3334
01:28:21,189 --> 01:28:21,199
what I'm looking to take here. If I can
 

3335
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:24,870
what I'm looking to take here. If I can
see an entry model that I like.

3336
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:24,880
see an entry model that I like.

3339
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:33,270

So, big buying came in 760s

3340
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,280
So, big buying came in 760s
 

3341
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,149
So, big buying came in 760s
and 770s.

3342

and 770s.
 

3343
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,149
and 770s.
Do we displace away from that? Do we

3344
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:38,159
Do we displace away from that? Do we
 

3345
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:39,590
Do we displace away from that? Do we
leave them trapped and displace away

3346
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:39,600
leave them trapped and displace away
 

3347
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,189
leave them trapped and displace away
from it or do we just hold? If there's

3348
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:41,199
from it or do we just hold? If there's
 

3349
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,629
from it or do we just hold? If there's
still a buyer on the tape, you can't do

3350
01:28:42,629 --> 01:28:42,639
still a buyer on the tape, you can't do
 

3351
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,629
still a buyer on the tape, you can't do
anything. But there's been a buy at tape

3352
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:44,639
anything. But there's been a buy at tape
 

3353

anything. But there's been a buy at tape
all morning at 700s.

3354

3355
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,790

There's the flush. I need an entry if

3356
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
There's the flush. I need an entry if
 

3357
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,310
There's the flush. I need an entry if
I'm going to get this. Don't want to

3358
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,320
I'm going to get this. Don't want to
 

3359
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,870

Can't see an entry model here. Lots of
sellers coming in there and they're not

01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
sellers coming in there and they're not
 

3365
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,950
sellers coming in there and they're not
moving lower. So, there's a passive buy

3366
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:00,960
moving lower. So, there's a passive buy
 

3367

Still soaking. Still absorbing.

3375
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:13,590

And this level here is where they would

3376
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:13,600
And this level here is where they would
 

3377
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:21,030
And this level here is where they would
need to reject.

3378
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:21,040

 

3379
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,629

Not really liking what I'm seeing here

Not really liking what I'm seeing here

Not really liking what I'm seeing here
for a short. Nothing. Nothing yet. Maybe

3389
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,110

Looks like they want that 800. Remember,

3390
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
Looks like they want that 800. Remember,
 

3391
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,830
Looks like they want that 800. Remember,
above this red box is very, very thin up

above this red box is very, very thin up
 

3393
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,030
above this red box is very, very thin up
here. That's why I don't want to front

3394
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
here. That's why I don't want to front
 

3395
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,669
here. That's why I don't want to front
run it. If they're not done, they're not

3396
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:49,679
run it. If they're not done, they're not

Can't rule them out going to 900 or 25k.

3400

Can't rule them out going to 900 or 25k.
 

3401
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:01,750
Can't rule them out going to 900 or 25k.
[\h__\h] mental, but can't rule it out.

3402
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:01,760

 

3403
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,350

It feels like it's going to explode.

01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
It feels like it's going to explode.

are they just going to let this squeeze
 

3413
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,510
are they just going to let this squeeze
out all day? Don't think the high is in

3421
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:33,669

3427
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,110
that it can get very squeezy. It can get
very squeezy up into this box. It's

3428
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:41,120
very squeezy up into this box. It's
 

3429
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,470
very squeezy up into this box. It's
pretty amazing if they get to previous

3430
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:42,480
pretty amazing if they get to previous
 

3431
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,030
pretty amazing if they get to previous

you cannot rule it out. This market's

3434
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:46,880
you cannot rule it out. This market's
 

3435
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,070
you cannot rule it out. This market's
done weirder things.

3436
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:50,080
done weirder things.
 

3437
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,910
done weirder things.
Where is Google? Oh, still sitting

3438
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:51,920
Where is Google? Oh, still sitting
 

3439
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,229
Where is Google? Oh, still sitting
around 6% up. Dragging that market up

3440
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:54,239
around 6% up. Dragging that market up
 

3441
01:30:54,239 --> 01:31:00,709
around 6% up. Dragging that market up
with it.

3442
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:00,719

 

3443
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:04,629

New highs here 800 that psychological

3444
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:04,639
New highs here 800 that psychological
 

3445
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:11,910
New highs here 800 that psychological
level.

3446
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:11,920

 

3447
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,510

So you can think about look above and

3448
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:13,520
So you can think about look above and
 

3449
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,590
So you can think about look above and
fail for the initial balance

3450
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:15,600
fail for the initial balance
 

3451
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,590
fail for the initial balance
potentially,

3452
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600

 

3453
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,030

but you want to see displacement. You

3454
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,040
but you want to see displacement. You
 

3455
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:21,990
but you want to see displacement. You
want to see them be a bit more

3456
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:22,000
want to see them be a bit more
 

3457
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,270
want to see them be a bit more
aggressive. They still not filled all

3458
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:23,280
aggressive. They still not filled all
 

3459
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,030
aggressive. They still not filled all
these participants at 800 yet. They're

3460
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:25,040
these participants at 800 yet. They're
 

3461
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,149
these participants at 800 yet. They're
sat there on the book looking to get

01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
sat there on the book looking to get
 

3463
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:33,750
sat there on the book looking to get
built 200 lot.

3464
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:33,760

 

3465
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,189

There's a bit of excess. I don't like

3466
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:35,199
There's a bit of excess. I don't like
 

3467
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:51,030
There's a bit of excess. I don't like
that. That 200 lot's still set up there.

3468
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:51,040

 

3469
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,990

Feeling an imbalance here.

3470
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:54,000
Feeling an imbalance here.
 

3471
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,430
Feeling an imbalance here.
Remember, there's been a buyer on the

01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:01,600
and structure is bullish. We're above
 

3477
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,870
and structure is bullish. We're above
initial balance. You don't want to fight

3478
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:02,880
initial balance. You don't want to fight
 

3479
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,390
initial balance. You don't want to fight
it. If you're going to take it, it's

3480
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:04,400
it. If you're going to take it, it's
 

3481
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,229
it. If you're going to take it, it's
really tough trade this. You're going to

3482
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
really tough trade this. You're going to

look for it. And right now, we're just
 

3485
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,750
look for it. And right now, we're just
in straight move upside. It's just a

3486
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:09,760
in straight move upside. It's just a
 

3487
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,030
in straight move upside. It's just a
straight grind. So, you can keep buying

3488
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:11,040
straight grind. So, you can keep buying
 

3489
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,550
straight grind. So, you can keep buying
flow zones. If they keep holding initial

3490
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:12,560
flow zones. If they keep holding initial
 

3491
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,229
flow zones. If they keep holding initial
balance, they keep holding this. This

3492
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:14,239
balance, they keep holding this. This
 

3493
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:17,430
balance, they keep holding this. This
will become blue. Remember,

3494
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:17,440
will become blue. Remember,
 

3495
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,550
will become blue. Remember,
right? And that's what we've done all

3496
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:18,560
right? And that's what we've done all
 

3497
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,149
right? And that's what we've done all
this all this morning. Test one level,

3498
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
this all this morning. Test one level,
 

3499
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,430
this all this morning. Test one level,
come back to the other, flip it. Test

3500
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:21,440
come back to the other, flip it. Test
 

3501
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,950
come back to the other, flip it. Test
one level, come to the next level, level

3502
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:22,960
one level, come to the next level, level
 

3503
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,990
one level, come to the next level, level
it, flip it. Test one level, come back,

3504
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,000
it, flip it. Test one level, come back,
 

3505
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,030
it, flip it. Test one level, come back,
maybe flip it. So, you cannot rule out

3506
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
maybe flip it. So, you cannot rule out
 

3507
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,030
maybe flip it. So, you cannot rule out
this squeeze all the way up here. You

01:33:32,629 --> 01:33:32,639
we are into that thin volume area that I
 

3547
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,310
we are into that thin volume area that I
talked about. Bears need to defend this

3548
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:34,320
talked about. Bears need to defend this
 

3549
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,669
talked about. Bears need to defend this
and they need to defend it soon because

if they don't, we're going to go to
 

3553
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,629
if they don't, we're going to go to
those 900s.

3554
01:33:40,629 --> 01:33:40,639
those 900s.
 

3555
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,550
those 900s.
If we go to 900, we might as well go

3556
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:42,560
If we go to 900, we might as well go
 

3557
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:47,990
If we go to 900, we might as well go
25,000 might we at that point.

3558
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:48,000

 

3559
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,149

which is impressive. So you'll be

01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,040
today. Now if you hold IB squeeze, if
 

3565
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,350
today. Now if you hold IB squeeze, if
you let go of IB, look above and fail.

3566
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:57,360
you let go of IB, look above and fail.
 

3567
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,590
you let go of IB, look above and fail.
Watching this 800 now. Coming back to

3568
01:33:59,590 --> 01:33:59,600
Watching this 800 now. Coming back to
 

3569
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,750
Watching this 800 now. Coming back to
it, we've left buyers trapped above 800

3570
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:01,760
it, we've left buyers trapped above 800
 

3571
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,990
it, we've left buyers trapped above 800
for now. Not a huge amount of excess,

3572
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:04,000
for now. Not a huge amount of excess,
 

3573
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,149
for now. Not a huge amount of excess,
but there is some. Uh I'd say you need

3574
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:06,159
but there is some. Uh I'd say you need
 

3575
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,790
but there is some. Uh I'd say you need
to trade under 92s, and really you want

3576
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:08,800

doubt about it. Seller sellers have
 

3739
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,629
doubt about it. Seller sellers have
front run this 800 up to 820s and

3740
01:38:34,629 --> 01:38:34,639
front run this 800 up to 820s and
 

3741
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,070
front run this 800 up to 820s and
caught. We don't have buyers with an

3742
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:36,080
caught. We don't have buyers with an
 

3743
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,149
caught. We don't have buyers with an
excess up those tops. That is sell

3744
01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:38,159
excess up those tops. That is sell
 

3745
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,149
excess up those tops. That is sell
excess up there. So, I'm not convinced

3746
01:38:40,149 --> 01:38:40,159
excess up there. So, I'm not convinced
 

3747
01:38:40,159 --> 01:39:00,470
excess up there. So, I'm not convinced
how that is in yet.

3748
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:00,480

 

3749
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,990

The shelf's got a little bit bigger now.

3750
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,000
The shelf's got a little bit bigger now.
 

3751
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,270
The shelf's got a little bit bigger now.
That's your shelf. And they're still

3752
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:05,280
That's your shelf. And they're still
 

3753
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,830
That's your shelf. And they're still
holding it. And delete this a little

3754
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:07,840
holding it. And delete this a little
 

3755
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,709
holding it. And delete this a little
bit. It's a bit ugly. You can just use

3756
01:39:10,709 --> 01:39:10,719
bit. It's a bit ugly. You can just use
 

3757
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:17,990
bit. It's a bit ugly. You can just use
the edge of this blue box in RBS.

3758
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,000

 

3759
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,510

said, I'm not convinced high days in

3760
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:19,520
said, I'm not convinced high days in
 

3761
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,109
said, I'm not convinced high days in
yet. I don't think we've got much excess

3762
01:39:21,109 --> 01:39:21,119
yet. I don't think we've got much excess
 

3763
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:23,030
yet. I don't think we've got much excess
up there, but we'll see. 800 still being

3764
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:23,040
up there, but we'll see. 800 still being
 

3765
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:29,189
up there, but we'll see. 800 still being
defended.

3766
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:29,199

 

3767
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,270

Still to 800. If they fail 800, you'll

3768
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:31,280
Still to 800. If they fail 800, you'll
 

3769
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,629
Still to 800. If they fail 800, you'll
get a snap, right? If they fail here,

3770
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:32,639
get a snap, right? If they fail here,
 

3771
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,310
get a snap, right? If they fail here,
you can maybe get a snap down to here.

3772
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,320
you can maybe get a snap down to here.
 

3773
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,870
you can maybe get a snap down to here.
50 point odd snap. But so far, it's

3774
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:36,880
50 point odd snap. But so far, it's
 

3775
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:45,030
50 point odd snap. But so far, it's
being defended.

3776
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,040

 

3777
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,629

trading into those 21s we talked about

3778
01:39:46,629 --> 01:39:46,639
trading into those 21s we talked about
 

3779
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:59,430
trading into those 21s we talked about
at the beginning of the day

3780
01:39:59,430 --> 01:39:59,440

 

3781
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:05,990

3783
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,270

now gone green

3784

now gone green
markets come to a bit of Just stand

3786
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:10,560
markets come to a bit of Just stand
 

3787
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:20,550
markets come to a bit of Just stand
still.

3788
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:20,560

 

3789
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,229

Just wondering like are they really

3790
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
Just wondering like are they really
 

3791
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:24,310
Just wondering like are they really
going to come for these river sweet

3792
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:24,320
going to come for these river sweet
 

3793
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,149
going to come for these river sweet
valley today?

3794
01:40:26,149 --> 01:40:26,159
valley today?
 

3795
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:27,590
valley today?
Feels like the answer is yes at the

3796
01:40:27,590 --> 01:40:27,600
Feels like the answer is yes at the
 

3797
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,669
Feels like the answer is yes at the
moment which is

3798
01:40:29,669 --> 01:40:29,679
moment which is
 

3799
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,870
moment which is
just insane. The size of moves in this

3800
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:32,880
just insane. The size of moves in this
 

3801
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,750
just insane. The size of moves in this
market at the moment. The swings are so

3802
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:35,760
market at the moment. The swings are so
 

3803
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,590
market at the moment. The swings are so
big um per session.

3804
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:39,600
big um per session.
 

3805
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:49,430
big um per session.
Really, really impressive.

3806
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:49,440

 

3807
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,870

Someone's going to get hurt here. You

3808
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:50,880
Someone's going to get hurt here. You
 

3809
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,870
Someone's going to get hurt here. You
can see this gray box, this volume shelf

3810
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:52,880
can see this gray box, this volume shelf
 

3811
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,030
can see this gray box, this volume shelf
being built out. We are into sort of a

3812
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:55,040
being built out. We are into sort of a
 

3813
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,430
being built out. We are into sort of a
thin volume area. There is a little node

3814
01:40:59,430 --> 01:40:59,440
thin volume area. There is a little node
 

3815
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,910
thin volume area. There is a little node
at 8.90. All right, there is a node at

3816
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:01,920
at 8.90. All right, there is a node at
 

3817
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,070
at 8.90. All right, there is a node at
890. I'm just going to Let's just make

3818
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,080
890. I'm just going to Let's just make
 

3819
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:08,070
890. I'm just going to Let's just make
sure this is accurate. Let's do this to

3820
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:08,080
sure this is accurate. Let's do this to
 

3821
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:11,669
sure this is accurate. Let's do this to
That's the wrong one. Let's do this.

3822
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:11,679
That's the wrong one. Let's do this.
 

3823
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,430
That's the wrong one. Let's do this.
Sure it's down far enough there.

3824
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:15,440
Sure it's down far enough there.
 

3825
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,870
Sure it's down far enough there.
Okay. So, that's to complete the

3826
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,880
Okay. So, that's to complete the
 

3827
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,350
Okay. So, that's to complete the
rotation will be up here. If they fail

3828
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:19,360
rotation will be up here. If they fail
 

3829
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,270
rotation will be up here. If they fail
here, then it would be a move back down

3830
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:21,280
here, then it would be a move back down
 

3831
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,790
here, then it would be a move back down
into this blue box or at least to

3832
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:22,800
into this blue box or at least to
 

3833
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,470
into this blue box or at least to
initial balance, but maybe into the edge

3834
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:24,480
initial balance, but maybe into the edge
 

3835
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,070
initial balance, but maybe into the edge
of value. This is where we really found

3836
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:26,080
of value. This is where we really found
 

3837
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,109
of value. This is where we really found
a bit 7:30. So if they fail this, I'd be

3838
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:29,119
a bit 7:30. So if they fail this, I'd be
 

3839
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:30,550
a bit 7:30. So if they fail this, I'd be
watching the trade to IB and if they

3840
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:30,560
watching the trade to IB and if they
 

3841
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,310
watching the trade to IB and if they
fail that point of control. If they hold

3842
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:32,320
fail that point of control. If they hold
 

3843
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,229
fail that point of control. If they hold
this or hold any dip, then the

3844
01:41:34,229 --> 01:41:34,239
this or hold any dip, then the
 

3845
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:36,070
this or hold any dip, then the
completion of the rotation's up here for

3846
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,080
completion of the rotation's up here for
 

3847
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:40,790
completion of the rotation's up here for
bulls. It's asking a lot. It's asking a

3848
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:40,800
bulls. It's asking a lot. It's asking a
 

3849
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,830
bulls. It's asking a lot. It's asking a
lot to do that. But uh

3850
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:43,840
lot to do that. But uh
 

3851
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,990
lot to do that. But uh
hey,

3852
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:46,000
hey,
 

3853
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,229
hey,
we're only at I don't know 300 points on

3854
01:41:48,229 --> 01:41:48,239
we're only at I don't know 300 points on
 

3855
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,070
we're only at I don't know 300 points on
the day. I think on Friday you had four

3856
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:50,080
the day. I think on Friday you had four
 

3857
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,790
the day. I think on Friday you had four
500 point swings. Okay, testing the

3858
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:52,800
500 point swings. Okay, testing the
 

3859
01:41:52,800 --> 01:42:00,790
500 point swings. Okay, testing the
bottom side of this gray box again.

3860
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:00,800

 

3861
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,790

Still bulls are defending that 800

3862
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:02,800
Still bulls are defending that 800
 

3863
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:16,950
Still bulls are defending that 800
sortish area.

3864
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:16,960

 

3865
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,270

They let go of this. It might be a wash

3866
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:19,280
They let go of this. It might be a wash
 

3867
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,870
They let go of this. It might be a wash
and a snap. I need to be careful there's

3868
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:20,880
and a snap. I need to be careful there's
 

3869
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:26,390
and a snap. I need to be careful there's
not a bear trap. But

3870
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,400

 

3871
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,310

only thing I don't like is I don't like

3872
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:28,320
only thing I don't like is I don't like
 

3873
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,189
only thing I don't like is I don't like
the excess at the high. Don't think

3874
01:42:31,189 --> 01:42:31,199
the excess at the high. Don't think
 

3875
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:33,830
the excess at the high. Don't think
there's enough buyers caught at the

3876
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:33,840
there's enough buyers caught at the
 

3877
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:39,189
there's enough buyers caught at the
moment.

3878
01:42:39,189 --> 01:42:39,199

 

3879
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:47,189

Definitely starting to stall out

3880
01:42:47,189 --> 01:42:47,199

 

3881
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:50,870

or green.

3882
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:50,880

 

3883
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,709

holding flow zones. Everything's still

3884
01:42:52,709 --> 01:42:52,719
holding flow zones. Everything's still
 

3885
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:56,470
holding flow zones. Everything's still
bullish. No move away from volume.

3886
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:56,480
bullish. No move away from volume.
 

3887
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,430
bullish. No move away from volume.
Sellers have not taken control.

3888
01:42:59,430 --> 01:42:59,440
Sellers have not taken control.
 

3889
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,430
Sellers have not taken control.
Last push was sold into from the buyers,

3890
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:01,440
Last push was sold into from the buyers,
 

3891
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,750
Last push was sold into from the buyers,
but it not at highs, but definitely sold

3892
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:03,760
but it not at highs, but definitely sold
 

3893
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:08,390
but it not at highs, but definitely sold
into above 804

3894
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:08,400

 

3895
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,390

and buyers caught up there, but still

3896
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:10,400
and buyers caught up there, but still
 

3897
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,709
and buyers caught up there, but still
holding the key level. Here you go. So,

3898
01:43:12,709 --> 01:43:12,719
holding the key level. Here you go. So,
 

3899
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:14,070
holding the key level. Here you go. So,
starting to move away from this. Now,

3900
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:14,080
starting to move away from this. Now,
 

3901
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,070
starting to move away from this. Now,
can they have follow through to IB and

3902
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:16,080
can they have follow through to IB and
 

3903
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,030
can they have follow through to IB and
back to uh value area high on the

3904
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:19,040
back to uh value area high on the
 

3905
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,390
back to uh value area high on the
session? So, I've got a small piece on

3906
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:20,400
session? So, I've got a small piece on
 

3907
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:24,149
session? So, I've got a small piece on
this now.

3908
01:43:24,149 --> 01:43:24,159

 

3909
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,510

See money, take money, I would say.

3910
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:25,520
See money, take money, I would say.
 

3911
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,070
See money, take money, I would say.
Watch the 775s.

3912
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
Watch the 775s.
 

3913
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,990
Watch the 775s.
Come on, baby.

3914
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:30,000
Come on, baby.
 

3915
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,390
Come on, baby.
Leaving volume.

3916
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:34,400

 

3917
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,030

Come on. Let's get to IB at least and

3918
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:37,040
Come on. Let's get to IB at least and
 

3919
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,270
Come on. Let's get to IB at least and
then let's dive through IB. Really nice.

3920
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:39,280
then let's dive through IB. Really nice.
 

3921
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:42,550
then let's dive through IB. Really nice.
Moving my stock into the money now.

3922
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:42,560
Moving my stock into the money now.
 

3923
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,030
Moving my stock into the money now.
So TP1 would be IB. I don't want to see

3924
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,040
So TP1 would be IB. I don't want to see
 

3925
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,470
So TP1 would be IB. I don't want to see
this reclaim. I really don't want to see

3926
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:46,480
this reclaim. I really don't want to see
 

3927
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,750
this reclaim. I really don't want to see
this reclaim. If it reclaims, I'm just

3928
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:47,760
this reclaim. If it reclaims, I'm just
 

3929
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,149
this reclaim. If it reclaims, I'm just
going to cut it instantly. It needs to

3930
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:50,159
going to cut it instantly. It needs to
 

3931
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,830
going to cut it instantly. It needs to
retest and stay heavy. I do not want to

3932
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:51,840
retest and stay heavy. I do not want to
 

3933
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,430
retest and stay heavy. I do not want to
see this reclaim because we had a lot of

3934
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:53,440
see this reclaim because we had a lot of
 

3935
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,870
see this reclaim because we had a lot of
aggressive selling coming in there. It's

3936
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:54,880
aggressive selling coming in there. It's
 

3937
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,510
aggressive selling coming in there. It's
a good hold for now. I'm going to move

3938
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:57,520
a good hold for now. I'm going to move
 

3939
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,109
a good hold for now. I'm going to move
my stop down. I've paid myself a little

3940
01:43:59,109 --> 01:43:59,119
my stop down. I've paid myself a little
 

3941
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:00,550
my stop down. I've paid myself a little
bit. I'm going to move my stop just

3942
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:00,560
bit. I'm going to move my stop just
 

3943
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:05,109
bit. I'm going to move my stop just
above 800

3944
01:44:05,109 --> 01:44:05,119

 

3945
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:06,550

because I think if we reclaim that, we

3946
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:06,560
because I think if we reclaim that, we
 

3947
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,830
because I think if we reclaim that, we
squeeze high of day because I don't like

3948
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:07,840
squeeze high of day because I don't like
 

3949
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:12,310
squeeze high of day because I don't like
the excess at high of day or lack of it.

3950
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:12,320
the excess at high of day or lack of it.
 

3951
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,990
the excess at high of day or lack of it.
I know it's counter trend as well. I'm

3952
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,000
I know it's counter trend as well. I'm
 

3953
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,189
I know it's counter trend as well. I'm
trying to time when this peters out. So

3954
01:44:17,189 --> 01:44:17,199
trying to time when this peters out. So
 

3955
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:21,270
trying to time when this peters out. So
far so good. Come on, baby. Come on,

3956
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:21,280
far so good. Come on, baby. Come on,
 

3957
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:23,030
far so good. Come on, baby. Come on,
baby. Be kind because I'm not well

3958
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,040
baby. Be kind because I'm not well
 

3959
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:28,709
baby. Be kind because I'm not well
enough to sit in this too long.

3960
01:44:28,709 --> 01:44:28,719

 

3961
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:30,470

Looking for this gray box to reject. If

3962
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:30,480
Looking for this gray box to reject. If
 

3963
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:33,030
Looking for this gray box to reject. If
it doesn't reject, I'm out. Okay, if it

3964
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:33,040
it doesn't reject, I'm out. Okay, if it
 

3965
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,229
it doesn't reject, I'm out. Okay, if it
doesn't reject, I'm out.

3966
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:36,239
doesn't reject, I'm out.
 

3967
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:43,990
doesn't reject, I'm out.
Very close to taking my stop here.

3968
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:44,000

 

3969
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,990

Just missed me barely. Probably going to

3970
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,000
Just missed me barely. Probably going to
 

3971
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,430
Just missed me barely. Probably going to
take me this candle. I can always get

3972
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:47,440
take me this candle. I can always get
 

3973
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,750
take me this candle. I can always get
back in, so I don't care. Paid myself

3974
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:49,760
back in, so I don't care. Paid myself
 

3975
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,390
back in, so I don't care. Paid myself
already.

3976
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,400
already.
 

3977
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:56,870
already.
How's it not taking me yet? Insane.

3978
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:56,880
How's it not taking me yet? Insane.
 

3979
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,310
How's it not taking me yet? Insane.
Might get lucky here.

3980
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:00,320
Might get lucky here.
 

3981
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:05,270
Might get lucky here.
Might get lucky here.

3982
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280

 

3983
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:13,990

It's coming in here at 85s.

3984
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:14,000

 

3985
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,070

Flush through this 85 lot.

3986
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,080
Flush through this 85 lot.
 

3987
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:24,070
Flush through this 85 lot.
Nice. Get through him.

3988
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:24,080

 

3989
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,390

Get through him.

3990
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:26,400
Get through him.
 

3991
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,390
Get through him.
They're moving the bids down, which is

3992
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:28,400
They're moving the bids down, which is
 

3993
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,229
They're moving the bids down, which is
good to see.

3994
01:45:32,229 --> 01:45:32,239

 

3995
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:35,270

Nice. Taking him out. Watching 770s

3996
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:35,280
Nice. Taking him out. Watching 770s
 

3997
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,070
Nice. Taking him out. Watching 770s
next. Don't want to see this. Uh, hold

3998
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:38,080
next. Don't want to see this. Uh, hold
 

3999
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,990
next. Don't want to see this. Uh, hold
up here now. We've just taken out the

4000
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:40,000
up here now. We've just taken out the
 

4001
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,669
up here now. We've just taken out the
actual volume. They should trade through

4002
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:41,679
actual volume. They should trade through
 

4003
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:43,910
actual volume. They should trade through
85s now. If they don't trade 385, it's

4004
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:43,920
85s now. If they don't trade 385, it's
 

4005
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:44,950
85s now. If they don't trade 385, it's
going to be a problem. It should trade

4006
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:44,960
going to be a problem. It should trade
 

4007
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,750
going to be a problem. It should trade
through 85s and go to 770s now. Stop

4008
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:47,760
through 85s and go to 770s now. Stop
 

4009
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,870
through 85s and go to 770s now. Stop
soaking here, you little you little so

4010
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:50,880
soaking here, you little you little so
 

4011
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,629

Here we go, folks. So, TP1 coming up

4016
01:45:58,229 --> 01:45:58,239
Here we go, folks. So, TP1 coming up
 

4017
01:45:58,239 --> 01:45:59,990
Here we go, folks. So, TP1 coming up
into IB. Don't be a dick for a tick.

4018
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,000
into IB. Don't be a dick for a tick.
 

4019
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,590
into IB. Don't be a dick for a tick.
Okay, here we go. Into IB. You going to

4020
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:03,600
Okay, here we go. Into IB. You going to
 

4021
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,790
Okay, here we go. Into IB. You going to
fill me or I'm going to have to move

4022
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:04,800
fill me or I'm going to have to move
 

4023
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,590
fill me or I'm going to have to move
this down? You going to fill me?

4024
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:07,600
this down? You going to fill me?
 

4025
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,030
this down? You going to fill me?
You going to fill me? Okay, I'm going to

4026
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:09,040
You going to fill me? Okay, I'm going to
 

4027
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:14,390
You going to fill me? Okay, I'm going to
take one off here

4028
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:14,400

 

4029
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,990

and then see if we collapse initial

4030
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:16,000
and then see if we collapse initial
 

4031
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,550
and then see if we collapse initial
balance or not.

4032
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:18,560
balance or not.
 

4033
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,629
balance or not.
It's three for three today. Oh, it

4034
01:46:20,629 --> 01:46:20,639
It's three for three today. Oh, it
 

4035
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:22,070
It's three for three today. Oh, it
almost took me out. Cannot believe. I

4036
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:22,080
almost took me out. Cannot believe. I
 

4037
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,950
almost took me out. Cannot believe. I
think it missed me by a tick. A nice

4038
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960
think it missed me by a tick. A nice
 

4039
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,629
think it missed me by a tick. A nice
rejection of that gray box. You can see

4040
01:46:26,629 --> 01:46:26,639
rejection of that gray box. You can see
 

4041
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:29,510
rejection of that gray box. You can see
how I play these. And initial balance

4042
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
how I play these. And initial balance
 

4043
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,189
how I play these. And initial balance
now becomes key. If we fail this initial

4044
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:31,199
now becomes key. If we fail this initial
 

4045
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,950
now becomes key. If we fail this initial
balance, then I my expectation is to

4046
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:32,960
balance, then I my expectation is to
 

4047
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,310
balance, then I my expectation is to
trade back to point control and volume

4048
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:36,320
trade back to point control and volume
 

4049
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,149
trade back to point control and volume
and VW up. All right, so I'll be

4050
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:38,159
and VW up. All right, so I'll be
 

4051
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:40,790
and VW up. All right, so I'll be
watching TP2, TP3, and if they collapse

4052
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:40,800
watching TP2, TP3, and if they collapse
 

4053
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,270
watching TP2, TP3, and if they collapse
this whole thing back down to here. I'm

4054
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:43,280
this whole thing back down to here. I'm
 

4055
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:46,070
this whole thing back down to here. I'm
not going to rule that out.

4056
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,080
not going to rule that out.
 

4057
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,510
not going to rule that out.
All right, nice winner here, guys.

4058
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:47,520
All right, nice winner here, guys.
 

4059
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:53,669
All right, nice winner here, guys.
Really nice. Three for three today.

4060
01:46:53,669 --> 01:46:53,679

 

4061
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,270

Hear how I said like we're not going to

4062
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:55,280
Hear how I said like we're not going to
 

4063
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,109
Hear how I said like we're not going to
front run this. We need to wait for them

4064
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:57,119
front run this. We need to wait for them
 

4065
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,270
front run this. We need to wait for them
to leave volume for the shift of volume.

4066
01:46:59,270 --> 01:46:59,280
to leave volume for the shift of volume.
 

4067
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,590
to leave volume for the shift of volume.
Once we left, came much easier. If you

4068
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:01,600
Once we left, came much easier. If you
 

4069
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:02,950
Once we left, came much easier. If you
were short in all of this trying to

4070
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:02,960
were short in all of this trying to
 

4071
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,390
were short in all of this trying to
guess it, you got caught. If you just

4072
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:04,400
guess it, you got caught. If you just
 

4073
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,430
guess it, you got caught. If you just
waited, it gave you at least some money

4074
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:07,440
waited, it gave you at least some money
 

4075
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,390
waited, it gave you at least some money
here. 30 40 points again. If they

4076
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:10,400
here. 30 40 points again. If they
 

4077
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,750
here. 30 40 points again. If they
reclaim this, I'm not interested because

4078
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:11,760
reclaim this, I'm not interested because
 

4079
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,149
reclaim this, I'm not interested because
then they'll have ambitions of of uh

4080
01:47:14,149 --> 01:47:14,159
then they'll have ambitions of of uh
 

4081
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:18,149
then they'll have ambitions of of uh
trading higher.

4082
01:47:18,149 --> 01:47:18,159

 

4083
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:21,669

Can't rule out previous week value area

4084
01:47:21,669 --> 01:47:21,679
Can't rule out previous week value area
 

4085
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,270
Can't rule out previous week value area
high with how we're trading today.

4086
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:23,280
high with how we're trading today.
 

4087
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,590
high with how we're trading today.
Cannot. I don't think we want to do

4088
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:25,600
Cannot. I don't think we want to do
 

4089
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,030
Cannot. I don't think we want to do
that. I want to see this happen here.

4090
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:29,040
that. I want to see this happen here.
 

4091
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,229
that. I want to see this happen here.
But, uh, if they do this, we cannot rule

4092
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:32,239
But, uh, if they do this, we cannot rule
 

4093
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:34,070
But, uh, if they do this, we cannot rule
this move out here out, which is why

4094
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:34,080
this move out here out, which is why
 

4095
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,830
this move out here out, which is why
it's very much a C money, take money.

4096
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840
it's very much a C money, take money.
 

4097
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,350
it's very much a C money, take money.
But, we definitely left buyers trapped

4098
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:37,360
But, we definitely left buyers trapped
 

4099
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,870
But, we definitely left buyers trapped
over here. I just don't like this

4100
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:38,880
over here. I just don't like this
 

4101
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,910
over here. I just don't like this
excess. What I mean is this this high of

4102
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:41,920
excess. What I mean is this this high of
 

4103
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,030
excess. What I mean is this this high of
day

4104
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,040

 

4105
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,310

does not have lots of market buying in.

4106
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:48,320
does not have lots of market buying in.
 

4107
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,870
does not have lots of market buying in.
Oh, and what I like to see is lots of

4108
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:50,880
Oh, and what I like to see is lots of
 

4109
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,270
Oh, and what I like to see is lots of
market buying up here and know that

4110
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:53,280
market buying up here and know that
 

4111
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,790
market buying up here and know that
there's a passive seller saying, "Nope,

4112
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:54,800
there's a passive seller saying, "Nope,
 

4113
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,629
there's a passive seller saying, "Nope,
we're not going any higher." We don't

4114
01:47:56,629 --> 01:47:56,639
we're not going any higher." We don't
 

4115
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:58,470
we're not going any higher." We don't
actually have that. If we look at

4116
01:47:58,470 --> 01:47:58,480
actually have that. If we look at
 

4117
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:04,550
actually have that. If we look at
bookmap,

4118
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:04,560

 

4119
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,149

it wants to move.

4120
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:08,159
it wants to move.
 

4121
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:11,990
it wants to move.
What's the higher day? 17s.

That's what gives me more conviction um
 

4135
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,910
That's what gives me more conviction um
that we're starting to like really

4136
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:27,920
that we're starting to like really
 

4137
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,189
that we're starting to like really
transition, but we're seeing stronger

transition, but we're seeing stronger
 

4139
01:48:29,199 --> 01:48:32,950

You see these passive lots here. Don't
 

4143
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,709
You see these passive lots here. Don't
know why it's saying that. I don't have

4144
01:48:36,709 --> 01:48:36,719
know why it's saying that. I don't have
 

4145
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:51,750
know why it's saying that. I don't have
any add-ons going. Come on.

4146
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:51,760

 

4147
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,229

from last week. You mean Corey? The

4148
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:54,239
from last week. You mean Corey? The
 

4149
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,550
from last week. You mean Corey? The
single prints?

4150
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
single prints?
 

4151
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,790
single prints?
What do you mean from this session? Uh

4152
01:48:58,790 --> 01:48:58,800
What do you mean from this session? Uh
 

4153
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,950
What do you mean from this session? Uh
can see a few into 800 which got

4154
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:00,960
can see a few into 800 which got
 

4155
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,790
can see a few into 800 which got
rebalanced, but not really anything

4156
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:02,800
rebalanced, but not really anything
 

4157
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,750
rebalanced, but not really anything
else. Maybe from last week,

4158
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:05,760
else. Maybe from last week,
 

4159
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,070
else. Maybe from last week,
which would make sense for that big dump

4160
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:08,080
which would make sense for that big dump
 

4161
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,510
which would make sense for that big dump
from Thursday. You mean do you mean

4162
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:09,520
from Thursday. You mean do you mean
 

4163
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:13,270
from Thursday. You mean do you mean
those repric those single prints?

4164
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:13,280
those repric those single prints?
 

4165
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,629
those repric those single prints?
It's kind of what we've started doing

4166
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:14,639
It's kind of what we've started doing
 

4167
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:18,550
It's kind of what we've started doing
now.

4168
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:18,560

 

4169
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:21,430

Think we fill these guys here. 770, 765,

4170
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:21,440
Think we fill these guys here. 770, 765,
 

4171
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,830
Think we fill these guys here. 770, 765,
760, 755. You got your initial balance

4172
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:23,840
760, 755. You got your initial balance
 

4173
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,870
760, 755. You got your initial balance
here. I think we're going to fill these

4174
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:24,880
here. I think we're going to fill these
 

4175
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,390
here. I think we're going to fill these
and move lower at this point. This looks

4176
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:26,400
and move lower at this point. This looks
 

4177
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:29,109
and move lower at this point. This looks
pretty good now. Rejecting this. See TP1

4178
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:29,119
pretty good now. Rejecting this. See TP1
 

4179
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:31,830
pretty good now. Rejecting this. See TP1
here, TP2, TP3, and then if you get

4180
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:31,840
here, TP2, TP3, and then if you get
 

4181
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,430
here, TP2, TP3, and then if you get
really lucky, we come back down to this

4182
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:33,440
really lucky, we come back down to this
 

4183
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,510
really lucky, we come back down to this
point, folks. You should have locked

4184
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:35,520
point, folks. You should have locked
 

4185
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,510
point, folks. You should have locked
some in into balance already. If we fail

4186
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:37,520
some in into balance already. If we fail
 

4187
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,750
some in into balance already. If we fail
this, this. If we fail this, this. If we

4188
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,760
this, this. If we fail this, this. If we
 

4189
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,070
this, this. If we fail this, this. If we
fail this, this

4190
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:44,080

 

4191
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:50,390

looks good.

4192
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:50,400

 

4193
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:54,149

Spirally filled one. QQQ still above.

4194
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:54,159
Spirally filled one. QQQ still above.
 

4195
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:58,470
Spirally filled one. QQQ still above.
Have a look.

4196
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:58,480

 

4197
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,310

I mean, yeah. I mean, you can even see

4198
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:00,320
I mean, yeah. I mean, you can even see
 

4199
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,790
I mean, yeah. I mean, you can even see
like even without a TPR, you can see

4200
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:02,800
like even without a TPR, you can see
 

4201
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,629
like even without a TPR, you can see
those f remember on the five minute

4202
01:50:04,629 --> 01:50:04,639
those f remember on the five minute
 

4203
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:08,470
those f remember on the five minute
bars. We never we never turned around.

4204
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:08,480
bars. We never we never turned around.
 

4205
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,870
bars. We never we never turned around.
Never turned around.

4206
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:10,880
Never turned around.
 

4207
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,709
Never turned around.
Never built anything out. It was just

4208
01:50:12,709 --> 01:50:12,719
Never built anything out. It was just
 

4209
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,229
Never built anything out. It was just
straight

4210
01:50:14,229 --> 01:50:14,239
straight
 

4211
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:17,590
straight
straight downside move. Use a bathroom

4212
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:17,600
straight downside move. Use a bathroom
 

4213
01:50:17,600 --> 01:52:48,550
straight downside move. Use a bathroom
here, folks. Be right back.

4214
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:48,560

 

4215
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,109

Oh, stop me out.

4216
01:52:51,109 --> 01:52:51,119
Oh, stop me out.
 

4217
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:55,109
Oh, stop me out.
Oh god, never mind. Still a good trade.

4218
01:52:55,109 --> 01:52:55,119
Oh god, never mind. Still a good trade.
 

4219
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:59,830
Oh god, never mind. Still a good trade.
Still might set up again.

4220
01:52:59,830 --> 01:52:59,840

 

4221
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,270

I might be done though, folks. I'm

4222
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:01,280
I might be done though, folks. I'm
 

4223
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,669
I might be done though, folks. I'm
really struggling here. My head is

4224
01:53:03,669 --> 01:53:03,679
really struggling here. My head is
 

4225
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,270
really struggling here. My head is
pounding.

4226
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,280
pounding.
 

4227
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,950
pounding.
We're banging into this volume and

4228
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:06,960
We're banging into this volume and
 

4229
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:10,629
We're banging into this volume and
they're not trading through it.

4230
01:53:10,629 --> 01:53:10,639
they're not trading through it.
 

4231
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:14,790
they're not trading through it.
But look at the IB that held. That's uh

4232
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:14,800
But look at the IB that held. That's uh
 

4233
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,149
But look at the IB that held. That's uh
potentially signaling trend day.

4234
01:53:18,149 --> 01:53:18,159
potentially signaling trend day.
 

4235
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:20,229
potentially signaling trend day.
Everything's bullish today. I probably

4236
01:53:20,229 --> 01:53:20,239
Everything's bullish today. I probably
 

4237
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:21,669
Everything's bullish today. I probably
should have just been buying these dips

4238
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:21,679
should have just been buying these dips
 

4239
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:22,790
should have just been buying these dips
to be honest. I should have probably

4240
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
to be honest. I should have probably
 

4241
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,629
to be honest. I should have probably
flipped long here looking for that. But

4242
01:53:24,629 --> 01:53:24,639
flipped long here looking for that. But
 

4243
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:27,270
flipped long here looking for that. But
it's so hard when we're into a huge

4244
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:27,280
it's so hard when we're into a huge
 

4245
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,109
it's so hard when we're into a huge
golden zone if we just think about where

4246
01:53:29,109 --> 01:53:29,119
golden zone if we just think about where
 

4247
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:31,430
golden zone if we just think about where
we are. Like the location

4248
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:31,440
we are. Like the location
 

4249
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:36,070
we are. Like the location
is so so bad.

4250
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:36,080

 

4251
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,510

Right, there's the Thursday pivot.

4252
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:37,520
Right, there's the Thursday pivot.
 

4253
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,070
Right, there's the Thursday pivot.
That's your swing high pivot into swing

4254
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:40,080
That's your swing high pivot into swing
 

4255
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:43,189
That's your swing high pivot into swing
low. Move this down properly. And we're

4256
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:43,199
low. Move this down properly. And we're
 

4257
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:48,229
low. Move this down properly. And we're
banging into this golden zone now.

4258
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:48,239

 

4259
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:49,750

This is crazy. And this is the second

4260
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:49,760
This is crazy. And this is the second
 

4261
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,390
This is crazy. And this is the second
leg. So I don't want to long the high of

4262
01:53:52,390 --> 01:53:52,400
leg. So I don't want to long the high of
 

4263
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,950
leg. So I don't want to long the high of
the second leg, right? I don't want to

4264
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:54,960
the second leg, right? I don't want to
 

4265
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:58,709
the second leg, right? I don't want to
long this because if this fails here or

4266
01:53:58,709 --> 01:53:58,719
long this because if this fails here or
 

4267
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:02,070
long this because if this fails here or
anywhere up here then we get this retest

4268
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:02,080
anywhere up here then we get this retest
 

4269
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:04,629
anywhere up here then we get this retest
of this again and the best position

4270
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
of this again and the best position
 

4271
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,550
of this again and the best position
would be a short position here when in

4272
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:06,560
would be a short position here when in
 

4273
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,070
would be a short position here when in
the lower time frame this does something

4274
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:08,080
the lower time frame this does something
 

4275
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,790
the lower time frame this does something
like this. Okay. And then we can fade

4276
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:10,800
like this. Okay. And then we can fade
 

4277
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,510
like this. Okay. And then we can fade
that down to here. And it did it all in

4278
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:13,520
that down to here. And it did it all in
 

4279
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,870
that down to here. And it did it all in
one day all the way down to the lows.

4280
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:14,880
one day all the way down to the lows.
 

4281
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,229
one day all the way down to the lows.
But it's probably likely to do that over

4282
01:54:16,229 --> 01:54:16,239
But it's probably likely to do that over
 

4283
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:18,709
But it's probably likely to do that over
a multiple session. And my expectation

4284
01:54:18,709 --> 01:54:18,719
a multiple session. And my expectation
 

4285
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:21,350
a multiple session. And my expectation
is this week we probably

4286
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:21,360
is this week we probably
 

4287
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,470
is this week we probably
do something like this.

4288
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:24,480
do something like this.
 

4289
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,229
do something like this.
And we just build out a ton of liquidity

4290
01:54:26,229 --> 01:54:26,239
And we just build out a ton of liquidity
 

4291
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:28,709
And we just build out a ton of liquidity
in here. I don't think we move above

4292
01:54:28,709 --> 01:54:28,719
in here. I don't think we move above
 

4293
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:30,550
in here. I don't think we move above
this. Maybe below this, but I don't

4294
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,560
this. Maybe below this, but I don't
 

4295
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:34,870
this. Maybe below this, but I don't
think we do. If we do, it's a wild move.

4296
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:34,880
think we do. If we do, it's a wild move.
 

4297
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:46,709
think we do. If we do, it's a wild move.
Wild move.

4298
01:54:46,709 --> 01:54:46,719

 

4299
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:51,189

Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Jeff.

4300
01:54:51,189 --> 01:54:51,199
Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Jeff.
 

4301
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,589
Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Jeff.
Big W. Nice, Jeff. Good work, man. Good

4302
01:54:53,589 --> 01:54:53,599
Big W. Nice, Jeff. Good work, man. Good
 

4303
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:55,830
Big W. Nice, Jeff. Good work, man. Good
work. Yeah. Anyone who's taken winners

4304
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:55,840
work. Yeah. Anyone who's taken winners
 

4305
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,430
work. Yeah. Anyone who's taken winners
today, like so we've had to be see money

4306
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:57,440
today, like so we've had to be see money
 

4307
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:00,390
today, like so we've had to be see money
take money. I don't like being long

4308
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:00,400
take money. I don't like being long
 

4309
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,709
take money. I don't like being long
um up here for those reasons. Like maybe

4310
01:55:02,709 --> 01:55:02,719
um up here for those reasons. Like maybe
 

4311
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:04,470
um up here for those reasons. Like maybe
at the beginning of the day if we drop

4312
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:04,480
at the beginning of the day if we drop
 

4313
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:05,669
at the beginning of the day if we drop
down to here, I definitely would have

4314
01:55:05,669 --> 01:55:05,679
down to here, I definitely would have
 

4315
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:07,030
down to here, I definitely would have
been thinking about the longs, but I

4316
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:07,040
been thinking about the longs, but I
 

4317
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,390
been thinking about the longs, but I
think some of you took it pre-market. I

4318
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:08,400
think some of you took it pre-market. I
 

4319
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:11,189
think some of you took it pre-market. I
mean, this was a no-brain,

4320
01:55:11,189 --> 01:55:11,199
mean, this was a no-brain,
 

4321
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:13,189
mean, this was a no-brain,
right? Holding previous day value area

4322
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:13,199
right? Holding previous day value area
 

4323
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:15,510
right? Holding previous day value area
high. Look at this. Filling the gap,

4324
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:15,520
high. Look at this. Filling the gap,
 

4325
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,189
high. Look at this. Filling the gap,
holding previous day value area high.

4326
01:55:17,189 --> 01:55:17,199
holding previous day value area high.
 

4327
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:19,589
holding previous day value area high.
But, you know, I'm not up at this time,

4328
01:55:19,589 --> 01:55:19,599
But, you know, I'm not up at this time,
 

4329
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:23,109
But, you know, I'm not up at this time,
but if you are, that's such a nice trade

4330
01:55:23,109 --> 01:55:23,119
but if you are, that's such a nice trade
 

4331
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:25,750
but if you are, that's such a nice trade
of first, I don't know, 600 7 a.m. this

4332
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:25,760
of first, I don't know, 600 7 a.m. this
 

4333
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,350
of first, I don't know, 600 7 a.m. this
morning. That's 3:00 a.m. for me. That's

4334
01:55:27,350 --> 01:55:27,360
morning. That's 3:00 a.m. for me. That's
 

4335
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,750
morning. That's 3:00 a.m. for me. That's
a really, really simple trade. Look at

4336
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:29,760
a really, really simple trade. Look at
 

4337
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,870
a really, really simple trade. Look at
how we built the liquidity.

4338
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:32,880
how we built the liquidity.
 

4339
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:35,350
how we built the liquidity.
There you go. Off to the races. That's

4340
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:35,360
There you go. Off to the races. That's
 

4341
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,189
There you go. Off to the races. That's
because of this and the gap. That's a

4342
01:55:37,189 --> 01:55:37,199
because of this and the gap. That's a
 

4343
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:39,669
because of this and the gap. That's a
good long location. Perfect. I don't

4344
01:55:39,669 --> 01:55:39,679
good long location. Perfect. I don't
 

4345
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:43,109
good long location. Perfect. I don't
want to be long up here now.

4346
01:55:43,109 --> 01:55:43,119
want to be long up here now.
 

4347
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:47,830
want to be long up here now.
526 points higher. No, thank you.

4348
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:47,840
526 points higher. No, thank you.
 

4349
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,550
526 points higher. No, thank you.
No, thank you.

4350
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:50,560
No, thank you.
 

4351
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,550
No, thank you.
Why is this just whole thing just moved?

4352
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:52,560
Why is this just whole thing just moved?
 

4353
01:55:52,560 --> 01:56:01,109
Why is this just whole thing just moved?
There we go.

4354
01:56:01,109 --> 01:56:01,119

 

4355
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:02,229

Nice. Yeah, if you're just playing the

4356
01:56:02,229 --> 01:56:02,239
Nice. Yeah, if you're just playing the
 

4357
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:03,589
Nice. Yeah, if you're just playing the
flow zone, I mean, they're playing if

4358
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:03,599
flow zone, I mean, they're playing if
 

4359
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:05,589
flow zone, I mean, they're playing if
even if you bought the IB. We didn't

4360
01:56:05,589 --> 01:56:05,599
even if you bought the IB. We didn't
 

4361
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:08,390
even if you bought the IB. We didn't
fail IB, right? So, I short here,

4362
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:08,400
fail IB, right? So, I short here,
 

4363
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,470
fail IB, right? So, I short here,
covered into that. Stopped that while I

4364
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:10,480
covered into that. Stopped that while I
 

4365
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:12,709
covered into that. Stopped that while I
was using the bathroom. But, I mean,

4366
01:56:12,709 --> 01:56:12,719
was using the bathroom. But, I mean,
 

4367
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:14,470
was using the bathroom. But, I mean,
flow zones and IB held. And there's your

4368
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:14,480
flow zones and IB held. And there's your
 

4369
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,709
flow zones and IB held. And there's your
flag. If they hold this, there's that.

4370
01:56:16,709 --> 01:56:16,719
flag. If they hold this, there's that.
 

4371
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:18,709
flag. If they hold this, there's that.
If they fail this, that can still

4372
01:56:18,709 --> 01:56:18,719
If they fail this, that can still
 

4373
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:21,350
If they fail this, that can still
happen. But

4374
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:21,360
happen. But
 

4375
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,270
happen. But
I think the target at this point's up

4376
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:23,280
I think the target at this point's up
 

4377
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,390
I think the target at this point's up
here. It's where they're trying to get

4378
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,400
here. It's where they're trying to get
 

4379
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,550
here. It's where they're trying to get
the wall up there. Where's ES trading

4380
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,560
the wall up there. Where's ES trading
 

4381
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,270
the wall up there. Where's ES trading
into? Above the 700s. Where's the

4382
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:31,280

4383
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:34,229
into? Above the 700s. Where's the
spiders? Trying to get back to 670s. Q's

4384
01:56:34,229 --> 01:56:34,239
spiders? Trying to get back to 670s. Q's
 

4385
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:39,270
spiders? Trying to get back to 670s. Q's
back above the 600s.

4386
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:39,280

 

4387
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:43,669

It's a bit better. I still don't think

4396
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:08,000
It's a bit better. I still don't think
 

4397
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,750
It's a bit better. I still don't think
it's done.

4398
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:09,760
it's done.
 

4399
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,109
it's done.
I think they're just going to keep going

I think they're just going to keep going
 

4401

I think they're just going to keep going
and going and going.

from previous week value area high. You
 

4409
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:55,669
from previous week value area high. You
might as well get there at this point.

4410
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:55,679

4429
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,310

I really hope that dip on Thursday and

4430
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:30,320
I really hope that dip on Thursday and
 

4431
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:35,109
I really hope that dip on Thursday and
Friday is not the end

4432
01:58:35,109 --> 01:58:35,119
Friday is not the end
 

4433
01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:37,270
Friday is not the end
of this rally because I didn't get any

4434
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:37,280
of this rally because I didn't get any
 

4435
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,990
of this rally because I didn't get any
positions in long term

4436
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:40,000
positions in long term
 

4437
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,430
positions in long term
or the start of this rally I should say.

4438
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:41,440
or the start of this rally I should say.
 

4439
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,910
or the start of this rally I should say.
I really hope we go much lower

4440
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:43,920
I really hope we go much lower
 

4441
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:51,589
I really hope we go much lower
selfishly.

4442
01:58:51,589 --> 01:58:51,599

 

4443
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,430

850 here on the book for those of you

4444
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:53,440
850 here on the book for those of you
 

4445
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,430
850 here on the book for those of you
who are long. 850 on the book and then

4446
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:55,440
who are long. 850 on the book and then
 

4447
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,350
who are long. 850 on the book and then
880. I'm just giving you the reads on

4448
01:58:57,350 --> 01:58:57,360
880. I'm just giving you the reads on
 

4449
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:59,589
880. I'm just giving you the reads on
the book. And then 900.

4450
01:58:59,589 --> 01:58:59,599
the book. And then 900.
 

4451
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:01,750
the book. And then 900.
Uh that's where the liquidity is set.

4452
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:01,760
Uh that's where the liquidity is set.
 

4453
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:05,990
Uh that's where the liquidity is set.
And I'd say 880 890 gets thick. And then

4454
01:59:05,990 --> 01:59:06,000
And I'd say 880 890 gets thick. And then
 

4455
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,510
And I'd say 880 890 gets thick. And then
a previous week value area high up

4456
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:07,520
a previous week value area high up
 

4457
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:11,430
a previous week value area high up
there. 945. This is a straight squeeze.

4458
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:11,440
there. 945. This is a straight squeeze.
 

4459
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,910
there. 945. This is a straight squeeze.
What is a measured move off IB right

4460
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:13,920
What is a measured move off IB right
 

4461
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,669
What is a measured move off IB right
now?

4462
01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:15,679
now?
 

4463
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,189
now?
Where is it? 1.5.

4464
01:59:19,189 --> 01:59:19,199

 

4465
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:21,750

basically 900.

4466
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:21,760
basically 900.
 

4467
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:26,149
basically 900.
It looks doable.

4468
01:59:26,149 --> 01:59:26,159

 

4469
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,669

4471
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:29,990
I mean, everything's held. It's
impressive.

4472
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,000
impressive.
 

4473
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:42,310
impressive.
That's your channel.

4474
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:42,320

Also, so are no news days. It's a drift

4480
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:50,159
Also, so are no news days. It's a drift
 

4481

higher event.

4482

02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:02,960
Like, it's cut through if you think
 

4487
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:05,350

levels that we were looking at today,
 

4491
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:09,589

one. There was one up here I deleted.
 

4497
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,390

every level is turning into an RBS. So,
 

4501

it's really impressive.
 

4503
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:23,430
it's really impressive.
This might look not look like match, but

4504
02:00:23,430 --> 02:00:23,440
This might look not look like match, but
 

4505
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:26,390
This might look not look like match, but

Pretty impressive. This is uh blowing

02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:30,960
Pretty impressive. This is uh blowing
 

4511
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:32,229
Pretty impressive. This is uh blowing
out shorts at this point. This is

4512
02:00:32,229 --> 02:00:32,239
out shorts at this point. This is
 

4513
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:34,149
out shorts at this point. This is
getting uh

4514
02:00:34,149 --> 02:00:34,159
getting uh
 

4515
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:36,310
getting uh
very squeezy.

4516
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:36,320
very squeezy.
 

4517
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,070
very squeezy.
It's definitely blowing out shorts. They

4518
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:38,080
It's definitely blowing out shorts. They
 

4519
02:00:38,080 --> 02:01:04,950
It's definitely blowing out shorts. They
just got blown out there. That last bit.

4520
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:04,960

 

4521
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,229

Wait, I got pre.

4522
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:08,239
Wait, I got pre.
 

4523
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:11,669
Wait, I got pre.
Sorry.

4524
02:01:11,669 --> 02:01:11,679

 

4525
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:13,669

Did we just trade into this? No, not

4526
02:01:13,669 --> 02:01:13,679
Did we just trade into this? No, not
 

4527
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:16,070
Did we just trade into this? No, not
yet.

4528
02:01:16,070 --> 02:01:16,080
yet.
 

4529
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:19,510
yet.
Not yet.

4530
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:19,520

 

4531
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:20,629

Yeah. I mean, if you're playing

4532
02:01:20,629 --> 02:01:20,639
Yeah. I mean, if you're playing
 

4533
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:21,910
Yeah. I mean, if you're playing
patterns, yeah, you could say it's a

4534
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:21,920
patterns, yeah, you could say it's a
 

4535
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,910
patterns, yeah, you could say it's a
rising wedge coming into a level of

4536
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:23,920
rising wedge coming into a level of
 

4537
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:27,030
rising wedge coming into a level of
interest,

4538
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:27,040

 

4539
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,550

which would be a bearish pattern

4540
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:28,560
which would be a bearish pattern
 

4541
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:31,510
which would be a bearish pattern
technically.

4542
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:31,520
technically.
 

4543
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:34,470
technically.
Not really huge amount of a pattern

4544
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:34,480
Not really huge amount of a pattern
 

4545
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,910
Not really huge amount of a pattern

02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,109
wedges and stuff.
Just trading what the volume's doing and

4550
02:01:41,109 --> 02:01:41,119
Just trading what the volume's doing and
 

4551
02:01:41,119 --> 02:02:01,830
Just trading what the volume's doing and
what the levels are telling me

4552
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:01,840

 

4553
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,430

02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:05,440
a minute, folks.
 

4557

Head pain starting to dissipate a bit.

02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:12,400
Head pain starting to dissipate a bit.

Head pain starting to dissipate a bit.

Tomorrow we'll talk about it tomorrow.

So big sales coming
tomorrow on Funded Next. We'll do that

4596
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:42,000

Uh

4600
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:46,880
Uh
 

4601
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:49,030
Uh
Tuesday, Wednesday, maybe Friday. I'm

4602
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:49,040
Tuesday, Wednesday, maybe Friday. I'm
 

4603
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,149
Tuesday, Wednesday, maybe Friday. I'm
not going to guarantee Friday, but

4604
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:50,159
not going to guarantee Friday, but
 

4605
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:52,709
not going to guarantee Friday, but
Tuesday, Wednesday, assuming I'll feel

4606
02:03:52,709 --> 02:03:52,719
Tuesday, Wednesday, assuming I'll feel
 

4607
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:54,790
Tuesday, Wednesday, assuming I'll feel
better than this tomorrow. Tuesday,

4608
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:54,800
better than this tomorrow. Tuesday,
 

4609
02:03:54,800 --> 02:04:04,229
better than this tomorrow. Tuesday,
Wednesday for sure.

4610
02:04:04,229 --> 02:04:04,239

 

4611
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:07,589

Some passive selling up there and

4612
02:04:07,589 --> 02:04:07,599
Some passive selling up there and
 

4613
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:09,189
Some passive selling up there and
a little bit of excess on that last

4614
02:04:09,189 --> 02:04:09,199
a little bit of excess on that last
 

4615
02:04:09,199 --> 02:04:10,709
a little bit of excess on that last
move. I still think they just want to

4616
02:04:10,709 --> 02:04:10,719
move. I still think they just want to
 

4617
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:15,030
move. I still think they just want to
continue to move higher.

4618
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:15,040

 

4619
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:17,109

Don't see

4620
02:04:17,109 --> 02:04:17,119
Don't see
 

4621
02:04:17,119 --> 02:04:20,310
Don't see
anything else yet, but uh it's a weird

4622
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:20,320
anything else yet, but uh it's a weird
 

4623
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:23,030
anything else yet, but uh it's a weird
one.

4624
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:23,040
one.
 

4625
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:28,470
one.
Certainly a weird one.

4626
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:28,480

 

4627
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,470

This

4628
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:30,480
This
 

4629
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:32,950
This
50s sellers could try take char 50s, but

4630
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:32,960
50s sellers could try take char 50s, but
 

4631
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,070
50s sellers could try take char 50s, but
you might as well just finish the

4632
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:34,080
you might as well just finish the
 

4633
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:35,669
you might as well just finish the
rotation to 900. So, it doesn't really

4634
02:04:35,669 --> 02:04:35,679
rotation to 900. So, it doesn't really
 

4635
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:39,189
rotation to 900. So, it doesn't really
make sense what you're doing here, guys.

4636
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:39,199
make sense what you're doing here, guys.
 

4637
02:04:39,199 --> 02:04:42,790
make sense what you're doing here, guys.
What these guys are playing at.

4638
02:04:42,790 --> 02:04:42,800
What these guys are playing at.
 

4639
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:44,070
What these guys are playing at.
They should just go to higher at this

4640
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:44,080
They should just go to higher at this
 

4641
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:46,310
They should just go to higher at this
point, but it doesn't look like they've

4642
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:46,320
point, but it doesn't look like they've
 

4643
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:48,149
point, but it doesn't look like they've
got the juice right now. They should

4644
02:04:48,149 --> 02:04:48,159
got the juice right now. They should
 

4645
02:04:48,159 --> 02:04:56,950
got the juice right now. They should
just go higher.

4646
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:56,960

 

4647
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,669

They need a pullback first. Maybe they

4648
02:04:59,669 --> 02:04:59,679
They need a pullback first. Maybe they
 

4649
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:02,950
They need a pullback first. Maybe they
should go higher, but uh

4650
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:02,960
should go higher, but uh
 

4651
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,709
should go higher, but uh
tape slowed right down. Looks like they

4652
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:04,719
tape slowed right down. Looks like they
 

4653
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:38,229
tape slowed right down. Looks like they
struggled on that last push.

4654
02:05:38,229 --> 02:05:38,239

 

4655
02:05:38,239 --> 02:05:40,149

What's the big red zone on my chart?

4656
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:40,159
What's the big red zone on my chart?
 

4657
02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:42,629
What's the big red zone on my chart?
It's a potential supply block based on

4658
02:05:42,629 --> 02:05:42,639
It's a potential supply block based on
 

4659
02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:44,149
It's a potential supply block based on
volume.

4660
02:05:44,149 --> 02:05:44,159
volume.
 

4661
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:45,750
volume.
It's where I think they want to target

4662
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:45,760
It's where I think they want to target
 

4663
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:48,470
It's where I think they want to target
up into and probably up here. It's that

4664
02:05:48,470 --> 02:05:48,480
up into and probably up here. It's that
 

4665
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,790
up into and probably up here. It's that
ultimate target.

4666
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:50,800
ultimate target.
 

4667
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,990
ultimate target.
And then if they get out there, I might

4668
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:52,000
And then if they get out there, I might
 

4669
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,390
And then if they get out there, I might
as well go 25,000.

4670
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:56,400

 

4671
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,070

And these buyers are struggling to move

4672
02:05:58,070 --> 02:05:58,080
And these buyers are struggling to move
 

4673
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:00,149
And these buyers are struggling to move
higher at this point. They've had a

4674
02:06:00,149 --> 02:06:00,159
higher at this point. They've had a
 

4675
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:01,589
higher at this point. They've had a
couple attempts up here and they are

4676
02:06:01,589 --> 02:06:01,599
couple attempts up here and they are
 

4677
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:03,030
couple attempts up here and they are
struggling. They should be moving

4678
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,040
struggling. They should be moving
 

4679
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,229
struggling. They should be moving
higher. They're struggling. I wonder if

4680
02:06:04,229 --> 02:06:04,239
higher. They're struggling. I wonder if
 

4681
02:06:04,239 --> 02:06:05,910
higher. They're struggling. I wonder if
there's deeper pullback needed in this

4682
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:05,920
there's deeper pullback needed in this
 

4683
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,669
there's deeper pullback needed in this
market at this point. These guys are

4684
02:06:07,669 --> 02:06:07,679
market at this point. These guys are
 

4685
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:08,950
market at this point. These guys are
struggling up here. Here you go. So,

4686
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:08,960
struggling up here. Here you go. So,
 

4687
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,310
struggling up here. Here you go. So,
starting to see that flush now. I was

4688
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:10,320
starting to see that flush now. I was
 

4689
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,470
starting to see that flush now. I was
just talking about this. You could see

4690
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:12,480
just talking about this. You could see
 

4691
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,709
just talking about this. You could see
it on the tape. They had a few attempts

4692
02:06:14,709 --> 02:06:14,719
it on the tape. They had a few attempts
 

4693
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:17,350
it on the tape. They had a few attempts
and they just they had no juice left.

4694
02:06:17,350 --> 02:06:17,360
and they just they had no juice left.
 

4695
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:19,910
and they just they had no juice left.
There is nothing left. I would say now

4696
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:19,920
There is nothing left. I would say now
 

4697
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:22,390
There is nothing left. I would say now
if sellers take control of 60s, they can

4698
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:22,400
if sellers take control of 60s, they can
 

4699
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:24,629
if sellers take control of 60s, they can
move lower. is it's a horrible area to

4700
02:06:24,629 --> 02:06:24,639
move lower. is it's a horrible area to
 

4701
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:27,189
move lower. is it's a horrible area to
think about shorting against because

4702
02:06:27,189 --> 02:06:27,199
think about shorting against because
 

4703
02:06:27,199 --> 02:06:29,910
think about shorting against because
they've got low hanging fruits higher

4704
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:29,920
they've got low hanging fruits higher
 

4705
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,669
they've got low hanging fruits higher
right now to go and take I'm certainly

4706
02:06:31,669 --> 02:06:31,679
right now to go and take I'm certainly
 

4707
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:33,830
right now to go and take I'm certainly
not doing anything but was just

4708
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:33,840
not doing anything but was just
 

4709
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,189
not doing anything but was just
observing the tape there and you could

4710
02:06:35,189 --> 02:06:35,199
observing the tape there and you could
 

4711
02:06:35,199 --> 02:06:36,790
observing the tape there and you could
just see the buyers were really

4712
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:36,800
just see the buyers were really
 

4713
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,189
just see the buyers were really
struggling. There was no one interested

4714
02:06:39,189 --> 02:06:39,199
struggling. There was no one interested
 

4715
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:44,629
struggling. There was no one interested
in auctioning this higher above 60.

4716
02:06:44,629 --> 02:06:44,639

 

4717
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:46,550

Yeah. So the the red zone is based on

4718
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:46,560
Yeah. So the the red zone is based on
 

4719
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:49,910
Yeah. So the the red zone is based on
volume. So

4720
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:49,920
volume. So
 

4721
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:53,669
volume. So
you guys time.

4722
02:06:53,669 --> 02:06:53,679
you guys time.
 

4723
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:56,310
you guys time.
Okay, here

4724
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:56,320
Okay, here
 

4725
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:00,229
Okay, here
previous week. You see this? Oh,

4726
02:07:00,229 --> 02:07:00,239
previous week. You see this? Oh,
 

4727
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,870
previous week. You see this? Oh,
where's my arrow? This here. All right,

4728
02:07:02,870 --> 02:07:02,880
where's my arrow? This here. All right,
 

4729
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:04,390
where's my arrow? This here. All right,
this is where we built out liquidity

4730
02:07:04,390 --> 02:07:04,400
this is where we built out liquidity
 

4731
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,709
this is where we built out liquidity
here represented by this volume

4732
02:07:06,709 --> 02:07:06,719
here represented by this volume
 

4733
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:08,470
here represented by this volume
represented by a resistance level that

4734
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:08,480
represented by a resistance level that
 

4735
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:10,149
represented by a resistance level that
we then bid through and we flushed

4736
02:07:10,149 --> 02:07:10,159
we then bid through and we flushed
 

4737
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:11,430
we then bid through and we flushed
straight back down through it. And it's

4738
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:11,440
straight back down through it. And it's
 

4739
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:14,470
straight back down through it. And it's
also previous week value area high. If

4740
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:14,480
also previous week value area high. If
 

4741
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:15,830
also previous week value area high. If
they trade through this level, then my

4742
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:15,840
they trade through this level, then my
 

4743
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,189
they trade through this level, then my
expectation is that we come and trade

4744
02:07:17,189 --> 02:07:17,199
expectation is that we come and trade
 

4745
02:07:17,199 --> 02:07:20,390
expectation is that we come and trade
into these lows 25,000. We trade through

4746
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:20,400
into these lows 25,000. We trade through
 

4747
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:23,990
into these lows 25,000. We trade through
that, like I said, above 25 350, which

4748
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:24,000
that, like I said, above 25 350, which
 

4749
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,430
that, like I said, above 25 350, which
is where that last bull trap happened,

4750
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:25,440
is where that last bull trap happened,
 

4751
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,510
is where that last bull trap happened,
above there, bulls, if they can trade

4752
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:27,520
above there, bulls, if they can trade
 

4753
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,030
above there, bulls, if they can trade
above and base above. There's a big

4754
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,040
above and base above. There's a big
 

4755
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,390
above and base above. There's a big
difference between just getting up to

4756
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:30,400
difference between just getting up to
 

4757
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:34,390
difference between just getting up to
there and potentially hold um for a big

4758
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:34,400
there and potentially hold um for a big
 

4759
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,310
there and potentially hold um for a big
old squeeze out, but uh we're nowhere

4760
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:36,320
old squeeze out, but uh we're nowhere
 

4761
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:39,109
old squeeze out, but uh we're nowhere
near that yet. So, we judge that if and

4762
02:07:39,109 --> 02:07:39,119
near that yet. So, we judge that if and
 

4763
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:54,950
near that yet. So, we judge that if and
when we get there.

4764
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:54,960

 

4765
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,589

responded next use end of day in all

4766
02:07:57,589 --> 02:07:57,599
responded next use end of day in all
 

4767
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:00,470
responded next use end of day in all
stages for the tests. Uh, yes, I believe

4768
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:00,480
stages for the tests. Uh, yes, I believe
 

4769
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:03,350
stages for the tests. Uh, yes, I believe
so. I've only traded the um legacy, but

4770
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:03,360
so. I've only traded the um legacy, but
 

4771
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:07,910
so. I've only traded the um legacy, but
I believe so. Yes,

4772
02:08:07,910 --> 02:08:07,920

 

4773
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:22,229

I'll check now. Hang on.

4774
02:08:22,229 --> 02:08:22,239

 

4775
02:08:22,239 --> 02:08:23,750

Well, everything works saying does

4776
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:23,760
Well, everything works saying does
 

4777
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,750
Well, everything works saying does
Fibonacci work. It's it definitely works

4778
02:08:25,750 --> 02:08:25,760
Fibonacci work. It's it definitely works
 

4779
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:27,589
Fibonacci work. It's it definitely works
as a point of interest, but you you

4780
02:08:27,589 --> 02:08:27,599
as a point of interest, but you you
 

4781
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:30,709
as a point of interest, but you you
can't just trade off a level.

4782
02:08:30,709 --> 02:08:30,719
can't just trade off a level.
 

4783
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:33,030
can't just trade off a level.
You have to trade off how do we react

4784
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:33,040
You have to trade off how do we react
 

4785
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:35,990
You have to trade off how do we react
when we get to a level?

4786
02:08:35,990 --> 02:08:36,000
when we get to a level?
 

4787
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,750
when we get to a level?
Yeah. End of day. Who asked for that?

4788
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:37,760
Yeah. End of day. Who asked for that?
 

4789
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,229
Yeah. End of day. Who asked for that?
Um,

4790
02:08:40,229 --> 02:08:40,239
Um,
 

4791
02:08:40,239 --> 02:08:42,790
Um,
Naveen. Yes, end of day. I've just

4792
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:42,800
Naveen. Yes, end of day. I've just
 

4793
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,669
Naveen. Yes, end of day. I've just
checked. So, Legacy and Rapids are both

4794
02:08:45,669 --> 02:08:45,679
checked. So, Legacy and Rapids are both
 

4795
02:08:45,679 --> 02:08:55,270
checked. So, Legacy and Rapids are both
end of day.

4796
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,280

 

4797
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,709

Still auctioning high. Like I said, it

4798
02:08:56,709 --> 02:08:56,719
Still auctioning high. Like I said, it
 

4799
02:08:56,719 --> 02:08:58,149
Still auctioning high. Like I said, it
shouldn't have stopped there, but maybe

4800
02:08:58,149 --> 02:08:58,159
shouldn't have stopped there, but maybe
 

4801
02:08:58,159 --> 02:08:59,510
shouldn't have stopped there, but maybe
they just needed a little pullback to

4802
02:08:59,510 --> 02:08:59,520
they just needed a little pullback to
 

4803
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:02,390
they just needed a little pullback to
trap some bears in. Reason to go higher

4804
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:02,400
trap some bears in. Reason to go higher
 

4805
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,990
trap some bears in. Reason to go higher
right now is to come into previous week

4806
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:04,000
right now is to come into previous week
 

4807
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,350
right now is to come into previous week
value area high. You might as well

4808
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:07,360
value area high. You might as well
 

4809
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:09,189
value area high. You might as well
Some of you were long from previous week

4810
02:09:09,189 --> 02:09:09,199
Some of you were long from previous week
 

4811
02:09:09,199 --> 02:09:10,790
Some of you were long from previous week
value area low. Are you still Are you

4812
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:10,800
value area low. Are you still Are you
 

4813
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,950
value area low. Are you still Are you
still long, folks? Or previous day,

4814
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:12,960
still long, folks? Or previous day,
 

4815
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,629
still long, folks? Or previous day,
sorry.

4816
02:09:14,629 --> 02:09:14,639
sorry.
 

4817
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:16,310
sorry.
We're about to complete a rotation from

4818
02:09:16,310 --> 02:09:16,320
We're about to complete a rotation from
 

4819
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:19,350
We're about to complete a rotation from
previous day value area high to previous

4820
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:19,360
previous day value area high to previous
 

4821
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:22,069
previous day value area high to previous
week value area high. That is

4822
02:09:22,069 --> 02:09:22,079
week value area high. That is
 

4823
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:23,910
week value area high. That is
impressive. From a daily to a weekly

4824
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:23,920
impressive. From a daily to a weekly
 

4825
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:28,149
impressive. From a daily to a weekly
level in one go.

4826
02:09:28,149 --> 02:09:28,159

 

4827
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:31,270

What a market. What a market. It's not

4828
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:31,280
What a market. What a market. It's not
 

4829
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:32,950
What a market. What a market. It's not
normal to be able to do that in one go.

4830
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:32,960
normal to be able to do that in one go.
 

4831
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:38,149
normal to be able to do that in one go.
Not when the range is

4832
02:09:38,149 --> 02:09:38,159

 

4833
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:40,310

Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 500 plus

4834
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:40,320
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 500 plus
 

4835
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:45,669
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 500 plus
points.

4836
02:09:45,669 --> 02:09:45,679

 

4837
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:47,910

Do I manually draw my VP or do I use

4838
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:47,920
Do I manually draw my VP or do I use
 

4839
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:51,750
Do I manually draw my VP or do I use
PVP? Uh, I'm so I manually draw uh

4840
02:09:51,750 --> 02:09:51,760
PVP? Uh, I'm so I manually draw uh
 

4841
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:54,629
PVP? Uh, I'm so I manually draw uh
previous week levels.

4842
02:09:54,629 --> 02:09:54,639
previous week levels.
 

4843
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:58,629
previous week levels.
Um, PVP I do use on the 30 minute bars

4844
02:09:58,629 --> 02:09:58,639
Um, PVP I do use on the 30 minute bars
 

4845
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:02,069
Um, PVP I do use on the 30 minute bars
on a side monitor,

4846
02:10:02,069 --> 02:10:02,079
on a side monitor,
 

4847
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:03,669
on a side monitor,
but I'm just interested in where the

4848
02:10:03,669 --> 02:10:03,679
but I'm just interested in where the
 

4849
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:06,310
but I'm just interested in where the
volume is on each 30 minute bar. See,

4850
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:06,320
volume is on each 30 minute bar. See,
 

4851
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:08,550
volume is on each 30 minute bar. See,
today we've just all we've done today is

4852
02:10:08,550 --> 02:10:08,560
today we've just all we've done today is
 

4853
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,310
today we've just all we've done today is
move value higher and point of control

4854
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:10,320
move value higher and point of control
 

4855
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:13,510
move value higher and point of control
higher. That's all we've done. We've

4856
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:13,520
higher. That's all we've done. We've
 

4857
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:16,310
higher. That's all we've done. We've
never traded uh and closed under a

4858
02:10:16,310 --> 02:10:16,320
never traded uh and closed under a
 

4859
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:18,709
never traded uh and closed under a
previous 30 minute point of control or

4860
02:10:18,709 --> 02:10:18,719
previous 30 minute point of control or
 

4861
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:20,310
previous 30 minute point of control or
value. We're just we're just walking

4862
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:20,320
value. We're just we're just walking
 

4863
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:31,430
value. We're just we're just walking
higher, just squeezing higher.

4864
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:31,440

 

4865
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:34,149

Oh, you got one M andQ. What from

4866
02:10:34,149 --> 02:10:34,159
Oh, you got one M andQ. What from
 

4867
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:36,629
Oh, you got one M andQ. What from
previous day value area high up to this?

4868
02:10:36,629 --> 02:10:36,639
previous day value area high up to this?
 

4869
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:38,629
previous day value area high up to this?
It's it's a great trade. 500 point say

4870
02:10:38,629 --> 02:10:38,639
It's it's a great trade. 500 point say
 

4871
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:42,709
It's it's a great trade. 500 point say
one one MNQ, but one MQ for 500 points

4872
02:10:42,709 --> 02:10:42,719
one one MNQ, but one MQ for 500 points
 

4873
02:10:42,719 --> 02:10:45,350
one one MNQ, but one MQ for 500 points
is what a,000 bucks.

4874
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:45,360
is what a,000 bucks.
 

4875
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:47,669
is what a,000 bucks.
It's nothing to scoff at. That's really

4876
02:10:47,669 --> 02:10:47,679
It's nothing to scoff at. That's really
 

4877
02:10:47,679 --> 02:11:03,350
It's nothing to scoff at. That's really
good.

4878
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:03,360

 

4879
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:09,910

Yes. Tesa 7%. That 420 is important.

4880
02:11:09,910 --> 02:11:09,920

 

4881
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:11,750

I mean,

4882
02:11:11,750 --> 02:11:11,760
I mean,
 

4883
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:15,350
I mean,
I think it's too early, Peter. I mean,

4884
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:15,360
I think it's too early, Peter. I mean,
 

4885
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:19,109
I think it's too early, Peter. I mean,
I had two questions right in my mind.

4886
02:11:19,109 --> 02:11:19,119
I had two questions right in my mind.
 

4887
02:11:19,119 --> 02:11:22,470
I had two questions right in my mind.
Was that a forced flush? So that, and we

4888
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:22,480
Was that a forced flush? So that, and we
 

4889
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:24,310
Was that a forced flush? So that, and we
talked about it last week, so that hedge

4890
02:11:24,310 --> 02:11:24,320
talked about it last week, so that hedge
 

4891
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:25,510
talked about it last week, so that hedge
funds could get long because they

4892
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:25,520
funds could get long because they
 

4893
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,950
funds could get long because they
haven't been long all year, so that they

4894
02:11:26,950 --> 02:11:26,960
haven't been long all year, so that they
 

4895
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,069
haven't been long all year, so that they
make their bonus.

4896
02:11:30,069 --> 02:11:30,079
make their bonus.
 

4897
02:11:30,079 --> 02:11:32,950
make their bonus.
Time will tell. Um, I'm not convinced

4898
02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:32,960
Time will tell. Um, I'm not convinced
 

4899
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:36,310
Time will tell. Um, I'm not convinced
the lows in yet, but uh,

4900
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:36,320
the lows in yet, but uh,
 

4901
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,990
the lows in yet, but uh,
we can only trade what's in front of us.

4902
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:38,000
we can only trade what's in front of us.
 

4903
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,629
we can only trade what's in front of us.
What I will be annoyed is is if we do

4904
02:11:40,629 --> 02:11:40,639
What I will be annoyed is is if we do
 

4905
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:43,510
What I will be annoyed is is if we do
make new highs this year, um, I didn't

4906
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:43,520
make new highs this year, um, I didn't
 

4907
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:47,430
make new highs this year, um, I didn't
get any QQ position filled to go long.

4908
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:47,440
get any QQ position filled to go long.
 

4909
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,350
get any QQ position filled to go long.
That will piss me off. I'll be honest.

4910
02:11:49,350 --> 02:11:49,360
That will piss me off. I'll be honest.
 

4911
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,589
That will piss me off. I'll be honest.
That will really annoy me. Okay, getting

4912
02:11:51,589 --> 02:11:51,599
That will really annoy me. Okay, getting
 

4913
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:53,430
That will really annoy me. Okay, getting
very close to this uh edge of volume

4914
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:53,440
very close to this uh edge of volume
 

4915
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,910
very close to this uh edge of volume
here.

4916
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:55,920
here.
 

4917
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:59,109
here.
This red block. Make sure I've got it in

4918
02:11:59,109 --> 02:11:59,119
This red block. Make sure I've got it in
 

4919
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:01,589
This red block. Make sure I've got it in
the right area.

4920
02:12:01,589 --> 02:12:01,599
the right area.
 

4921
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:04,790
the right area.
Yeah, it is.

4922
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:04,800
Yeah, it is.
 

4923
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:12,470
Yeah, it is.
I'd argue that's got moved down.

4924
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:12,480

 

4925
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:14,950

Okay, so that's previous week value high

4926
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:14,960
Okay, so that's previous week value high
 

4927
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:20,069
Okay, so that's previous week value high
up there.

4928
02:12:20,069 --> 02:12:20,079

 

4929
02:12:20,079 --> 02:12:36,870

through that gets a bit thinner.

4930
02:12:36,870 --> 02:12:36,880

 

4931
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,629

Make sure your settings are the same on

4932
02:12:38,629 --> 02:12:38,639
Make sure your settings are the same on
 

4933
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,470
Make sure your settings are the same on
PvP. Might be because of that. It might

4934
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:40,480
PvP. Might be because of that. It might
 

4935
02:12:40,480 --> 02:13:09,750
PvP. Might be because of that. It might
be reading tick or bars differently.

4936
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:09,760

 

4937
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,870

Maybe Kevin, maybe it doesn't come, you

4938
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:12,880
Maybe Kevin, maybe it doesn't come, you
 

4939
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,350
Maybe Kevin, maybe it doesn't come, you
know. Who knows?

4940
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
know. Who knows?
 

4941
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:19,669
know. Who knows?
Only play what's in front of us.

4942
02:13:19,669 --> 02:13:19,679

 

4943
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:20,870

It's certainly not a level I'm

4944
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:20,880
It's certainly not a level I'm
 

4945
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:27,430
It's certainly not a level I'm
interested in longing up here.

4946
02:13:27,430 --> 02:13:27,440

 

4947
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:29,750

It's just been squeeze up all day.

4948
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:29,760
It's just been squeeze up all day.
 

4949
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,750
It's just been squeeze up all day.
Relief all day. Tell you what though,

4950
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:31,760
Relief all day. Tell you what though,
 

4951
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,270
Relief all day. Tell you what though,
the VIX has found that bid at that low

4952
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:33,280
the VIX has found that bid at that low
 

4953
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:34,390
the VIX has found that bid at that low
of day that we talked about. It's right

4954
02:13:34,390 --> 02:13:34,400
of day that we talked about. It's right
 

4955
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:37,430
of day that we talked about. It's right
at the bottom of my blue box into 21. It

4956
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:37,440
at the bottom of my blue box into 21. It
 

4957
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:42,629
at the bottom of my blue box into 21. It
has found a bid there

4958
02:13:42,629 --> 02:13:42,639

 

4959
02:13:42,639 --> 02:14:07,669

for now.

4960
02:14:07,669 --> 02:14:07,679

 

4961
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:09,669

Delta was pretty big on that high last

4962
02:14:09,669 --> 02:14:09,679
Delta was pretty big on that high last
 

4963
02:14:09,679 --> 02:14:11,589
Delta was pretty big on that high last
day push

4964
02:14:11,589 --> 02:14:11,599
day push
 

4965
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:23,109
day push
this candle. Delta there was pretty big.

4966
02:14:23,109 --> 02:14:23,119

 

4967
02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:25,189

Might as well get to 900 at this point,

4968
02:14:25,189 --> 02:14:25,199
Might as well get to 900 at this point,
 

4969
02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:29,030
Might as well get to 900 at this point,
which is one and a half IB.

4970
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,040
which is one and a half IB.
 

4971
02:14:29,040 --> 02:15:41,589
which is one and a half IB.
We'll go there.

4972
02:15:41,589 --> 02:15:41,599

 

4973
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:43,270

Yeah, we can do a giveaway. Have we got

4974
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:43,280
Yeah, we can do a giveaway. Have we got
 

4975
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:48,870
Yeah, we can do a giveaway. Have we got
the likes up? Sorry, I haven't looked.

4976
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:48,880

 

4977
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:52,069

We got to 150.

4978
02:15:52,069 --> 02:15:52,079
We got to 150.
 

4979
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:55,030
We got to 150.
No, I get to 150 and I'll do an Apex

4980
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:55,040
No, I get to 150 and I'll do an Apex
 

4981
02:15:55,040 --> 02:16:01,910
No, I get to 150 and I'll do an Apex
giveaway.

4982
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:01,920

 

4983
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:03,910

Way too late to be long up here, I I

4984
02:16:03,910 --> 02:16:03,920
Way too late to be long up here, I I
 

4985
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:05,430
Way too late to be long up here, I I
would say. I mean, it might still work,

4986
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:05,440
would say. I mean, it might still work,
 

4987
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,669
would say. I mean, it might still work,
but

4988
02:16:07,669 --> 02:16:07,679
but
 

4989
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:09,589
but
this is looking the same as earlier now.

4990
02:16:09,589 --> 02:16:09,599

02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:26,710
over again. I'm not con convinced
they've completed the auction. We have

5148
02:20:26,710 --> 02:20:26,720
they've completed the auction. We have
 

5149
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:28,389
they've completed the auction. We have
left buyers trapped at the highs now,

5150
02:20:28,389 --> 02:20:28,399
left buyers trapped at the highs now,
 

5151
02:20:28,399 --> 02:20:31,349
left buyers trapped at the highs now,
but not convinced that that is the end

5152
02:20:31,349 --> 02:20:31,359
but not convinced that that is the end
 

5153
02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:33,670
but not convinced that that is the end
of it today because we're so close. So,

5154
02:20:33,670 --> 02:20:33,680
of it today because we're so close. So,
 

5155
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:35,110
of it today because we're so close. So,
I might as well come and finish all of

5156
02:20:35,110 --> 02:20:35,120
I might as well come and finish all of
 

5157
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:39,270
I might as well come and finish all of
this. In my mind,

5158
02:20:39,270 --> 02:20:39,280
this. In my mind,
 

5159
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:40,710
this. In my mind,
I might as well come and finish the

5160
02:20:40,710 --> 02:20:40,720
I might as well come and finish the
 

5161
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:43,190
I might as well come and finish the
auction and complete it all. Or maybe

5162
02:20:43,190 --> 02:20:43,200
auction and complete it all. Or maybe
 

5163
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:46,070
auction and complete it all. Or maybe
they save it for later.

5164
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:46,080
they save it for later.
 

5165
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:50,230
they save it for later.
Who knows?

5166
02:20:50,230 --> 02:20:50,240

 

5167
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:54,150

5170
02:20:56,550 --> 02:20:56,560
that for like 5 10 minutes. That is
 

5171
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:58,950
that for like 5 10 minutes. That is
incredible.

5172

Starting to see a bit more selling into

5222
02:22:30,389 --> 02:22:30,399
Starting to see a bit more selling into
 

5223
02:22:30,399 --> 02:22:32,469
Starting to see a bit more selling into
the edge of this range. Looks just like

5224
02:22:32,469 --> 02:22:32,479
the edge of this range. Looks just like
 

5225
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:34,790
the edge of this range. Looks just like
earlier, but we've not left it yet. And

5226
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:34,800
earlier, but we've not left it yet. And
 

5227
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,389
earlier, but we've not left it yet. And
the thing is there's low hanging fruit

5228
02:22:36,389 --> 02:22:36,399
the thing is there's low hanging fruit
 

5229
02:22:36,399 --> 02:22:37,990
the thing is there's low hanging fruit
through or there's a rotation to

5230
02:22:37,990 --> 02:22:38,000
through or there's a rotation to
 

5231
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,510
through or there's a rotation to
complete above, which makes me a bit

5232
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:39,520
complete above, which makes me a bit
 

5233
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:42,550
complete above, which makes me a bit
nervy about taking a short here. But

5234
02:22:42,550 --> 02:22:42,560
nervy about taking a short here. But
 

5235
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:46,070
nervy about taking a short here. But
it's exactly the same setup as earlier.

5236
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:46,080
it's exactly the same setup as earlier.
 

5237
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:49,670
it's exactly the same setup as earlier.
Okay, small size in stopping the money

5238
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:49,680
Okay, small size in stopping the money
 

5239
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:51,429
Okay, small size in stopping the money
because I don't like that we're so close

5240
02:22:51,429 --> 02:22:51,439
because I don't like that we're so close
 

5241
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:52,950
because I don't like that we're so close
to that level from earlier. Watching

5242
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:52,960
to that level from earlier. Watching
 

5243
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:55,910
to that level from earlier. Watching
here if we can snap 50s.

5244
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:55,920
here if we can snap 50s.
 

5245
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:57,670
here if we can snap 50s.
Come on.

5246
02:22:57,670 --> 02:22:57,680
Come on.
 

5247
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:00,230
Come on.
You snap 50s and puke. So, we pull the

5248
02:23:00,230 --> 02:23:00,240
You snap 50s and puke. So, we pull the
 

5249
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:01,750
You snap 50s and puke. So, we pull the
winner straight after this. Exactly the

5250
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:01,760
winner straight after this. Exactly the
 

5251
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:03,190
winner straight after this. Exactly the
same setup as earlier. We're leaving a

5252
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:03,200
same setup as earlier. We're leaving a
 

5253
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:05,990
same setup as earlier. We're leaving a
shelf.

5254
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,000
shelf.
 

5255
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,230
shelf.
Take a little piece off here. Watching

5256
02:23:08,230 --> 02:23:08,240
Take a little piece off here. Watching
 

5257
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:11,429
Take a little piece off here. Watching
30s and 20s if they cover. Stopping at

5258
02:23:11,429 --> 02:23:11,439
30s and 20s if they cover. Stopping at
 

5259
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:15,750
30s and 20s if they cover. Stopping at
60s now.

02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:17,110

Is that a right start? That's probably

5262
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:17,120
Is that a right start? That's probably
 

5263
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:19,510
Is that a right start? That's probably
not the right start. Hang on. 64s.

5264
02:23:19,510 --> 02:23:19,520
not the right start. Hang on. 64s.

02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:51,750
Um if it offers fails, you need to focus
on volume. All right? So, it's just

02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:51,760
on volume. All right? So, it's just
 

5425
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:53,510
on volume. All right? So, it's just
trading level to level. If it offers a

5426
02:26:53,510 --> 02:26:53,520
trading level to level. If it offers a
 

5427
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:55,510
trading level to level. If it offers a
fail there, even if it does this, it's

02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:55,520
fail there, even if it does this, it's
 

5429
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:57,190
fail there, even if it does this, it's
level to level. It's level to level.

5438
02:27:08,469 --> 02:27:08,479
zone. I'd be more looking to see if it
 

5439
02:27:08,479 --> 02:27:09,910

peters out. If it doesn't peter out

5440
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:09,920
peters out. If it doesn't peter out
 

5441
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:12,230
peters out. If it doesn't peter out
today, maybe if they close it high,

5442
02:27:12,230 --> 02:27:12,240
today, maybe if they close it high,
 

5443
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:13,590
today, maybe if they close it high,
that's the important. Maybe if they

5444
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:13,600
that's the important. Maybe if they
 

5445
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,830
that's the important. Maybe if they
close it high, it peter out tomorrow.

5446
