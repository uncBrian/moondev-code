we will do giveaways during the stream.
All right, a quick review of what we had

18
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
All right, a quick review of what we had
 

19
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,550
All right, a quick review of what we had
last week then. All right, last week we

20
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
last week then. All right, last week we
 

21
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,309
last week then. All right, last week we
fulfilled what we hope would be the

22
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
fulfilled what we hope would be the
 

23
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,110
fulfilled what we hope would be the
obligation of this 200 day move and

24
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
obligation of this 200 day move and
 

25
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,029
obligation of this 200 day move and
we're finding a squeeze back up off it

26
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
we're finding a squeeze back up off it
 

27
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,270
we're finding a squeeze back up off it
on the Friday which we played long this

28
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
on the Friday which we played long this
 

29
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,230
on the Friday which we played long this
level here. All right, based on the last

30
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
level here. All right, based on the last
 

31
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,550
level here. All right, based on the last
12 months. All right, there's 12 months

32
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
12 months. All right, there's 12 months
 

33
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,270
12 months. All right, there's 12 months
of price action. This is the rotation

34
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
of price action. This is the rotation
 

35
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,070
of price action. This is the rotation
point. Okay, you can see it right here.

36
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
point. Okay, you can see it right here.
 

37
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,469
point. Okay, you can see it right here.
All right, the immediate rotation. So,

38
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
All right, the immediate rotation. So,
 

39
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,309
All right, the immediate rotation. So,
we're watching these levels. Okay, we're

40
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
we're watching these levels. Okay, we're
 

41
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,589
we're watching these levels. Okay, we're
watching sort of 9 950s right now. The

42
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
watching sort of 9 950s right now. The
 

43
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,270
watching sort of 9 950s right now. The
edge of this 950s. If we keep absorbing

44
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
edge of this 950s. If we keep absorbing
 

45
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,110
edge of this 950s. If we keep absorbing
950s,

46
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
950s,
 

47
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,070
950s,
there is potentially a back test towards

48
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
there is potentially a back test towards
 

49
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,749
there is potentially a back test towards
where we broke down from. All right,

50
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
where we broke down from. All right,
 

51
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,270
where we broke down from. All right,
25600s

52
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
25600s
 

53
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,309
25600s
uh maybe 25,500. So there is potentially

54
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
uh maybe 25,500. So there is potentially
 

55
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,309
uh maybe 25,500. So there is potentially
this move doesn't have to happen in one

56
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
this move doesn't have to happen in one
 

57
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,029
this move doesn't have to happen in one
week, but it's potentially there. If we

58
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
week, but it's potentially there. If we
 

59
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,029
week, but it's potentially there. If we
start seeing follow through underneath

60
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
start seeing follow through underneath
 

61
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,870
start seeing follow through underneath
this zone, then we're going to look for

62
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
this zone, then we're going to look for
 

63
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,110
this zone, then we're going to look for
a rotation back down towards these lows

64
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
a rotation back down towards these lows
 

65
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,950
a rotation back down towards these lows
where we have relative equal lows down

66
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
where we have relative equal lows down
 

67
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,350
where we have relative equal lows down
there. And you know, never know, maybe

68
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
there. And you know, never know, maybe
 

69
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,589
there. And you know, never know, maybe
we get the next leg down. We need to be

70
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
we get the next leg down. We need to be
 

71
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,350
we get the next leg down. We need to be
careful uh early on in this week for

72
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
careful uh early on in this week for
 

73
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,790
careful uh early on in this week for
this rotation. We have a bit of news

74
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
this rotation. We have a bit of news
 

75
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,710
this rotation. We have a bit of news
today, not a lot, mainly Fed speak, but

76
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
today, not a lot, mainly Fed speak, but
 

77
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,629
today, not a lot, mainly Fed speak, but
we did have some news overnight from

78
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
we did have some news overnight from
 

79
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,870
we did have some news overnight from
Japan and China. So originally what

80
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
Japan and China. So originally what
 

81
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,469
Japan and China. So originally what
happened in Japan was pretty bullish for

82
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
happened in Japan was pretty bullish for
 

83
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,550
happened in Japan was pretty bullish for
the market. Nikkeay finding a bid. We

84
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
the market. Nikkeay finding a bid. We
 

85
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,550
the market. Nikkeay finding a bid. We
thought maybe we'd go risk on then we

86
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
thought maybe we'd go risk on then we
 

87
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,110
thought maybe we'd go risk on then we
have some uh treasury and bond issues in

88
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
have some uh treasury and bond issues in
 

89
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,670
have some uh treasury and bond issues in
Asia now versus the US market giving us

90
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
Asia now versus the US market giving us
 

91
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,110
Asia now versus the US market giving us
this pullback. So we're watching this

92
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
this pullback. So we're watching this
 

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,029
this pullback. So we're watching this
level into here very very closely. All

94
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
level into here very very closely. All
 

95
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,990
level into here very very closely. All
right. Do we just do this for a few days

96
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
right. Do we just do this for a few days
 

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,230
right. Do we just do this for a few days
which is my expectation? Maybe we even

98
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
which is my expectation? Maybe we even
 

99
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,990
which is my expectation? Maybe we even
drift down and do this build out some

100
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
drift down and do this build out some
 

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,830
drift down and do this build out some
liquidity early on in the week and then

102
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
liquidity early on in the week and then
 

103
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,270
liquidity early on in the week and then
we can use it later on on the week.

104
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
we can use it later on on the week.
 

105
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,589
we can use it later on on the week.
because I think the first few days might

106
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
because I think the first few days might
 

107
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,670
because I think the first few days might
be a little bit more choppy than maybe

108
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
be a little bit more choppy than maybe
 

109
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,990
be a little bit more choppy than maybe
some of you had anticipated, but we will

110
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
some of you had anticipated, but we will
 

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,430
some of you had anticipated, but we will
see. You never know. We might get some

112
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
see. You never know. We might get some
 

113
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,350
see. You never know. We might get some
follow through. All right. On the hourly

114
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
follow through. All right. On the hourly
 

115
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,309
follow through. All right. On the hourly
chart. So, finding a bid like we talked

116
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
chart. So, finding a bid like we talked
 

117
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,150
chart. So, finding a bid like we talked
about off the 200 day. Here's Friday.

118
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
about off the 200 day. Here's Friday.
 

119
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,629
about off the 200 day. Here's Friday.
So, this was all overnight Friday. All

120
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
So, this was all overnight Friday. All
 

121
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,710
So, this was all overnight Friday. All
right. And then Friday open. We squeeze

122
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
right. And then Friday open. We squeeze
 

123
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,029
right. And then Friday open. We squeeze
up and we get that one final push back

124
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
up and we get that one final push back
 

125
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,029
up and we get that one final push back
and we're coming back down towards this

126
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
and we're coming back down towards this
 

127
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,990
and we're coming back down towards this
key level. All right. This uh 25 or

128
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
key level. All right. This uh 25 or
 

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,070
key level. All right. This uh 25 or
24,900 somewhere in here. You can see we

130
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
24,900 somewhere in here. You can see we
 

131
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,589
24,900 somewhere in here. You can see we
found a bid on it overnight. If you

132
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
found a bid on it overnight. If you
 

133
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,709
found a bid on it overnight. If you
think about this pivot here, uh 969 or

134
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
think about this pivot here, uh 969 or
 

135
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,389
think about this pivot here, uh 969 or
whatever it was overnight, and you think

136
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
whatever it was overnight, and you think
 

137
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,829
whatever it was overnight, and you think
about what we just talked about on the

138
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
about what we just talked about on the
 

139
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,470
about what we just talked about on the
daily, all right, this kind of edge into

140
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
daily, all right, this kind of edge into
 

141
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,310
daily, all right, this kind of edge into
here, it's the same kind of area, right?

142
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
here, it's the same kind of area, right?
 

143
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,389
here, it's the same kind of area, right?
It's the volume shelf somewhere around

144
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
It's the volume shelf somewhere around
 

145
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,790
It's the volume shelf somewhere around
there. So, we're watching that. If we

146
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
there. So, we're watching that. If we
 

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,670
there. So, we're watching that. If we
fail that 900s, then absolutely naked

148
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
fail that 900s, then absolutely naked
 

149
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,430
fail that 900s, then absolutely naked
point of control based on a weekly down

150
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
point of control based on a weekly down
 

151
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,790
point of control based on a weekly down
here into 800. So, underneath 900s or

152
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
here into 800. So, underneath 900s or
 

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,190
here into 800. So, underneath 900s or
950s, there is a 100 point slingshot

154
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
950s, there is a 100 point slingshot
 

155
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,630
950s, there is a 100 point slingshot
back down there. And then you would

156
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
back down there. And then you would
 

157
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,310
back down there. And then you would
expect them to try and bid up for a back

158
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
expect them to try and bid up for a back
 

159
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,790
expect them to try and bid up for a back
test. So I think we are likely to build

160
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
test. So I think we are likely to build
 

161
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,030
test. So I think we are likely to build
out liquidity today. Maybe between these

162
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
out liquidity today. Maybe between these
 

163
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,430
out liquidity today. Maybe between these
areas, maybe between these areas. All

164
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
areas, maybe between these areas. All
 

165
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,949
areas, maybe between these areas. All
right. And then we can make decisions

166
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
right. And then we can make decisions
 

167
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,269
right. And then we can make decisions
once we start bidding over this. There's

168
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
once we start bidding over this. There's
 

169
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,269
once we start bidding over this. There's
a chance to come back up here. All

170
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
a chance to come back up here. All
 

171
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,269
a chance to come back up here. All
right. So not until that point. This is

172
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
right. So not until that point. This is
 

173
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,030
right. So not until that point. This is
the developing week profile. So I want

174
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
the developing week profile. So I want
 

175
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,550
the developing week profile. So I want
to be careful today. I don't have a huge

176
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
to be careful today. I don't have a huge
 

177
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,870
to be careful today. I don't have a huge
amount of bias. Like maybe if we fail

178
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
amount of bias. Like maybe if we fail
 

179
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,790
amount of bias. Like maybe if we fail
900, 950, I'll look for a short down

180
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
900, 950, I'll look for a short down
 

181
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,110
900, 950, I'll look for a short down
towards 800. And then maybe down there

182
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
towards 800. And then maybe down there
 

183
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,790
towards 800. And then maybe down there
they set a little trap. I'll look for a

184
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
they set a little trap. I'll look for a
 

185
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,550
they set a little trap. I'll look for a
long back up. I'm not going to be too

186
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
long back up. I'm not going to be too
 

187
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,710
long back up. I'm not going to be too
overly biased in one direction today. I

188
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
overly biased in one direction today. I
 

189
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,630
overly biased in one direction today. I
think we're going to need to build out.

190
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
think we're going to need to build out.
 

191
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,550
think we're going to need to build out.
If we hold bids early in the morning and

192
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
If we hold bids early in the morning and
 

193
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,150
If we hold bids early in the morning and
we drift up here, I'll be watching to

194
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
we drift up here, I'll be watching to
 

195
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,230
we drift up here, I'll be watching to
see how we react at 200s. If we start to

196
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
see how we react at 200s. If we start to
 

197
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,150
see how we react at 200s. If we start to
find a bid over it, I think there's a

198
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
find a bid over it, I think there's a
 

199
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,550
find a bid over it, I think there's a
rep push up into fours. All right. So,

200
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
rep push up into fours. All right. So,
 

201
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,829
rep push up into fours. All right. So,
those are my kind of trigger points

202
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
those are my kind of trigger points
 

203
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,550
those are my kind of trigger points
today. Short maybe to here, long maybe

204
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
today. Short maybe to here, long maybe
 

205
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,190
today. Short maybe to here, long maybe
to there. Try and leave this stuff alone

206
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
to there. Try and leave this stuff alone
 

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,030
to there. Try and leave this stuff alone
and maybe long over this back up to

208
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
and maybe long over this back up to
 

209
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,550
and maybe long over this back up to
there or maybe a fail breakout and a

210
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
there or maybe a fail breakout and a
 

211
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,750
there or maybe a fail breakout and a
short back down. So, we're going to

212
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
short back down. So, we're going to
 

213
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,670
short back down. So, we're going to
provide opportunities, but I'm going to

214
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
provide opportunities, but I'm going to
 

215
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,389
provide opportunities, but I'm going to
try and ignore uh 25,000 to 25200 unless

216
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
try and ignore uh 25,000 to 25200 unless
 

217
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,430
try and ignore uh 25,000 to 25200 unless
I see a really clean trap.

218
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
I see a really clean trap.
 

219
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,630
I see a really clean trap.
All right, let's have a look at this

220
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
All right, let's have a look at this
 

221
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,069
All right, let's have a look at this
5minute chart. You can see what happened

222
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
5minute chart. You can see what happened
 

223
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,550
5minute chart. You can see what happened
overnight. We can talk about the open.

224
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
overnight. We can talk about the open.
 

225
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,430
overnight. We can talk about the open.
So, nice gap up at the open.

226
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
So, nice gap up at the open.
 

227
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,630
So, nice gap up at the open.
All right, big drive up and then it all

228
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
All right, big drive up and then it all
 

229
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,949
All right, big drive up and then it all
got sold off and all we've done is dip

230
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
got sold off and all we've done is dip
 

231
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,550
got sold off and all we've done is dip
right back down to that ledge we talked

232
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
right back down to that ledge we talked
 

233
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,710
right back down to that ledge we talked
about on the daily, finding a bid and

234
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
about on the daily, finding a bid and
 

235
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,550
about on the daily, finding a bid and
just trapped between right now. So maybe

236
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
just trapped between right now. So maybe
 

237
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,990
just trapped between right now. So maybe
market wants to come and do one of

238
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
market wants to come and do one of
 

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,150
market wants to come and do one of
these. We will see. We will see in good

240
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
these. We will see. We will see in good
 

241
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,230
these. We will see. We will see in good
time. Monday morning, we're not going to

242
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
time. Monday morning, we're not going to
 

243
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,230
time. Monday morning, we're not going to
push too hard, are we? I'm going to take

244
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
push too hard, are we? I'm going to take
 

245
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,069
push too hard, are we? I'm going to take
our time to see what this market wants

246
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
our time to see what this market wants
 

247
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,430
our time to see what this market wants
to do. I do just want to mark

248
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
to do. I do just want to mark
 

249
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,949
to do. I do just want to mark
this zone here out there just so I

250
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
this zone here out there just so I
 

251
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,350
this zone here out there just so I
remember it that bigger pivot. All

252
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
remember it that bigger pivot. All
 

253
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,310
remember it that bigger pivot. All
right, let's have a look at the ES.

254
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320

 

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,590

All right, that's quite interesting

256
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
All right, that's quite interesting
 

257
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,190
All right, that's quite interesting
between the New York VW up and the

258
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
between the New York VW up and the
 

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,110
between the New York VW up and the
24hour. So, gap up, loses the 24hour,

260
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
24hour. So, gap up, loses the 24hour,
 

261
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,829
24hour. So, gap up, loses the 24hour,
back down to a pivot, back into 24-hour,

262
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
back down to a pivot, back into 24-hour,
 

263
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,670
back down to a pivot, back into 24-hour,
fails, right back down to the old New

264
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
fails, right back down to the old New
 

265
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,389
fails, right back down to the old New
York VW, pivot back to the 24hour,

266
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
York VW, pivot back to the 24hour,
 

267
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,069
York VW, pivot back to the 24hour,
probably back down to the New York VW.

268
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
probably back down to the New York VW.
 

269
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,870
probably back down to the New York VW.
So, this is your rotation in here on the

270
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
So, this is your rotation in here on the
 

271
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,269
So, this is your rotation in here on the
ES. And same kind of story. If we find

272
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
ES. And same kind of story. If we find
 

273
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,190
ES. And same kind of story. If we find
weakness, it's possible it can come all

274
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
weakness, it's possible it can come all
 

275
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,430
weakness, it's possible it can come all
the way back down if it finds weakness.

276
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
the way back down if it finds weakness.
 

277
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,870
the way back down if it finds weakness.
Remember, we have relative strength

278
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
Remember, we have relative strength
 

279
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,269
Remember, we have relative strength
overall on the ES. If we're going to

280
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
overall on the ES. If we're going to
 

281
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,430
overall on the ES. If we're going to
talk about the rotations in the market,

282
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
talk about the rotations in the market,
 

283
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,110
talk about the rotations in the market,
hopefully you guys read the weekly

284
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
hopefully you guys read the weekly
 

285
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,110
hopefully you guys read the weekly
newsletter that went out on Saturday

286
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
newsletter that went out on Saturday
 

287
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,110
newsletter that went out on Saturday
morning.

288
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
morning.
 

289
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,630
morning.
Uh,

290
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
Uh,
 

291
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,310
Uh,
one of those TE's, please. Um,

292
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
one of those TE's, please. Um,
 

293
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,829
one of those TE's, please. Um,
if you read the newsletter that went out

294
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
if you read the newsletter that went out
 

295
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,110
if you read the newsletter that went out
Saturday morning, you should be prepared

296
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
Saturday morning, you should be prepared
 

297
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,470
Saturday morning, you should be prepared
for some of this. But if we have a look

298
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
for some of this. But if we have a look
 

299
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,269
for some of this. But if we have a look
at the strength in the broader markets,

300
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
at the strength in the broader markets,
 

301
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,350
at the strength in the broader markets,
right, ES still holding up pretty well.

302
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
right, ES still holding up pretty well.
 

303
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,150
right, ES still holding up pretty well.
All right, no big undercut of any pivot.

304
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
All right, no big undercut of any pivot.
 

305
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,750
All right, no big undercut of any pivot.
You'd struggle to say this was bearish

306
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
You'd struggle to say this was bearish
 

307
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,509
You'd struggle to say this was bearish
right now. You would just say more,

308
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
right now. You would just say more,
 

309
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,030

they going to come back to the highs? It

348
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
they going to come back to the highs? It
 

349
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,550
they going to come back to the highs? It
is possible, folks. It's possible. Can't

350
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
is possible, folks. It's possible. Can't

353
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,629
rule it out. cues. Same kind of story.
You can see this sort of inverse look.

354
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
You can see this sort of inverse look.
 

355
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,470
You can see this sort of inverse look.
All right. Do we build out liquidity

356
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
All right. Do we build out liquidity
 

357
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,870
All right. Do we build out liquidity
here? And if so, can we get acceptance

358
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
here? And if so, can we get acceptance
 

359
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,430
here? And if so, can we get acceptance
over the 615s to go? Any acceptance

360
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
over the 615s to go? Any acceptance
 

361
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,430
over the 615s to go? Any acceptance
under here? And we probably repair this

362
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
under here? And we probably repair this
 

363
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,509
under here? And we probably repair this
low down here. So, same kind of story as

364
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
low down here. So, same kind of story as
 

365
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,310
low down here. So, same kind of story as
we just went over. Uh Dixie still fading

Struggling to find too much of a bid

370
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
Struggling to find too much of a bid
 

371
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,670
Struggling to find too much of a bid
here. Um but the same story is going to

372
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
here. Um but the same story is going to
 

373
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,269
here. Um but the same story is going to
be true here. We will be watching this

374
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
be true here. We will be watching this
 

375
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,590
be true here. We will be watching this
pivot on Dixie. All right. There's the

376
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
pivot on Dixie. All right. There's the
 

377
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,670

378
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
breakout. There's the retest. Do they
 

379
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,190
breakout. There's the retest. Do they
find a bid here to move it up? If not,

380
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
find a bid here to move it up? If not,
 

381
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,829
find a bid here to move it up? If not,
not good. And that will help gold. Uh,

382
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
not good. And that will help gold. Uh,
 

383
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,590
not good. And that will help gold. Uh,
in fact, what we saw overnight in Asia

384
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
in fact, what we saw overnight in Asia
 

385
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,430
in fact, what we saw overnight in Asia
will help gold significantly. We're

386
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
will help gold significantly. We're
 

387
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,030
will help gold significantly. We're
probably already finding a bid. We are.

388
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
probably already finding a bid. We are.
 

389
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,030
probably already finding a bid. We are.
There we go. So, if I was going to be

390
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
There we go. So, if I was going to be
 

391
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,710
There we go. So, if I was going to be
long-term swing, I think I'd prefer to

392
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
long-term swing, I think I'd prefer to
 

393
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,230
long-term swing, I think I'd prefer to
be long-term. If I really wanted to be

394
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240
be long-term. If I really wanted to be
 

395
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,910
be long-term. If I really wanted to be
bullish on a metal, I'd rather be

396
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
bullish on a metal, I'd rather be
 

397
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,030
bullish on a metal, I'd rather be
bullish in gold than silver. It has uh

398
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
bullish in gold than silver. It has uh
 

399
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,949
bullish in gold than silver. It has uh
more correlation with what's going on in

400
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
more correlation with what's going on in
 

401
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,829
more correlation with what's going on in
Asia right now. Okay. Vicks, still we

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
careful, but so far really good because
 

423
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,189
careful, but so far really good because
it doesn't have the same exposure to AI,

424

it doesn't have the same exposure to AI,
 

425
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,030
it doesn't have the same exposure to AI,
so we're not going a risk off in the

426
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
so we're not going a risk off in the
 

427

489
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,430

absorbed early in Jan. So, are they

490
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
absorbed early in Jan. So, are they
 

491
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,750
absorbed early in Jan. So, are they
willing to come back down there? Is this

492
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
willing to come back down there? Is this
 

493
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,590
willing to come back down there? Is this
an area where they're looking to bid on?

494
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
an area where they're looking to bid on?
 

495
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,110
an area where they're looking to bid on?
Because it definitely has been before.

I'm going to assume that's not a dark

I'm going to assume that's not a dark
 

499
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,790
I'm going to assume that's not a dark
ball print. I don't think so. So, I

500
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
ball print. I don't think so. So, I
 

501
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,230
ball print. I don't think so. So, I
think we're getting into an area of

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
think we're getting into an area of
 

503
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,949
think we're getting into an area of
interest for Meta. So all of these uh

504
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
interest for Meta. So all of these uh
 

505
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,389
interest for Meta. So all of these uh
ones which have been selling off more

506

ones which have been selling off more
 

507

515
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,189

516
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199

 

517
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,710

95s
 

519
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,710
95s
we have. All right. So that might be

520
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
we have. All right. So that might be
 

521
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,550
we have. All right. So that might be
efficient. Probably going to be due a

522
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
efficient. Probably going to be due a
 

523
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,710
efficient. Probably going to be due a
bounce here soon. And we have a gap fill

524
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
bounce here soon. And we have a gap fill
 

525
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,670
bounce here soon. And we have a gap fill
back up the upside now. All right. So

526
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
back up the upside now. All right. So
 

527
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,829
back up the upside now. All right. So

now. Tesla that was very choppy. We

536
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
now. Tesla that was very choppy. We
 

537
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,710
now. Tesla that was very choppy. We
eventually left this range. You can see

538
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
eventually left this range. You can see
 

539
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,030
eventually left this range. You can see
chop chop chop. Left the range. There's

your double bottom W shape back up into
 

543
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,269
your double bottom W shape back up into
this shoulder pattern. So, can it find

544
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
this shoulder pattern. So, can it find
 

545
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,949
this shoulder pattern. So, can it find
acceptance over that or do we see

546
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
acceptance over that or do we see
 

547
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,470
acceptance over that or do we see
downside pressure? So, this is your big

548
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
downside pressure? So, this is your big
 

549
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,949
downside pressure? So, this is your big
overunder here. Sort of 15s in Tesla

00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
overunder here. Sort of 15s in Tesla
 

551
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,230

somewhere around there. I'd be watching

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
somewhere around there. I'd be watching
 

553
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,670

You can see equally weighted wash out

You can see equally weighted wash out
 

561
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,710
You can see equally weighted wash out
from uh Thursday, Friday. Catch the bid.

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
here like we talked about. I did buy
 

569
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,350
here like we talked about. I did buy
some Oracle down here. So already up

570
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
some Oracle down here. So already up
 

571
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,350
some Oracle down here. So already up
nicely on that. We'll see if we can

572
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
nicely on that. We'll see if we can
 

573
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,710
nicely on that. We'll see if we can
retrace. Like lots of these are

574
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
retrace. Like lots of these are
 

575
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,389
retrace. Like lots of these are
oversold. It doesn't mean I want to be

00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
oversold. It doesn't mean I want to be
 

577
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,990

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
in them long term, but you know, I think
 

579
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,629
in them long term, but you know, I think
we do a back test in lots of these,

580
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
we do a back test in lots of these,
 

581
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,670
we do a back test in lots of these,
right? Some form of back test. Netflix

want to see new lows there first, but we

586
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
want to see new lows there first, but we
 

587
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,629
want to see new lows there first, but we
will see. That's pretty much it, folks.

swing long in the small size. What was
 

597
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,150
swing long in the small size. What was
the other one I started in last week?

Uh, hood.
 

601
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,669
Uh, hood.
Nice gap up on Hood as well. All right.

So, most of these just way way oversold.

604
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
So, most of these just way way oversold.

You can see way way oversold. So I'm
 

607
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,470
You can see way way oversold. So I'm
going to see if I can get back into 50%

608
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
going to see if I can get back into 50%
 

609
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,549
going to see if I can get back into 50%
somewhere up here 93s and then hold to

610
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
somewhere up here 93s and then hold to
 

611
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,590
somewhere up here 93s and then hold to
see if we can get back through the

612
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
see if we can get back through the
 

613
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:51,750
see if we can get back through the
hundreds for this relief rally.

614
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760

 

615
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,150

Okay, you can see overnight profile

616
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
Okay, you can see overnight profile
 

617
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,430
Okay, you can see overnight profile
developing here. If you're wondering why

618
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
developing here. If you're wondering why
 

619
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,710
developing here. If you're wondering why
I've got that on, I always put it on the

620
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
I've got that on, I always put it on the
 

621
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,510
I've got that on, I always put it on the
beginning of the week. It's my

622
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
beginning of the week. It's my
 

623
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,630
beginning of the week. It's my
developing profile. So, you can see

624
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
developing profile. So, you can see
 

625
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,470
developing profile. So, you can see
these nodes already here starting to

626
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
these nodes already here starting to
 

627
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,789
these nodes already here starting to
take place. All right, so this is the

628
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
take place. All right, so this is the
 

629
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,950
take place. All right, so this is the
big yearly node down here all the way

630
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
big yearly node down here all the way
 

631
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,110
big yearly node down here all the way
down to 900. This is our overnight

632
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
down to 900. This is our overnight
 

633
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,029
down to 900. This is our overnight
profile. Can we find acceptance? We're

634
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
profile. Can we find acceptance? We're
 

635
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,029
profile. Can we find acceptance? We're
currently opening up inside previous

636
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
currently opening up inside previous
 

637
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,029
currently opening up inside previous
days value underneath previous days

638
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
days value underneath previous days
 

639
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,710
days value underneath previous days
point of control. If we lose this,

640
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
point of control. If we lose this,
 

641
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,070
point of control. If we lose this,
there's an argument to come back down

642
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
there's an argument to come back down
 

643
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,669
there's an argument to come back down
here for previous day value or low

644
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
here for previous day value or low
 

645
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,270
here for previous day value or low
previous week point of control. I'd

646
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
previous week point of control. I'd
 

647
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,669
previous week point of control. I'd
imagine this session is likely to be

648
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
imagine this session is likely to be
 

649
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,750
imagine this session is likely to be
somewhat choppy. So, just be careful,

650
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
somewhat choppy. So, just be careful,
 

651
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,830
somewhat choppy. So, just be careful,
folks. It's a Monday morning. The last

654
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
two weeks have provided us absolutely
 

655
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,029
two weeks have provided us absolutely
insane price action. Um,

656
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
insane price action. Um,
 

657
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,990
insane price action. Um,
so let's not go giving it all back on a

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
Look, just bouncing around like a mad
 

685
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,870
Look, just bouncing around like a mad

686
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880

 

687
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,630

I'm watching this blue box. And if we

688
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm watching this blue box. And if we
 

689
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,470
I'm watching this blue box. And if we
leave this blue box, maybe down into

690
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
leave this blue box, maybe down into
 

691
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,710
leave this blue box, maybe down into
previous day value area low.

692
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720

 

693
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:34,630

Come on. Let's see if we can get down

694
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640

 

695
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,150

expanding here. We come into that blue

696
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
expanding here. We come into that blue
 

697
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,990
expanding here. We come into that blue
box. So, let's see if they buy dips here

698
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
box. So, let's see if they buy dips here
 

699
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,270
box. So, let's see if they buy dips here
or not. If we flip this, we're going to

700
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,280
or not. If we flip this, we're going to
 

701
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,870
or not. If we flip this, we're going to
come previous day value area low. So,

702
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
come previous day value area low. So,
 

703
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,870
come previous day value area low. So,
interested. Do they buy dips here or not

704
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
interested. Do they buy dips here or not
 

705
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,710
interested. Do they buy dips here or not
right now?

706
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
right now?
 

707
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,470
right now?
Or do we flip it into previous day value

708
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
Or do we flip it into previous day value
 

709
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,430
Or do we flip it into previous day value
area low? Big sell right now.

710
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
area low? Big sell right now.
 

711
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,270
area low? Big sell right now.
Big aggressive sell right now.

712
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280

 

713
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,029

Starting to see some absorption down

714
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
Starting to see some absorption down
 

715
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,710
Starting to see some absorption down
here. Try and take place. I think they

716
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
here. Try and take place. I think they
 

717
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,230
here. Try and take place. I think they
can still move lower if they want.

718
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240

 

719
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,870

So let's give this a chance here to just

720
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
So let's give this a chance here to just
 

721
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,350
So let's give this a chance here to just
settle down for a minute.

722
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
settle down for a minute.
 

723
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,870
settle down for a minute.
If we flip this, there's potentially

724
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
If we flip this, there's potentially
 

725
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,549
If we flip this, there's potentially
short down here. I think they will try

726
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
short down here. I think they will try
 

727
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,870
short down here. I think they will try
and absorb down here at least for a

728
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
and absorb down here at least for a
 

729
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,870
and absorb down here at least for a
first rally up. All of the mag other

730
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
first rally up. All of the mag other
 

731
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,110
first rally up. All of the mag other
than Meta and Microsoft or Meta just

732
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
than Meta and Microsoft or Meta just
 

733
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,390
than Meta and Microsoft or Meta just
gone red as well. So all of the MAG

734
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
gone red as well. So all of the MAG
 

735
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,909

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,120
here. It's just uh I've had one go at it
 

943
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,549
here. It's just uh I've had one go at it
already. So, I actually want to wait for

944
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
already. So, I actually want to wait for
 

945
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,990
already. So, I actually want to wait for
them to come right back down and retest

946
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
them to come right back down and retest
 

947
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,990
them to come right back down and retest
that low before I do it or base above

948
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
that low before I do it or base above
 

949
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:24,549
that low before I do it or base above
now at this point. One or the other.

956
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
to get it yet. Might need to retest the
 

957
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,190
to get it yet. Might need to retest the
low first. We talked about

for gap fill. It's almost there. Here we

1048
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:49,679
for gap fill. It's almost there. Here we
 

1049

1051
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,990
go. Here's the 120s. All right. Peeling
most off here. You hear me smashing my

And then we'll see for gap fill now be

1056
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:58,399
And then we'll see for gap fill now be
 

1057
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,549
And then we'll see for gap fill now be
163. And then the edge will be right up

1058
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
163. And then the edge will be right up
 

1059
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,110
163. And then the edge will be right up
into here. done 88 to 25200.

Is the heat map through bookm? Yeah.
Yeah. I wouldn't be entering long here,

1094
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
Yeah. I wouldn't be entering long here,
 

1095
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,630
Yeah. I wouldn't be entering long here,
folks. Definitely not.

1096
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
folks. Definitely not.
 

1097
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,950
folks. Definitely not.
We were looking for Remember today if

1098
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
We were looking for Remember today if
 

1099
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,789
We were looking for Remember today if
dips hold the blue zone. We're going to

1100
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
dips hold the blue zone. We're going to
 

1101
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,310
dips hold the blue zone. We're going to
look to see if we can hold. If we then

1102
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
look to see if we can hold. If we then
 

1103
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,389
look to see if we can hold. If we then
reclaim the gray zone, the rotations

1104
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
reclaim the gray zone, the rotations
 

1105
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,870
reclaim the gray zone, the rotations
like I talked about it was gray to blue.

1106
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:58,880
like I talked about it was gray to blue.
 

1107
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,110
like I talked about it was gray to blue.
I expect blue to hold. Blue held. Blue

1108
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
I expect blue to hold. Blue held. Blue
 

1109
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,870
I expect blue to hold. Blue held. Blue
went back to gray. I was looking for a

1110
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:02,880
went back to gray. I was looking for a
 

1111
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,549
went back to gray. I was looking for a
red dip back into here. It never came.

1112
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
red dip back into here. It never came.
 

1113
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,710
red dip back into here. It never came.
So I had to wait. I got knocked out once

1114
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
So I had to wait. I got knocked out once
 

1115
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,430
So I had to wait. I got knocked out once
and then got this move. TP1, TP2. And

1116
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
and then got this move. TP1, TP2. And
 

1117
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,269
and then got this move. TP1, TP2. And
now if we get all the way up for gap

1118
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
now if we get all the way up for gap
 

1119
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,110
now if we get all the way up for gap
fill, it be the yellow line above. If my

1120
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
fill, it be the yellow line above. If my
 

1121
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,029
fill, it be the yellow line above. If my
mouse wants to come up into here and

1122
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
mouse wants to come up into here and
 

1123
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,549
mouse wants to come up into here and
then older highs up here.

1124
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
then older highs up here.
 

1125
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,630
then older highs up here.
So blue box trapping all those shorts at

1126
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
So blue box trapping all those shorts at
 

1127
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,149
So blue box trapping all those shorts at
the lows. Remember at the lows I said

1128
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:22,159
the lows. Remember at the lows I said
 

1129
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,389
the lows. Remember at the lows I said
we've just trapped lots of shorts at the

1130
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:24,399
we've just trapped lots of shorts at the
 

1131
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,830
we've just trapped lots of shorts at the
lows. Look at all these guys getting

1132
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:25,840
lows. Look at all these guys getting
 

1133
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,430
lows. Look at all these guys getting
caught trying to short into This gray

1134
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,440
caught trying to short into This gray
 

1135
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,950
caught trying to short into This gray
box in here is the blue box on my other

1136
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:28,960
box in here is the blue box on my other
 

1137
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,950
box in here is the blue box on my other
screen. All these guys got caught,

1138
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
screen. All these guys got caught,
 

1139
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,029
screen. All these guys got caught,
right? And when we lifted and we have

1140
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:33,039
right? And when we lifted and we have
 

1141
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,710
right? And when we lifted and we have
this big buyer up here now. So this is

1142
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:34,720
this big buyer up here now. So this is
 

1143
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,190
this big buyer up here now. So this is
our overunder now, right? A 900 lot

1144
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
our overunder now, right? A 900 lot
 

1145
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,110
our overunder now, right? A 900 lot
buyer at previous day value high. That's

1146
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
buyer at previous day value high. That's
 

1147
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,990
buyer at previous day value high. That's
our over under sentiment for the day.

1148
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,000

 

1149
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,789

If he gets caught this now old value

1150
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
If he gets caught this now old value
 

1151
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,230
If he gets caught this now old value
area high, current point of control, if

1152
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
area high, current point of control, if
 

1153
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,789
area high, current point of control, if
he gets caught, we will rotate down. He

1154
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
he gets caught, we will rotate down. He
 

1155
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,149
he gets caught, we will rotate down. He
will become liquidity that gets sold

1156
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:52,159
will become liquidity that gets sold
 

1157
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,149
will become liquidity that gets sold
into. So that is your over under this

1158
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
into. So that is your over under this
 

1159
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,669
into. So that is your over under this
sort of 120 level that we're back

1160
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
sort of 120 level that we're back
 

1161
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,269
sort of 120 level that we're back
testing here. ES closed its gap. QQQ

did not close its gap. We are now under

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720

1167
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,029

that player. Be very, very careful here.

1168
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:07,039
that player. Be very, very careful here.
 

1169
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:15,510
that player. Be very, very careful here.
We're now under that player.

1170
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:15,520

 

1171
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,669

Do I draw the gray zones off the daily

1172
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:17,679
Do I draw the gray zones off the daily
 

1173
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,070
Do I draw the gray zones off the daily
charts? Uh, they're just done off um

1174
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
charts? Uh, they're just done off um
 

1175
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,909
charts? Uh, they're just done off um
profiles from like previous day or

00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919

current day session or previous week
 

1179
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,070
current day session or previous week
session. They're just areas where I know

1180
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,080
session. They're just areas where I know
 

1181
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,630
session. They're just areas where I know
we're likely to rotate, where we're

1182
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,640
we're likely to rotate, where we're
 

1183
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,549
we're likely to rotate, where we're
likely to find a bid. Like the blue one

1184
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,559
likely to find a bid. Like the blue one
 

1185
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,549
likely to find a bid. Like the blue one
was likely to set a trap for shorts. And

1186
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559
was likely to set a trap for shorts. And
 

1187
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,149
was likely to set a trap for shorts. And
it's exactly what we got. Remember, we

1188
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
it's exactly what we got. Remember, we
 

1189
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,549
it's exactly what we got. Remember, we
said we would not short, right? Unless

1190
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
said we would not short, right? Unless
 

1191
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,710
said we would not short, right? Unless
we got under this and flipped it. We

1192
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
we got under this and flipped it. We
 

1193
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,389
we got under this and flipped it. We
didn't. We trapped shorts and we

1194
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:40,399
didn't. We trapped shorts and we
 

1195
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,870
didn't. We trapped shorts and we
expanded, we ripped them higher because

1196
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
expanded, we ripped them higher because
 

1197
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,710
expanded, we ripped them higher because
what's the trend right now, right? If we

1198
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:44,720
what's the trend right now, right? If we
 

1199
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,830
what's the trend right now, right? If we
zoom out, it's a pullback, right? And

1200
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
zoom out, it's a pullback, right? And
 

1201
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,509
zoom out, it's a pullback, right? And
the pullback, we are going to take

1202
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
the pullback, we are going to take
 

1203
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,509
the pullback, we are going to take
profit into here because we don't know,

1204
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
profit into here because we don't know,
 

1205
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,029
profit into here because we don't know,
right? If we think about this, we don't

1206
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
right? If we think about this, we don't
 

1207
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,389
right? If we think about this, we don't
know if we get acceptance through here.

1208
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399
know if we get acceptance through here.
 

1209
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,389
know if we get acceptance through here.
If we find acceptance, we might get one

1210
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
If we find acceptance, we might get one
 

1211
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,990
If we find acceptance, we might get one
of these and wash all these guys out.

1212
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
of these and wash all these guys out.
 

1213
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,470
of these and wash all these guys out.
But we don't know that. So, we buy these

1214
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:00,480
But we don't know that. So, we buy these
 

1215
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,909
But we don't know that. So, we buy these
and we sell into that and we hold

1216
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
and we sell into that and we hold
 

1217
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,070
and we sell into that and we hold
runners in case.

1218
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
runners in case.
 

1219
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,909
runners in case.
I'd imagine we will have somewhat of a

1220
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
I'd imagine we will have somewhat of a
 

1221
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,909
I'd imagine we will have somewhat of a
choppy day here. But we will see see if

1222
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:07,919
choppy day here. But we will see see if
 

1223
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:23,830
choppy day here. But we will see see if
they turn the boosters on or not.

1224
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840

 

1225
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,830

When I'm moving, take profit. When I'm

1226
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
When I'm moving, take profit. When I'm
 

1227
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,190
When I'm moving, take profit. When I'm
taking profit, I'm moving break even.

1228
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
taking profit, I'm moving break even.
 

1229
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,789
taking profit, I'm moving break even.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely,

1230
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:28,799
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely,
 

1231
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,990
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely,
definitely. Definitely. Remember, I

1232
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,000
definitely. Definitely. Remember, I
 

1233
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,430
definitely. Definitely. Remember, I
moved break even very quick here and got

1234
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
moved break even very quick here and got
 

1235
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,710
moved break even very quick here and got
knocked out. So, I looked for this

1236
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
knocked out. So, I looked for this
 

1237
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,070
knocked out. So, I looked for this
squeeze. First time I was looking for

1238
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
squeeze. First time I was looking for
 

1239
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,710
squeeze. First time I was looking for
this squeeze here, took a scout, break

1240
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:36,720
this squeeze here, took a scout, break
 

1241
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,230
this squeeze here, took a scout, break
even. I was like, I'll wait. They

1242
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
even. I was like, I'll wait. They
 

1243
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,789
even. I was like, I'll wait. They
retracted. I took the same trade and

1244
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
retracted. I took the same trade and
 

1245
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,269
retracted. I took the same trade and
this time got it. As soon as we start

1246
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
this time got it. As soon as we start
 

1247
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,950
this time got it. As soon as we start
breaking through here, I'm break even. I

1248
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:44,960
breaking through here, I'm break even. I
 

1249
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,230
breaking through here, I'm break even. I
don't want this to come back on me at

1250
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:46,240
don't want this to come back on me at
 

1251
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,590
don't want this to come back on me at
that point. It's got no reason to. So,

1252
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
that point. It's got no reason to. So,
 

1253
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,190
that point. It's got no reason to. So,
it's already trapped, right? So, I'm

1254
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,200
it's already trapped, right? So, I'm
 

1255
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,950
it's already trapped, right? So, I'm
break even. I'm taking profit. I'm

1256
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
break even. I'm taking profit. I'm
 

1257
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,710

taking profit. I'm looking to see how

1258
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
taking profit. I'm looking to see how
 

1259
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,710

high up we can go now. I don't want us

1260
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
high up we can go now. I don't want us
 

1261
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,230
high up we can go now. I don't want us
to lose this gray shelf now. It's

1262
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,240
to lose this gray shelf now. It's
 

1263
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,870
to lose this gray shelf now. It's
massive, massive level here where this

1264
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
massive, massive level here where this
 

1265
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,990
massive, massive level here where this
guy kept getting uh buying this 900 lot.

1266
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,000
guy kept getting uh buying this 900 lot.
 

1267

guy kept getting uh buying this 900 lot.
This is our overunder, right? I'm going

1268
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
This is our overunder, right? I'm going
 

1269
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,789
This is our overunder, right? I'm going
to make this gray. So, we're bullish all

1270
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
to make this gray. So, we're bullish all
 

1271
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,990
to make this gray. So, we're bullish all
the time. We're holding above that. The

1272
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
the time. We're holding above that. The
 

1273
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,909
the time. We're holding above that. The
moment we lose that, there's probably a

1274
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:09,919
moment we lose that, there's probably a
 

1275
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,909
moment we lose that, there's probably a
nasty drop down to 100 very, very

1276
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
nasty drop down to 100 very, very
 

1277
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,190
nasty drop down to 100 very, very
quickly. And if they want to be really

1278
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
quickly. And if they want to be really
 

1279
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,070
quickly. And if they want to be really
nasty, they'll flush it even harder. So

1280
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
nasty, they'll flush it even harder. So
 

1281
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,190
nasty, they'll flush it even harder. So
just remember right here is a guy that

1282
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
just remember right here is a guy that
 

1283

1349
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,349
Uh, I've got a tiny guy left, but it's

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,750
makes it or not. A tiny guy left, but
it's inconsequential whether he makes it

1354
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
it's inconsequential whether he makes it
 

1355
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,349
it's inconsequential whether he makes it
or not. And I will cut him if we start

1356
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359
or not. And I will cut him if we start
 

1357
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,470
or not. And I will cut him if we start
losing this shelf here. Right. So, it

1358
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,480
losing this shelf here. Right. So, it
 

1359
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,310
losing this shelf here. Right. So, it
took two goes today, but it was the same

1360
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,320
took two goes today, but it was the same
 

1361
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,230
took two goes today, but it was the same
thesis. It was basically long for this

1362
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
thesis. It was basically long for this
 

1363
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,750

1367
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,310
And got knocked out first time. There's
the shelf. And we'll see if we get

1368
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
the shelf. And we'll see if we get
 

1369
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,750
the shelf. And we'll see if we get
lucky. We're going to get all the way up

1370
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
lucky. We're going to get all the way up
 

1371

we don't have too much above that. We

1390
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:36,800
we don't have too much above that. We
 

1391
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,470
we don't have too much above that. We
can get pretty thin and pretty wild if

1392
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480
can get pretty thin and pretty wild if
 

1393
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,550

losing 65s now, I'd be careful because

1456
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:13,599
losing 65s now, I'd be careful because
 

1457
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,270
losing 65s now, I'd be careful because
they've been very very aggressive in

1526
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
buying. I put it on after the trade
 

1527
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,670
buying. I put it on after the trade
because I'm actually trading. I'm

00:38:59,670 --> 00:38:59,680
because I'm actually trading. I'm
 

1529
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,950
because I'm actually trading. I'm
actually trading. That's why I have to

1530
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:02,960
actually trading. That's why I have to
 

1531
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,990
actually trading. That's why I have to
be reactive.

1532
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,000

 

1533
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,349

All right. Washed out here on the

1534
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
All right. Washed out here on the
 

1535
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,589
All right. Washed out here on the

All right. So they come back down

1538
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:14,720
All right. So they come back down
 

1539
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,230
All right. So they come back down
probably to test this point of control

1540
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,240
probably to test this point of control
 

1541
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,109
probably to test this point of control
here. 34s and then 20s again. And how we

1542
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119
here. 34s and then 20s again. And how we
 

1543
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:28,550
here. 34s and then 20s again. And how we
act here now becomes key.

1544
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,560

 

1545
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,990

Breezy, you're buying that blue zone.

1546
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,000
Breezy, you're buying that blue zone.
 

1547
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,510
Breezy, you're buying that blue zone.
Nice. All right, there's a 120 tap

1548
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:31,520
Nice. All right, there's a 120 tap
 

1549
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,109
Nice. All right, there's a 120 tap
again. So, they're testing this buyer,

1550
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:33,119
again. So, they're testing this buyer,
 

1551
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,670
again. So, they're testing this buyer,
that same level that we were at earlier.

1552
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:35,680
that same level that we were at earlier.
 

1553
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,230
that same level that we were at earlier.
They're testing this buyer here. VWAP as

1554
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,240
They're testing this buyer here. VWAP as
 

1555
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,870
They're testing this buyer here. VWAP as
well across the indexes and they're

1556
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:40,880
well across the indexes and they're
 

1557
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,109
well across the indexes and they're
holding so far this buyer. So, I'd say

1558
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:43,119
holding so far this buyer. So, I'd say
 

1559
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,829
holding so far this buyer. So, I'd say
160 is now key. If they fail to follow

1560
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
160 is now key. If they fail to follow
 

1561
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,150
160 is now key. If they fail to follow
through above 160. So your rotation now

1562
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,160
through above 160. So your rotation now
 

1563
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,990
through above 160. So your rotation now
in here is 120 to 160s. And if they do

1564
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000
in here is 120 to 160s. And if they do
 

1565
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,670
in here is 120 to 160s. And if they do
this, they get more. If they fail here,

1566
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
this, they get more. If they fail here,
 

1567
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,950
this, they get more. If they fail here,
they'll come back down. If they fail

1568
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
they'll come back down. If they fail
 

1569
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,349
they'll come back down. If they fail
here, they'll wash. Right? That's what

1570
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:57,359
here, they'll wash. Right? That's what
 

1571
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:08,150
here, they'll wash. Right? That's what
we're doing right now.

1572
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160

 

1573
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,390

Back to VWAP. Still not under the 20.

1574
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400
Back to VWAP. Still not under the 20.
 

1575
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,510
Back to VWAP. Still not under the 20.
That buy is still currently comfortable

1576
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,520
That buy is still currently comfortable
 

1577
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,390
That buy is still currently comfortable
on previous day value area high. If we

1578
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
on previous day value area high. If we
 

1579
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,349
on previous day value area high. If we
start leaving this area, there will be a

1580
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:19,359
start leaving this area, there will be a
 

1581
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,470
start leaving this area, there will be a
shove back down probably into PC,

1582
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
shove back down probably into PC,
 

1583
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,790
shove back down probably into PC,
previous day PC. So, this is old value

1584
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:24,800
previous day PC. So, this is old value
 

1585
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,870
previous day PC. So, this is old value
area high. Buyers will want to bid and

1586
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,880
area high. Buyers will want to bid and
 

1587
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,109
area high. Buyers will want to bid and
hold above this for the rotation. If

1588
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,119
hold above this for the rotation. If
 

1589
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,430
hold above this for the rotation. If
they lose this bid, that 900 lot would

1590
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:31,440
they lose this bid, that 900 lot would
 

1591
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,109
they lose this bid, that 900 lot would
probably flush down here. And then I'd

1592
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:33,119
probably flush down here. And then I'd
 

1593
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,310
probably flush down here. And then I'd
be watching to see if they want to

1594
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:34,320
be watching to see if they want to
 

1595
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:43,349
be watching to see if they want to
reclaim to retest 160s today.

1596
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:43,359

 

1597
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,109

Like I said, I think we'll be pretty

1598
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
Like I said, I think we'll be pretty
 

1599
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,030
Like I said, I think we'll be pretty
washy and rangy today. So that at the

1600
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
washy and rangy today. So that at the
 

1601
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,870
washy and rangy today. So that at the
very start of the day, I don't think

1602
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:48,880
very start of the day, I don't think
 

1603
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,390
very start of the day, I don't think
we'll be a big trend today. I think

1604
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:50,400
we'll be a big trend today. I think
 

1605
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,310
we'll be a big trend today. I think
we'll probably wash around, build a lot

1606
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:52,320
we'll probably wash around, build a lot
 

1607
00:40:52,320 --> 00:41:05,510
we'll probably wash around, build a lot
of liquidity.

1608
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520

 

1609
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,030

Yeah.

1610
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,040
Yeah.
 

1611
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,950
Yeah.
Not Jordan. The reason is people just

1612
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
Not Jordan. The reason is people just
 

1613
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,030
Not Jordan. The reason is people just
want me to be like buy here and sell

1614
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
want me to be like buy here and sell
 

1615
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,950
want me to be like buy here and sell
here and do this and they're not willing

1616
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
here and do this and they're not willing
 

1617
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,390
here and do this and they're not willing
to learn the wise and they don't

1618
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
to learn the wise and they don't
 

1619
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,030
to learn the wise and they don't
understand that you can't just say buy

1620
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,040
understand that you can't just say buy
 

1621
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,790
understand that you can't just say buy
here and do this. I can say this is an

1622
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
here and do this. I can say this is an
 

1623
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,109
here and do this. I can say this is an
area that I'm interested in but I need

1624
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:21,119
area that I'm interested in but I need
 

1625
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,670
area that I'm interested in but I need
to see people get trapped in and traps

1626
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:23,680
to see people get trapped in and traps
 

1627
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,589
to see people get trapped in and traps
can happen like that. So I can't tell

1628
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:25,599
can happen like that. So I can't tell
 

1629
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,349
can happen like that. So I can't tell
you before it happens all the time. I

1630
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:27,359
you before it happens all the time. I
 

1631
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,349
you before it happens all the time. I
have to be reactive and my job believe

1632
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
have to be reactive and my job believe
 

1633
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,750
have to be reactive and my job believe
it or not is to make me money. So I

1634
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
it or not is to make me money. So I
 

1635
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,190
it or not is to make me money. So I
actually have to trade what's in front

1636
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
actually have to trade what's in front
 

1637
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,349
actually have to trade what's in front
of me.

1638
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359
of me.
 

1639
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,510
of me.
Okay. Losing 120s. Like I said, lose

1640
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
Okay. Losing 120s. Like I said, lose
 

1641
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,109
Okay. Losing 120s. Like I said, lose
120s potentially down here to previous

1642
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:39,119
120s potentially down here to previous
 

1643
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,030
120s potentially down here to previous
day point of control and VWAP. And then

1644
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,040
day point of control and VWAP. And then
 

1645
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,950
day point of control and VWAP. And then
maybe they trap and regrow back up. We

1646
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:42,960
maybe they trap and regrow back up. We
 

1647
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,790
maybe they trap and regrow back up. We
will have to see if they lose point

1648
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:44,800
will have to see if they lose point
 

1649
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,550
will have to see if they lose point
control and VWOP. There is a rotation

1650
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
control and VWOP. There is a rotation
 

1651
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,870
control and VWOP. There is a rotation
the whole way down. Right. So remember

1652
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
the whole way down. Right. So remember
 

1653
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,990
the whole way down. Right. So remember
our main target was this right here. Gap

1654
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,000
our main target was this right here. Gap
 

1655
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,470
our main target was this right here. Gap
fill has been complete. How we at now is

1656
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,480
fill has been complete. How we at now is
 

1657
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,190
fill has been complete. How we at now is
key.

1658
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
key.
 

1659
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,430
key.
VIX finding a bid here. Didn't close its

1660
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
VIX finding a bid here. Didn't close its
 

1661
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,349
VIX finding a bid here. Didn't close its
gap interestingly on the VIX. All right.

1662
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,359
gap interestingly on the VIX. All right.
 

1663
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:19,670
gap interestingly on the VIX. All right.
Here's previous day point control.

1664
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680

 

1665
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,190

Finding a bid of previous day point of

1666
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
Finding a bid of previous day point of
 

1667
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,349
Finding a bid of previous day point of
control. Trying to reclaim the 120s. Not

1668
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:23,359
control. Trying to reclaim the 120s. Not
 

1669
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,670
control. Trying to reclaim the 120s. Not
able to fully base above that 120s yet.

1670
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
able to fully base above that 120s yet.
 

1671
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,270
able to fully base above that 120s yet.
So getting stuck between these two gray

1672
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,280
So getting stuck between these two gray
 

1673
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,589
So getting stuck between these two gray
boxes. If we do a little dirty move,

1674
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
boxes. If we do a little dirty move,
 

1675
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,670
boxes. If we do a little dirty move,
we'll wash, reclaim, hold, and then

1676
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
we'll wash, reclaim, hold, and then
 

1677
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,230
we'll wash, reclaim, hold, and then
trade 160s if they want to be dirty.

1678
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,240
trade 160s if they want to be dirty.
 

1679
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,950
trade 160s if they want to be dirty.
They'll do something like this. They'll

1680
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
They'll do something like this. They'll
 

1681
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,790
They'll do something like this. They'll
do something. Oh my god, give me this.

1682
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,800
do something. Oh my god, give me this.
 

1683
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,309
do something. Oh my god, give me this.
If they want to be dirty, they'll do

1684
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,319
If they want to be dirty, they'll do
 

1685
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,589
If they want to be dirty, they'll do
something like this, this, this, and

1686
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:41,599
something like this, this, this, and
 

1687
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,390
something like this, this, this, and
this for a move back into that. If they

1688
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,400
this for a move back into that. If they
 

1689
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,910
this for a move back into that. If they
lose this, I wouldn't rule out the whole

1690
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:47,920
lose this, I wouldn't rule out the whole
 

1691
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,829
lose this, I wouldn't rule out the whole
move back down. But we'll see how they

1692
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:49,839
move back down. But we'll see how they
 

1693
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,630
move back down. But we'll see how they
build out in here now.

1694
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:54,640

 

1695

00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:31,760
Great. And this is key. Now, what
 

1711
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,190
Great. And this is key. Now, what
happens if they're going to trap, they

1712
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,200
happens if they're going to trap, they
 

1713
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,109
happens if they're going to trap, they
need to trap around here, reclaim 120,

1714
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:35,119
need to trap around here, reclaim 120,
 

1715
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,710
need to trap around here, reclaim 120,
and squeeze. You got a big shelf there

1716
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
and squeeze. You got a big shelf there
 

1717
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,790
and squeeze. You got a big shelf there
now. So, if they're We just drew out the

1718
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
now. So, if they're We just drew out the
 

1719
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,910
now. So, if they're We just drew out the
trap. If they're going to trap, if you

1720
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:39,920
trap. If they're going to trap, if you
 

1721
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,349
trap. If they're going to trap, if you
lose this gray box, I wouldn't rule out

1722
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:41,359
lose this gray box, I wouldn't rule out
 

1723
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,790
lose this gray box, I wouldn't rule out
a rotation all the way to the lows. But,

1724
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
a rotation all the way to the lows. But,
 

1725
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,309
a rotation all the way to the lows. But,
if they're going to trap, this is where

1726
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:44,319
if they're going to trap, this is where
 

1727
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,430
if they're going to trap, this is where
they're going to need to do it. But

1728
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:45,440
they're going to need to do it. But
 

1729
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,190
they're going to need to do it. But

when to do it. I think I drew it out
 

1749
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,950

said if they're going to trap, they're

1834
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:24,400
said if they're going to trap, they're

going to trap here. We We're playing
this now to just see if we can get into

this now to just see if we can get into
 

1839
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,109
this now to just see if we can get into
here. I've already paid myself no matter

here. I've already paid myself no matter
 

1841

here. I've already paid myself no matter
what because if this is failed follow

1842

what because if this is failed follow
 

1843
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,230
what because if this is failed follow
through and they lose this, this will be

1844
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
through and they lose this, this will be
 

1845
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,829
through and they lose this, this will be
a dunk. So, getting ready to get out on

1846
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:33,839
a dunk. So, getting ready to get out on
 

1847
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,790
a dunk. So, getting ready to get out on
the rest out now. Can always read back

1848
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
the rest out now. Can always read back
 

1849
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,670
the rest out now. Can always read back
in.

1850
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:41,680

 

1851
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,069

Why out there? Because we left this

1852
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:44,079
Why out there? Because we left this
 

1853
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,510
Why out there? Because we left this
shelf. All right. Technically, you could

1854
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:45,520
shelf. All right. Technically, you could
 

1855
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,030
shelf. All right. Technically, you could
risk this, but I'm risking this shelf

1856
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
risk this, but I'm risking this shelf
 

1857
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,630
risk this, but I'm risking this shelf
here. So, I can always add back in if I

1858
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,640
here. So, I can always add back in if I
 

1859
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,710
here. So, I can always add back in if I
see it reabsorb and want to play the

1860
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,720
see it reabsorb and want to play the
 

1861
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,309
see it reabsorb and want to play the
same move again.

1862
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:54,319

 

1863
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,829

Am I trading a one minute? Well, you're

1864
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
Am I trading a one minute? Well, you're
 

1865
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,190
Am I trading a one minute? Well, you're
looking at a one minute. I wouldn't

1866
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
looking at a one minute. I wouldn't
 

1867
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,829
looking at a one minute. I wouldn't
necessarily necessarily say I'm trading

1868
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
necessarily necessarily say I'm trading
 

1869
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,950
necessarily necessarily say I'm trading
a one minute. I'm observing it. Um, what

1870
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
a one minute. I'm observing it. Um, what
 

1871
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,870

00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:04,880
matters to me more than anything is the
 

1873
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:12,950
matters to me more than anything is the
hourlies and the dailies.

1874
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960

 

1875
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,870

still trying to bid rebid off this now.
 

1879
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,390
still trying to bid rebid off this now.
They might knock me out to go and do it

1880
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:18,400
They might knock me out to go and do it
 

1881

They might knock me out to go and do it
now. We'll see.

That's why I stopped out at the bottom

1894
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:54,079
That's why I stopped out at the bottom
 

1895

Back to the top side of this block.

1954
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:22,640

 

1955
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,069

Here we go. Do I only swing with

1956
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:24,079
Here we go. Do I only swing with
 

1957
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,750
Here we go. Do I only swing with
commons? Yeah, pretty much. Like

1958
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:25,760
commons? Yeah, pretty much. Like
 

1959
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,589
commons? Yeah, pretty much. Like
sometimes I'll take leaps, but mainly

1960
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:27,599
sometimes I'll take leaps, but mainly
 

1961
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,309
sometimes I'll take leaps, but mainly
commons. Mainly because I'm trading my

1962
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:30,319
commons. Mainly because I'm trading my
 

1963
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,710
commons. Mainly because I'm trading my
um investment account, so it's taxfree.

1964
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
um investment account, so it's taxfree.
 

1965
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,549
um investment account, so it's taxfree.
So, I can only trade commons on that.

1966
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:36,559
So, I can only trade commons on that.
 

1967
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,030
So, I can only trade commons on that.
So, if we lift 140, we should get 160.

1968
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
So, if we lift 140, we should get 160.
 

1969
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,349
So, if we lift 140, we should get 160.
We lift 140, we should get 160. There's

1970
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
We lift 140, we should get 160. There's
 

1971
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:42,950
We lift 140, we should get 160. There's
they're actually adding liquidity up at

00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
they're actually adding liquidity up at
 

1973
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,990
they're actually adding liquidity up at
180, but if we lift 140s, we should get

1974
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:46,000
180, but if we lift 140s, we should get
 

1975
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,670
180, but if we lift 140s, we should get
160s.

1976
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:47,680
160s.

1998
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079

 

1999
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,549

Am I leaning bullish today? Um,

2000
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:30,559
Am I leaning bullish today? Um,
 

2001
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,390
Am I leaning bullish today? Um,
I think it's just more relief. Like when

2002
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,400
I think it's just more relief. Like when
 

2003
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,109
I think it's just more relief. Like when
we look at

2004
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:35,119
we look at
 

2005
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,710
we look at
this,

2006
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:36,720
this,
 

2007
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,349
this,
it's not that I'm bullish necessarily

2008
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:39,359
it's not that I'm bullish necessarily
 

2009
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,430
it's not that I'm bullish necessarily
overall, right? It's that we've been in

2010
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:41,440
overall, right? It's that we've been in
 

2011
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,309
overall, right? It's that we've been in
a big wash. We left volume. We washed.

2012
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:44,319
a big wash. We left volume. We washed.
 

2013
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,030
a big wash. We left volume. We washed.
We hit the 200 day. We've seen relief.

2014
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,040
We hit the 200 day. We've seen relief.
 

2015
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,950
We hit the 200 day. We've seen relief.
If we consider that leg one, this is a

2016
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
If we consider that leg one, this is a
 

2017
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,270
If we consider that leg one, this is a
pullback. We're holding key levels here

2018
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
pullback. We're holding key levels here
 

2019
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,349
pullback. We're holding key levels here
on the pullback. I'm thinking

2020
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:53,359
on the pullback. I'm thinking
 

2021
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,870
on the pullback. I'm thinking
potentially we're going to come back up

2022
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
potentially we're going to come back up
 

2023
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,109
potentially we're going to come back up
here. Not necessarily today, but we're

2024
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
here. Not necessarily today, but we're
 

2025
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,390
here. Not necessarily today, but we're
going to create rotation here. Maybe a

2026
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,400
going to create rotation here. Maybe a
 

2027
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,270
going to create rotation here. Maybe a
lift and maybe bears resell that level.

2028
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,280
lift and maybe bears resell that level.
 

2029
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,750
lift and maybe bears resell that level.
If they don't resell this level, I think

2030
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,760
If they don't resell this level, I think
 

2031
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,430
If they don't resell this level, I think
they're going to resell this level back

2032
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
they're going to resell this level back
 

2033
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,030
they're going to resell this level back
down. And I think we'll have something

2034
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:09,040
down. And I think we'll have something
 

2035
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,790
down. And I think we'll have something
like that. And I think we'll build out

2036
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:10,800
like that. And I think we'll build out
 

2037
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,790
like that. And I think we'll build out
here for a little bit of time while they

2038
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800
here for a little bit of time while they
 

2039
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,990
here for a little bit of time while they
make their mind up what we're going to

2040
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
make their mind up what we're going to
 

2041
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,670
make their mind up what we're going to
do. A lot would depend on the broader

2042
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:15,680
do. A lot would depend on the broader
 

2043
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,510
do. A lot would depend on the broader
market.

2044
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
market.
 

2045
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,710
market.
A lot would depend on the broader

2046
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
A lot would depend on the broader
 

2047
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,390
A lot would depend on the broader
market. Remember, we're weaker in tech,

2048
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400
market. Remember, we're weaker in tech,
 

2049
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,069
market. Remember, we're weaker in tech,
but we're seeing like a rally in

2050
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
but we're seeing like a rally in
 

2051
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,670
but we're seeing like a rally in
software like we talked about at the

2052
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:23,680
software like we talked about at the
 

2053
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,750
software like we talked about at the
open.

2054
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:25,760
open.
 

2055
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,829
open.
They cannot get this through this 40 to

2056
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:27,839
They cannot get this through this 40 to
 

2057
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,349
They cannot get this through this 40 to
get to 60. All right. Be very careful

2058
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:29,359
get to 60. All right. Be very careful
 

2059
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,630
get to 60. All right. Be very careful
here if you were in this long now.

2060
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:30,640
here if you were in this long now.
 

2061
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,829
here if you were in this long now.
That's a failure. So the rotation

2062
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
That's a failure. So the rotation
 

2063
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,910
That's a failure. So the rotation
happening. You can see each side of this

2064
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:35,920
happening. You can see each side of this
 

2065
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,910
happening. You can see each side of this
very very sensitive. No acceptance

2066
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
very very sensitive. No acceptance
 

2067
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,670
very very sensitive. No acceptance
above, no acceptance below. If you get

2068
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:39,680
above, no acceptance below. If you get
 

2069
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,349
above, no acceptance below. If you get
under this, this is very much possible.

2070
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:45,359

 

2071
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,109

This is what I was anticipating today. A

2072
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,119
This is what I was anticipating today. A
 

2073
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,069
This is what I was anticipating today. A
lot of chop and slop. Yeah, that's it.

2074
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
lot of chop and slop. Yeah, that's it.
 

2075
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,069
lot of chop and slop. Yeah, that's it.
Big chop. Universal authorizer. That's

2076
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:52,079
Big chop. Universal authorizer. That's
 

2077
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,309
Big chop. Universal authorizer. That's
it. That's what we expect today. We

2078
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:54,319
it. That's what we expect today. We
 

2079
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,069
it. That's what we expect today. We
expect that liquidity to be built today.

2080
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:56,079
expect that liquidity to be built today.
 

2081
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,589
expect that liquidity to be built today.
If you look at the last three sessions,

2082
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
If you look at the last three sessions,
 

2083
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:05,190
If you look at the last three sessions,
like even if we go to the daily,

2084
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,200

 

2085
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,549

all right, and then go to the daily.

2086
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
all right, and then go to the daily.
 

2087
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,549
all right, and then go to the daily.
We're not really finding acceptance

2088
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:10,559
We're not really finding acceptance
 

2089
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,109
We're not really finding acceptance
outside previous day high, are we? We

2090
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:13,119
outside previous day high, are we? We
 

2091
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,069
outside previous day high, are we? We
can chop in here. We know that this is a

2092
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:16,079
can chop in here. We know that this is a
 

2093
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,390
can chop in here. We know that this is a
big level. This is volume from the high,

2094
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
big level. This is volume from the high,
 

2095
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,190
big level. This is volume from the high,
from the all-time high. All right, we

2096
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,200
from the all-time high. All right, we
 

2097
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,069
from the all-time high. All right, we
know that this is a big level on an all

2098
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:24,079
know that this is a big level on an all
 

2099
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,990
know that this is a big level on an all
from the all-time high. So if you did a

2100
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:26,000
from the all-time high. So if you did a
 

2101
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,150
from the all-time high. So if you did a
profile from all-time high, this is a

2102
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
profile from all-time high, this is a
 

2103
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,710
profile from all-time high, this is a
huge level. Through this level, they can

2104
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:30,720
huge level. Through this level, they can
 

2105
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,109
huge level. Through this level, they can
maybe lift for a back test of there. On

2106
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
maybe lift for a back test of there. On
 

2107
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,670
maybe lift for a back test of there. On
the yearly for the last 12 months, we

2108
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:35,680
the yearly for the last 12 months, we
 

2109
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,470
the yearly for the last 12 months, we
know that this is a huge level. All

2110
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
know that this is a huge level. All
 

2111
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,710
know that this is a huge level. All
right. So really what we're saying is we

2112
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720
right. So really what we're saying is we
 

2113
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,790
right. So really what we're saying is we
are probably going to do a bit of a

2114
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
are probably going to do a bit of a
 

2115
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,190
are probably going to do a bit of a
dance in there for a bit. Yeah, we're

2116
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:45,200
dance in there for a bit. Yeah, we're
 

2117
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,549
dance in there for a bit. Yeah, we're
going to do a dance in there for a bit.

2118
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
going to do a dance in there for a bit.
 

2119
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,670
going to do a dance in there for a bit.
We're going to build out liquidity in

2120
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:47,680
We're going to build out liquidity in
 

2121
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,750
We're going to build out liquidity in
there for a bit. Now, if bulls want to

2122
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
there for a bit. Now, if bulls want to
 

2123
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,069
there for a bit. Now, if bulls want to
take it higher or if sellers want to let

2124
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:52,079
take it higher or if sellers want to let
 

2125
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,230
take it higher or if sellers want to let
bulls take it higher, they will let them

2126
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,240
bulls take it higher, they will let them
 

2127
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,549
bulls take it higher, they will let them
do this move. All right, and let bulls

2128
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:56,559
do this move. All right, and let bulls
 

2129
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,230
do this move. All right, and let bulls
chase in up here and then they will sell

2130
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:58,240
chase in up here and then they will sell
 

2131
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,670
chase in up here and then they will sell
them back down. Right? If bulls want to

2132
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:01,680
them back down. Right? If bulls want to
 

2133
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,349
them back down. Right? If bulls want to
set a trap for shorts, they'll let it

2134
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:03,359
set a trap for shorts, they'll let it
 

2135
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,109
set a trap for shorts, they'll let it
come under, reclaim, and do that move.

2136
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
come under, reclaim, and do that move.
 

2137
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,950
come under, reclaim, and do that move.
If sellers just want to get aggressive,

2138
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
If sellers just want to get aggressive,
 

2139
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,710
If sellers just want to get aggressive,
they'll wait for this break here and

2140
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
they'll wait for this break here and
 

2141
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,870
they'll wait for this break here and
look for this clean out here to then

2142
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
look for this clean out here to then
 

2143
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,870
look for this clean out here to then
come into the next level. All right? So,

2144
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880
come into the next level. All right? So,
 

2145
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,870
come into the next level. All right? So,
we want to be careful when we're dancing

2146
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:14,880
we want to be careful when we're dancing
 

2147
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,470
we want to be careful when we're dancing
in between two massive levels based on

2148
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:18,480
in between two massive levels based on
 

2149
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,510
in between two massive levels based on
one year worth of volume. All right? We

2150
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:21,520
one year worth of volume. All right? We
 

2151
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,870
one year worth of volume. All right? We
don't want to be too aggressive, right?

2152
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:22,880
don't want to be too aggressive, right?
 

2153
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,870
don't want to be too aggressive, right?
We're aggressive when we leave volume.

2154
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:24,880
We're aggressive when we leave volume.
 

2155
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,870
We're aggressive when we leave volume.
We're aggressive where we trap and we

2156
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:26,880
We're aggressive where we trap and we
 

2157
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,390
We're aggressive where we trap and we
come back up. We're not aggressive where

2158
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,400
come back up. We're not aggressive where
 

2159
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,630
come back up. We're not aggressive where
we create volume.

2160
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:30,640
we create volume.
 

2161
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,470
we create volume.
Not aggressive. Oh, or I'm not

2162
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:32,480
Not aggressive. Oh, or I'm not
 

2163
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,549
Not aggressive. Oh, or I'm not
aggressive. I'll just say that. I'm not

2164
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
aggressive. I'll just say that. I'm not
 

2165
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,109
aggressive. I'll just say that. I'm not
aggressive where we're creating volume.

2166
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:37,119
aggressive where we're creating volume.
 

2167
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,470
aggressive where we're creating volume.
I'm aggressive where we're leaving

2168
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
I'm aggressive where we're leaving
 

2169
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,870
I'm aggressive where we're leaving
volume. So, no acceptance under reclaim

2170
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
volume. So, no acceptance under reclaim
 

2171
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,230
volume. So, no acceptance under reclaim
again. And now they're going to have

2172
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:42,240
again. And now they're going to have
 

2173
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,589
again. And now they're going to have
another go to try and get back up to

2174
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:43,599
another go to try and get back up to
 

2175
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,670
another go to try and get back up to
these 60s. Obviously, I'm not in

2176
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
these 60s. Obviously, I'm not in
 

2177
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,589
these 60s. Obviously, I'm not in
anything right now. There you go. So,

2178
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
anything right now. There you go. So,
 

2179
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,150
anything right now. There you go. So,
you're going to get your 60s. Now, I

2180
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,160
you're going to get your 60s. Now, I
 

2181
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,549
you're going to get your 60s. Now, I
would be selling some into 60s. Okay.

2182
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
would be selling some into 60s. Okay.
 

2183
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,270
would be selling some into 60s. Okay.
And if you get acceptance above 60s,

2184
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:55,280
And if you get acceptance above 60s,
 

2185
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,950
And if you get acceptance above 60s,
right, I'd be selling some into this red

2186
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:56,960
right, I'd be selling some into this red
 

2187
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,349
right, I'd be selling some into this red
block. So, it's the same trade. It just

2188
00:53:59,349 --> 00:53:59,359
block. So, it's the same trade. It just
 

2189
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,270
block. So, it's the same trade. It just
knocked me out. So, it's same trade.

2190
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:01,280
knocked me out. So, it's same trade.
 

2191
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,829
knocked me out. So, it's same trade.
There's your 60s, right? So, sell a

2192
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:03,839
There's your 60s, right? So, sell a
 

2193
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,510
There's your 60s, right? So, sell a
partial here. And now you should come

2194
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:05,520
partial here. And now you should come
 

2195
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,349
partial here. And now you should come
and lift all the way up here now. You

2196
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:07,359
and lift all the way up here now. You
 

2197
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,790
and lift all the way up here now. You
should get all the way up here now on

2198
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
should get all the way up here now on
 

2199
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,910
should get all the way up here now on
the squeeze. There you go. So, they're

2200
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:09,920
the squeeze. There you go. So, they're
 

2201
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,990
the squeeze. There you go. So, they're
starting to do it. They just faf around

2202
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
starting to do it. They just faf around
 

2203
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:21,030
starting to do it. They just faf around
too much down there for me.

2204
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040

 

2205
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,030

But we lower our expectations, right? So

2206
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,040
But we lower our expectations, right? So
 

2207
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,470
But we lower our expectations, right? So
when we're looking for these longs

2208
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:24,480
when we're looking for these longs
 

2209
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,630
when we're looking for these longs
because we know,

2210
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
because we know,
 

2211
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,470
because we know,
all right, we know that it's a relief

2212
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,480
all right, we know that it's a relief
 

2213
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,190
all right, we know that it's a relief
rally. We're not like piling into it

2214
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200
rally. We're not like piling into it
 

2215
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,430
rally. We're not like piling into it
looking for like a huge protrend move

2216
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:33,440
looking for like a huge protrend move
 

2217
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,549
looking for like a huge protrend move
where we're going to break alltime

2218
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:34,559
where we're going to break alltime
 

2219
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,109
where we're going to break alltime
highs. We're in a relief rally where we

2220
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:37,119
highs. We're in a relief rally where we
 

2221
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,190
highs. We're in a relief rally where we
know we're coming into some big levels

2222
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,200
know we're coming into some big levels
 

2223
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,589
know we're coming into some big levels
and we're going to sell, right? Partials

2224
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:41,599
and we're going to sell, right? Partials
 

2225
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,069
and we're going to sell, right? Partials
because we don't know at what point the

2226
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:44,079
because we don't know at what point the
 

2227
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,990
because we don't know at what point the
shorts say, "Hey, enough's enough. [\h__\h]

2228
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
shorts say, "Hey, enough's enough. [\h__\h]
 

2229
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,990
shorts say, "Hey, enough's enough. [\h__\h]
off. [\h__\h] off." Or do they go like,

2230
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
off. [\h__\h] off." Or do they go like,
 

2231
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,589
off. [\h__\h] off." Or do they go like,
"Okay, you can come up here." Or do they

2232
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:49,599
"Okay, you can come up here." Or do they
 

2233
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,990
"Okay, you can come up here." Or do they
go really really bullish and let us What

2234
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,000
go really really bullish and let us What
 

2235
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,270
go really really bullish and let us What
was the level I just said we could come

2236
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,280
was the level I just said we could come
 

2237
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,109
was the level I just said we could come
into

2238
00:54:55,109 --> 00:54:55,119
into
 

2239
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,069
into
25800 or here? All right. I'd imagine

2240
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
25800 or here? All right. I'd imagine
 

2241
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,549
25800 or here? All right. I'd imagine
one of these will be a higher time frame

2242
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559
one of these will be a higher time frame
 

2243
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,309
one of these will be a higher time frame
sell. One of these up here. So we have

2244
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:04,319
sell. One of these up here. So we have
 

2245
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,230
sell. One of these up here. So we have
to manage our expectations as we get

2246
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
to manage our expectations as we get
 

2247
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:12,790
to manage our expectations as we get
into those levels

2248
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:12,800

 

2249
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,549

going after 200. Yeah, pro probably

2250
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:14,559
going after 200. Yeah, pro probably
 

2251
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,390
going after 200. Yeah, pro probably
trying to get to 220. I mean if you look

2252
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,400
trying to get to 220. I mean if you look
 

2253
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,069
trying to get to 220. I mean if you look
at the ES, it's just reclaimed its

2254
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
at the ES, it's just reclaimed its
 

2255
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,230
at the ES, it's just reclaimed its
20-day. SPY is getting a bid off its

2256
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,240
20-day. SPY is getting a bid off its
 

2257
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,270
20-day. SPY is getting a bid off its
20-day. Q's bidding off the 5day this

2258
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:23,280
20-day. Q's bidding off the 5day this
 

2259
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,270
20-day. Q's bidding off the 5day this
morning coming up to previous day high.

2260
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
morning coming up to previous day high.
 

2261
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,109
morning coming up to previous day high.
Yeah. So we might get alignment here

2262
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:27,119
Yeah. So we might get alignment here
 

2263
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,829
Yeah. So we might get alignment here
between the cash market and the futures

2264
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:29,839
between the cash market and the futures
 

2265
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,150
between the cash market and the futures
market. So I'll be watching that

2266
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,160
market. So I'll be watching that
 

2267
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,829
market. So I'll be watching that
previous day high. The red line on your

2268
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
previous day high. The red line on your
 

2269
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,109
previous day high. The red line on your
screen is probably what I think they're

2270
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,119
screen is probably what I think they're
 

2271
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,630
screen is probably what I think they're
going to do. The 220s like we talked

2272
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
going to do. The 220s like we talked
 

2273
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,829
going to do. The 220s like we talked
about is where they're trying to get up

2274
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:37,839
about is where they're trying to get up
 

2275
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,109
about is where they're trying to get up
to. So, if you are long in this, you

2276
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:39,119
to. So, if you are long in this, you
 

2277
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,230
to. So, if you are long in this, you
look good. Just make sure you're paying

2278
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
look good. Just make sure you're paying
 

2279
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,030
look good. Just make sure you're paying
yourself on the way. The blue line on

2280
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
yourself on the way. The blue line on
 

2281
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,309
yourself on the way. The blue line on
the screen is the current week

2282
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
the screen is the current week
 

2283
00:55:44,319 --> 00:56:34,870
the screen is the current week
developing profile since Sunday.

2284
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880

 

2285
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,710

Almost there, folks.

2286
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720

 

2287
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,030

So, the trap worked. They just took

2288
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:41,040
So, the trap worked. They just took
 

2289
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,950
So, the trap worked. They just took
time. They took too much time for me. It

2290
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
time. They took too much time for me. It
 

2291
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,990
time. They took too much time for me. It
would have been nice if they did it

2292
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:44,000
would have been nice if they did it
 

2293
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,190
would have been nice if they did it
first time. Probably should have

2294
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:45,200
first time. Probably should have
 

2295
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,950
first time. Probably should have
re-entered here, but there we go. But

2296
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:46,960
re-entered here, but there we go. But
 

2297
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,589
re-entered here, but there we go. But
this was your track gray box and this is

2298
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
this was your track gray box and this is
 

2299
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,150
this was your track gray box and this is
your TP up here now. And you can hold

2300
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,160
your TP up here now. And you can hold
 

2301
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,990
your TP up here now. And you can hold
runners above that for GloEx high which

2302
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
runners above that for GloEx high which
 

2303
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,630
runners above that for GloEx high which
would be 265s.

2304
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:56,640
would be 265s.
 

2305
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,549
would be 265s.
And over there if you got very lucky

2306
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:58,559
And over there if you got very lucky
 

2307
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,390
And over there if you got very lucky
you'll get 350s if they really turn it

2308
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,400
you'll get 350s if they really turn it
 

2309
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,789
you'll get 350s if they really turn it
on. But I would be selling like 80% of

2310
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:02,799
on. But I would be selling like 80% of
 

2311
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,670
on. But I would be selling like 80% of
your profits into this move up here.

2312
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680

 

2313
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,190

Into this move up here. You want to be

2314
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:09,200
Into this move up here. You want to be
 

2315
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,430
Into this move up here. You want to be
selling 80% of your profits and then you

2316
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:11,440
selling 80% of your profits and then you
 

2317
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:19,430
selling 80% of your profits and then you
can just hold runners.

2318
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:19,440

 

2319
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,430

No, I'm not in the long. I tried. I had

2320
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:21,440
No, I'm not in the long. I tried. I had
 

2321
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,030
No, I'm not in the long. I tried. I had
a go at it. I had the first go at it.

2322
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
a go at it. I had the first go at it.
 

2323
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,470
a go at it. I had the first go at it.
Right. So, once they did the turnaround

2324
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,480
Right. So, once they did the turnaround
 

2325
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,150
Right. So, once they did the turnaround
here, so I was long here.

2326
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,160
here, so I was long here.
 

2327
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,549
here, so I was long here.
Sold a partial. Move my stop under this

2328
00:57:30,549 --> 00:57:30,559
Sold a partial. Move my stop under this
 

2329
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,390
Sold a partial. Move my stop under this
shelf. Got knocked out. All right. And

2330
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
shelf. Got knocked out. All right. And
 

2331
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,069
shelf. Got knocked out. All right. And
then they kept trapping under that shelf

2332
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:34,079
then they kept trapping under that shelf
 

2333
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,750
then they kept trapping under that shelf
unfortunately. And then did the move. Is

2334
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:35,760
unfortunately. And then did the move. Is
 

2335
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,950
unfortunately. And then did the move. Is
what it is. It's all right. It's Monday

2336
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:36,960
what it is. It's all right. It's Monday
 

2337
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,950
what it is. It's all right. It's Monday
morning. I don't mind that. It's fine.

2338
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
morning. I don't mind that. It's fine.
 

2339

This is your final TP. Red block is the

2340
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
This is your final TP. Red block is the
 

2341
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,349
This is your final TP. Red block is the
TP, but ideally you get a sweep of this.

2342
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:43,359
TP, but ideally you get a sweep of this.
 

2343
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,630
TP, but ideally you get a sweep of this.
But just make make sure you paid

2344
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
But just make make sure you paid
 

2345
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,549
But just make make sure you paid
yourself some.

2346
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
yourself some.
 

2347
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,069
yourself some.
What about shorting at the highs? Well,

2348
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:48,079
What about shorting at the highs? Well,
 

2349
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,270
What about shorting at the highs? Well,
there's no reason to get short right

2350
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,280
there's no reason to get short right
 

2351
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,349
there's no reason to get short right
now, is there? All right, we're bullish

2352
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:51,359
now, is there? All right, we're bullish
 

2353
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,789
now, is there? All right, we're bullish
in momentum. Look at the flow zones.

2354
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:52,799
in momentum. Look at the flow zones.
 

2355
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,950
in momentum. Look at the flow zones.
We're opening up. I would say you'd want

2356
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
We're opening up. I would say you'd want
 

2357
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,390
We're opening up. I would say you'd want
to see them trap at the highs, wouldn't

2358
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:56,400
to see them trap at the highs, wouldn't
 

2359
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,510
to see them trap at the highs, wouldn't
you? So, if you're going to be bullish

2360
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:57,520
you? So, if you're going to be bullish
 

2361
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,670
you? So, if you're going to be bullish
at the highs, uh bearish at the highs,

2362
00:57:59,670 --> 00:57:59,680
at the highs, uh bearish at the highs,
 

2363
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,030
at the highs, uh bearish at the highs,
you'd need to see something like this,

2364
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:01,040
you'd need to see something like this,
 

2365
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,270
you'd need to see something like this,
some form of shelf built out, leaving

2366
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:03,280
some form of shelf built out, leaving
 

2367
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,870
some form of shelf built out, leaving
the shelf, rejecting the shelf for that

2368
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:04,880
the shelf, rejecting the shelf for that
 

2369
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,710
the shelf, rejecting the shelf for that
rotation. Otherwise, you're just

2370
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:06,720
rotation. Otherwise, you're just
 

2371
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,710
rotation. Otherwise, you're just
guessing and hoping it swip it swipes

2372
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,720
guessing and hoping it swip it swipes
 

2373
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,549
guessing and hoping it swip it swipes
liquidity and then comes back down. You

2374
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:10,559
liquidity and then comes back down. You
 

2375
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:19,109
liquidity and then comes back down. You
don't know it's going to do that.

2376
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:19,119

 

2377
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,069

question. I bought the indicator. Does

2378
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
question. I bought the indicator. Does
 

2379
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,109
question. I bought the indicator. Does
that suite on Trading View like you have

2380
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:25,119
that suite on Trading View like you have
 

2381
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,270
that suite on Trading View like you have
mark out the levels you have? Uh, it

2382
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
mark out the levels you have? Uh, it
 

2383
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,190
mark out the levels you have? Uh, it
marks out all the horizontal levels, all

2384
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:29,200
marks out all the horizontal levels, all
 

2385
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,870
marks out all the horizontal levels, all
the lines, but not the blocks. The

2386
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
the lines, but not the blocks. The
 

2387
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,309
the lines, but not the blocks. The
blocks you'll have to draw in yourself.

2388
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
blocks you'll have to draw in yourself.
 

2389
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,829
blocks you'll have to draw in yourself.
Like these gray and red boxes you have

2390
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:33,839
Like these gray and red boxes you have
 

2391
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,870
Like these gray and red boxes you have
to draw in yourself.

2392
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880

 

2393
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,549

Okay. Like I said, VIX coming to close

2394
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:40,559
Okay. Like I said, VIX coming to close
 

2395
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,230
Okay. Like I said, VIX coming to close
that gap now. It was odd that it didn't

2396
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
that gap now. It was odd that it didn't
 

2397
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,750
that gap now. It was odd that it didn't
close it earlier, but it's looking like

2398
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:43,760
close it earlier, but it's looking like
 

2399
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,829
close it earlier, but it's looking like
it wants it now. Uh QQQ did just tap the

2400
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:47,839
it wants it now. Uh QQQ did just tap the
 

2401
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,950
it wants it now. Uh QQQ did just tap the
previous day high on the uh cash market.

2402
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:50,960
previous day high on the uh cash market.
 

2403
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,549
previous day high on the uh cash market.
So, we got very very close here. I think

2404
00:58:52,549 --> 00:58:52,559
So, we got very very close here. I think
 

2405
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:59,109
So, we got very very close here. I think
they will probably want to swipe it.

2406
00:58:59,109 --> 00:58:59,119

 

2407
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,950

Am I down for the day? Uh no.

2408
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
Am I down for the day? Uh no.
 

2409
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,549
Am I down for the day? Uh no.
What do you mean done for the day? No.

2410
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:04,559
What do you mean done for the day? No.
 

2411
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,789
What do you mean done for the day? No.
I'll look for another trade. That's all

2412
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:06,799
I'll look for another trade. That's all
 

2413
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,030
I'll look for another trade. That's all
I've got today. Couple thousand bucks at

2414
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,040
I've got today. Couple thousand bucks at
 

2415
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,270
I've got today. Couple thousand bucks at
the moment. rotating the accounts, but I

2416
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
the moment. rotating the accounts, but I
 

2417
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:28,069
the moment. rotating the accounts, but I
will look for another trade.

2418
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:28,079

 

2419
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,670

Now, remember this trade here is like

2420
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:29,680
Now, remember this trade here is like
 

2421
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,030
Now, remember this trade here is like
118 points. It's uh you only need one of

2422
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
118 points. It's uh you only need one of
 

2423
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,589
118 points. It's uh you only need one of
those a day. One of those a day gets you

2424
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:35,599
those a day. One of those a day gets you
 

2425
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,030
those a day. One of those a day gets you
paid. This trade here, if you make it,

2426
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,040
paid. This trade here, if you make it,
 

2427
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,270
paid. This trade here, if you make it,
will be 125 points. But already into the

2428
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:39,280
will be 125 points. But already into the
 

2429
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,870
will be 125 points. But already into the
red block. There's another 100 pointer.

2430
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:40,880
red block. There's another 100 pointer.
 

2431
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,870
red block. There's another 100 pointer.
If you manage to stay in it wiggled me

2432
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880
If you manage to stay in it wiggled me
 

2433
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,390
If you manage to stay in it wiggled me

00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,400
out. I told you I moved my stop under
 

2435
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,950
out. I told you I moved my stop under
here. Like it is what it is. Oh, don't

2436
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:46,960

2439
00:59:50,160 --> 01:00:00,230
move that. I need that guy.
No, I don't need that guy. He can go.

2440
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240

 

2441
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,270

So, they're trying to lift. They're

2442
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:01,280
So, they're trying to lift. They're
 

2443
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,950
So, they're trying to lift. They're
looking for the 220s. Through 220s,

2444
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
looking for the 220s. Through 220s,
 

2445
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,510
looking for the 220s. Through 220s,
you're looking for 265s. Just be careful

2446
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,520
you're looking for 265s. Just be careful
 

2447
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,109
you're looking for 265s. Just be careful
up here, though. I would not be joining

2448
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:07,119
up here, though. I would not be joining
 

2449
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,230
up here, though. I would not be joining
long up here, that's for sure.

2450
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,240
long up here, that's for sure.

long up here, that's for sure.
Alex, why is the EMA trend friend

2452
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:12,079
Alex, why is the EMA trend friend
 

2453
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,069
Alex, why is the EMA trend friend
indicator not accessible from my end?

2454
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:14,079
indicator not accessible from my end?
 

2455
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,230
indicator not accessible from my end?
Did you apply from it? Did you put in

normally if it's not working, it's
 

2461
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:21,829
normally if it's not working, it's
because someone you haven't put like

2462
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:21,839
because someone you haven't put like

2468
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:31,599

 

2469
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,230

What's the red box? Red box is a supply

2470
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,240
What's the red box? Red box is a supply
 

2471
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,470
What's the red box? Red box is a supply
zone, right? If it's a blue box, it's an

2472
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:36,480
zone, right? If it's a blue box, it's an
 

2473
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,390
zone, right? If it's a blue box, it's an
area I think buyers will will step up.

2474
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:38,400
area I think buyers will will step up.
 

2475
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,990
area I think buyers will will step up.
If it's a red box, it's an area where I

2476
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,000
If it's a red box, it's an area where I
 

2477
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,789
If it's a red box, it's an area where I
think sellers might step up. Gray box is

2478
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:42,799
think sellers might step up. Gray box is
 

2479
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:49,990
think sellers might step up. Gray box is
a volume that we are building out.

2480
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,000

 

2481
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,950

Do I prefer ENQ over ES? For me, yeah, I

2482
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
Do I prefer ENQ over ES? For me, yeah, I
 

2483
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,309
Do I prefer ENQ over ES? For me, yeah, I
but I just know the personality of ENQ.

2484
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:56,319
but I just know the personality of ENQ.
 

2485
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,390
but I just know the personality of ENQ.
Okay, they keep trying to sell under 200

2486
01:00:58,390 --> 01:00:58,400
Okay, they keep trying to sell under 200
 

2487
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,950
Okay, they keep trying to sell under 200
here. Um, we have imbalances. The big

2488
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
here. Um, we have imbalances. The big
 

2489
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,069
here. Um, we have imbalances. The big
buyer came in at 180. A big big buyer

2490
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:04,079
buyer came in at 180. A big big buyer
 

2491
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,430
buyer came in at 180. A big big buyer
came in here at 180. So maybe they dunk

2492
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:07,440
came in here at 180. So maybe they dunk
 

2493
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,670
came in here at 180. So maybe they dunk
down to that and then save it. Here's

2494
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,680
down to that and then save it. Here's
 

2495
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,309
down to that and then save it. Here's
the dunk to 180.

2496
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
the dunk to 180.
 

2497
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,150
the dunk to 180.
Do they save it now at 180 or do they

2498
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
Do they save it now at 180 or do they
 

2499
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,910
Do they save it now at 180 or do they
wash this all the way back down to 150

2500
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:15,920
wash this all the way back down to 150
 

2501
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,430
wash this all the way back down to 150
now?

2502
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440
now?
 

2503
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,430
now?
So big buyer stepped in at 180 first

2504
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,440
So big buyer stepped in at 180 first
 

2505
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,270
So big buyer stepped in at 180 first
time round.

2506
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280

 

2507
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,829

Sellers getting caught that low.

2508
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
Sellers getting caught that low.
 

2509
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,510
Sellers getting caught that low.
Watching the 180 here. They're trying to

2510
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
Watching the 180 here. They're trying to
 

2511
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,349
Watching the 180 here. They're trying to
do that next trap to move up right here.

2512
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:31,359
do that next trap to move up right here.
 

2513
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,270
do that next trap to move up right here.
Here we go.

2514
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:33,280
Here we go.
 

2515
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,670
Here we go.
So saved 180.

2516
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
So saved 180.
 

2517
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,270
So saved 180.
Sellers caught under there right now.

2518
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,280
Sellers caught under there right now.
 

2519
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,829
Sellers caught under there right now.
All right. So here 180. There's the big

2520
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:39,839
All right. So here 180. There's the big
 

2521
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,069
All right. So here 180. There's the big
buyer. They tried to sell under 180.

2522
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:42,079
buyer. They tried to sell under 180.
 

2523
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,069
buyer. They tried to sell under 180.
They got caught. All right. And buyers

2524
01:01:44,069 --> 01:01:44,079
They got caught. All right. And buyers
 

2525
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,910
They got caught. All right. And buyers
now stuck top side at 204. So the

2526
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:45,920
now stuck top side at 204. So the
 

2527
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:56,150
now stuck top side at 204. So the
rotation is 180 to 200 right now.

2528
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,160

 

2529
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,030

Literally instant rotation. 180 200.

2530
01:01:59,030 --> 01:01:59,040
Literally instant rotation. 180 200.
 

2531
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,549
Literally instant rotation. 180 200.
They have enough juice to trap and go

2532
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:00,559
They have enough juice to trap and go
 

2533
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:04,630
They have enough juice to trap and go
here now.

2534
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:04,640

 

2535
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,230

So if you were quick there and I said do

2536
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
So if you were quick there and I said do
 

2537
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,069
So if you were quick there and I said do
they trap at 180 that's where the big

2538
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:08,079
they trap at 180 that's where the big
 

2539
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,069
they trap at 180 that's where the big
buy was then you could have taken you

2540
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079
buy was then you could have taken you
 

2541
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,910
buy was then you could have taken you
know 20 odd point trade just up here and

2542
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:11,920
know 20 odd point trade just up here and
 

2543
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,910
know 20 odd point trade just up here and
then now hold your runners again. If

2544
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:13,920
then now hold your runners again. If
 

2545
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,670
then now hold your runners again. If
they come back under 180 and lose it

2546
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
they come back under 180 and lose it
 

2547
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,270
they come back under 180 and lose it
though I would be out of this

2548
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:17,280
though I would be out of this
 

2549
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,470
though I would be out of this
completely.

2550
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,480

 

2551
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,390

There you go. That is the 200 tag. This

2552
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:22,400
There you go. That is the 200 tag. This
 

2553
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,069
There you go. That is the 200 tag. This
is the sell side imbalance. All right

2554
01:02:24,069 --> 01:02:24,079
is the sell side imbalance. All right
 

2555
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,589
is the sell side imbalance. All right
and over this is where buyers got

2556
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:25,599
and over this is where buyers got
 

2557
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,109
and over this is where buyers got
caught. But if we find acceptance over

2558
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:27,119
caught. But if we find acceptance over
 

2559
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,870
caught. But if we find acceptance over
this, you can still have 220 as a

2560
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:28,880
this, you can still have 220 as a
 

2561
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,230
this, you can still have 220 as a
lowhanging fruit to go and attack.

2562
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
lowhanging fruit to go and attack.
 

2563
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,589
lowhanging fruit to go and attack.
You took it. There you go. Some of you

2564
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:33,599
You took it. There you go. Some of you
 

2565
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,430
You took it. There you go. Some of you
took it.

2566
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,440
took it.
 

2567
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,990
took it.
Some of you took it. So this the trap

2568
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,000
Some of you took it. So this the trap
 

2569
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,829
Some of you took it. So this the trap
right here. Once you understand how they

2570
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:39,839
right here. Once you understand how they
 

2571
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,349
right here. Once you understand how they
built the liquidity, all right, it was

2572
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:41,359
built the liquidity, all right, it was
 

2573
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:42,789
built the liquidity, all right, it was
here for you. Once you understand like

2574
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:42,799
here for you. Once you understand like
 

2575
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,630
here for you. Once you understand like
this is a big buyer, sellers sell

2576
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:44,640
this is a big buyer, sellers sell
 

2577
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,069
this is a big buyer, sellers sell
underneath the buyer. They get caught.

2578
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
underneath the buyer. They get caught.
 

2579
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,670
underneath the buyer. They get caught.
That means there is a passive buyer here

2580
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680
That means there is a passive buyer here
 

2581
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,670
That means there is a passive buyer here
absorbing. We absorb and run it back to

2582
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:49,680
absorbing. We absorb and run it back to
 

2583
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,829
absorbing. We absorb and run it back to
the 200 where the buyer got stuck last

2584
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:51,839
the 200 where the buyer got stuck last
 

2585
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,069
the 200 where the buyer got stuck last
time. If we can get through two 200,

2586
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:54,079
time. If we can get through two 200,
 

2587
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,670
time. If we can get through two 200,
we're going to look to trade 205s.

2588
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:55,680
we're going to look to trade 205s.
 

2589
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,589
we're going to look to trade 205s.
Through 205s, you probably get a new

2590
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:57,599
Through 205s, you probably get a new
 

2591
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,549
Through 205s, you probably get a new
higher day.

2592
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:00,559
higher day.
 

2593
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,150
higher day.
But what do I know? Like I always talk

2594
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,160
But what do I know? Like I always talk
 

2595
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,150
But what do I know? Like I always talk
about, I'm just a numpty on YouTube,

2596
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:04,160
about, I'm just a numpty on YouTube,
 

2597
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,589
about, I'm just a numpty on YouTube,
right? What what the fudge do I know?

2598
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:07,599
right? What what the fudge do I know?
 

2599
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,030
right? What what the fudge do I know?
I'd be looking to see if you can get

2600
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,040
I'd be looking to see if you can get
 

2601
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,950
I'd be looking to see if you can get

that trap we just talked about down
 

2645
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,470
that trap we just talked about down
here, there's your there's your next TP

2646
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
here, there's your there's your next TP
 

2647
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,230
here, there's your there's your next TP
through that. Now, you're looking for

2648
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:14,240
through that. Now, you're looking for
 

2649
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,109
through that. Now, you're looking for
265s. And if you got very very very

2650
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:17,119
265s. And if you got very very very
 

2651
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,750
265s. And if you got very very very
lucky, uh, you could look for higher

lucky, uh, you could look for higher
 

2653
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,549
lucky, uh, you could look for higher
into like 350. I don't think I don't

2654
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:22,559
into like 350. I don't think I don't
 

2655
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,710
into like 350. I don't think I don't
think we'll do it. I don't think we'll

01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:24,720
think we'll do it. I don't think we'll
 

2657
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,990
think we'll do it. I don't think we'll
do that. I think we'll rotate. There's

2658
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,000
do that. I think we'll rotate. There's

2749
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,670
a quick look higher on bookmap to see if
there's anyone stacking. 29300's are

2750
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:33,680
there's anyone stacking. 29300's are
 

2751
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,789
there's anyone stacking. 29300's are
being stacked and 350

2752
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:38,799

 

2753
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,029

Well, you've got guys stacking into

2754
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
Well, you've got guys stacking into
 

2755
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,630
Well, you've got guys stacking into
these boxes uh into orange and gray. So,

2756
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:44,640
these boxes uh into orange and gray. So,
 

2757
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,069
these boxes uh into orange and gray. So,
maybe maybe you get lucky here. Maybe

2758
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:48,079
maybe maybe you get lucky here. Maybe
 

2759
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,710
maybe maybe you get lucky here. Maybe
you get the full move. I would not be

2760
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:50,720
you get the full move. I would not be
 

2761
01:06:50,720 --> 01:07:12,150
you get the full move. I would not be
getting long up here now, though.

2762
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,160

 

2763
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,430

Vick's getting crushed here. So Vick's

2764
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:15,440
Vick's getting crushed here. So Vick's
 

2765
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,789
Vick's getting crushed here. So Vick's
next level we can look for is previous

2766
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:16,799
next level we can look for is previous
 

2767
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:21,029
next level we can look for is previous
day low which will be 1728. So this can

2768
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,039
day low which will be 1728. So this can
 

2769
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,549
day low which will be 1728. So this can
keep lifting if VIX is going to keep

2770
01:07:22,549 --> 01:07:22,559
keep lifting if VIX is going to keep
 

2771
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,589
keep lifting if VIX is going to keep
doing that. You might get lucky. Oh my

2772
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599
doing that. You might get lucky. Oh my
 

2773
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:28,150
doing that. You might get lucky. Oh my
god, this one's going to hurt, man.

2774
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:28,160
god, this one's going to hurt, man.
 

2775
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,230
god, this one's going to hurt, man.
Because if I had this original position

2776
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,240
Because if I had this original position
 

2777
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,630
Because if I had this original position
and not moved my stop under that shelf,

2778
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
and not moved my stop under that shelf,
 

2779
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,710
and not moved my stop under that shelf,
I would still have 10% left looking for

2780
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
I would still have 10% left looking for
 

2781
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,789
I would still have 10% left looking for
this, which would be 200 pointer.

2782
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
this, which would be 200 pointer.
 

2783
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:53,349
this, which would be 200 pointer.
Never mind.

2785
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,230

I'm going to remove this red block now
 

2787
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:04,309
I'm going to remove this red block now
that we've traded through it. All right.

2788
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319

 

2789
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:14,789

This was the pullback today with a

2868
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
This was the pullback today with a
 

2869
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,950
This was the pullback today with a
double bottom. So, the bottom was 6:00

2870
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
double bottom. So, the bottom was 6:00
 

2871
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,709
double bottom. So, the bottom was 6:00
a.m. and then that pullback we we looked

2872
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
a.m. and then that pullback we we looked
 

2873
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,790
a.m. and then that pullback we we looked
at the blue box, same level. They've bid

2874
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:08,800
at the blue box, same level. They've bid
 

2875
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,350
at the blue box, same level. They've bid
it back up

2876
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360
it back up
 

2877
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,790
it back up
and I think they want this at the

2878
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:12,800
and I think they want this at the
 

2879
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,350
and I think they want this at the
moment. Big buy got a little bit stuck

2880
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,360
moment. Big buy got a little bit stuck
 

2881
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,630
moment. Big buy got a little bit stuck
there at 50s, folks. Decent size lot.

2882
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:18,640

100 lot stuck up there at the 950s now.
So, worth thinking about that. Even if

2886
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:22,880
So, worth thinking about that. Even if
 

2887
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,470
So, worth thinking about that. Even if
we explode above him and then come back

2888
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
we explode above him and then come back
 

2889
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,310
we explode above him and then come back
under him, we have imbalances down here

2890
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
under him, we have imbalances down here
 

2891
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:34,070
under him, we have imbalances down here
into 30s and 20s.

2892
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:34,080

 

2893
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,630

I think it wants more. ES ES did just

2894
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
I think it wants more. ES ES did just
 

2895
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,990
I think it wants more. ES ES did just
take out that Gloex level.

2896
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,000
take out that Gloex level.
 

2897
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,750
take out that Gloex level.
I'm not convinced this is done yet. They

2898
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:41,760
I'm not convinced this is done yet. They
 

2899
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,110
I'm not convinced this is done yet. They
might just want one more trap before

2900
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:43,120
might just want one more trap before
 

2901
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,750
might just want one more trap before
they try and finish it. We'll see. We've

2902
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:45,760
they try and finish it. We'll see. We've
 

2903
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,790
they try and finish it. We'll see. We've
got imbalances, like I said, 30

2904
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:48,800
got imbalances, like I said, 30
 

2905
01:10:48,800 --> 01:11:01,510
got imbalances, like I said, 30
twos and 28s and 23s.

2906
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520

 

2907
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,630

Might come and fill some of these

2908
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:02,640
Might come and fill some of these
 

2909
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,950
Might come and fill some of these
imbalances. We have just been efficient.

2910
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
imbalances. We have just been efficient.
 

2911
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,630
imbalances. We have just been efficient.
So, into that first imbalance here.

2912
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:06,640
So, into that first imbalance here.
 

2913
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,790

guys, just to be honest with you. Once I
saw that buyer trapped and we came back

2920
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:15,600
saw that buyer trapped and we came back
 

2921
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,149
saw that buyer trapped and we came back
under 40s for these imbalance fills.

2922

That's the third imbalance now tapped

2924
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:19,840
That's the third imbalance now tapped
 

2925
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,390
That's the third imbalance now tapped
into there into 22s.

2926
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,400
into there into 22s.
 

2927
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,229
into there into 22s.
Still in this now seeing if we retest

2928
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:24,239
Still in this now seeing if we retest
 

2929
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,070
Still in this now seeing if we retest
16s or not. I don't want to reclaim a

2930
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
16s or not. I don't want to reclaim a
 

2931
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,510
16s or not. I don't want to reclaim a
30s here where we've got a sellside

2932
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:27,520
30s here where we've got a sellside
 

2933
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,070
30s here where we've got a sellside
imbalance. It's just a scalp and I'll

2934
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:30,080
imbalance. It's just a scalp and I'll
 

2935
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,870
imbalance. It's just a scalp and I'll
watch this if we come to 16s and if we

2936
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:32,880
watch this if we come to 16s and if we
 

2937
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,510
watch this if we come to 16s and if we
back test and lose this gray box. Here

2938
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
back test and lose this gray box. Here
 

2939

01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:38,000
we go out here on a runner. Just had had
 

2941
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,590
we go out here on a runner. Just had had
a little scalp there just cuz I saw the

2942
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:39,600
a little scalp there just cuz I saw the
 

2943
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,870
a little scalp there just cuz I saw the
player get stuck at the highs. All

2944
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:40,880

2946
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,640
right. So show you again. I can't always
 

2947
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,390
right. So show you again. I can't always
do this because I have to be very quick.

2948
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:44,400
do this because I have to be very quick.
 

2949

That was the buyer getting stuck. See,

01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000
That was the buyer getting stuck. See,
 

2951
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,669
That was the buyer getting stuck. See,
the buyer got stuck. We came under his

2952
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:47,679
the buyer got stuck. We came under his
 

2953
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:50,149
the buyer got stuck. We came under his
level once we lost lost. Where did I

2954
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
level once we lost lost. Where did I
 

2955
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,149
level once we lost lost. Where did I
start attacking? 40s. We had some

2956
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
start attacking? 40s. We had some
 

2957
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:53,910
start attacking? 40s. We had some
imbalances to fill here back into this

2958
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:53,920
imbalances to fill here back into this
 

2959
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,229
imbalances to fill here back into this
key level here. 28. I want to see if we

2960
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:56,239
key level here. 28. I want to see if we
 

2961
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,070
key level here. 28. I want to see if we
get under value. I'm out of this now.

2962
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:58,080
get under value. I'm out of this now.
 

2963
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,870
get under value. I'm out of this now.
And uh we'll just see around this gray

2964
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:00,880
And uh we'll just see around this gray
 

2965
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,550
And uh we'll just see around this gray
box if we do a bit of a dance for a

2966
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:02,560
box if we do a bit of a dance for a
 

2967
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,149
box if we do a bit of a dance for a
while.

2973
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,709

2975
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,550

might as well put something on. Too good
 

2979
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,350
might as well put something on. Too good
not to just into the gray box. Still

01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:19,360
not to just into the gray box. Still
 

2981
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,430
not to just into the gray box. Still
think they want more upside but could

think they want more upside but could
 

2983
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:41,669
think they want more upside but could
use his pain for a minute.

3045
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,390
All right, gray box to gray box here. We
can just move this one over. That trap

I would say ES has done the move,
though. It's now losing previous day

3056
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:16,719
though. It's now losing previous day
 

3057
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,910
though. It's now losing previous day
high. We have to see now. If they fail

3058
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:19,920
high. We have to see now. If they fail
 

3059
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,830
high. We have to see now. If they fail
to reclaim, they might shove this all

3060
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840
to reclaim, they might shove this all
 

3061
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,189
to reclaim, they might shove this all
the way back down into these kind of

3062
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:23,199
the way back down into these kind of
 

3063
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:24,870
the way back down into these kind of
areas. There are other nodes, though.

3064
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:24,880
areas. There are other nodes, though.
 

3065
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,630
areas. There are other nodes, though.
It's kind of messy how they've developed

3066
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:26,640
It's kind of messy how they've developed
 

3067
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,950
It's kind of messy how they've developed
this. I'll be honest with you. Not the

3068
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
this. I'll be honest with you. Not the
 

3069
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,669
this. I'll be honest with you. Not the
prettiest. This is the big level, right?

3070
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:31,679
prettiest. This is the big level, right?
 

3071
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,189
prettiest. This is the big level, right?
Where was that big player? I've got to

3072
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:33,199
Where was that big player? I've got to
 

3073
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,870
Where was that big player? I've got to
remind myself where that huge player

3074
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:34,880
remind myself where that huge player
 

3075
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,990
remind myself where that huge player
was.

3076
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:38,000

 

3077
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,990

Was it 20s? Why can't I remember this

3078
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:40,000
Was it 20s? Why can't I remember this
 

3079
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,910
Was it 20s? Why can't I remember this
now? Where is he on my book?

3080
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:43,920
now? Where is he on my book?
 

3081
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,510
now? Where is he on my book?
120. Okay, I need to remember that.

3082
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,520
120. Okay, I need to remember that.
 

3083
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,030
120. Okay, I need to remember that.
Okay, it might come down for this and

3084
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,040
Okay, it might come down for this and
 

3085
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,790
Okay, it might come down for this and
retest it. It might be backside here,

3086
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:50,800
retest it. It might be backside here,
 

3087
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,310
retest it. It might be backside here,
but we'll see if they protect this low,

3088
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,320
but we'll see if they protect this low,
 

3089
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,830
but we'll see if they protect this low,
then they'll have one more shot to go

3090
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:53,840
then they'll have one more shot to go
 

3091
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,990
then they'll have one more shot to go
back up. Like I said, I think we're

3092
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,000
back up. Like I said, I think we're
 

3093
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:05,350
back up. Like I said, I think we're
going a rotation day.

3094
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360

 

3095
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,430

Watching the 80s. 80s is where that

3096
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
Watching the 80s. 80s is where that
 

3097
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,830
Watching the 80s. 80s is where that
buyer stepped in before

3098
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
buyer stepped in before
 

3099
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,790
buyer stepped in before
here. This trap.

3100
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:12,800
here. This trap.
 

3101
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,590
here. This trap.
So they might do 200 to 80s rotation

3102
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
So they might do 200 to 80s rotation
 

3103
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,350
So they might do 200 to 80s rotation
here. And then what we do after that,

3104
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
here. And then what we do after that,
 

3105
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,030
here. And then what we do after that,
it's going to become hard. Here we go. I

3106
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:19,040
it's going to become hard. Here we go. I
 

3107
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,590
it's going to become hard. Here we go. I
[\h__\h] have the short as well.

3108
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
[\h__\h] have the short as well.
 

3109
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,350
[\h__\h] have the short as well.
Oh, there we go. They might come all the

3110
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
Oh, there we go. They might come all the
 

3111
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,030
Oh, there we go. They might come all the
way down. If we start losing this level

3112
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
way down. If we start losing this level
 

3113
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,590
way down. If we start losing this level
here, 80s, uh, we can come all the way

3114
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:27,600
here, 80s, uh, we can come all the way
 

3115
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,189
here, 80s, uh, we can come all the way
back down into this block down here,

3116
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:29,199
back down into this block down here,
 

3117
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,709
back down into this block down here,
which is where that big buyer had been

3118
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
which is where that big buyer had been
 

3119
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,990
which is where that big buyer had been
participating. So, I would say now we'll

3120
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,000
participating. So, I would say now we'll
 

3121
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,070
participating. So, I would say now we'll
rotate between these and make a decision

3122
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
rotate between these and make a decision
 

3123
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,950
rotate between these and make a decision
of this or this. This is kind of nasty

3124
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:38,960
of this or this. This is kind of nasty
 

3125
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,310
of this or this. This is kind of nasty
how they've got this double one. If they

3126
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,320
how they've got this double one. If they
 

3127
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,189
how they've got this double one. If they
lose this, we come down

3128
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:43,199
lose this, we come down
 

3129
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:47,350
lose this, we come down
and I'm short from 40s. Oh my god.

3130
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,360
and I'm short from 40s. Oh my god.
 

3131
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:53,669
and I'm short from 40s. Oh my god.
Oh my god.

3132
01:15:53,669 --> 01:15:53,679

 

3133
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,390

So that player at the high is becoming

3134
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
So that player at the high is becoming
 

3135
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,990
So that player at the high is becoming
the liquidity. This guy up here got

3136
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,000
the liquidity. This guy up here got
 

3137
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,350
the liquidity. This guy up here got
caught and we're kind of come back down.

3138
01:15:59,350 --> 01:15:59,360
caught and we're kind of come back down.
 

3139
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,110
caught and we're kind of come back down.
We have more imbalances to fill down

3140
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:01,120
We have more imbalances to fill down
 

3141
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,910
We have more imbalances to fill down
here. Maybe into 50s and 45s. Very, very

3142
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
here. Maybe into 50s and 45s. Very, very
 

3143
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,750
here. Maybe into 50s and 45s. Very, very
possible.

3144
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:05,760
possible.
 

3145
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,750
possible.
This 80 player here, Key, if we stay

3146
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
This 80 player here, Key, if we stay
 

3147
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,350
This 80 player here, Key, if we stay
under him, we probably fill all of these

3148
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:09,360
under him, we probably fill all of these
 

3149
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,990
under him, we probably fill all of these
now. Oh god, too late for me now. Wanted

3150
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:12,000
now. Oh god, too late for me now. Wanted
 

3151
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,070
now. Oh god, too late for me now. Wanted
to play the edge.

3152
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:14,080
to play the edge.
 

3153
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:20,470
to play the edge.
Wanted to play the edge.

3154
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480

 

3155
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,070

you just start using trading view for

3156
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,080
you just start using trading view for
 

3157
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,590
you just start using trading view for
charting and realize it's delayed data.

3158
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:23,600
charting and realize it's delayed data.
 

3159
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,510
charting and realize it's delayed data.
Well, for futures it will be delayed

3160
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:25,520
Well, for futures it will be delayed
 

3161
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,910
Well, for futures it will be delayed
data unless you pay for CME or you log

you log into trade of a on trading view
you will get the data but um otherwise

you will get the data but um otherwise
 

3169
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,709
you will get the data but um otherwise
you can pay I think it's like five or

you can pay I think it's like five or
 

3171
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,390
you can pay I think it's like five or
eight bucks a month or something for CME

3172
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
eight bucks a month or something for CME
 

3173

be.

3176
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:42,400
be.
 

3177
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,189
be.
Okay, down to previous day close here

3178
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:45,199
Okay, down to previous day close here
 

3179
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:46,950
Okay, down to previous day close here
filling these imbalances. Oh, that's

3180
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960
filling these imbalances. Oh, that's
 

3181
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:56,790
filling these imbalances. Oh, that's
painful. That is painful.

3182
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:56,800

 

3183
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,630

I seem to be using two to three

3184
01:16:58,630 --> 01:16:58,640
I seem to be using two to three
 

3185
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,790
I seem to be using two to three
different tools. Well, volume is free.

3186
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:00,800
different tools. Well, volume is free.
 

3187
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,550
different tools. Well, volume is free.
Uh the flow zones, a version of this

3188
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:02,560
Uh the flow zones, a version of this
 

3189

I teach you how to use footprint. Um,
 

3199
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,070
I teach you how to use footprint. Um,
same with Bookmap. I teach you how to

3203
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:27,750
use it. I don't I don't provide it.
I don't make it. I don't own it.

3204
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760

go back down. So, it's the same concept,

3210
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:33,280
go back down. So, it's the same concept,
 

3211
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,910
go back down. So, it's the same concept,
right? Think about what we've had today.

3212
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:35,920
right? Think about what we've had today.
 

3213
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,950
right? Think about what we've had today.
That 100 lot guy got caught up at these

3214
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:38,960
That 100 lot guy got caught up at these
 

3215
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,990
That 100 lot guy got caught up at these
highs, right? And once he's stuck and

3216
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,000
highs, right? And once he's stuck and
 

3217
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,430
highs, right? And once he's stuck and
they've sold into him and they pair off

3218
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
they've sold into him and they pair off
 

3219
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,030
they've sold into him and they pair off
and they trade back down inside. If we

3220
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
and they trade back down inside. If we
 

3221
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,070
and they trade back down inside. If we
think about the low of day, the big 100

3222
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,080
think about the low of day, the big 100
 

3223
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,149
think about the low of day, the big 100
lot sellers came in where we thought

3224
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:50,159
lot sellers came in where we thought
 

3225
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,750
lot sellers came in where we thought
buyers would step in. They get caught

3226
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
buyers would step in. They get caught
 

3227
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,430
buyers would step in. They get caught
and we use their pain to go higher. What

3228
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:53,440
and we use their pain to go higher. What
 

3229
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,950
and we use their pain to go higher. What
I don't really want to do is trade like

3230
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960
I don't really want to do is trade like
 

3231
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,870
I don't really want to do is trade like
around the mid. Right. So the longs were

3232
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
around the mid. Right. So the longs were
 

3233
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,790
around the mid. Right. So the longs were
here and the shorts were probably here.

3234
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
here and the shorts were probably here.
 

3235
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,510
here and the shorts were probably here.
So I might have to sit this out for a

3236
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:01,520
So I might have to sit this out for a
 

3237
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,430
So I might have to sit this out for a
bit now.

3238
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:03,440
bit now.
 

3239
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,110
bit now.
It might be that sit this out unless we

3240
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:05,120
It might be that sit this out unless we
 

3241
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,790
It might be that sit this out unless we
can get a pop to fade or a real dump

3242
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:06,800
can get a pop to fade or a real dump
 

3243
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,030
can get a pop to fade or a real dump
that gets soaked up. I don't want to be

3244
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,040
that gets soaked up. I don't want to be
 

3245
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,790
that gets soaked up. I don't want to be
trading the midpoint of the range. It's

3246
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:10,800
trading the midpoint of the range. It's
 

3247
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,229
trading the midpoint of the range. It's
going to get harder and harder to trade

3248
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
going to get harder and harder to trade
 

3249
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,390
going to get harder and harder to trade
in here. We've got all these the way

3250
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
in here. We've got all these the way
 

3251
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,750
in here. We've got all these the way
especially with how we've developed the

3252
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:15,760
especially with how we've developed the
 

3253
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,750
especially with how we've developed the
nodes, right?

3254
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
nodes, right?
 

3255
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,270
nodes, right?
Especially how we've developed these

3256
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
Especially how we've developed these
 

3257
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:37,990
Especially how we've developed these
nodes.

3273
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,709

Okay, so gray to gray again. Probably we

3274
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
Okay, so gray to gray again. Probably we
 

3275
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,630
Okay, so gray to gray again. Probably we
have an imbalance here at 200. If they

3276
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:10,640
have an imbalance here at 200. If they
 

3277
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,950
have an imbalance here at 200. If they
lift 200, we're going to trade 26s again

3278
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
lift 200, we're going to trade 26s again
 

3279
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,350
lift 200, we're going to trade 26s again
up here.

3280
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:17,360

 

3281
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,950

So, I'm interested how we operate up

3282
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:18,960
So, I'm interested how we operate up
 

3283
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,709
So, I'm interested how we operate up
here. Obviously, we didn't take out the

3284
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:20,719
here. Obviously, we didn't take out the
 

3285
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,950
here. Obviously, we didn't take out the
the final low hanging fruit, the GlobeEx

3286
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:22,960
the final low hanging fruit, the GlobeEx
 

3287
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:29,990
the final low hanging fruit, the GlobeEx
on um n on NQ

3288
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,000

 

3289
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,669

and main order flow today has still been

3290
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:31,679
and main order flow today has still been
 

3291
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,510
and main order flow today has still been
bullish. So, we just have to see. Do we

3292
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:33,520
bullish. So, we just have to see. Do we
 

3293
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,350
bullish. So, we just have to see. Do we
see failure to follow through up here,

3294
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:35,360
see failure to follow through up here,
 

3295
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,189
see failure to follow through up here,
right? Do we see a move up here where

3296
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:37,199
right? Do we see a move up here where
 

3297
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,189
right? Do we see a move up here where
buyers get stuck and they resell it or

3298
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:39,199
buyers get stuck and they resell it or
 

3299
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,870
buyers get stuck and they resell it or
are we going to see this? That's the

3300
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
are we going to see this? That's the
 

3301
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,310
are we going to see this? That's the
question right now I'm posing. I don't

3302
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,320
question right now I'm posing. I don't
 

3303
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,910
question right now I'm posing. I don't
mind which. I probably won't play the

3304
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:43,920
mind which. I probably won't play the
 

3305
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,910
mind which. I probably won't play the
long, but if I see buyers get stuck

3306
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
long, but if I see buyers get stuck
 

3307
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,590
long, but if I see buyers get stuck
there and I think this is going to be

3308
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
there and I think this is going to be
 

3309
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,030
there and I think this is going to be
failure to follow through, I'll consider

3310
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:49,040
failure to follow through, I'll consider
 

3311
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:55,110
failure to follow through, I'll consider
the short

3312
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,120

 

3313
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,030

previous day high. Not seen buyers get

3314
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:57,040
previous day high. Not seen buyers get
 

3315
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,470
previous day high. Not seen buyers get
stuck yet. They're being aggressive. I

3316
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:58,480
stuck yet. They're being aggressive. I
 

3317
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,910
stuck yet. They're being aggressive. I
think they're going to try and resqueeze

3318
01:19:59,910 --> 01:19:59,920
think they're going to try and resqueeze
 

3319
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,310
think they're going to try and resqueeze
this.

3320
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:04,320

personal preference.
They're still looking to drive this

3332
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:16,480
They're still looking to drive this
 

3333
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,550
They're still looking to drive this
higher top side of this gray box. And if

3334
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:18,560
higher top side of this gray box. And if
 

3335
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,709
higher top side of this gray box. And if
they get through this, then I think uh

3336
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:20,719
they get through this, then I think uh
 

3337
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,390
they get through this, then I think uh
up here and maybe even up here is

3338
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,400
up here and maybe even up here is
 

3339
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,910
up here and maybe even up here is
possible.

3340
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:23,920
possible.
 

3341
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,669
possible.
Want a big old squeeze out. Yeah,

3342
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
Want a big old squeeze out. Yeah,
 

3343
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,430
Want a big old squeeze out. Yeah,
exactly. What? squeezed gray box to gray

3344
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
exactly. What? squeezed gray box to gray
 

3345
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,510
exactly. What? squeezed gray box to gray
box. Held the PDC, reclaimed same level

3346
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:29,520
box. Held the PDC, reclaimed same level
 

3347
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,030
box. Held the PDC, reclaimed same level
that they trapped in before, right? Same

3348
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
that they trapped in before, right? Same
 

3349
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,790
that they trapped in before, right? Same
level, same kind of thing. Did the dance

3350
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
level, same kind of thing. Did the dance
 

3351
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,669
level, same kind of thing. Did the dance
at 180, reclaimed and gone and right

3352
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:35,679
at 180, reclaimed and gone and right
 

3353
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:37,590
at 180, reclaimed and gone and right
back to this top side. I just don't want

3354
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
back to this top side. I just don't want
 

3355
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,669
back to this top side. I just don't want
to play the midpoint anymore when we

3356
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:39,679
to play the midpoint anymore when we
 

3357
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,270
to play the midpoint anymore when we
think about where we are in the IB. I'm

3358
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:41,280
think about where we are in the IB. I'm
 

3359
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,550
think about where we are in the IB. I'm
not really interested in playing that.

3360
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:42,560
not really interested in playing that.
 

3361
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,790
not really interested in playing that.
So, I'm interested now if we fail here

3362
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:44,800
So, I'm interested now if we fail here
 

3363
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,950
So, I'm interested now if we fail here
or if we're I

3364
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:46,960
or if we're I
 

3365
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,630
or if we're I
I guess I could think about an IB

3366
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:48,640
I guess I could think about an IB
 

3367
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,910
I guess I could think about an IB
expansion or an IB failure. We'll see.

3368
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
expansion or an IB failure. We'll see.
 

3369
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,590
expansion or an IB failure. We'll see.
We'll see. Just got to let it set up

3370
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,600
We'll see. Just got to let it set up
 

3371
01:20:53,600 --> 01:21:06,870
We'll see. Just got to let it set up
now. Let it build some liquidity.

3372
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:06,880

 

3373
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,630

Watching this previous day high that red

3374
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:08,640
Watching this previous day high that red
 

3375
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,510
Watching this previous day high that red
line how they act there

3376
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
line how they act there
 

3377
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,550
line how they act there
are trying to absorb there right now.

3378
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
are trying to absorb there right now.
 

3379
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,030
are trying to absorb there right now.
Yes, breaking out for a new high of day

3380
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
Yes, breaking out for a new high of day
 

3381
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:29,830
Yes, breaking out for a new high of day
as well.

3382
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:29,840

 

3383
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,510

Nice DTN. Look forward to working with

3384
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:31,520
Nice DTN. Look forward to working with
 

3385
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,350
Nice DTN. Look forward to working with
you.

3386
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
you.
 

3387
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,110
you.
So, node being developed here. That gray

3388
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:35,120
So, node being developed here. That gray
 

3389
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,990
So, node being developed here. That gray
box. No entry for me yet. I still think

3390
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000
box. No entry for me yet. I still think
 

3391
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,590
box. No entry for me yet. I still think
there's a chance to break out here, but

3392
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:39,600
there's a chance to break out here, but
 

3393
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,950
there's a chance to break out here, but
we'll see. I'm not going to play the

3394
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
we'll see. I'm not going to play the
 

3395
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,630
we'll see. I'm not going to play the
longs, but I think it wants to break

3396
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:42,640
longs, but I think it wants to break
 

3397
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,830
longs, but I think it wants to break
out. I'm more interested in fades once

3398
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:45,840
out. I'm more interested in fades once
 

3399
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,550
out. I'm more interested in fades once
we get stuck. Unless we can set like a

3400
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:48,560
we get stuck. Unless we can set like a
 

3401
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,910
we get stuck. Unless we can set like a
giant trap. We'll see. Maybe that would

3402
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:51,920
giant trap. We'll see. Maybe that would
 

3403
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,229
giant trap. We'll see. Maybe that would
might have done it already under that 80

3404
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
might have done it already under that 80
 

3405
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,550
might have done it already under that 80
again. Remember we have liquidity stuck

3406
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:56,560
again. Remember we have liquidity stuck
 

3407
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,390
again. Remember we have liquidity stuck
at 50. That big buyer, the high day

3408
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
at 50. That big buyer, the high day
 

3409
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,229
at 50. That big buyer, the high day
buyer, he's stuck at 50. I really need a

3410
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:00,239
buyer, he's stuck at 50. I really need a
 

3411
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:03,750
buyer, he's stuck at 50. I really need a
coffee right now.

3412
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:03,760
coffee right now.
 

3413
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,750
coffee right now.
What do you do to cross the intraday

3414
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:05,760
What do you do to cross the intraday
 

3415
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,629
What do you do to cross the intraday
trading on a brand new TPT Pro in terms

3416
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:08,639
trading on a brand new TPT Pro in terms
 

3417
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,310
trading on a brand new TPT Pro in terms
of what your maximum takeprofit or

3418
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320
of what your maximum takeprofit or
 

3419
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,390
of what your maximum takeprofit or
points is or stop loss? Well, your take

3420
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,400
points is or stop loss? Well, your take
 

3421
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,669
points is or stop loss? Well, your take
profit and your stop loss should be

3422
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:13,679
profit and your stop loss should be
 

3423
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,990
profit and your stop loss should be
based on the liquidity in front of you

3424
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
based on the liquidity in front of you
 

3425
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,510
based on the liquidity in front of you
where the levels are, not based on a

3426
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
where the levels are, not based on a
 

3427
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,510
where the levels are, not based on a
cash amount. So you should work out what

3428
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:19,520
cash amount. So you should work out what
 

3429
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,110
cash amount. So you should work out what
you're willing to lose or what you're

3430
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,120
you're willing to lose or what you're
 

3431
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,390
you're willing to lose or what you're
trying to make and base it upon your

3432
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:24,400
trying to make and base it upon your
 

3433
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,189
trying to make and base it upon your
contract size upon where those that

3437
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,990
trade's no longer valid in terms of how
to deal with it. Well, probably size

3438
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
to deal with it. Well, probably size
 

3439
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,790

down, take your time, you know, break it
 

3441
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,350
down, take your time, you know, break it
down into 10 days or 5 days or 20 days

down into 10 days or 5 days or 20 days

to get past the trading draw down or
 

3445
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,110
to get past the trading draw down or
whatever it is. Don't be too aggressive

3446
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:41,120
whatever it is. Don't be too aggressive
 

3447
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,709
whatever it is. Don't be too aggressive
on day one. And once you're past the

3448
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:42,719
on day one. And once you're past the
 

3449
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,070
on day one. And once you're past the
trading draw down, you can do your set

3450
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,080
trading draw down, you can do your set
 

3451
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,070

01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,080

3453
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,270
and forgets, right? Gets a lot easier.
All right, back down to this previous

3454
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:47,280
All right, back down to this previous
 

3455
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,830
All right, back down to this previous
day high. Still don't like how we're

3456
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:49,840
day high. Still don't like how we're
 

3457
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,350
day high. Still don't like how we're
shaping up here. I still think there's a

3458
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
shaping up here. I still think there's a
 

3459
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:57,189
shaping up here. I still think there's a
chance they shove it again.

3460
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:57,199

 

3461
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,030

How do you get anchored volume profile

3462
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,040
How do you get anchored volume profile
 

3463
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,709
How do you get anchored volume profile
to now to not cover candles? Why have it

3464
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:02,719
to now to not cover candles? Why have it
 

3465
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:09,430
to now to not cover candles? Why have it
set to the right pin to the right?

3466
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:09,440

 

3467
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,350

How do I calculate value levels? Any

3468
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:11,360
How do I calculate value levels? Any
 

3469
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,870
How do I calculate value levels? Any
chance they might be wrong because I see

3470
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:12,880
chance they might be wrong because I see
 

3471
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,550
chance they might be wrong because I see
different? It's a chance they're wrong.

3472
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:14,560
different? It's a chance they're wrong.
 

3473
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,510
different? It's a chance they're wrong.
It depends how they calculate them. Uh,

3474
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
It depends how they calculate them. Uh,
 

3475
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,110
It depends how they calculate them. Uh,
depends what time frame you're on. It

3476
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,120
depends what time frame you're on. It
 

3477
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,550
depends what time frame you're on. It
depends what you're using. Trading View

3478
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:20,560
depends what you're using. Trading View
 

3479
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,070
depends what you're using. Trading View
is normally slightly different to Ninja

3480
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,080
is normally slightly different to Ninja
 

3481
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:32,629
is normally slightly different to Ninja
Trader. So, I have both on my screens.

3482
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:32,639

 

3483
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:35,350

Yes. Breaking out here. I think ENQ

3484
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:35,360
Yes. Breaking out here. I think ENQ
 

3485
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,590
Yes. Breaking out here. I think ENQ
wants to go. We still got that bias

3486
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:37,600
wants to go. We still got that bias
 

3487
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,990
wants to go. We still got that bias
stuck at 50s. Once you get above 50s, I

3488
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:40,000
stuck at 50s. Once you get above 50s, I
 

3489
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,310
stuck at 50s. Once you get above 50s, I
think you're going to get a rip. But

3490
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:42,320
think you're going to get a rip. But
 

3491
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,229
think you're going to get a rip. But
it's just whether they turn on the juice

3492
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:44,239
it's just whether they turn on the juice
 

3493
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:47,750
it's just whether they turn on the juice
or not here.

3494
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:47,760

 

3495
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,510

They're trying. They are trying. The way

3496
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:49,520
They're trying. They are trying. The way
 

3497
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,709
They're trying. They are trying. The way
they're building out the liquidity here

3498
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:50,719
they're building out the liquidity here
 

3499
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,149
they're building out the liquidity here
is not great. I still think there's more

3500
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:52,159
is not great. I still think there's more
 

3501
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:53,750
is not great. I still think there's more
upside in this which why I'm not playing

3502
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:53,760
upside in this which why I'm not playing
 

3503
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,149
upside in this which why I'm not playing
downside. 250 is coming up. There's the

3504
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:56,159
downside. 250 is coming up. There's the
 

3505
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:57,830
downside. 250 is coming up. There's the
test towards 250s. Once you get through

3506
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:57,840
test towards 250s. Once you get through
 

3507
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,350
test towards 250s. Once you get through
that, there's a resqueeze because that's

3508
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,360
that, there's a resqueeze because that's
 

3509
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,110
that, there's a resqueeze because that's
where that big player that 100 lot got

3510
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
where that big player that 100 lot got
 

3511
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,270
where that big player that 100 lot got
stuck before. So if you are long, I'd be

3512
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:03,280
stuck before. So if you are long, I'd be
 

3513
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,669
stuck before. So if you are long, I'd be
taking a partial into this guy at 250.

3514
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:05,679
taking a partial into this guy at 250.
 

3515
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,510
taking a partial into this guy at 250.
And if you get through him, you'll be

3516
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:07,520
And if you get through him, you'll be
 

3517
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,590
And if you get through him, you'll be
looking for

3518
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:09,600
looking for
 

3519
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,550
looking for
uh 66s and then this gray box above. So

3520
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:12,560
uh 66s and then this gray box above. So
 

3521
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,030
uh 66s and then this gray box above. So
here's the 250. You need this guy not to

3522
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:15,040
here's the 250. You need this guy not to
 

3523
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,270
here's the 250. You need this guy not to
become a seller. You need this guy up

3524
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
become a seller. You need this guy up
 

3525
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,790
become a seller. You need this guy up
here not to become a seller. So you want

3526
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:18,800
here not to become a seller. So you want
 

3527
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,629
here not to become a seller. So you want
to break through 250 and just rip some

3528
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:20,639
to break through 250 and just rip some
 

3529
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,430
to break through 250 and just rip some
faces. There's the 250. He's started

3530
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:23,440
faces. There's the 250. He's started
 

3531
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,350
faces. There's the 250. He's started
selling there. So he's got outbreak

3532
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:25,360
selling there. So he's got outbreak
 

3533
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,510
selling there. So he's got outbreak
even. Now if you rebid this above it,

3534
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
even. Now if you rebid this above it,
 

3535
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,270
even. Now if you rebid this above it,
you can look for 66s and 300s, right? So

3536
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
you can look for 66s and 300s, right? So
 

3537
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,350
you can look for 66s and 300s, right? So
like we said, there's a the buyer was

3538
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:33,360
like we said, there's a the buyer was
 

3539
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,189
like we said, there's a the buyer was
stuck at 250s. Look at that. right into

3540
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
stuck at 250s. Look at that. right into
 

3541
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,910
stuck at 250s. Look at that. right into
250. He became the seller. So, whoever

3542
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:37,920
250. He became the seller. So, whoever
 

3543
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,510
250. He became the seller. So, whoever
market ordered there before has probably

3544
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:39,520
market ordered there before has probably
 

3545
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,270
market ordered there before has probably
now got out. Now, if you re bid above

3546
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:41,280
now got out. Now, if you re bid above
 

3547
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,950
now got out. Now, if you re bid above
this, you should get the squeeze. There

3548
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:42,960
this, you should get the squeeze. There
 

3549
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,590
this, you should get the squeeze. There
you go. So, we should now get 66s and

3550
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:45,600
you go. So, we should now get 66s and
 

3551
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,229
you go. So, we should now get 66s and
potentially 300s if ES wants to carry

3552
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
potentially 300s if ES wants to carry
 

3553
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,990
potentially 300s if ES wants to carry
it. You should be taking a little bit of

3554
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
it. You should be taking a little bit of
 

3555
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,149

01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,910

Yes, a version of the indicator is in

01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:53,920
Yes, a version of the indicator is in
 

3637
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,270
Yes, a version of the indicator is in

3638
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:55,280
the course. So, if you open up the
 

3639
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,790
the course. So, if you open up the
course and scroll through it, you'll

3640
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:56,800
course and scroll through it, you'll
 

3641
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,350
course and scroll through it, you'll
find a version there as well, a version

3642
01:27:59,350 --> 01:27:59,360

for it there in the course. So, you've
 

3645
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,350
for it there in the course. So, you've
just got to go down into the course and

01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:03,360
just got to go down into the course and

3653
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,709

So I'll be using IB and 250 as your over

3654
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:20,719
So I'll be using IB and 250 as your over

3667
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,709
so quickly.
Yes. Holding up pretty well here.

3668
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:40,719
Yes. Holding up pretty well here.
 

3669
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,229
Yes. Holding up pretty well here.
So this imbalance being filled back to

3670
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:42,239
So this imbalance being filled back to
 

3671
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,149
So this imbalance being filled back to
this gray box. Do they rebid here or

3672
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:44,159
this gray box. Do they rebid here or
 

3673
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,550
this gray box. Do they rebid here or
not? Or are they now going to sell IB

3674
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:46,560
not? Or are they now going to sell IB
 

3675
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,510
not? Or are they now going to sell IB
and 50s for a bigger wash?

3676
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:49,520
and 50s for a bigger wash?
 

3677
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,189
and 50s for a bigger wash?
VIX has just come back under previous

3678
01:28:51,189 --> 01:28:51,199
VIX has just come back under previous
 

3679
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,590
VIX has just come back under previous
days low and found a bid. So we know. So

3680
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:53,600
days low and found a bid. So we know. So
 

3681
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,750
days low and found a bid. So we know. So
we're watching these 50s and IB. If they

3682
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:55,760
we're watching these 50s and IB. If they
 

3683
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,590
we're watching these 50s and IB. If they
start rejecting here, we might move

3684
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
start rejecting here, we might move
 

3685
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,709
start rejecting here, we might move
lower violently if they start rejecting.

3686
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:00,719
lower violently if they start rejecting.
 

3687
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:02,790
lower violently if they start rejecting.
So what I'd be looking for now is are

3688
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:02,800
So what I'd be looking for now is are
 

3689
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,110
So what I'd be looking for now is are
they going to do

3690
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,120

 

3691
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,870

Are you going to let me draw? No, you're

3692
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:08,880
Are you going to let me draw? No, you're
 

3693
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,070
Are you going to let me draw? No, you're
not. Are they going to reject 50s, come

3694
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:12,080
not. Are they going to reject 50s, come
 

3695
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,629
not. Are they going to reject 50s, come
under here and wash is what I'd be

3696
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:14,639
under here and wash is what I'd be
 

3697
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,030
under here and wash is what I'd be
watching carefully for. If not, they're

3698
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,040
watching carefully for. If not, they're
 

3699
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,149
watching carefully for. If not, they're
going to do it. They're going to do the

3700
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
going to do it. They're going to do the
 

3701
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,750
going to do it. They're going to do the
same trap and come back up for this

3702
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:19,760
same trap and come back up for this
 

3703
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,270
same trap and come back up for this
again.

3704
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
again.
 

3705
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,430
again.
So, these 50s big big level. They're

3706
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:23,440
So, these 50s big big level. They're
 

3707
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,870
So, these 50s big big level. They're
still adding liquidity higher though.

3708
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:24,880
still adding liquidity higher though.
 

3709
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,310
still adding liquidity higher though.
They're still adding liquidity at like

3710
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:26,320
They're still adding liquidity at like
 

3711
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,229
They're still adding liquidity at like
90s and 300. So, it looks like they're

3712
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:28,239
90s and 300. So, it looks like they're
 

3713
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:31,430
90s and 300. So, it looks like they're
trying to lift and ES is holding on

3714
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:31,440
trying to lift and ES is holding on
 

3715
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,830
trying to lift and ES is holding on
really really well. Doing all the work

3716
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:33,840
really really well. Doing all the work
 

3717
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,030
really really well. Doing all the work
so far. So, back to these 50s again.

3718
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:37,040
so far. So, back to these 50s again.
 

3719
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,550
so far. So, back to these 50s again.

give away a free course for you guys.
Just the introduction course.

3986
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600

 

3987
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,189

Still absorbing here. Still no follow

3988
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:23,199
Still absorbing here. Still no follow
 

3989
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:26,470
Still absorbing here. Still no follow
through underneath that uh 250 and IB

3990
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:26,480
through underneath that uh 250 and IB
 

3991
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,550
through underneath that uh 250 and IB
and value now moved up. Right. So this

3992
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:28,560
and value now moved up. Right. So this
 

3993
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,070
and value now moved up. Right. So this
is a massive level like this kind of

3994
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:30,080
is a massive level like this kind of
 

3995
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,470
is a massive level like this kind of
level here.

3996
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:32,480
level here.
 

3997
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,109
level here.
We are not leaving right now. We're

3998
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:35,119
We are not leaving right now. We're
 

3999
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,270
We are not leaving right now. We're
still absorbing

4000
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:37,280
still absorbing
 

4001
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,870
still absorbing
this level here. Right now, it's not a

4002
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
this level here. Right now, it's not a
 

4003
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,629
this level here. Right now, it's not a
node. It's just where they keep trying

4004
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:40,639
node. It's just where they keep trying
 

4005
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,870
node. It's just where they keep trying
to absorb price maybe to complete the

4006
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:42,880
to absorb price maybe to complete the
 

4007
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,030
to absorb price maybe to complete the
rotation up into here until they're done

4008
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:45,040
rotation up into here until they're done
 

4009
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:51,990
rotation up into here until they're done
with it. Unless we get a backside move.

4010
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:52,000

 

4011
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,510

Definitely seeing aggre aggressive

4012
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:53,520
Definitely seeing aggre aggressive
 

4013
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,189
Definitely seeing aggre aggressive
sellers. Aggressive sellers keep

4014
01:37:55,189 --> 01:37:55,199
sellers. Aggressive sellers keep
 

4015
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:57,030
sellers. Aggressive sellers keep
stepping in down here and they cannot

4016
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:57,040
stepping in down here and they cannot
 

4017
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,790
stepping in down here and they cannot
get follow through underneath these 50s.

4018
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:58,800
get follow through underneath these 50s.
 

4019
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,310
get follow through underneath these 50s.
That's what we can see right now at the

4020
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
That's what we can see right now at the
 

4021
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,990
That's what we can see right now at the
moment. They're not getting follow

4022
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:02,000
moment. They're not getting follow
 

4023
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,270
moment. They're not getting follow
through under the 50. So, I'm going to

4024
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:03,280
through under the 50. So, I'm going to
 

4025
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,709
through under the 50. So, I'm going to
remove that so it doesn't confuse you.

4026
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:04,719
remove that so it doesn't confuse you.
 

4027
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:05,990
remove that so it doesn't confuse you.
But, it's just a big level to be

4028
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:06,000
But, it's just a big level to be
 

4029
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,310
But, it's just a big level to be
watching.

4030
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:10,320

 

4031
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,550

You guys another minute to do that. VIC

4039
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,030
flying in 85. Yeah, 85 lot with a force
up. Here we go. So, they absorbed.

4040
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,040
up. Here we go. So, they absorbed.
 

4041
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,629
up. Here we go. So, they absorbed.
They're trying to complete this move to

4042
01:38:24,629 --> 01:38:24,639
They're trying to complete this move to
 

4043
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,430
They're trying to complete this move to
300 and maybe even 350s. Like I said on

4044
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:27,440
300 and maybe even 350s. Like I said on
 

4045
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,950
300 and maybe even 350s. Like I said on
the book, they kept adding liquidity up

4046
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:28,960
the book, they kept adding liquidity up
 

4047
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,550
the book, they kept adding liquidity up
here, trying to attract the market to

4048
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:30,560
here, trying to attract the market to
 

4049
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,070
here, trying to attract the market to
come up and fetch it, which is what

4050
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:32,080
come up and fetch it, which is what
 

4051
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,189
come up and fetch it, which is what
we're now seeing.

4052
01:38:35,189 --> 01:38:35,199
we're now seeing.
 

4053
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:37,430
we're now seeing.
There we go. There's the resqueeze up

There we go. There's the resqueeze up
 

4055
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,950
There we go. There's the resqueeze up
intowards here. You can see it all on

01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:38,960
intowards here. You can see it all on
 

4057
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,550
intowards here. You can see it all on
the book. So, they added so much on the

4058
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:40,560
the book. So, they added so much on the
 

4059
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,750
the book. So, they added so much on the
book. Are they going to add any more

4060
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
book. Are they going to add any more
 

4061
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:48,310
book. Are they going to add any more
above? No, not really.

4062
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:48,320

 

4063
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,990

This might be the limit to where they go

spike high from Sunday if they really

01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:43,760
spike high from Sunday if they really
 

4109
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,510
spike high from Sunday if they really
want to take GlobeEx out. But I'd watch

4110
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,520
want to take GlobeEx out. But I'd watch
 

4111
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,830
want to take GlobeEx out. But I'd watch
300 here very very carefully into and

4112
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:47,840
300 here very very carefully into and
 

4113
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,310
300 here very very carefully into and
around this box that whole number. But

4114
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:50,320
around this box that whole number. But
 

4115
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,310
around this box that whole number. But
if they want to do 50 points more, they

4116
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,320
if they want to do 50 points more, they
 

4117
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,070
if they want to do 50 points more, they
will. But we are getting a little bit

4118
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:54,080
will. But we are getting a little bit
 

4119
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,149
will. But we are getting a little bit
frothy up here. Little bit

4120
01:39:56,149 --> 01:39:56,159
frothy up here. Little bit
 

4121
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:58,149
frothy up here. Little bit
overexuberant.

4122
01:39:58,149 --> 01:39:58,159
overexuberant.
 

4123
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,990
overexuberant.
We never let go of that IB. So we need

4124
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:00,000
We never let go of that IB. So we need
 

4125
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,510
We never let go of that IB. So we need
to be aware of it. It's possible they

4126
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:01,520
to be aware of it. It's possible they
 

4127
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,109
to be aware of it. It's possible they
come for this. But this gray box got

4128
01:40:03,109 --> 01:40:03,119
come for this. But this gray box got
 

4129
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:05,030
come for this. But this gray box got
tagged. 300 got tagged like we talked

4130
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:05,040
tagged. 300 got tagged like we talked
 

4131
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,550
tagged. 300 got tagged like we talked
about.

4133
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,149

And we look for volume now to start

4134
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:10,159
And we look for volume now to start
 

4135
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:11,590
And we look for volume now to start
getting trapped anywhere from here all

4136
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:11,600
getting trapped anywhere from here all
 

4137
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,109
getting trapped anywhere from here all
the way up here. If if we're going to

4138
01:40:13,109 --> 01:40:13,119
the way up here. If if we're going to
 

4139
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,430
the way up here. If if we're going to
play that downside move until we see

4140
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:15,440
play that downside move until we see
 

4141
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,870
play that downside move until we see
volume trapped, we cannot play the

4142
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:16,880
volume trapped, we cannot play the
 

4143
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,590
volume trapped, we cannot play the
downside move. Auction at the high is a

4144
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:19,600
downside move. Auction at the high is a
 

4145
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,350
downside move. Auction at the high is a
45 lot at the high right now. We got

4146
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:21,360
45 lot at the high right now. We got
 

4147
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,350
45 lot at the high right now. We got
stuck, but it's not very big. Not too

4148
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:23,360
stuck, but it's not very big. Not too
 

4149
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:32,709
stuck, but it's not very big. Not too
much of a swipe.

4150
01:40:32,709 --> 01:40:32,719

 

4151
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,310

Back down we come. Watching this.

4152
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:36,320
Back down we come. Watching this.
 

4153
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,550
Back down we come. Watching this.
watching this. Now, if we leave these

4154
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:38,560
watching this. Now, if we leave these
 

4155
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,109
watching this. Now, if we leave these
nodes up here and start rejecting 88 and

4156
01:40:41,109 --> 01:40:41,119
nodes up here and start rejecting 88 and
 

4157
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:50,950
nodes up here and start rejecting 88 and
90s, I'm interested in the short.

4158
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:50,960

 

4159
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,390

Testing this old wick now.

4160
01:40:54,390 --> 01:40:54,400
Testing this old wick now.
 

4161
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,229
Testing this old wick now.
Do they offer a reload here? Do they get

4162
01:40:56,229 --> 01:40:56,239
Do they offer a reload here? Do they get
 

4163
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:58,310
Do they offer a reload here? Do they get
stuck versus 88 and 90s? I'm watching

4164
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:58,320
stuck versus 88 and 90s? I'm watching
 

4165
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,350
stuck versus 88 and 90s? I'm watching
this now to see if if we reject after

4166
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:01,360
this now to see if if we reject after
 

4167
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:04,790
this now to see if if we reject after
trapping and tapping this box. We don't

4168
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:04,800
trapping and tapping this box. We don't
 

4169
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,790
trapping and tapping this box. We don't
reject. There's no trade. Here's the

4170
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:06,800
reject. There's no trade. Here's the
 

4171
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,390
reject. There's no trade. Here's the
move back into it. If they reclaim this,

4172
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,400
move back into it. If they reclaim this,
 

4173
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:12,149
move back into it. If they reclaim this,
there's no trade. No trade. We need to

4174
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:12,159
there's no trade. No trade. We need to
 

4175
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:19,910
there's no trade. No trade. We need to
wait for a rejection and a leave.

4176
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:19,920

 

4177
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,350

Alex, would you advise copy trading

4178
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:21,360
Alex, would you advise copy trading
 

4179
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,870
Alex, would you advise copy trading
multiple accounts at the same time or

4180
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:22,880
multiple accounts at the same time or
 

4181
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,030
multiple accounts at the same time or
trade them individually? Guess what I'm

4182
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,040
trade them individually? Guess what I'm
 

4183
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,430
trade them individually? Guess what I'm
asking is how to trade them? Uh, it

4184
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
asking is how to trade them? Uh, it
 

4185
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,510
asking is how to trade them? Uh, it
depends on your success rate. Um,

4186
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:31,520
depends on your success rate. Um,
 

4187
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,270
depends on your success rate. Um,
you know, and how how you're feeling.

4188
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:33,280
you know, and how how you're feeling.
 

4189
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,590
you know, and how how you're feeling.
Like I'm not feeling like 100% today. So

4190
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:35,600
Like I'm not feeling like 100% today. So
 

4191
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,870
Like I'm not feeling like 100% today. So
I'd do them one at a time. When I'm

4192
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:36,880
I'd do them one at a time. When I'm
 

4193
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,229
I'd do them one at a time. When I'm
feeling good, I trade them all together.

4194
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:40,239
feeling good, I trade them all together.
 

4195
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:41,750
feeling good, I trade them all together.
If you've got a proven strategy and

4196
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:41,760
If you've got a proven strategy and
 

4197
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,430
If you've got a proven strategy and
you're feeling good, do them all

4198
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:43,440
you're feeling good, do them all
 

4199
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,550
you're feeling good, do them all
together. Obviously, like it's the

4200
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:44,560
together. Obviously, like it's the
 

4201
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,830
together. Obviously, like it's the
riskier thing to do. But you don't need

4202
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:45,840
riskier thing to do. But you don't need
 

4203
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,669
riskier thing to do. But you don't need
to size up. We are starting to see some

4204
01:41:47,669 --> 01:41:47,679
to size up. We are starting to see some
 

4205
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,270
to size up. We are starting to see some
rejection up there at the moment. Buyers

4206
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:49,280
rejection up there at the moment. Buyers
 

4207
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,510
rejection up there at the moment. Buyers
just got caught into 290. They are still

4208
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:51,520
just got caught into 290. They are still
 

4209
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,669
just got caught into 290. They are still
adding liquidity higher though into 210.

4210
01:41:53,669 --> 01:41:53,679
adding liquidity higher though into 210.
 

4211
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:55,590
adding liquidity higher though into 210.
But buyers just got caught. It's perking

4212
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:55,600
But buyers just got caught. It's perking
 

4213
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:03,910
But buyers just got caught. It's perking
my interest here for a short back down.

4214
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:03,920

 

4215
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,950

89. Yeah, 90s is the level.

4216
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:08,960
89. Yeah, 90s is the level.
 

4217
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,629
89. Yeah, 90s is the level.
I might have just missed that, folks. It

4218
01:42:10,629 --> 01:42:10,639
I might have just missed that, folks. It
 

4219
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:11,990
I might have just missed that, folks. It
might do it now. I might have missed my

4220
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:12,000
might do it now. I might have missed my
 

4221
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,790
might do it now. I might have missed my
entry there.

4222
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:14,800
entry there.
 

4223
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,470
entry there.
Might have missed my entry there for the

4224
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:16,480
Might have missed my entry there for the
 

4225
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:22,790
Might have missed my entry there for the
trade back down into 66s.

4226

4227
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:34,390

Might have just missed that.

He literally tweeted that. That's not me

He literally tweeted that. That's not me
just saying it. He actually tweeted that

All right. Still lifting it. Wow. Still

All right. Still lifting it. Wow. Still
 

4283

Still lifting it. Still no rejection. I

Still lifting it. Still no rejection. I

Still lifting it. Still no rejection. I
thought about taking this candle here

4288
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:17,760
thought about taking this candle here
 

4289
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,830
thought about taking this candle here
once we close back under, but still

4290
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:19,840
once we close back under, but still
 

4291
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,550
once we close back under, but still
lifting it. Are they going to come for

4292
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:22,560
lifting it. Are they going to come for
 

4293
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:29,830
lifting it. Are they going to come for
this? Are they coming for that 350s?

4294
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:29,840

 

4295
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,070

I tell you what, if we get through 350s,

4296
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:32,080
I tell you what, if we get through 350s,
 

4297
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,709
I tell you what, if we get through 350s,
you've got to be thinking 4 440s or

4298
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:34,719
you've got to be thinking 4 440s or
 

4299
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,430
you've got to be thinking 4 440s or
400s. You have to rejection into that

4300
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:37,440
400s. You have to rejection into that
 

4301
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,590
400s. You have to rejection into that
box again. So, the short now will come.

4302
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:39,600
box again. So, the short now will come.
 

4303
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,709
box again. So, the short now will come.
If we trap up here

4304
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:42,719
If we trap up here
 

4305
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,470
If we trap up here
and we do this, there will be a short

4306
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:44,480
and we do this, there will be a short
 

4307
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,709
and we do this, there will be a short
here. It's counter trend. I'm going to

4308
01:44:46,709 --> 01:44:46,719
here. It's counter trend. I'm going to
 

4309
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:48,470
here. It's counter trend. I'm going to
tell you that it's counter trend, but

4310
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,480
tell you that it's counter trend, but
 

4311
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,910
tell you that it's counter trend, but
I'm think we're going to have a

4312
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:49,920
I'm think we're going to have a
 

4313
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,990
I'm think we're going to have a
rotational day

4314
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:52,000
rotational day
 

4315
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,390
rotational day
back to these 90s. This where the buyer

4316
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:54,400
back to these 90s. This where the buyer
 

4317
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,629
back to these 90s. This where the buyer
has just stepped in again here up here.

4318
01:44:56,629 --> 01:44:56,639
has just stepped in again here up here.
 

4319
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,470
has just stepped in again here up here.
So, we can see this buyer have bought

4320
01:44:58,470 --> 01:44:58,480
So, we can see this buyer have bought
 

4321
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:01,430
So, we can see this buyer have bought
the high up here. All right. So, 90s is

4322
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:01,440
the high up here. All right. So, 90s is
 

4323
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,950
the high up here. All right. So, 90s is
a big level. They did just get a little

4324
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:02,960
a big level. They did just get a little
 

4325
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,149
a big level. They did just get a little
caught here. You can see sellers trying

4326
01:45:04,149 --> 01:45:04,159
caught here. You can see sellers trying
 

4327
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:05,590
caught here. You can see sellers trying
to sell through 90s, but all the time

4328
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:05,600
to sell through 90s, but all the time
 

4329
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,590
to sell through 90s, but all the time
we're absorbing here, it's still okay.

4330
01:45:07,590 --> 01:45:07,600
we're absorbing here, it's still okay.
 

4331
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,109
we're absorbing here, it's still okay.

not fair on the other guys that did the
 

4523

not fair on the other guys that did the
other course and uh you might trade

4524
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:26,480
other course and uh you might trade
 

4525
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,310
other course and uh you might trade
volume a different way and there's lots

4526
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:28,320
volume a different way and there's lots
 

4527
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:34,070
volume a different way and there's lots
of reasons for it.

4528
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:34,080

 

4529
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:35,669

Alex, do you have anything you look for

4530
01:50:35,669 --> 01:50:35,679
Alex, do you have anything you look for
 

4531
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:37,270
Alex, do you have anything you look for
to confirm price isn't going to come

4532
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:37,280
to confirm price isn't going to come
 

4533
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,990
to confirm price isn't going to come
back for the trapped buyers or sellers?

4534
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:40,000
back for the trapped buyers or sellers?
 

4535
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,510
back for the trapped buyers or sellers?
Well, it's more about leaving it. It's

4536
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:41,520
Well, it's more about leaving it. It's
 

4537
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,950
Well, it's more about leaving it. It's
always about the reaction, right? So,

4538
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:42,960
always about the reaction, right? So,
 

4539
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,950
always about the reaction, right? So,
now we have this here. So, if we start

4540
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
now we have this here. So, if we start
 

4541
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,750
now we have this here. So, if we start
leaving this,

4542
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:47,760
leaving this,
 

4543
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,910
leaving this,
we can look for this, right? This level

4544
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:49,920
we can look for this, right? This level
 

4545
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:51,750
we can look for this, right? This level
now is key. If we start if we keep

4546
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:51,760
now is key. If we start if we keep
 

4547
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,830
now is key. If we start if we keep
failing this level into 20s, this will

4548
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:53,840
failing this level into 20s, this will
 

4549
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,390
failing this level into 20s, this will
now be key. There's an imbalance there

4550
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:56,400
now be key. There's an imbalance there
 

4551
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,070
now be key. There's an imbalance there
and we have buyers caught above it. So,

4552
01:50:58,070 --> 01:50:58,080
and we have buyers caught above it. So,
 

4553
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,910
and we have buyers caught above it. So,
I'm interested in this now. But the

4554
01:50:59,910 --> 01:50:59,920
I'm interested in this now. But the
 

4555
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,149
I'm interested in this now. But the
thing is, we we need it to push up and

4556
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:02,159
thing is, we we need it to push up and
 

4557
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,229
thing is, we we need it to push up and
reject it for this trade back down

4558
01:51:04,229 --> 01:51:04,239
reject it for this trade back down
 

4559
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:06,550
reject it for this trade back down
towards the 300s. If it can't push up

4560
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:06,560
towards the 300s. If it can't push up
 

4561
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,470
towards the 300s. If it can't push up
and reject it, then there's no trade.

4562
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:08,480
and reject it, then there's no trade.
 

4563
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,070
and reject it, then there's no trade.
And if it pushes up and doesn't reject

4564
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:10,080
And if it pushes up and doesn't reject
 

4565
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,310
And if it pushes up and doesn't reject
it, then we're going to trade up to 350.

4566
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:12,320
it, then we're going to trade up to 350.
 

4567
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,750
it, then we're going to trade up to 350.
I'm obviously not going to be long up

4568
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:13,760
I'm obviously not going to be long up
 

4569
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:16,470
I'm obviously not going to be long up
here, right? We're so far into premium

4570
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:16,480
here, right? We're so far into premium
 

4571
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,910
here, right? We're so far into premium
now. We're coming into right, we're

4572
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:17,920
now. We're coming into right, we're
 

4573
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,669
now. We're coming into right, we're
right into the top side of premium from

4574
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:19,679
right into the top side of premium from
 

4575
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:21,270
right into the top side of premium from
the previous week, right? Which will be

4576
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:21,280
the previous week, right? Which will be
 

4577
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:26,709
the previous week, right? Which will be
into sort of 420s.

4578
01:51:26,709 --> 01:51:26,719

 

4579
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:29,669

So, still no rejection yet.

4580
01:51:29,669 --> 01:51:29,679
So, still no rejection yet.
 

4581
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:32,310
So, still no rejection yet.
They keep bidding now at 300. So, I

4582
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:32,320
They keep bidding now at 300. So, I
 

4583
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,830
They keep bidding now at 300. So, I
think there is a move here. It's a small

4584
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:33,840
think there is a move here. It's a small
 

4585
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,270
think there is a move here. It's a small
move back down towards towards these

4586
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
move back down towards towards these
 

4587
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,669
move back down towards towards these
300s, 280s, 300s. I think this can

4588
01:51:37,669 --> 01:51:37,679
300s, 280s, 300s. I think this can
 

4589
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:39,430
300s, 280s, 300s. I think this can
happen. Otherwise, you're going to see

4590
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:39,440
happen. Otherwise, you're going to see
 

4591
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,830
happen. Otherwise, you're going to see
this. But, this can happen. And if they

4592
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:41,840
this. But, this can happen. And if they
 

4593
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,910
this. But, this can happen. And if they
let go of this, this can happen. It all

4594
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:43,920
let go of this, this can happen. It all
 

4595
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,030
let go of this, this can happen. It all
depends when they're going to be done

4596
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:45,040
depends when they're going to be done
 

4597
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,550
depends when they're going to be done

01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,870
this is the rotation. So, these are the
imbalances that are holding. You should

4754
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:28,880
imbalances that are holding. You should
 

4755
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,629
imbalances that are holding. You should
see the highs. We keep getting buyers

4756
01:56:30,629 --> 01:56:30,639
see the highs. We keep getting buyers
 

4757
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:31,910
see the highs. We keep getting buyers
caught. At the lows, we keep getting

4758
01:56:31,910 --> 01:56:31,920
caught. At the lows, we keep getting
 

4759
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,350
caught. At the lows, we keep getting
sellers caught, but we're holding the

4760
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
sellers caught, but we're holding the
 

4761
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,430
sellers caught, but we're holding the
imbalances. So, we're rotating between

4762
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,440
imbalances. So, we're rotating between
 

4763
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,109
imbalances. So, we're rotating between
the imbalances. This low volume node,

4764
01:56:37,109 --> 01:56:37,119
the imbalances. This low volume node,
 

4765
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:39,030
the imbalances. This low volume node,
right? We're rotating between greater,

4766
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:39,040
right? We're rotating between greater,
 

4767
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,470
right? We're rotating between greater,
great, greater, great, greater, great.

4768
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:40,480
great, greater, great, greater, great.
 

4769
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:41,910
great, greater, great, greater, great.
Coming back down for those imbalances.

4770
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:41,920
Coming back down for those imbalances.
 

4771
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:43,270
Coming back down for those imbalances.
This is where the last lot of sellers

4772
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:43,280
This is where the last lot of sellers
 

4773
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,910
This is where the last lot of sellers
got caught here at 10. So, I'm just want

4774
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:45,920
got caught here at 10. So, I'm just want
 

4775
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:47,589
got caught here at 10. So, I'm just want
to see if there's a bit more aggression

4776
01:56:47,589 --> 01:56:47,599
to see if there's a bit more aggression
 

4777
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,109
to see if there's a bit more aggression
on the tape and if these buyers show

4778
01:56:49,109 --> 01:56:49,119
on the tape and if these buyers show
 

4779
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:50,550
on the tape and if these buyers show
exhaustion, but we're not leaving

4780
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:50,560
exhaustion, but we're not leaving
 

4781
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,629
exhaustion, but we're not leaving
aggressively. We almost need to be

4782
01:56:52,629 --> 01:56:52,639
aggressively. We almost need to be
 

4783
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:55,270
aggressively. We almost need to be
honest, we almost need a swipe now and

4784
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:55,280
honest, we almost need a swipe now and
 

4785
01:56:55,280 --> 01:57:00,790
honest, we almost need a swipe now and
then that

4786
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:00,800

 

4787
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,030

first pullback on ES VIX coming into a

4788
01:57:03,030 --> 01:57:03,040
first pullback on ES VIX coming into a
 

4789
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:06,470
first pullback on ES VIX coming into a
key pivot 1740. So, it's reclaimed

4790
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:06,480
key pivot 1740. So, it's reclaimed
 

4791
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:09,030
key pivot 1740. So, it's reclaimed
previous day low.

4792
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,040
previous day low.
 

4793
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:10,790
previous day low.
Still eyeing the same trade. I like it

4794
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:10,800
Still eyeing the same trade. I like it
 

4795
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,070
Still eyeing the same trade. I like it
less and less. The longer we're here,

4796
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:12,080
less and less. The longer we're here,
 

4797
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,910
less and less. The longer we're here,
the less I like it. We're starting to

4798
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
the less I like it. We're starting to
 

4799
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,070
the less I like it. We're starting to
see some rejection here, though. They

4800
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:16,080
see some rejection here, though. They
 

4801
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,669
see some rejection here, though. They
are starting to struggle to reclaim and

4802
01:57:17,669 --> 01:57:17,679
are starting to struggle to reclaim and
 

4803
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:24,470
are starting to struggle to reclaim and
squeeze. Still no confirmation.

4804
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:24,480

 

4805
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,390

So, they're adding liquidity now. 25

4806
01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:26,400
So, they're adding liquidity now. 25
 

4807
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,310
So, they're adding liquidity now. 25
seller now adding liquidity at 25. He's

4808
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,320
seller now adding liquidity at 25. He's
 

4809
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,750
seller now adding liquidity at 25. He's
trying to drag the market up a bit. Now,

4810
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:29,760
trying to drag the market up a bit. Now,
 

4811
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,750
trying to drag the market up a bit. Now,
he's lifted and moved to 27 and 30s.

4812
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:31,760
he's lifted and moved to 27 and 30s.
 

4813
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,910
he's lifted and moved to 27 and 30s.
Now, he's come down to 20. So, they they

4814
01:57:33,910 --> 01:57:33,920
Now, he's come down to 20. So, they they
 

4815
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:37,510
Now, he's come down to 20. So, they they
continue to play games in this area.

4816
01:57:37,510 --> 01:57:37,520
continue to play games in this area.
 

4817
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:46,950
continue to play games in this area.
Someone's going to get hurt soon.

4818
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:46,960

 

4819
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,629

Back to those 20s again. Do they lift

4820
01:57:48,629 --> 01:57:48,639
Back to those 20s again. Do they lift
 

4821
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:51,430
Back to those 20s again. Do they lift
and go 30 now? I almost want them to

4822
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:51,440
and go 30 now? I almost want them to
 

4823
01:57:51,440 --> 01:58:06,310
and go 30 now? I almost want them to
clear it out to make it easier.

4824
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:06,320

 

4825
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,629

Big failing that 1740 drive. had a good

4826
01:58:08,629 --> 01:58:08,639
Big failing that 1740 drive. had a good
 

4827
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:10,149
Big failing that 1740 drive. had a good
go at it. Let me see if it can get back

4828
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:10,159
go at it. Let me see if it can get back
 

4829
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:13,350
go at it. Let me see if it can get back
in above again. Still not through this

4830
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:13,360
in above again. Still not through this
 

4831
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:16,229
in above again. Still not through this
gray box. It's getting very, very, very

4832
01:58:16,229 --> 01:58:16,239
gray box. It's getting very, very, very
 

4833
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:17,589
gray box. It's getting very, very, very
tight here. But we're building out a

4834
01:58:17,589 --> 01:58:17,599
tight here. But we're building out a
 

4835
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:19,030
tight here. But we're building out a
bigger and bigger node because we keep

4836
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:19,040
bigger and bigger node because we keep
 

4837
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:20,390
bigger and bigger node because we keep
dropping down and saving it, which

4838
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:20,400
dropping down and saving it, which
 

4839
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,149
dropping down and saving it, which
doesn't leave much room. This is where

4840
01:58:22,149 --> 01:58:22,159
doesn't leave much room. This is where
 

4841
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:23,430
doesn't leave much room. This is where
it becomes like less and less

4842
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:23,440
it becomes like less and less
 

4843
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,189
it becomes like less and less
attractive, right? We keep making this

4844
01:58:25,189 --> 01:58:25,199
attractive, right? We keep making this
 

4845
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:26,470
attractive, right? We keep making this
thicker. Then we're going to have to

4846
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:26,480
thicker. Then we're going to have to
 

4847
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,390
thicker. Then we're going to have to
play this and we don't get much room for

4848
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:28,400
play this and we don't get much room for
 

4849
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,709
play this and we don't get much room for
that that trade there. It becomes like a

4850
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:30,719
that that trade there. It becomes like a
 

4851
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,870
that that trade there. It becomes like a
onetoone trade unless we get a runner to

4852
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:32,880
onetoone trade unless we get a runner to
 

4853
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,189
onetoone trade unless we get a runner to
go and then it's like a 3:1.

4854
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:35,199
go and then it's like a 3:1.
 

4855
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:36,790
go and then it's like a 3:1.
>> So, it's not that attractive at the

4856
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:36,800
>> So, it's not that attractive at the
 

4857
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,229
>> So, it's not that attractive at the
moment.

4858
01:58:40,229 --> 01:58:40,239

 

4859
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:42,149

And if they reclaim this, then they have

4860
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:42,159
And if they reclaim this, then they have
 

4861
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:43,750
And if they reclaim this, then they have
got this red line to go for, which looks

4862
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:43,760
got this red line to go for, which looks
 

4863
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,430
got this red line to go for, which looks
like they're still trying to do that

4864
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:45,440
like they're still trying to do that
 

4865
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,189
like they're still trying to do that
GlobeEx high up here, which was the

4866
01:58:47,189 --> 01:58:47,199
GlobeEx high up here, which was the
 

4867
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:49,030
GlobeEx high up here, which was the
original trade thesis from down here,

4868
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:49,040
original trade thesis from down here,
 

4869
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,669
original trade thesis from down here,
right? The original thesis. If they get

4870
01:58:51,669 --> 01:58:51,679
right? The original thesis. If they get
 

4871
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:53,510
right? The original thesis. If they get
through that, well, that would be quite

4872
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:53,520
through that, well, that would be quite
 

4873
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,390
through that, well, that would be quite
the shove up previous week value area

4874
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:56,400
the shove up previous week value area
 

4875
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:59,109
the shove up previous week value area
high today. I didn't think we'd do that

4876
01:58:59,109 --> 01:58:59,119
high today. I didn't think we'd do that
 

4877
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:04,149
high today. I didn't think we'd do that
in one day.

4878
01:59:04,149 --> 01:59:04,159

 

4879
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:05,589

Buyers definitely just caught caught

4880
01:59:05,589 --> 01:59:05,599
Buyers definitely just caught caught
 

4881
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:09,030
Buyers definitely just caught caught
there again into above 20s, above 22s.

4882
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:09,040
there again into above 20s, above 22s.
 

4883
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:12,629
there again into above 20s, above 22s.
They got really caught there. 23 to 26s.

4884
01:59:12,629 --> 01:59:12,639
They got really caught there. 23 to 26s.
 

4885
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:13,990
They got really caught there. 23 to 26s.
They got really caught there on that

4886
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:14,000
They got really caught there on that
 

4887
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,910
They got really caught there on that
last shove. We're still absorbing

4888
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:15,920
last shove. We're still absorbing
 

4889
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,030
last shove. We're still absorbing
though. So, you can see the top of the

4890
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
though. So, you can see the top of the
 

4891
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,910
though. So, you can see the top of the
gray box. This is starting to per my

4892
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:19,920
gray box. This is starting to per my
 

4893
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:35,350
gray box. This is starting to per my
interest again.

4894
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:35,360

 

4895
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:37,189

volume profile on the right is anchored

4896
01:59:37,189 --> 01:59:37,199
volume profile on the right is anchored
 

4897
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:39,030
volume profile on the right is anchored
volume profile. Nightbot has just told

4898
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:39,040
volume profile. Nightbot has just told
 

4899
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,709
volume profile. Nightbot has just told
you in chat underneath what you've said.

4900
01:59:40,709 --> 01:59:40,719
you in chat underneath what you've said.
 

4901
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:41,990
you in chat underneath what you've said.
All right, back to where those buyers

4902
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:42,000
All right, back to where those buyers
 

4903
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,109
All right, back to where those buyers
were trapped again. 23 to 26es. Let's

4904
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:45,119
were trapped again. 23 to 26es. Let's
 

4905
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,030
were trapped again. 23 to 26es. Let's
see what they do here. Do we just trade

4906
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:47,040
see what they do here. Do we just trade
 

4907
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:49,270
see what they do here. Do we just trade
back through it?

4908
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:49,280
back through it?
 

4909
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,109
back through it?
I think we just want to swipe out higher

4910
01:59:51,109 --> 01:59:51,119
I think we just want to swipe out higher
 

4911
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:52,390
I think we just want to swipe out higher
at this point. It's going to make the

4912
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:52,400
at this point. It's going to make the
 

4913
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,750
at this point. It's going to make the
short easier for us if we're going to

4914
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:53,760
short easier for us if we're going to
 

4915
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,390
short easier for us if we're going to
take a short today because the flow the

4916
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:56,400
take a short today because the flow the
 

4917
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:57,830
take a short today because the flow the
flow zone is a supporting bid. We're

4918
01:59:57,830 --> 01:59:57,840
flow zone is a supporting bid. We're
 

4919
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,270
flow zone is a supporting bid. We're
above the initial balance. We're in a

4920
01:59:59,270 --> 01:59:59,280
above the initial balance. We're in a
 

4921
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,270
above the initial balance. We're in a
trend up day. It's just I don't want to

4922
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:01,280
trend up day. It's just I don't want to
 

4923
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,270
trend up day. It's just I don't want to
buy the high. So, I'm looking for a mean

4924
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:03,280
buy the high. So, I'm looking for a mean
 

4925
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,189
buy the high. So, I'm looking for a mean
reversion trade back down if and when it

4926
02:00:05,189 --> 02:00:05,199
reversion trade back down if and when it
 

4927
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:06,629
reversion trade back down if and when it
comes and then we can think about a

4928
02:00:06,629 --> 02:00:06,639
comes and then we can think about a
 

4929
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:08,870
comes and then we can think about a
rebid. Did we just clear out there? We

4930
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:08,880
rebid. Did we just clear out there? We
 

4931
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,149
rebid. Did we just clear out there? We
just cleared out there again. That's a

4932
02:00:10,149 --> 02:00:10,159
just cleared out there again. That's a
 

4933
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:18,870
just cleared out there again. That's a
high of day taken.

4934
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:18,880

 

4935
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,510

It's still adding liquidity. 40 4550. I

4936
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:21,520
It's still adding liquidity. 40 4550. I
 

4937
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:22,790
It's still adding liquidity. 40 4550. I
think we just got to let this do what it

4938
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:22,800
think we just got to let this do what it
 

4939
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,030
think we just got to let this do what it
needs to do to the upside here, folks.

4940
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:25,040
needs to do to the upside here, folks.
 

4941
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,950
needs to do to the upside here, folks.
Let it do what it's got to do. What's my

4942
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:26,960
Let it do what it's got to do. What's my
 

4943
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,589
Let it do what it's got to do. What's my
bias for now? My bias is a rotation. So

4944
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:29,599
bias for now? My bias is a rotation. So
 

4945
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:34,229
bias for now? My bias is a rotation. So
my bias right now is this on an hourly.

4946
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:34,239
my bias right now is this on an hourly.
 

4947
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:36,470
my bias right now is this on an hourly.
All right, we were

4948
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:36,480
All right, we were
 

4949
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:39,589
All right, we were
long from here and here and we were long

4950
02:00:39,589 --> 02:00:39,599
long from here and here and we were long
 

4951
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,270
long from here and here and we were long
this morning from here. All right, so if

4952
02:00:41,270 --> 02:00:41,280
this morning from here. All right, so if
 

4953
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,990
this morning from here. All right, so if
we think about this,

4954
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:44,000
we think about this,
 

4955
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,229
we think about this,
I think we're coming into an area where

4956
02:00:46,229 --> 02:00:46,239
I think we're coming into an area where
 

4957
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:47,990
I think we're coming into an area where
I think sellers will be hanging out

4958
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:48,000
I think sellers will be hanging out
 

4959
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,910
I think sellers will be hanging out
looking to defend and I think there's

4960
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:49,920
looking to defend and I think there's
 

4961
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,589
looking to defend and I think there's
probably a counter trend short back down

4962
02:00:51,589 --> 02:00:51,599
probably a counter trend short back down
 

4963
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:54,149
probably a counter trend short back down
into here. Right, so that's my bias. My

4964
02:00:54,149 --> 02:00:54,159
into here. Right, so that's my bias. My
 

4965
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:56,470
into here. Right, so that's my bias. My
bias has been this morning long, but now

4966
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:56,480
bias has been this morning long, but now
 

4967
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,149
bias has been this morning long, but now
we're up into these levels. I think from

4968
02:00:58,149 --> 02:00:58,159
we're up into these levels. I think from
 

4969
02:00:58,159 --> 02:00:59,830
we're up into these levels. I think from
here there's likely to be a short back

4970
02:00:59,830 --> 02:00:59,840
here there's likely to be a short back
 

4971
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,229
here there's likely to be a short back
down. If we get acceptance back through

4972
02:01:02,229 --> 02:01:02,239
down. If we get acceptance back through
 

4973
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:03,830
down. If we get acceptance back through
previous week value area high, then I

4974
02:01:03,830 --> 02:01:03,840
previous week value area high, then I
 

4975
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,750
previous week value area high, then I
will be long bias again for the move

4976
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:05,760
will be long bias again for the move
 

4977
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,390
will be long bias again for the move
back up to this old level here of 800.

4978
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,400
back up to this old level here of 800.
 

4979
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,229
back up to this old level here of 800.
Right? So, if we do that, I'll be long

4980
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:10,239
Right? So, if we do that, I'll be long
 

4981
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:12,070
Right? So, if we do that, I'll be long
bias again later in this week. Right

4982
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:12,080
bias again later in this week. Right
 

4983
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:15,430
bias again later in this week. Right
now, I think that this will be sold back

4984
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:15,440
now, I think that this will be sold back
 

4985
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:19,510
now, I think that this will be sold back
into down here somewhere at some point

4986
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:19,520
into down here somewhere at some point
 

4987
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:28,390
into down here somewhere at some point
based on the hourlys.

4988
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:28,400

 

4989
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:29,910

Yeah, that's exactly what I said in the

4990
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
Yeah, that's exactly what I said in the
 

4991
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,669
Yeah, that's exactly what I said in the
newsletter. Ricardo, same thing.

4992
02:01:33,669 --> 02:01:33,679
newsletter. Ricardo, same thing.
 

4993
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:35,589
newsletter. Ricardo, same thing.
Your anchor volume profile doesn't look

Your anchor volume profile doesn't look

Your anchor volume profile doesn't look

02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:40,470
look right. Uh,
make sure

02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:45,589
road is two, width 20, placement on the

02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
right, and it's set to tick. And if you
 

5003

do that, and you're watching the NQ, it

5004
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:47,199
do that, and you're watching the NQ, it
 

5005
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:53,589
do that, and you're watching the NQ, it
should look like this.

5006
02:01:53,589 --> 02:01:53,599

 

5007
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:55,830

Still not hit those 350s. We're not far

5008
02:01:55,830 --> 02:01:55,840
Still not hit those 350s. We're not far
 

5009
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,589
Still not hit those 350s. We're not far
away. Just still not done it. But we

5010
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:57,599
away. Just still not done it. But we
 

5011
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:00,709
away. Just still not done it. But we
have now swiped the highs. I just want

5012
02:02:00,709 --> 02:02:00,719
have now swiped the highs. I just want
 

5013
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:02,229
have now swiped the highs. I just want
this if we're going to protect this gray

5014
02:02:02,229 --> 02:02:02,239
this if we're going to protect this gray
 

5015
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:03,750
this if we're going to protect this gray
box. We want this just to keep going

5016
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:03,760
box. We want this just to keep going
 

5017
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,830
box. We want this just to keep going
higher. Now, even for the short thesis,

5018
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:05,840
higher. Now, even for the short thesis,
 

5019
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,189
higher. Now, even for the short thesis,
the higher the better. The bigger the

5020
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,199
the higher the better. The bigger the
 

5021
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:08,709
the higher the better. The bigger the
squeeze, the better. The more bulls that

5022
02:02:08,709 --> 02:02:08,719
squeeze, the better. The more bulls that
 

5023
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:11,430
squeeze, the better. The more bulls that
chasing at the highs, the better.

5024
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:11,440
chasing at the highs, the better.
 

5025
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,189
chasing at the highs, the better.
We do not want to get short front side

5026
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:13,199
We do not want to get short front side
 

5027
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:14,950
We do not want to get short front side
though until we leave people trapped. We

5028
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:14,960
though until we leave people trapped. We
 

5029
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:16,709
though until we leave people trapped. We
do not want to get short front side. So,

5030
02:02:16,709 --> 02:02:16,719
do not want to get short front side. So,
 

5031
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:18,310
do not want to get short front side. So,
back into this gray box. Do they rebid

5032
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:18,320
back into this gray box. Do they rebid
 

5033
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:19,910
back into this gray box. Do they rebid
this now or do we sell through this gray

5034
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:19,920
this now or do we sell through this gray
 

5035
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:23,030
this now or do we sell through this gray
box back down to the 10ens?

5036
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:23,040
box back down to the 10ens?
 

5037
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:28,709
box back down to the 10ens?
I don't know.

5038
02:02:28,709 --> 02:02:28,719

 

5039
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:31,030

It's the 20s again. Looks a bit like a

5040
02:02:31,030 --> 02:02:31,040
It's the 20s again. Looks a bit like a
 

5041
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,310
It's the 20s again. Looks a bit like a
fail break out there, but we're still in

5042
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:32,320
fail break out there, but we're still in
 

5043
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,070
fail break out there, but we're still in
this gray box. We still haven't taken

5044
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:34,080
this gray box. We still haven't taken
 

5045
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:36,709
this gray box. We still haven't taken
out the high

5046
02:02:36,709 --> 02:02:36,719
out the high
 

5047
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:40,629
out the high
down to the 10 then.

5048
02:02:40,629 --> 02:02:40,639

 

5049
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:41,990

They're going to make this hard. You can

5050
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:42,000
They're going to make this hard. You can
 

5051
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,910
They're going to make this hard. You can
tell they're going to do it. They're

5052
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:43,920
tell they're going to do it. They're
 

5053
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,430
tell they're going to do it. They're
going to do it out of nowhere and then

5054
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:45,440
going to do it out of nowhere and then
 

5055
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,910
going to do it out of nowhere and then
just dunk the thing.

5056
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:47,920
just dunk the thing.
 

5057
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:49,669
just dunk the thing.
All right. Same setups. Looking at the

5058
02:02:49,669 --> 02:02:49,679
All right. Same setups. Looking at the
 

5059
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,430
All right. Same setups. Looking at the
same setup. Rejection of these levels.

5060
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:51,440
same setup. Rejection of these levels.
 

5061
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,030
same setup. Rejection of these levels.
Do we reject these levels for that trade

5062
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,040
Do we reject these levels for that trade
 

5063
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,470
Do we reject these levels for that trade
back down? And I will be covering some

5064
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:54,480
back down? And I will be covering some
 

5065
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:57,669
back down? And I will be covering some
into the sort of 90s and 300s. If we see

5066
02:02:57,669 --> 02:02:57,679
into the sort of 90s and 300s. If we see
 

5067
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:00,950
into the sort of 90s and 300s. If we see
that rejection, if we reclaim this block

5068
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:00,960
that rejection, if we reclaim this block
 

5069
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,470
that rejection, if we reclaim this block
again, then I'm going to expect 50s for

5070
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:02,480
again, then I'm going to expect 50s for
 

5071
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:06,149
again, then I'm going to expect 50s for
a clear out.

5072
02:03:06,149 --> 02:03:06,159

 

5073
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:08,470

Reclaiming the block.

5074
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:08,480
Reclaiming the block.
 

5075
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,109
Reclaiming the block.
So, we expect 50s for a clear out. We

5076
02:03:11,109 --> 02:03:11,119
So, we expect 50s for a clear out. We
 

5077
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:13,030
So, we expect 50s for a clear out. We
should push up to try and clear out 50s

5078
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:13,040
should push up to try and clear out 50s
 

5079
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:35,830
should push up to try and clear out 50s
now.

5080
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:35,840

 

5081
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,910

We just want them to complete this at

5082
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:37,920
We just want them to complete this at
 

5083
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:42,070
We just want them to complete this at
this point. Make it easier.

5084
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:42,080

 

5085
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:43,990

Yeah, M and Q can definitely look funny

5086
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,000
Yeah, M and Q can definitely look funny
 

5087
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,189
Yeah, M and Q can definitely look funny
sometimes if you're looking at the

5088
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:45,199
sometimes if you're looking at the
 

5089
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:46,709
sometimes if you're looking at the
profile. That's where I ch why I chart

5090
02:03:46,709 --> 02:03:46,719
profile. That's where I ch why I chart
 

5091
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:49,510
profile. That's where I ch why I chart
ENQ.

5092
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:49,520
ENQ.
 

5093
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:51,669
ENQ.
The best way to trade MNQ and chart ENQ,

5094
02:03:51,669 --> 02:03:51,679
The best way to trade MNQ and chart ENQ,
 

5095
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:54,870
The best way to trade MNQ and chart ENQ,
honestly, is to use the affordable

5096
02:03:54,870 --> 02:03:54,880
honestly, is to use the affordable
 

5097
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:57,990
honestly, is to use the affordable
indicators. Um, I can't remember what

5098
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:58,000
indicators. Um, I can't remember what
 

5099
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,550
indicators. Um, I can't remember what
the the thing's called. Someone else

5100
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:00,560
the the thing's called. Someone else
 

5101
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,750
the the thing's called. Someone else
helped me out. But you can literally

5102
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:01,760
helped me out. But you can literally
 

5103
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,830
helped me out. But you can literally
flip from mini to micro, but chart on

5104
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:03,840
flip from mini to micro, but chart on
 

5105
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:07,990
flip from mini to micro, but chart on
the same uh screen. Makes it much easier

5106
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:08,000
the same uh screen. Makes it much easier
 

5107
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,510
the same uh screen. Makes it much easier
rather than having to have two different

5108
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:09,520
rather than having to have two different
 

5109
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,830
rather than having to have two different
screens up. All right. Can they lift

5110
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:11,840
screens up. All right. Can they lift
 

5111
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,990
screens up. All right. Can they lift
this now to 50s and complete this bloody

5112
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:14,000
this now to 50s and complete this bloody
 

5113
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,910
this now to 50s and complete this bloody

was the last trap we tal talked about?

5126
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:40,400
was the last trap we tal talked about?
 

5127
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,149
was the last trap we tal talked about?
Was it this one here? Right, you're

5128
02:04:42,149 --> 02:04:42,159
Was it this one here? Right, you're

02:04:42,159 --> 02:04:43,830
Was it this one here? Right, you're
going to hit your final TP here. If you

5130
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:43,840
going to hit your final TP here. If you
 

5131
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,270
going to hit your final TP here. If you
got very lucky, they'd come all the way

5132
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:45,280
got very lucky, they'd come all the way
 

5133
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,189
got very lucky, they'd come all the way
back up to value. That that is a massive

5134
02:04:47,189 --> 02:04:47,199
back up to value. That that is a massive
 

5135
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:49,189
back up to value. That that is a massive
move if they do that. But this is a

5136
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:49,199
move if they do that. But this is a
 

5137
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:52,709
move if they do that. But this is a
GlobeEx level.

5138
02:04:52,709 --> 02:04:52,719
GlobeEx level.
 

5139
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:54,709

02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:07,350
premium price of the previous week. It's
why we want to try and bid in discount.

5152
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:07,360
why we want to try and bid in discount.
 

5153
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,189

Discount is underneath previous day
 

5155
02:05:09,199 --> 02:05:11,270
Discount is underneath previous day

5157
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:14,470

Look, we're losing location or uh longs.

5164
02:05:25,510 --> 02:05:25,520

5177
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,589

trapping buyers up there again and back

5178
02:05:53,589 --> 02:05:53,599
trapping buyers up there again and back
 

5179
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:55,030
trapping buyers up there again and back
down to this gray node again, which has

5180
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:55,040
down to this gray node again, which has
 

5181
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:56,790
down to this gray node again, which has
now been built out higher again. Look at

5182
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:56,800
now been built out higher again. Look at
 

5183
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,629
now been built out higher again. Look at
this. This time now it's been built out

5184
02:05:58,629 --> 02:05:58,639
this. This time now it's been built out
 

5185
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:00,070
this. This time now it's been built out
higher. This is starting to look very

5186
02:06:00,070 --> 02:06:00,080
higher. This is starting to look very
 

5187
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:02,229
higher. This is starting to look very
ugly. Every dip is being absorbed right

5188
02:06:02,229 --> 02:06:02,239
ugly. Every dip is being absorbed right
 

5189
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:05,589
ugly. Every dip is being absorbed right
now.

5190
02:06:05,589 --> 02:06:05,599

 

5191
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:17,510

Here

5192
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:17,520

 

5193
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:20,470

we go. Finally, they might do it here.

5194
02:06:20,470 --> 02:06:20,480
we go. Finally, they might do it here.
 

5195
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,149

5199
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,310

So, spike high there. Definitely caught

5200
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:02,320
So, spike high there. Definitely caught
 

5201
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:03,589
So, spike high there. Definitely caught
some buyers up here. I still think we

5202
02:07:03,589 --> 02:07:03,599
some buyers up here. I still think we
 

5203
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:04,790
some buyers up here. I still think we
got to take out this last bit of

5204
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:04,800
got to take out this last bit of
 

5205
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,950
got to take out this last bit of
liquidity into like 46s or wherever it

5206
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:06,960
liquidity into like 46s or wherever it
 

5207
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,510
liquidity into like 46s or wherever it
is would be ideal. One more shove up.

5208
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:09,520
is would be ideal. One more shove up.
 

5209
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:11,589
is would be ideal. One more shove up.

They're actually up into 360. Is there
anyone above 360? Not really. Next level

5216
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:18,480
anyone above 360? Not really. Next level
 

5217
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:21,270
anyone above 360? Not really. Next level
400. So, we're getting frothy up here

5218
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,280
400. So, we're getting frothy up here
 

5219
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,430
400. So, we're getting frothy up here
into this level. We're going to still

5220
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:23,440
into this level. We're going to still
 

5221
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,069
into this level. We're going to still
look for the same thing. I'm We I am

5222
02:07:26,069 --> 02:07:26,079
look for the same thing. I'm We I am
 

5223
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:28,870
look for the same thing. I'm We I am
going to look for a little like swipe of

5224
02:07:28,870 --> 02:07:28,880
going to look for a little like swipe of
 

5225
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,870
going to look for a little like swipe of
liquidity, someone to get trapped up

5226
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:30,880
liquidity, someone to get trapped up
 

5227
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:32,629
liquidity, someone to get trapped up
here. Maybe I get a starter and if we

5228
02:07:32,629 --> 02:07:32,639
here. Maybe I get a starter and if we
 

5229
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:34,310
here. Maybe I get a starter and if we
lose that, get that move there. It's

5230
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:34,320
lose that, get that move there. It's
 

5231
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,069
lose that, get that move there. It's
what I'm going to look for. I'm not

5232
02:07:36,069 --> 02:07:36,079
what I'm going to look for. I'm not
 

5233
02:07:36,079 --> 02:07:37,750
what I'm going to look for. I'm not
going to keep bidding up here for up and

5234
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:37,760
going to keep bidding up here for up and
 

5235
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:39,270
going to keep bidding up here for up and
up and up and up. It's possible they

5236
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:39,280
up and up and up. It's possible they
 

5237
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,270
up and up and up. It's possible they
come all the way up here. So, you know,

5238
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:41,280
come all the way up here. So, you know,
 

5239
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,109
come all the way up here. So, you know,
we just have to wait for sufficient

we just have to wait for sufficient
 

5241
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:44,709
we just have to wait for sufficient
liquidity to get trapped. Seller just

liquidity to get trapped. Seller just
 

5243
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:46,470

Unless that's someone taking some
 

5249
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,390
Unless that's someone taking some
profits and just hitting the market.

02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,229
am still eyeing this for the short. Now,
if we start letting go of this, I will

5274
02:08:30,229 --> 02:08:30,239
if we start letting go of this, I will
 

5275
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:32,870
if we start letting go of this, I will
start to add into this and look for a

5276
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:32,880
start to add into this and look for a
 

5277
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:37,030
start to add into this and look for a
scale lower.

5278
02:08:37,030 --> 02:08:37,040

 

5279
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:38,790

Watching 15s here.
 

5283
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,350
Watching 15s here.
We now have an imbalanced sell side up

5284
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:43,360
We now have an imbalanced sell side up
 

5285
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,069
We now have an imbalanced sell side up
to 29s. Looking to scale some into this.

5286
02:08:46,069 --> 02:08:46,079
to 29s. Looking to scale some into this.
 

5287
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:47,350
to 29s. Looking to scale some into this.
Especially if we leave, I'll get

5288
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:47,360
Especially if we leave, I'll get
 

5289
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,669
Especially if we leave, I'll get
heavier. Got a piece on here. If we

5290
02:08:49,669 --> 02:08:49,679
heavier. Got a piece on here. If we
 

5291
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:53,510

leave gray box, I will get heavier.

5292

leave gray box, I will get heavier.
 

5293

02:08:55,030 --> 02:08:55,040
And we still have the imbalance down to
 

5295
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,870
And we still have the imbalance down to
300. So, if we leave this gray box, I

5296
02:08:56,870 --> 02:08:56,880
300. So, if we leave this gray box, I
 

5297
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,030
300. So, if we leave this gray box, I
will scale heavier. Got a little starter

5298
02:08:59,030 --> 02:08:59,040
will scale heavier. Got a little starter
 

5299
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,430
will scale heavier. Got a little starter
on once we started to sell through 30s.

5300
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,440
on once we started to sell through 30s.
 

5301

5303
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,589
Watching these 15. See if we push up now
and fail the imbalance of 25s again.

5304
02:09:05,589 --> 02:09:05,599
and fail the imbalance of 25s again.
 

5305
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:09,910

to sell 25s to 30s or I'll cut the
trade. It's only a small piece on

5333
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:54,069

It's possible I'm early here. It is

in this current candle. If we can close
 

5339
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,790

lower, it would be really good.

5369
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:45,589
keep holding this level? You
[\h__\h]

5370
02:10:45,589 --> 02:10:45,599

 

5371
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:47,510

Still have an imbalance above that they

5372
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:47,520
Still have an imbalance above that they
 

5373
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,270
Still have an imbalance above that they
can fill, right? Still have an imbalance

5374
02:10:49,270 --> 02:10:49,280
can fill, right? Still have an imbalance
 

5375
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,790
can fill, right? Still have an imbalance
above.

5376
02:10:50,790 --> 02:10:50,800
above.
 

5377
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:51,990
above.
They can still come and fill this

5378
02:10:51,990 --> 02:10:52,000
They can still come and fill this
 

5379
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,430
They can still come and fill this
imbalance. So, these buyers got trapped

5380
02:10:53,430 --> 02:10:53,440
imbalance. So, these buyers got trapped
 

5381
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,030
imbalance. So, these buyers got trapped
here. We can still fill this imbalance.

5382
02:10:55,030 --> 02:10:55,040
here. We can still fill this imbalance.
 

5383
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:56,950
here. We can still fill this imbalance.
My stop is just above this. If we wash

5384
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:56,960
My stop is just above this. If we wash
 

5385
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:58,470
My stop is just above this. If we wash
this, I'm looking for a cover down here.

5386
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:58,480
this, I'm looking for a cover down here.
 

5387
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,390
this, I'm looking for a cover down here.
I don't like that the sellers just came

5388
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:00,400
I don't like that the sellers just came
 

5389
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,510
I don't like that the sellers just came
in there and couldn't get the break

5390
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:01,520
in there and couldn't get the break
 

5391
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,189
in there and couldn't get the break
under the shelf, but I'm still in this

5392
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:03,199
under the shelf, but I'm still in this
 

5393
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:05,990
under the shelf, but I'm still in this
for now. If we take out 31s, then I'll

5394
02:11:05,990 --> 02:11:06,000
for now. If we take out 31s, then I'll
 

5395
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:11,109
for now. If we take out 31s, then I'll
stop out

5396
02:11:11,109 --> 02:11:11,119

 

5397
02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:12,790

into the imbalances now that we just

5398
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:12,800
into the imbalances now that we just
 

5399
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,870
into the imbalances now that we just
talked about

5400
02:11:14,870 --> 02:11:14,880
talked about
 

5401
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:16,629
talked about
in this gray box. I got to be very very

5402
02:11:16,629 --> 02:11:16,639
in this gray box. I got to be very very
 

5403
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:18,790
in this gray box. I got to be very very
careful here. Very very careful here.

5404
02:11:18,790 --> 02:11:18,800
careful here. Very very careful here.
 

5405
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:19,990
careful here. Very very careful here.
Especially if ES wants to do a

5406
02:11:19,990 --> 02:11:20,000
Especially if ES wants to do a
 

5407
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,910
Especially if ES wants to do a
fiveminute flag.

5408
02:11:21,910 --> 02:11:21,920
fiveminute flag.
 

5409
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:25,270
fiveminute flag.
Did you tag me? Thanks.

5410
02:11:25,270 --> 02:11:25,280
Did you tag me? Thanks.
 

5411
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:28,550
Did you tag me? Thanks.
Out is what it is. Like I said, might be

5412
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:28,560
Out is what it is. Like I said, might be
 

5413
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:32,870
Out is what it is. Like I said, might be
early here.

5414
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:32,880

 

5415
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:35,830

So, I had a starter on here. Was waiting

5416
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:35,840
So, I had a starter on here. Was waiting
 

5417
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,830
So, I had a starter on here. Was waiting
to see if we do that to get heavy.

5418
02:11:37,830 --> 02:11:37,840
to see if we do that to get heavy.
 

5419
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,990
to see if we do that to get heavy.
Knocked out starter.

5420
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:40,000
Knocked out starter.
 

5421
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:46,470
Knocked out starter.
No change.

5422
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:46,480

 

5423
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:47,669

And they might still want to come for

5424
02:11:47,669 --> 02:11:47,679
And they might still want to come for
 

5425
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:51,030
And they might still want to come for
this low hanging fruit.

5426
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
this low hanging fruit.
 

5427
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:53,589
this low hanging fruit.
That's why I'm starter only.

5428
02:11:53,589 --> 02:11:53,599
That's why I'm starter only.
 

5429
02:11:53,599 --> 02:12:01,270
That's why I'm starter only.
And now flat.

5430
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:01,280

 

5431
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:02,950

What do you think about timing? I see

5432
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:02,960
What do you think about timing? I see
 

5433
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:05,669
What do you think about timing? I see
every day contra trend in the time 11 to

5434
02:12:05,669 --> 02:12:05,679
every day contra trend in the time 11 to
 

5435
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:08,950
every day contra trend in the time 11 to
12 people eating. Maybe uh no, you don't

5436
02:12:08,950 --> 02:12:08,960
12 people eating. Maybe uh no, you don't
 

5437
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:10,149
12 people eating. Maybe uh no, you don't
see that every day. That's just

5438
02:12:10,149 --> 02:12:10,159
see that every day. That's just
 

5439
02:12:10,159 --> 02:12:11,910
see that every day. That's just
something you've decided in your head

5440
02:12:11,910 --> 02:12:11,920
something you've decided in your head
 

5441
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:14,229
something you've decided in your head
happens every day. If you actually

5442
02:12:14,229 --> 02:12:14,239
happens every day. If you actually
 

5443
02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:15,990
happens every day. If you actually
studied that every day and looked at a

5444
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:16,000
studied that every day and looked at a
 

5445
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,589
studied that every day and looked at a
statbased thing, you definitely would

5446
02:12:17,589 --> 02:12:17,599
statbased thing, you definitely would
 

5447
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:20,629
statbased thing, you definitely would
not see every day that the trend goes

5448
02:12:20,629 --> 02:12:20,639
not see every day that the trend goes
 

5449
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:23,270
not see every day that the trend goes
the other way at that time.

5450
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:23,280
the other way at that time.
 

5451
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:24,470
the other way at that time.
Just something that might have happened

5452
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:24,480
Just something that might have happened
 

5453
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:26,149
Just something that might have happened
a few times that you've noticed it, but

5454
02:12:26,149 --> 02:12:26,159
a few times that you've noticed it, but
 

5455
02:12:26,159 --> 02:12:27,669
a few times that you've noticed it, but
it's definitely not a thing every day. I

5456
02:12:27,669 --> 02:12:27,679
it's definitely not a thing every day. I
 

5457
02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:34,470
it's definitely not a thing every day. I
promise you.

5458
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:34,480

 

5459
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:36,310

Why is low hanging fruit? Is it

5460
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:36,320
Why is low hanging fruit? Is it
 

5461
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:37,910
Why is low hanging fruit? Is it
liquidity? Yeah, it's liquidity. It's

5462
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:37,920
liquidity? Yeah, it's liquidity. It's
 

5463
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:53,510
liquidity? Yeah, it's liquidity. It's
the Asia High.

5464
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:53,520

 

5465
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,750

Yeah, like I said, my stop was at 31.

5466
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:55,760
Yeah, like I said, my stop was at 31.
 

5467
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:58,950
Yeah, like I said, my stop was at 31.
I'm out. I I lit quite literally told

5468
02:12:58,950 --> 02:12:58,960
I'm out. I I lit quite literally told
 

5469
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:02,950
I'm out. I I lit quite literally told
you where my stop was.

5470
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:02,960

 

5471
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,470

They might redo it. I'll have another go

5472
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:04,480
They might redo it. I'll have another go
 

5473
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:07,990
They might redo it. I'll have another go
if they redo it.

5474
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:08,000
if they redo it.
 

5475
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,589
if they redo it.
But ideally they just swipe this out.

5476
02:13:11,589 --> 02:13:11,599
But ideally they just swipe this out.
 

5477
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:16,149
But ideally they just swipe this out.
So I saw buyers get trapped here.

5478
02:13:16,149 --> 02:13:16,159

 

5479
02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:18,950

We came under. I was attacking this. I

5480
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:18,960
We came under. I was attacking this. I
 

5481
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:21,270
We came under. I was attacking this. I
was willing to add if we rejected this

5482
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:21,280
was willing to add if we rejected this
 

5483
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:23,270
was willing to add if we rejected this
and get heavy. We didn't reject it. It

5484
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:23,280
and get heavy. We didn't reject it. It
 

5485
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:27,270
and get heavy. We didn't reject it. It
can still do this. But this is becoming

5486
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:27,280
can still do this. But this is becoming
 

5487
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:40,950
can still do this. But this is becoming
very very important now.

5488
02:13:40,950 --> 02:13:40,960

 

5489
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,390

Do I not worry about shorting into the

5490
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:42,400
Do I not worry about shorting into the
 

5491
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:43,750
Do I not worry about shorting into the
flow zones? Yeah, but like I said, I'm

5492
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:43,760
flow zones? Yeah, but like I said, I'm
 

5493
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:44,950
flow zones? Yeah, but like I said, I'm
looking for the counter trend trade.

5494
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:44,960
looking for the counter trend trade.
 

5495
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,390
looking for the counter trend trade.
Like like I always talk about, it's the

5496
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:46,400
Like like I always talk about, it's the
 

5497
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:47,750
Like like I always talk about, it's the
hardest trade in the book, right? It's

5498
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:47,760
hardest trade in the book, right? It's
 

5499
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:48,950
hardest trade in the book, right? It's
the hardest trade in the book. The

5500
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:48,960
the hardest trade in the book. The
 

5501
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:51,270
the hardest trade in the book. The
easier trade in the book. Even this is

5502
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:51,280
easier trade in the book. Even this is
 

5503
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,350
easier trade in the book. Even this is
counter trade. Counter trend. It's the

5504
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:53,360
counter trade. Counter trend. It's the
 

5505
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,910
counter trade. Counter trend. It's the
hardest trade in the book. Absolutely is

5506
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:55,920
hardest trade in the book. Absolutely is
 

5507
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:57,189
hardest trade in the book. Absolutely is
the hardest trade in the book. We talk

5508
02:13:57,189 --> 02:13:57,199
the hardest trade in the book. We talk
 

5509
02:13:57,199 --> 02:13:59,270
the hardest trade in the book. We talk
about it all the time. That's why I'm

5510
02:13:59,270 --> 02:13:59,280
about it all the time. That's why I'm
 

5511
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:01,750
about it all the time. That's why I'm
small size on it. And I would get heavy,

5512
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:01,760
small size on it. And I would get heavy,
 

5513
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,709
small size on it. And I would get heavy,
right? If we came under here,

5514
02:14:04,709 --> 02:14:04,719
right? If we came under here,
 

5515
02:14:04,719 --> 02:14:05,990
right? If we came under here,
like I talked about, if we reject the

5516
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,000
like I talked about, if we reject the
 

5517
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,350
like I talked about, if we reject the
gray box, because then we'd be under the

5518
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:07,360
gray box, because then we'd be under the
 

5519
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,870
gray box, because then we'd be under the
flow zones. Flow zones would flip and

5520
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:08,880
flow zones. Flow zones would flip and
 

5521
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,390
flow zones. Flow zones would flip and
we'd probably see a trade back down into

5522
02:14:10,390 --> 02:14:10,400
we'd probably see a trade back down into
 

5523
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,310
we'd probably see a trade back down into
these,

5524
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:12,320
these,
 

5525
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:14,709
these,
right? So, that's why it's the hardest

5526
02:14:14,709 --> 02:14:14,719
right? So, that's why it's the hardest
 

5527
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:17,510
right? So, that's why it's the hardest
trade in the book.

5528
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:17,520
trade in the book.
 

5529
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:19,350
trade in the book.
Okay, can they clear out this liquidity

5530
02:14:19,350 --> 02:14:19,360
Okay, can they clear out this liquidity
 

5531
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:21,430
Okay, can they clear out this liquidity
now? Uh, VIX back down towards low of

5532
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:21,440
now? Uh, VIX back down towards low of
 

5533
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:25,990
now? Uh, VIX back down towards low of
day. Need to be careful here.

5534
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:26,000

 

5535
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,910

There is an old imbalance above this

5536
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:27,920
There is an old imbalance above this
 

5537
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:36,790
There is an old imbalance above this
GlobeEx high as well.

5538
02:14:36,790 --> 02:14:36,800

 

5539
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,790

I think it's close, folks. They just got

5540
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:38,800
I think it's close, folks. They just got
 

5541
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:41,189
I think it's close, folks. They just got
to go and take it. It's close to letting

5542
02:14:41,189 --> 02:14:41,199
to go and take it. It's close to letting
 

5543
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:43,189
to go and take it. It's close to letting
go here and having like a deeper

5544
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:43,199
go here and having like a deeper
 

5545
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:44,950
go here and having like a deeper
pullback for a little reset because this

5546
02:14:44,950 --> 02:14:44,960
pullback for a little reset because this
 

5547
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:47,669
pullback for a little reset because this
has been a big old drive. It's very

5548
02:14:47,669 --> 02:14:47,679
has been a big old drive. It's very
 

5549
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:48,950
has been a big old drive. It's very
close. We're watching this gray box

5550
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:48,960
close. We're watching this gray box
 

5551
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,870
close. We're watching this gray box
still. If we think about this move,

5552
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:50,880
still. If we think about this move,
 

5553
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:59,669
still. If we think about this move,
right, think about this move.

5554
02:14:59,669 --> 02:14:59,679

 

5555
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:02,310

Right. It needs a little reset. Even if

5556
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:02,320
Right. It needs a little reset. Even if
 

5557
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,229
Right. It needs a little reset. Even if
they're going to scoop that to go later,

5558
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:04,239
they're going to scoop that to go later,
 

5559
02:15:04,239 --> 02:15:06,950
they're going to scoop that to go later,
it's just do they do that? Do they do

5560
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:06,960
it's just do they do that? Do they do
 

5561
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:08,470
it's just do they do that? Do they do
that?

5562
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:08,480
that?
 

5563
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:11,510
that?
Or do they do this? That's the question.

5564
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:11,520
Or do they do this? That's the question.
 

5565
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:21,510
Or do they do this? That's the question.
I tell you what, I'm not buying up here.

5566
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:21,520

 

5567
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:41,990

Take care, Miguel.

5568
02:15:41,990 --> 02:15:42,000

 

5569
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,790

Okay. Can they take it out? Can they

5570
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:44,800
Okay. Can they take it out? Can they
 

5571
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:53,189
Okay. Can they take it out? Can they
finally take it out?

5572
02:15:53,189 --> 02:15:53,199

 

5573
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:55,430

There we go. Finally, they've swiped it.

5574
02:15:55,430 --> 02:15:55,440
There we go. Finally, they've swiped it.
 

5575
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:56,709
There we go. Finally, they've swiped it.
All right, finally they've taken that

5576
02:15:56,709 --> 02:15:56,719
All right, finally they've taken that
 

5577
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:58,629
All right, finally they've taken that
liquidity. So the question now is are

5578
02:15:58,629 --> 02:15:58,639
liquidity. So the question now is are
 

5579
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:00,390
liquidity. So the question now is are
they going to fail here? So if you if

5580
02:16:00,390 --> 02:16:00,400
they going to fail here? So if you if
 

5581
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:02,069
they going to fail here? So if you if
you were long, congratulations. Did

5582
02:16:02,069 --> 02:16:02,079
you were long, congratulations. Did
 

5583
02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:03,830
you were long, congratulations. Did
anyone actually hold that long from down

5584
02:16:03,830 --> 02:16:03,840
anyone actually hold that long from down
 

5585
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,189
anyone actually hold that long from down
here that we talked about or maybe even

5586
02:16:05,189 --> 02:16:05,199
here that we talked about or maybe even
 

5587
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:07,109
here that we talked about or maybe even
the one from this morning? Did anyone go

5588
02:16:07,109 --> 02:16:07,119
the one from this morning? Did anyone go
 

5589
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:09,189
the one from this morning? Did anyone go
from blue box

5590
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:09,199
from blue box
 

5591
02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:11,510
from blue box
all the way up here? The question now is

5592
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:11,520
all the way up here? The question now is
 

5593
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,750
all the way up here? The question now is
are they able to get up into the 400s or

5594
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:13,760
are they able to get up into the 400s or
 

5595
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:21,990
are they able to get up into the 400s or
we going to see this peak out and die?

5596
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:22,000

 

5597
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,709

I do have an old imbalance here into 30

5598
02:16:24,709 --> 02:16:24,719
I do have an old imbalance here into 30
 

5599
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:29,750
I do have an old imbalance here into 30
33s. Is it 333s? 353. Sorry, Alex can't

5600
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:29,760
33s. Is it 333s? 353. Sorry, Alex can't
 

5601
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:31,350
33s. Is it 333s? 353. Sorry, Alex can't
read.

5602
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:31,360
read.
 

5603
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,270
read.
Okay, there we go. That's the imbalance.

5604
02:16:33,270 --> 02:16:33,280
Okay, there we go. That's the imbalance.
 

5605
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,429
Okay, there we go. That's the imbalance.
353s.

5606
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:35,439
353s.
 

5607
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,349
353s.
They are still adding liquidity high. I

5608
02:16:37,349 --> 02:16:37,359
They are still adding liquidity high. I
 

5609
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:40,070
They are still adding liquidity high. I
will be amazed if they come up for

5610
02:16:40,070 --> 02:16:40,080
will be amazed if they come up for
 

5611
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:42,070
will be amazed if they come up for
previous week value area high today.

5612
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:42,080
previous week value area high today.
 

5613
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:45,509
previous week value area high today.
That will be quite the shove.

5614
02:16:45,509 --> 02:16:45,519
That will be quite the shove.
 

5615
02:16:45,519 --> 02:16:47,270
That will be quite the shove.
It's very possible, but it would be

5616
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:47,280
It's very possible, but it would be
 

5617
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:49,990
It's very possible, but it would be
quite the shove, which will be the 161,

5618
02:16:49,990 --> 02:16:50,000
quite the shove, which will be the 161,
 

5619
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,309
quite the shove, which will be the 161,
right? Didn't we measure it earlier?

5620
02:16:54,309 --> 02:16:54,319

 

5621
02:16:54,319 --> 02:16:59,750

No, that would be even higher.

5622
02:16:59,750 --> 02:16:59,760

 

5623
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:01,910

Okay, just tapped this imbalance. It's

5624
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:01,920
Okay, just tapped this imbalance. It's
 

5625
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:11,190
Okay, just tapped this imbalance. It's
an old imbalance here.

5626
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,200

 

5627
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:14,389

We get through this. Oof.

5628
02:17:14,389 --> 02:17:14,399
We get through this. Oof.
 

5629
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:19,349
We get through this. Oof.
Oof.

5630
02:17:19,349 --> 02:17:19,359

 

5631
02:17:19,359 --> 02:17:21,190

Yes. Looks like it wants to go. Yes.

5632
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:21,200
Yes. Looks like it wants to go. Yes.
 

5633
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:25,030
Yes. Looks like it wants to go. Yes.
Wants more. I would say spy. Uh

5634
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:25,040
Wants more. I would say spy. Uh
 

5635
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:27,669
Wants more. I would say spy. Uh
95 would be the level, right? 95. That

5636
02:17:27,669 --> 02:17:27,679
95 would be the level, right? 95. That
 

5637
02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:38,309
95 would be the level, right? 95. That
same level. 695.

5638
02:17:38,309 --> 02:17:38,319

 

5639
02:17:38,319 --> 02:17:40,309

They support a bid here. They haven't

5640
02:17:40,309 --> 02:17:40,319
They support a bid here. They haven't
 

5641
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:42,070
They support a bid here. They haven't
cleared out everyone. They cleared out a

5642
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:42,080
cleared out everyone. They cleared out a
 

5643
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:45,750
cleared out everyone. They cleared out a
decent chunk. Still guys resting on the

5644
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:45,760
decent chunk. Still guys resting on the
 

5645
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:49,589
decent chunk. Still guys resting on the
offer above. Still a big seller at 400.

5646
02:17:49,589 --> 02:17:49,599
offer above. Still a big seller at 400.
 

5647
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:50,709
offer above. Still a big seller at 400.
Here they go. They're trying to clear

5648
02:17:50,709 --> 02:17:50,719
Here they go. They're trying to clear
 

5649
02:17:50,719 --> 02:18:09,990
Here they go. They're trying to clear
out everyone now.

5650
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:10,000

 

5651
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,429

Still guys at 60s. Still they bid. And

5652
02:18:13,429 --> 02:18:13,439
Still guys at 60s. Still they bid. And
 

5653
02:18:13,439 --> 02:18:20,790
Still guys at 60s. Still they bid. And
still they bid. Still no short setup.

5654
02:18:20,790 --> 02:18:20,800

 

5655
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:24,309

Even argue this up here. But really this

5656
02:18:24,309 --> 02:18:24,319
Even argue this up here. But really this
 

5657
02:18:24,319 --> 02:18:26,469
Even argue this up here. But really this
and I just wonder are they going to come

5658
02:18:26,469 --> 02:18:26,479
and I just wonder are they going to come
 

5659
02:18:26,479 --> 02:18:29,429
and I just wonder are they going to come
for this up here? Are they coming for

5660
02:18:29,429 --> 02:18:29,439
for this up here? Are they coming for
 

5661
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:33,910
for this up here? Are they coming for
440s today? That is one hell of a move

5662
02:18:33,910 --> 02:18:33,920
440s today? That is one hell of a move
 

5663
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:41,110
440s today? That is one hell of a move
if they do.

5664
02:18:41,110 --> 02:18:41,120

 

5665
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:44,070

How do I determine

5666
02:18:44,070 --> 02:18:44,080
How do I determine
 

5667
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:47,509
How do I determine
95 as a key price for ES? Uh, not for ES

5668
02:18:47,509 --> 02:18:47,519
95 as a key price for ES? Uh, not for ES
 

5669
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:49,429
95 as a key price for ES? Uh, not for ES
for spy.

5670
02:18:49,429 --> 02:18:49,439
for spy.
 

5671
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:51,589
for spy.
It will be a gamma level. There'll be a

5672
02:18:51,589 --> 02:18:51,599
It will be a gamma level. There'll be a
 

5673
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:54,469
It will be a gamma level. There'll be a
gamma level there at 695. I I haven't

5674
02:18:54,469 --> 02:18:54,479
gamma level there at 695. I I haven't
 

5675
02:18:54,479 --> 02:18:55,910
gamma level there at 695. I I haven't
even looked, but I can almost guarantee

5676
02:18:55,910 --> 02:18:55,920
even looked, but I can almost guarantee
 

5677
02:18:55,920 --> 02:19:07,589
even looked, but I can almost guarantee
it. Getting

5678
02:19:07,589 --> 02:19:07,599

 

5679
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:09,910

wonky up here. It's getting wonky up

5680
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:09,920
wonky up here. It's getting wonky up
 

5681
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,309
wonky up here. It's getting wonky up
here. We still haven't cleared out the

5682
02:19:12,309 --> 02:19:12,319
here. We still haven't cleared out the

probably a trade back down to here
 

5733

02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:27,270
Here's 50s. Let's just flush 20s then.
The faf. The faf. Are they going to

5838
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:27,280
The faf. The faf. Are they going to
 

5839
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:29,349
The faf. The faf. Are they going to
retrap and go again? Seriously, guys.

5840
02:23:29,349 --> 02:23:29,359
retrap and go again? Seriously, guys.
 

5841
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:37,270
retrap and go again? Seriously, guys.
This is getting ridiculous.

5842
02:23:37,270 --> 02:23:37,280

 

5843
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,670

Come on.

5844
02:23:39,670 --> 02:23:39,680
Come on.
 

5845
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:42,150
Come on.
Like I said, I will he add heavy under

5846
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:42,160
Like I said, I will he add heavy under
 

5847
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:44,070
Like I said, I will he add heavy under
this gray box. If this is a peak and we

5848
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:44,080
this gray box. If this is a peak and we
 

5849
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:45,670
this gray box. If this is a peak and we
get under here, I will add heavy under

5850
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:45,680
get under here, I will add heavy under
 

5851
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:48,150
get under here, I will add heavy under
here for a rotation. Until then, I'm

5852
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:48,160
here for a rotation. Until then, I'm
 

5853
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:51,590
here for a rotation. Until then, I'm
very, very light.

5854
02:23:51,590 --> 02:23:51,600
very, very light.
 

5855
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,030
very, very light.
Structurally, we're still bullish

5856
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:53,040
Structurally, we're still bullish
 

5857
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:54,950
Structurally, we're still bullish
technically, but we did just trap buyers

5858
02:23:54,950 --> 02:23:54,960
technically, but we did just trap buyers
 

5859
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:58,230
technically, but we did just trap buyers
at those highs.

5860
02:23:58,230 --> 02:23:58,240
at those highs.
 

5861
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:00,150
at those highs.
Yes, still holding. VIX needs to get

5862
02:24:00,150 --> 02:24:00,160
Yes, still holding. VIX needs to get
 

5863
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:04,230
Yes, still holding. VIX needs to get
back above previous day low,

5864
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:04,240

 

5865
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:05,750

back into this imbalance. If there's no

5866
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:05,760
back into this imbalance. If there's no
 

5867
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:08,630
back into this imbalance. If there's no
rejection here, I have to cut

5868
02:24:08,630 --> 02:24:08,640
rejection here, I have to cut
 

5869
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:11,510
rejection here, I have to cut
cuz I'm early. Hardest trade on the book

5870
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:11,520
cuz I'm early. Hardest trade on the book
 

5871
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:25,110
cuz I'm early. Hardest trade on the book
in the book like I always talk about.

5872
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:25,120

 

5873
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:27,110

It's very slow. I don't like how slow it

5874
02:24:27,110 --> 02:24:27,120
It's very slow. I don't like how slow it
 

5875
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:29,590
It's very slow. I don't like how slow it
is. Come on.

5876
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:29,600

someone absorbing this book nonstop.

02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:44,640
someone absorbing this book nonstop.
 

5891
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:46,630
someone absorbing this book nonstop.
So, I have to be disciplined out of

5892
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:46,640
So, I have to be disciplined out of
 

5893
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,630
So, I have to be disciplined out of

that swipe.
 

5897
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:52,230
that swipe.
You're going to [\h__\h] do it the moment

5898
02:24:52,230 --> 02:24:52,240
You're going to [\h__\h] do it the moment
 

5899
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:55,270
You're going to [\h__\h] do it the moment
I cut.

5900
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:55,280
I cut.
 

5901
02:24:55,280 --> 02:25:01,030

02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:17,190
Looking for this again. [\h__\h]
[\h__\h] I can't believe they just did

5908
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:17,200
[\h__\h] I can't believe they just did
 

5909
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:18,790
[\h__\h] I can't believe they just did
that to me. I think that's the second

5910
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:18,800
that to me. I think that's the second
 

5911
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:21,349
that to me. I think that's the second
time today. All right. Can we move back

5917
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,389

Can we move back down to the 20s or we

5918
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:38,399
Can we move back down to the 20s or we
 

5919
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:40,469
Can we move back down to the 20s or we
going to reject this? I don't like this.

5920
02:25:40,469 --> 02:25:40,479

heavy for that if we're going to do
 

5937
02:25:56,240 --> 02:25:58,710
heavy for that if we're going to do
that. Uh maybe all the way back to IB

5939
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:09,349
that. Uh maybe all the way back to IB
would be very lucky.

6243
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:05,270
this up at this point. This is uh
frothy. Really frothy.

6244

6245
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:07,270

Honestly, I really wonder if this is

6246
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:07,280
Honestly, I really wonder if this is
 

6247
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:08,389
Honestly, I really wonder if this is
what they're going to do. If they're

6248
02:35:08,389 --> 02:35:08,399
what they're going to do. If they're
 

6249
02:35:08,399 --> 02:35:09,750
what they're going to do. If they're
just like, "We got to get through the

6250
02:35:09,750 --> 02:35:09,760
just like, "We got to get through the
 

6251
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:12,309
just like, "We got to get through the
whole week in one go." It would be an

6252
02:35:12,309 --> 02:35:12,319
whole week in one go." It would be an
 

6253
02:35:12,319 --> 02:35:15,429
whole week in one go." It would be an
insane recovery, guys, to do that. Like,

6254
02:35:15,429 --> 02:35:15,439
insane recovery, guys, to do that. Like,
 

6255
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:18,070
insane recovery, guys, to do that. Like,
I cannot explain how big a recovery that

6256
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:18,080
I cannot explain how big a recovery that
 

6257
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:24,550
I cannot explain how big a recovery that
is in one go. Insane.

6258
02:35:24,550 --> 02:35:24,560

02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:29,830
New shelf developed up here. out. It's
how much buying just came in in the last

6262
02:35:29,830 --> 02:35:29,840
how much buying just came in in the last
 

6263
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:31,990
how much buying just came in in the last
20 seconds that we've just put a little

6264
02:35:31,990 --> 02:35:32,000
20 seconds that we've just put a little

6269
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:48,870

Still they're forcing. Didn't even feel

6270
02:35:48,870 --> 02:35:48,880
Still they're forcing. Didn't even feel
 

6271
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:51,030
Still they're forcing. Didn't even feel
the imbalance. They are forcing higher

6272
02:35:51,030 --> 02:35:51,040
the imbalance. They are forcing higher
 

6273
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:52,790
the imbalance. They are forcing higher
here.

6274
02:35:52,790 --> 02:35:52,800
here.
 

6275
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:54,950
here.
They do not give a [\h__\h] I cannot

6276
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:54,960
They do not give a [\h__\h] I cannot

They do not give a [\h__\h] I cannot
explain how aggressive this is on the

explain how aggressive this is on the
 

6279
02:35:56,479 --> 02:36:01,910
explain how aggressive this is on the
tape to be bidding like this.

6280
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:01,920

 

6281
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:05,510

They clearly in my mind this is a market

6282
02:36:05,510 --> 02:36:05,520
They clearly in my mind this is a market
 

6283
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:08,389
They clearly in my mind this is a market
maker or a a a institution who's been

6284
02:36:08,389 --> 02:36:08,399
maker or a a a institution who's been
 

6285
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:10,630
maker or a a a institution who's been
stuck on the cell. So they are now

6286
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:10,640
stuck on the cell. So they are now
 

6287
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:14,309
stuck on the cell. So they are now
forcing up to get out of their position

6288
02:36:14,309 --> 02:36:14,319
forcing up to get out of their position
 

6289
02:36:14,319 --> 02:36:16,790
forcing up to get out of their position
without having too much damage. And once

6290
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:16,800
without having too much damage. And once
 

6291
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,309
without having too much damage. And once
they're out of that position, they will

6292
02:36:18,309 --> 02:36:18,319
they're out of that position, they will
 

6293
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:20,870
they're out of that position, they will
sell it and tank it back down and rebid.

6294
02:36:20,870 --> 02:36:20,880
sell it and tank it back down and rebid.
 

6295
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:22,870
sell it and tank it back down and rebid.
But I'm This is what I expected this

6296
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:22,880
But I'm This is what I expected this
 

6297
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:25,910
But I'm This is what I expected this
week. I didn't expect it in one day. I

6298
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:25,920
week. I didn't expect it in one day. I
 

6299
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:27,750
week. I didn't expect it in one day. I
didn't expect us to literally go

02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:27,760
didn't expect us to literally go
 

6301
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:29,429
didn't expect us to literally go
straight back up to previous week value

6302
02:36:29,429 --> 02:36:29,439
straight back up to previous week value
 

6303
02:36:29,439 --> 02:36:31,429
straight back up to previous week value
area high in one day. This is the area

6304
02:36:31,429 --> 02:36:31,439
area high in one day. This is the area
 

6305
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:33,830
area high in one day. This is the area
as we get into here where shorts must or

6306
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:33,840
as we get into here where shorts must or
 

6307
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:36,230
as we get into here where shorts must or
sellers must defend this area. If we

6308
02:36:36,230 --> 02:36:36,240
sellers must defend this area. If we
 

6309
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:38,710
sellers must defend this area. If we
start reclaiming this area, there is a

6310
02:36:38,710 --> 02:36:38,720
start reclaiming this area, there is a
 

6311
02:36:38,720 --> 02:36:42,950
start reclaiming this area, there is a
gigantic squeeze opportunity up to 675

6312
02:36:42,950 --> 02:36:42,960
gigantic squeeze opportunity up to 675
 

6313
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:46,309
gigantic squeeze opportunity up to 675
and even 830. We will not do that today.

6314
02:36:46,309 --> 02:36:46,319
and even 830. We will not do that today.
 

6315
02:36:46,319 --> 02:36:48,870
and even 830. We will not do that today.
There's just no way. But this is the

6316
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:48,880
There's just no way. But this is the
 

6317
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:52,309
There's just no way. But this is the
area sellers must 100% defend. They have

6318
02:36:52,309 --> 02:36:52,319
area sellers must 100% defend. They have
 

6319
02:36:52,319 --> 02:36:54,309
area sellers must 100% defend. They have
no nothing else that they can do other

6320
02:36:54,309 --> 02:36:54,319
no nothing else that they can do other
 

6321
02:36:54,319 --> 02:36:56,150
no nothing else that they can do other
than defend that area. If they lose that

6322
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:56,160
than defend that area. If they lose that
 

6323
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:58,230
than defend that area. If they lose that
area,

6324
02:36:58,230 --> 02:36:58,240
area,
 

6325
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:00,630
area,
then I think uh we are in big trouble

6326
02:37:00,630 --> 02:37:00,640
then I think uh we are in big trouble
 

6327
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:02,070
then I think uh we are in big trouble
for all the sellers at the lows, the

6328
02:37:02,070 --> 02:37:02,080
for all the sellers at the lows, the
 

6329
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:07,510
for all the sellers at the lows, the
swing shorts.

6330
02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:07,520

 

6331
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:10,070

Okay, there's the peak out

6332
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:10,080
Okay, there's the peak out
 

6333
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:11,830
Okay, there's the peak out
back into this imbalance again. Are we

6334
02:37:11,830 --> 02:37:11,840
back into this imbalance again. Are we
 

6335
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:14,630
back into this imbalance again. Are we
now backside yet? We have just tagged

6336
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:14,640
now backside yet? We have just tagged
 

6337
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:16,389
now backside yet? We have just tagged
all those key areas like we talked about

6338
02:37:16,389 --> 02:37:16,399
all those key areas like we talked about
 

6339
02:37:16,399 --> 02:37:18,389
all those key areas like we talked about
on uh

6340
02:37:18,389 --> 02:37:18,399
on uh
 

6341
02:37:18,399 --> 02:37:20,950
on uh
the options market

6342
02:37:20,950 --> 02:37:20,960
the options market
 

6343

the options market
Q's and uh and SPY

6344

6345
02:37:26,399 --> 02:37:27,830

still holding that imbalance. We're not

6346
02:37:27,830 --> 02:37:27,840
still holding that imbalance. We're not
 

6347
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:29,190
still holding that imbalance. We're not
even letting go of the imbalance at

6348
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:29,200
even letting go of the imbalance at
 

6349
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,910
even letting go of the imbalance at
76es. This is so insane right now,

6350
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:31,920
76es. This is so insane right now,
 

6351
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:34,870
76es. This is so insane right now,
folks. I cannot explain this to you to

6352
02:37:34,870 --> 02:37:34,880
folks. I cannot explain this to you to
 

6353
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:38,309
folks. I cannot explain this to you to
bid like this non-stop. It's not so much

6354
02:37:38,309 --> 02:37:38,319
bid like this non-stop. It's not so much
 

6355
02:37:38,319 --> 02:37:40,950
bid like this non-stop. It's not so much
that where we've gone. It's like how he

6356
02:37:40,950 --> 02:37:40,960
that where we've gone. It's like how he
 

6357
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:43,190
that where we've gone. It's like how he
stepped up at 40 and gobbled and gobbled

6358
02:37:43,190 --> 02:37:43,200
stepped up at 40 and gobbled and gobbled
 

6359
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:46,150
stepped up at 40 and gobbled and gobbled
and gobbled and then just ripped it. To

6360
02:37:46,150 --> 02:37:46,160
and gobbled and then just ripped it. To
 

6361
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:48,389
and gobbled and then just ripped it. To
be buying the amount he was buying here

6362
02:37:48,389 --> 02:37:48,399
be buying the amount he was buying here
 

6363
02:37:48,399 --> 02:37:50,710
be buying the amount he was buying here
was crazy for me to watch that happen on

6364
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:50,720
was crazy for me to watch that happen on
 

6365
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:56,309
was crazy for me to watch that happen on
the tape.

6366
02:37:56,309 --> 02:37:56,319

 

6367
02:37:56,319 --> 02:37:59,510

And he's now bidding at 77 and 67 with a

6368
02:37:59,510 --> 02:37:59,520
And he's now bidding at 77 and 67 with a
 

6369
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:05,750
And he's now bidding at 77 and 67 with a
target of 95 97 and 400. He's not done.

6370
02:38:05,750 --> 02:38:05,760
target of 95 97 and 400. He's not done.
 

6371
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:07,750
target of 95 97 and 400. He's not done.
Uh no, not really Dave. That's not

6372
02:38:07,750 --> 02:38:07,760
Uh no, not really Dave. That's not
 

6373
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:10,469
Uh no, not really Dave. That's not
really how it works cuz if you do that

6374
02:38:10,469 --> 02:38:10,479
really how it works cuz if you do that
 

6375
02:38:10,479 --> 02:38:12,070
really how it works cuz if you do that
all right and they pull their position

6376
02:38:12,070 --> 02:38:12,080
all right and they pull their position
 

6377
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:13,990
all right and they pull their position
and you buy deep and premium you got to

6378
02:38:13,990 --> 02:38:14,000
and you buy deep and premium you got to
 

6379
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,070
and you buy deep and premium you got to
understand

6380
02:38:16,070 --> 02:38:16,080
understand
 

6381
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:17,429
understand
when you're saying if you can't beat

6382
02:38:17,429 --> 02:38:17,439
when you're saying if you can't beat
 

6383
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:19,349
when you're saying if you can't beat
them join them. Um they were joining

6384
02:38:19,349 --> 02:38:19,359
them join them. Um they were joining
 

6385
02:38:19,359 --> 02:38:21,990
them join them. Um they were joining
they they they've probably been bidding

6386
02:38:21,990 --> 02:38:22,000
they they they've probably been bidding
 

6387
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:25,590
they they they've probably been bidding
right since here right and even beyond

6388
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:25,600
right since here right and even beyond
 

6389
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:27,750
right since here right and even beyond
that they've been bidding all of this

6390
02:38:27,750 --> 02:38:27,760
that they've been bidding all of this
 

6391
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:29,910
that they've been bidding all of this
bid bid bid bid bid. They're just trying

6392
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:29,920
bid bid bid bid bid. They're just trying
 

6393
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:31,990
bid bid bid bid bid. They're just trying
to force that last bit up now. You don't

6394
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:32,000
to force that last bit up now. You don't
 

6395
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,670
to force that last bit up now. You don't
want to be the guy buying the top of

6396
02:38:33,670 --> 02:38:33,680
want to be the guy buying the top of
 

6397
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:36,150
want to be the guy buying the top of
their bid do you? Right. You need to

6398
02:38:36,150 --> 02:38:36,160
their bid do you? Right. You need to
 

6399
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:37,990
their bid do you? Right. You need to
have some rules.

6400
02:38:37,990 --> 02:38:38,000
have some rules.
 

6401
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,469
have some rules.
If we if we buy the top of their bid, we

6402
02:38:40,469 --> 02:38:40,479
If we if we buy the top of their bid, we
 

6403
02:38:40,479 --> 02:38:41,990
If we if we buy the top of their bid, we
will get dunked on when they're done

6404
02:38:41,990 --> 02:38:42,000
will get dunked on when they're done
 

6405
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,510
will get dunked on when they're done
with it because they were going to have

6406
02:38:43,510 --> 02:38:43,520
with it because they were going to have
 

6407
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:45,750
with it because they were going to have
a massive core position which is way

6408
02:38:45,750 --> 02:38:45,760
a massive core position which is way
 

6409
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:47,190
a massive core position which is way
lower than this. It's just that they're

6410
02:38:47,190 --> 02:38:47,200
lower than this. It's just that they're
 

6411
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:49,670
lower than this. It's just that they're
non-stop up here. They want the exit up

6412
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:49,680
non-stop up here. They want the exit up
 

6413
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:51,190
non-stop up here. They want the exit up
here so they can probably get out break

6414
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:51,200
here so they can probably get out break
 

6415
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:52,790
here so they can probably get out break
even versus the previous week. It's

6416
02:38:52,790 --> 02:38:52,800
even versus the previous week. It's
 

6417
02:38:52,800 --> 02:39:05,110
even versus the previous week. It's
going to be something stupid like that.

6418
02:39:05,110 --> 02:39:05,120

 

6419
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:06,870

SPX got a while to go to get there. All

6420
02:39:06,870 --> 02:39:06,880
SPX got a while to go to get there. All
 

6421
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:09,429
SPX got a while to go to get there. All
right, still watching these 7475s

6422
02:39:09,429 --> 02:39:09,439
right, still watching these 7475s
 

6423
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:13,750
right, still watching these 7475s
or is it 76 75? 76s and 75s. And if we

6424
02:39:13,750 --> 02:39:13,760
or is it 76 75? 76s and 75s. And if we
 

6425
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:15,110
or is it 76 75? 76s and 75s. And if we
flush this, we probably trade straight

6426
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:15,120
flush this, we probably trade straight
 

6427
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:16,550
flush this, we probably trade straight
down. Look, this is a big imbalance

6428
02:39:16,550 --> 02:39:16,560
down. Look, this is a big imbalance
 

6429
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:24,790
down. Look, this is a big imbalance
here.

6430
02:39:24,790 --> 02:39:24,800

 

6431
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:26,309

Yeah, just cuz you know the market's

6432
02:39:26,309 --> 02:39:26,319
Yeah, just cuz you know the market's
 

6433
02:39:26,319 --> 02:39:28,870
Yeah, just cuz you know the market's
going one like in a certain direction

6434
02:39:28,870 --> 02:39:28,880
going one like in a certain direction
 

6435
02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:32,469
going one like in a certain direction
doesn't mean that we can join. If you

6436
02:39:32,469 --> 02:39:32,479
doesn't mean that we can join. If you
 

6437
02:39:32,479 --> 02:39:34,309
doesn't mean that we can join. If you
join late,

6438
02:39:34,309 --> 02:39:34,319
join late,
 

6439
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:36,469
join late,
you're just amplifying issues, right? If

6440
02:39:36,469 --> 02:39:36,479
you're just amplifying issues, right? If
 

6441
02:39:36,479 --> 02:39:37,910
you're just amplifying issues, right? If
you're joining late like that, you're

6442
02:39:37,910 --> 02:39:37,920
you're joining late like that, you're
 

6443
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:40,550
you're joining late like that, you're
not you're not helping your situation,

6444
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:40,560
not you're not helping your situation,
 

6445
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:42,469
not you're not helping your situation,
right? So, just understanding that,

6446
02:39:42,469 --> 02:39:42,479
right? So, just understanding that,
 

6447
02:39:42,479 --> 02:39:44,309
right? So, just understanding that,
okay, we the expectation is the market

6448
02:39:44,309 --> 02:39:44,319
okay, we the expectation is the market
 

6449
02:39:44,319 --> 02:39:45,830
okay, we the expectation is the market
is going to do this at the moment

6450
02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:45,840
is going to do this at the moment
 

6451
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:47,830
is going to do this at the moment
doesn't mean if we don't have prime

6452
02:39:47,830 --> 02:39:47,840
doesn't mean if we don't have prime
 

6453
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:50,070
doesn't mean if we don't have prime
position, why do we want to then play

6454
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:50,080
position, why do we want to then play
 

6455
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:54,790
position, why do we want to then play
that market there?

6456
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:54,800

 

6457
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:57,429

That's also bollocks JT because you

6458
02:39:57,429 --> 02:39:57,439
That's also bollocks JT because you
 

6459
02:39:57,439 --> 02:39:59,110
That's also bollocks JT because you
absolutely can. And you can have a stop

6460
02:39:59,110 --> 02:39:59,120
absolutely can. And you can have a stop
 

6461
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:02,150
absolutely can. And you can have a stop
here and that can disrespect you down

6462
02:40:02,150 --> 02:40:02,160
here and that can disrespect you down
 

6463
02:40:02,160 --> 02:40:03,990
here and that can disrespect you down
here cuz it's so thin and you can get

6464
02:40:03,990 --> 02:40:04,000
here cuz it's so thin and you can get
 

6465
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:09,830
here cuz it's so thin and you can get
run on that stop.

6466
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:09,840

 

6467
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:12,230

That's just not accurate.

6468
02:40:12,230 --> 02:40:12,240
That's just not accurate.
 

6469
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:13,750
That's just not accurate.
Not when it's the amount of size that

6470
02:40:13,750 --> 02:40:13,760
Not when it's the amount of size that
 

6471
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:19,590
Not when it's the amount of size that
they've got.

6472
02:40:19,590 --> 02:40:19,600

 

6473
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,190

Still we point higher. Still they're

6474
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:21,200
Still we point higher. Still they're
 

6475
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:23,830
Still we point higher. Still they're
looking for these 400s.

6476
02:40:23,830 --> 02:40:23,840
looking for these 400s.
 

6477
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:26,070
looking for these 400s.
If we I would not be surprised we get 4

6478
02:40:26,070 --> 02:40:26,080
If we I would not be surprised we get 4
 

6479
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:27,910
If we I would not be surprised we get 4

02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:31,349
and440 into lunch and then they just
stop it. They just go, "Okay, enough.

stop it. They just go, "Okay, enough.
Be done with it."

6484
02:40:35,590 --> 02:40:35,600

 

6485
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:37,110

Exactly. Buying expensive to sell

6486
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:37,120
Exactly. Buying expensive to sell
 

6487
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:38,309
Exactly. Buying expensive to sell
expensive is not a great business

6488
02:40:38,309 --> 02:40:38,319
expensive is not a great business
 

6489
02:40:38,319 --> 02:40:40,309
expensive is not a great business
strategy. I I agree. It's a force up,

6490
02:40:40,309 --> 02:40:40,319
strategy. I I agree. It's a force up,
 

6491
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:42,150
strategy. I I agree. It's a force up,
guys. This is an absolute force up. It's

6492
02:40:42,150 --> 02:40:42,160
guys. This is an absolute force up. It's
 

6493
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:43,990
guys. This is an absolute force up. It's
being done on purpose. This is going to

6494
02:40:43,990 --> 02:40:44,000
being done on purpose. This is going to
 

6495
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,990
being done on purpose. This is going to
get get them to unload their position

get get them to unload their position
 

6497

when they're ready, and it it's also

6498
02:40:47,830 --> 02:40:47,840
when they're ready, and it it's also
 

6499
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:49,030
when they're ready, and it it's also
going to provide the opportunity for

6500
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:49,040
going to provide the opportunity for
 

6501
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:53,270
going to provide the opportunity for
them to get short where they want.

6502
02:40:53,270 --> 02:40:53,280

 

6503
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:55,110

I expected this this week. I didn't

6504
02:40:55,110 --> 02:40:55,120
I expected this this week. I didn't
 

6505
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:57,110
I expected this this week. I didn't
expect it all in one go. I did expect it

6506
02:40:57,110 --> 02:40:57,120
expect it all in one go. I did expect it
 

6507
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:59,429
expect it all in one go. I did expect it
this week. I'm telling you what, if they

6508
02:40:59,429 --> 02:40:59,439
this week. I'm telling you what, if they
 

6509
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:01,670
this week. I'm telling you what, if they
start getting over 520s today, it's

6510
02:41:01,670 --> 02:41:01,680
start getting over 520s today, it's
 

6511
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:07,349
start getting over 520s today, it's
going to get real nasty.

6512
02:41:07,349 --> 02:41:07,359

 

6513
02:41:07,359 --> 02:41:13,190

There's the move to fours.

6514
02:41:13,190 --> 02:41:13,200

 

6515
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:14,550

And you haven't got that much left to

6516
02:41:14,550 --> 02:41:14,560
And you haven't got that much left to
 

6517
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:18,469
And you haven't got that much left to
get into here. 440s.

6518
02:41:18,469 --> 02:41:18,479

 

6519
02:41:18,479 --> 02:41:22,070

Look, where's that old imbalance? 21s.

6520
02:41:22,070 --> 02:41:22,080
Look, where's that old imbalance? 21s.
 

6521
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:25,349
Look, where's that old imbalance? 21s.
421s.

6522
02:41:25,349 --> 02:41:25,359

 

6523
02:41:25,359 --> 02:41:27,270

Okay, move this up. This is their

6524
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:27,280
Okay, move this up. This is their
 

6525
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:29,270
Okay, move this up. This is their
support system now. They let go of that.

6526
02:41:29,270 --> 02:41:29,280
support system now. They let go of that.
 

6527
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:31,990
support system now. They let go of that.
There's a wash back down.

6528
02:41:31,990 --> 02:41:32,000
There's a wash back down.
 

6529
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,150
There's a wash back down.
I don't know if I'll have another go.

6530
02:41:34,150 --> 02:41:34,160
I don't know if I'll have another go.
 

6531
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:41,830
I don't know if I'll have another go.
Might be done.

6532
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:41,840

 

6533
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:46,630

460 is expected high of day.

6534
02:41:46,630 --> 02:41:46,640

 

6535
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:51,429

Such a monstrous move. Honestly,

6536
02:41:51,429 --> 02:41:51,439
Such a monstrous move. Honestly,
 

6537
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:53,030
Such a monstrous move. Honestly,
it looks good for it. Where did I say

6538
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,040
it looks good for it. Where did I say
 

6539
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,990
it looks good for it. Where did I say
the 161 was? I keep forgetting.

6540
02:41:55,990 --> 02:41:56,000
the 161 was? I keep forgetting.
 

6541
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:59,429
the 161 was? I keep forgetting.
588

6542
02:41:59,429 --> 02:41:59,439

 

6543
02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:04,309

this morning's first pullback

6544
02:42:04,309 --> 02:42:04,319

 

6545
02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:05,990

over the measured move of that pullback

6546
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:06,000
over the measured move of that pullback
 

6547
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,950
over the measured move of that pullback
already.

6548
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:10,960

 

6549
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:12,550

I think we'll see a peak out soon. I

6550
02:42:12,550 --> 02:42:12,560
I think we'll see a peak out soon. I
 

6551
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:13,990
I think we'll see a peak out soon. I
think buyers will chase the tops and

6552
02:42:13,990 --> 02:42:14,000
think buyers will chase the tops and
 

6553
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,550
think buyers will chase the tops and
we'll see a peek out soon. Do I have one

6554
02:42:16,550 --> 02:42:16,560
we'll see a peek out soon. Do I have one
 

6555
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:22,070
we'll see a peek out soon. Do I have one
more go at this if it's ready?

6556
02:42:22,070 --> 02:42:22,080

 

6557
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:23,590

6558
02:42:23,590 --> 02:42:23,600
What was the IB expansion? I've
 

6559
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:30,870
What was the IB expansion? I've
forgotten that as well.

02:43:55,279 --> 02:44:00,630
the 20s. Um,
US AR 4 and a.5% up. Um, what else were

6612
02:44:00,630 --> 02:44:00,640
US AR 4 and a.5% up. Um, what else were
 

6613
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:02,469
US AR 4 and a.5% up. Um, what else were
we looking? Oracle, we're over 10% up

6614
02:44:02,469 --> 02:44:02,479
we looking? Oracle, we're over 10% up
 

6615
02:44:02,479 --> 02:44:05,830
we looking? Oracle, we're over 10% up
now, 10.31% up on the day. Might be an

6616
02:44:05,830 --> 02:44:05,840
now, 10.31% up on the day. Might be an
 

6617
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:07,590
now, 10.31% up on the day. Might be an
opportunity to start scaling out some of

6618
02:44:07,590 --> 02:44:07,600
opportunity to start scaling out some of
 

6619
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:09,349
opportunity to start scaling out some of
these at least to lock in a little bit

6620
02:44:09,349 --> 02:44:09,359
these at least to lock in a little bit
 

6621
02:44:09,359 --> 02:44:12,469
these at least to lock in a little bit
on these swings.

6622
02:44:12,469 --> 02:44:12,479
on these swings.
 

6623
02:44:12,479 --> 02:44:14,710
on these swings.
Plenty of room left, but could protect

6624
02:44:14,710 --> 02:44:14,720
Plenty of room left, but could protect
 

6625
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:20,870
Plenty of room left, but could protect
some profits here.

6626
02:44:20,870 --> 02:44:20,880

 

6627
02:44:20,880 --> 02:44:25,910

Up on those miners. Where am I at?

6628
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:25,920

 

6629
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:41,190

Good.

6630
02:44:41,190 --> 02:44:41,200

 

6631
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:44,630

All right. I think they want this.

6632
02:44:44,630 --> 02:44:44,640
All right. I think they want this.
 

6633
02:44:44,640 --> 02:44:46,469
All right. I think they want this.
I can't believe they're going to do it

6634
02:44:46,469 --> 02:44:46,479
I can't believe they're going to do it
 

6635
02:44:46,479 --> 02:44:49,830
I can't believe they're going to do it
in one session. It's so impressive. I

6636
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:49,840
in one session. It's so impressive. I
 

6637
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:52,550
in one session. It's so impressive. I
Yeah, I think four

6638
02:44:52,550 --> 02:44:52,560
Yeah, I think four
 

6639
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:54,469
Yeah, I think four
4 I just want to make sure this is

6640
02:44:54,469 --> 02:44:54,479
4 I just want to make sure this is
 

6641
02:44:54,479 --> 02:44:56,389
4 I just want to make sure this is
right.

6642
02:44:56,389 --> 02:44:56,399
right.
 

6643
02:44:56,399 --> 02:44:59,110
right.
This 440 I think 440 is the kind of

6644
02:44:59,110 --> 02:44:59,120
This 440 I think 440 is the kind of
 

6645
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:01,269
This 440 I think 440 is the kind of
target.

6646
02:45:01,269 --> 02:45:01,279
target.
 

6647
02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:04,309
target.
I think it might be the target. Uh that

6648
02:45:04,309 --> 02:45:04,319
I think it might be the target. Uh that
 

6649
02:45:04,319 --> 02:45:06,950
I think it might be the target. Uh that
will be

6650
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:06,960
will be
 

6651
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:09,269
will be
insane to do that in in one day. It's a

6652
02:45:09,269 --> 02:45:09,279
insane to do that in in one day. It's a
 

6653
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:11,830
insane to do that in in one day. It's a
really impressive move. Uh the the node

6654
02:45:11,830 --> 02:45:11,840
really impressive move. Uh the the node
 

6655
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:13,429
really impressive move. Uh the the node
starts we're already coming into the

6656
02:45:13,429 --> 02:45:13,439
starts we're already coming into the
 

6657
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:15,349
starts we're already coming into the
start of that node. I'll show you what

6658
02:45:15,349 --> 02:45:15,359
start of that node. I'll show you what
 

6659
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:18,389
start of that node. I'll show you what
I'm looking at. Uh

6660
02:45:18,389 --> 02:45:18,399
I'm looking at. Uh
 

6661
02:45:18,399 --> 02:45:19,750
I'm looking at. Uh
right, we're coming into the start of

6662
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:19,760
right, we're coming into the start of
 

6663
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:21,910
right, we're coming into the start of
this node here. This is previous week

6664
02:45:21,910 --> 02:45:21,920
this node here. This is previous week
 

6665
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:24,309
this node here. This is previous week
value area high. If we find acceptance

6666
02:45:24,309 --> 02:45:24,319
value area high. If we find acceptance
 

6667
02:45:24,319 --> 02:45:27,349
value area high. If we find acceptance
over this, right, and we start basing

6668
02:45:27,349 --> 02:45:27,359
over this, right, and we start basing
 

6669
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:29,429
over this, right, and we start basing
this will all become trapped and we will

6670
02:45:29,429 --> 02:45:29,439
this will all become trapped and we will
 

6671
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:32,309
this will all become trapped and we will
fill this thing in very very quickly,

6672
02:45:32,309 --> 02:45:32,319
fill this thing in very very quickly,
 

6673
02:45:32,319 --> 02:45:33,429
fill this thing in very very quickly,
right?

6674
02:45:33,429 --> 02:45:33,439
right?
 

6675
02:45:33,439 --> 02:45:35,269
right?
If we find acceptance over this, I don't

6676
02:45:35,269 --> 02:45:35,279
If we find acceptance over this, I don't
 

6677
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:37,110
If we find acceptance over this, I don't
think today, tomorrow, Wednesday, this

6678
02:45:37,110 --> 02:45:37,120
think today, tomorrow, Wednesday, this
 

6679
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:39,510
think today, tomorrow, Wednesday, this
move here can happen. This is why I said

6680
02:45:39,510 --> 02:45:39,520
move here can happen. This is why I said
 

6681
02:45:39,520 --> 02:45:40,790
move here can happen. This is why I said
at the very start of the day, I would

6682
02:45:40,790 --> 02:45:40,800
at the very start of the day, I would
 

6683
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:43,429
at the very start of the day, I would
expect this level here, it to at least

6684
02:45:43,429 --> 02:45:43,439
expect this level here, it to at least
 

6685
02:45:43,439 --> 02:45:45,990
expect this level here, it to at least
reject down into this.

6686
02:45:45,990 --> 02:45:46,000
reject down into this.
 

6687
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:49,030
reject down into this.
I think this is a force up

6688
02:45:49,030 --> 02:45:49,040
I think this is a force up
 

6689
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:51,670
I think this is a force up
cuz it's too it's too much too quick

6690
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:51,680
cuz it's too it's too much too quick
 

6691
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:54,870
cuz it's too it's too much too quick
into too much of a giant giant giant

6692
02:45:54,870 --> 02:45:54,880
into too much of a giant giant giant
 

6693
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:56,389
into too much of a giant giant giant
level.

6694
02:45:56,389 --> 02:45:56,399
level.
 

6695
02:45:56,399 --> 02:45:59,349
level.
So, I'd expect a pullback soon. I'm

6696
02:45:59,349 --> 02:45:59,359
So, I'd expect a pullback soon. I'm
 

6697
02:45:59,359 --> 02:46:00,950
So, I'd expect a pullback soon. I'm
surprised they haven't already done it,

6698
02:46:00,950 --> 02:46:00,960
surprised they haven't already done it,
 

6699
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:02,870
surprised they haven't already done it,
but uh

6700
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:02,880
but uh
 

6701
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:05,429
but uh
they haven't. It's really impressive.

6702
02:46:05,429 --> 02:46:05,439
they haven't. It's really impressive.
 

6703
02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:07,590
they haven't. It's really impressive.
All right, let's do an Apex giveaway or

6704
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:07,600
All right, let's do an Apex giveaway or
 

6705
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:09,269
All right, let's do an Apex giveaway or
should we wait to see if the short comes

6706
02:46:09,269 --> 02:46:09,279
should we wait to see if the short comes
 

6707
02:46:09,279 --> 02:46:11,110
should we wait to see if the short comes
to us first? Maybe I could do the Apex

6708
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:11,120

6709
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:12,550
to us first? Maybe I could do the Apex
giveaway first. Hopefully, we don't miss

6710
02:46:12,550 --> 02:46:12,560
giveaway first. Hopefully, we don't miss
 

6711
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:22,550
giveaway first. Hopefully, we don't miss
the short.

02:46:30,790 --> 02:46:30,800
impressed that this hasn't done a
 

6721
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:33,269
impressed that this hasn't done a
rotation day. Wow, this is caught me off

6722
02:46:33,269 --> 02:46:33,279
rotation day. Wow, this is caught me off
 

6723
02:46:33,279 --> 02:46:34,389
rotation day. Wow, this is caught me off
guard. It's not what I thought we'd do

6724
02:46:34,389 --> 02:46:34,399
guard. It's not what I thought we'd do

out up here. This is just a trend day at
 

6763
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:34,790

the moment without a pullback.

6764

moment is yes, but sellers just came in

7032
02:55:41,269 --> 02:55:41,279
moment is yes, but sellers just came in
 

7033
02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:44,469
moment is yes, but sellers just came in
at 95 and got absorbed again. Again,

7034
02:55:44,469 --> 02:55:44,479
at 95 and got absorbed again. Again,
 

7035
02:55:44,479 --> 02:55:46,550
at 95 and got absorbed again. Again,
there's still someone absorbing the

there's still someone absorbing the
 

7037
02:55:46,560 --> 02:55:49,349
there's still someone absorbing the

tape. Even up here this high, there is
 

7039
02:55:49,359 --> 02:55:51,190
tape. Even up here this high, there is
someone who just absorbed that tape

7040
02:55:51,190 --> 02:55:51,200
someone who just absorbed that tape
 

7041
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:52,950
someone who just absorbed that tape
again. Look, the sellers just came in

7042
02:55:52,950 --> 02:55:52,960
again. Look, the sellers just came in
 

7043
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:55,429

and got absorbed again. We have to
 

7045
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:59,190
and got absorbed again. We have to
respect this zone.

7046
02:55:59,190 --> 02:55:59,200
respect this zone.
 

7047
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:01,510

02:56:19,750 --> 02:56:19,760
This is where the sellers keep getting
 

7055
02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:21,830
This is where the sellers keep getting
caught under 400s. Do we get more

7056
02:56:21,830 --> 02:56:21,840
caught under 400s. Do we get more
 

7057
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:24,150
caught under 400s. Do we get more
aggressive here and do we trade and

aggressive here and do we trade and
 

7059
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:26,710
aggressive here and do we trade and

7060
02:56:26,710 --> 02:56:26,720
leave 95s? I would have to respect 90
 

7061

7065
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:33,429
short comes underneath all of this. This
is gross, man. The way they've set this

7066
02:56:33,429 --> 02:56:33,439
is gross, man. The way they've set this
 

7067
02:56:33,439 --> 02:56:35,990
is gross, man. The way they've set this
up is [\h__\h] awful for a short. They've

7068
02:56:35,990 --> 02:56:36,000
up is [\h__\h] awful for a short. They've
 

7069
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,070
up is [\h__\h] awful for a short. They've
set so many support systems for it. I

7070
02:56:38,070 --> 02:56:38,080
set so many support systems for it. I
 

7071
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:41,110
set so many support systems for it. I
don't like it.

7072
02:56:41,110 --> 02:56:41,120
don't like it.
 

7073
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:42,550
don't like it.
They've made sure there's nodes

7074
02:56:42,550 --> 02:56:42,560

All I can think of is they have to get

7102
02:57:32,790 --> 02:57:32,800
All I can think of is they have to get
 

7103
02:57:32,800 --> 02:57:35,269
All I can think of is they have to get
up here to get out. It's clearly what

7104
02:57:35,269 --> 02:57:35,279
up here to get out. It's clearly what
 

7105
02:57:35,279 --> 02:57:37,349
up here to get out. It's clearly what
they've decided at the moment. Unless we

7106
02:57:37,349 --> 02:57:37,359
they've decided at the moment. Unless we
 

7107
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:39,750
they've decided at the moment. Unless we
start closing under 95s on SPY and under

02:57:39,750 --> 02:57:39,760
start closing under 95s on SPY and under
 

7109
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:42,150
start closing under 95s on SPY and under
15s. I mean, we're already almost at 16s

7110
02:57:42,150 --> 02:57:42,160
15s. I mean, we're already almost at 16s

Flip the point of control. That's not
 

7123
02:57:57,279 --> 02:57:59,269
Flip the point of control. That's not
good for for buyers. If we start

7124
02:57:59,269 --> 02:57:59,279
good for for buyers. If we start
 

7125
02:57:59,279 --> 02:58:00,790
good for for buyers. If we start
flipping all of this now, that's really

7126
02:58:00,790 --> 02:58:00,800
flipping all of this now, that's really
 

7127
02:58:00,800 --> 02:58:03,190
flipping all of this now, that's really
bad for buyers. This becomes possible if

7128
02:58:03,190 --> 02:58:03,200
bad for buyers. This becomes possible if
 

7129
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:05,670
bad for buyers. This becomes possible if
we start flipping all of this.

7130
02:58:05,670 --> 02:58:05,680
we start flipping all of this.

There's so much volume up here now. We
flip PC. That's not a good look for

flip PC. That's not a good look for
 

7135
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:11,830
flip PC. That's not a good look for
buyers. If the sellers want to come in

7136
02:58:11,830 --> 02:58:11,840
buyers. If the sellers want to come in
 

7137
02:58:11,840 --> 02:58:13,990

here and actually do something, they've

7139
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:18,309
here and actually do something, they've
got a shot.

7140

7141
02:58:18,319 --> 02:58:21,990

7143
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,910

I'm so iffy about taking this because

7148
02:58:27,910 --> 02:58:27,920
scalps is not going to be very good. But
 

7149
02:58:27,920 --> 02:58:31,349
scalps is not going to be very good. But
if they let it go, it would be amazing.

7150
02:58:31,349 --> 02:58:31,359
if they let it go, it would be amazing.
 

7151
02:58:31,359 --> 02:58:36,630

03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:20,630
tomorrow afternoon. Today in the
afternoon, we can see what we get in

7232
03:00:20,630 --> 03:00:20,640
afternoon, we can see what we get in
 

7233
03:00:20,640 --> 03:00:22,150
afternoon, we can see what we get in
Discord. Sorry, tomorrow morning. I'll

7234
03:00:22,150 --> 03:00:22,160
Discord. Sorry, tomorrow morning. I'll
 

7235
03:00:22,160 --> 03:00:24,870
Discord. Sorry, tomorrow morning. I'll
be back. And here we go. They're still

7236
03:00:24,870 --> 03:00:24,880
be back. And here we go. They're still
 

7237
03:00:24,880 --> 03:00:27,269
be back. And here we go. They're still
going for more. They are just adamant.

7238
03:00:27,269 --> 03:00:27,279
going for more. They are just adamant.
 

7239
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:30,309
going for more. They are just adamant.
They cannot let this thing go. They have

7240
03:00:30,309 --> 03:00:30,319
They cannot let this thing go. They have
 

7241
03:00:30,319 --> 03:00:32,150
They cannot let this thing go. They have
to get up here. It's clearly they've

7242
03:00:32,150 --> 03:00:32,160
to get up here. It's clearly they've
 

7243
03:00:32,160 --> 03:00:34,070
to get up here. It's clearly they've
decided they have to get that level to

7244
03:00:34,070 --> 03:00:34,080
decided they have to get that level to
 

7245
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:37,429
decided they have to get that level to
get out. It's just it must they must be

7246
03:00:37,429 --> 03:00:37,439
get out. It's just it must they must be
 

7247
03:00:37,439 --> 03:00:39,830
get out. It's just it must they must be
stuck up there and they need to go and

7248
03:00:39,830 --> 03:00:39,840
stuck up there and they need to go and
 

7249
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:42,630
stuck up there and they need to go and
revisit it. That's all I can think of.

7250
03:00:42,630 --> 03:00:42,640
revisit it. That's all I can think of.
 

7251
03:00:42,640 --> 03:00:45,510
revisit it. That's all I can think of.
Um I don't mind because we're now up

7252
03:00:45,510 --> 03:00:45,520
Um I don't mind because we're now up
 

7253
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:48,230
Um I don't mind because we're now up
11.26% on the day on Oracle alone on the

7254
03:00:48,230 --> 03:00:48,240
11.26% on the day on Oracle alone on the
 

7255
03:00:48,240 --> 03:00:50,630
11.26% on the day on Oracle alone on the
day. So, I'm not I'm not totally against

7256
03:00:50,630 --> 03:00:50,640
day. So, I'm not I'm not totally against
 

7257
03:00:50,640 --> 03:00:56,389
day. So, I'm not I'm not totally against
it.

7258
03:00:56,389 --> 03:00:56,399

 

7259
03:00:56,399 --> 03:00:57,990

Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I think I

7260
03:00:57,990 --> 03:00:58,000
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I think I
 

7261
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:59,429
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I think I
think they're probably it's not even

7262
03:00:59,429 --> 03:00:59,439
think they're probably it's not even
 

7263
03:00:59,439 --> 03:01:00,950
think they're probably it's not even
about the d-risk. I think they're

7264
03:01:00,950 --> 03:01:00,960
about the d-risk. I think they're
 

7265
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:03,990
about the d-risk. I think they're
probably like they're caught offside.

7266
03:01:03,990 --> 03:01:04,000
probably like they're caught offside.
 

7267
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,510
probably like they're caught offside.
So, they're bidding back up to get out

7268
03:01:05,510 --> 03:01:05,520
So, they're bidding back up to get out
 

7269
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:06,870
So, they're bidding back up to get out
of where they need to get out and then

7270
03:01:06,870 --> 03:01:06,880
of where they need to get out and then
 

7271
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:09,830
of where they need to get out and then
they can at that point their d-risk will

7272
03:01:09,830 --> 03:01:09,840
they can at that point their d-risk will
 

7273
03:01:09,840 --> 03:01:11,750
they can at that point their d-risk will
be when they get out, right? So, they

7274
03:01:11,750 --> 03:01:11,760
be when they get out, right? So, they
 

7275
03:01:11,760 --> 03:01:14,070
be when they get out, right? So, they
can derisk up here. If we think about

7276
03:01:14,070 --> 03:01:14,080
can derisk up here. If we think about
 

7277
03:01:14,080 --> 03:01:16,870
can derisk up here. If we think about
this,

7278
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:16,880
this,
 

7279
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:19,190
this,
if we go to like a 15 minute or

7280
03:01:19,190 --> 03:01:19,200
if we go to like a 15 minute or
 

7281
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:22,230
if we go to like a 15 minute or
something. All right. So once

7282
03:01:22,230 --> 03:01:22,240
something. All right. So once
 

7283
03:01:22,240 --> 03:01:24,710
something. All right. So once
once we left this huge value area which

7284
03:01:24,710 --> 03:01:24,720
once we left this huge value area which
 

7285
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:28,309
once we left this huge value area which
is what like 8 weeks long right and

7286
03:01:28,309 --> 03:01:28,319
is what like 8 weeks long right and
 

7287
03:01:28,319 --> 03:01:31,830
is what like 8 weeks long right and
washed right if they are offside in here

7288
03:01:31,830 --> 03:01:31,840
washed right if they are offside in here
 

7289
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:34,230
washed right if they are offside in here
they can force this aggressive move to

7290
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:34,240
they can force this aggressive move to
 

7291
03:01:34,240 --> 03:01:36,550
they can force this aggressive move to
derisk here and then get this play back

7292
03:01:36,550 --> 03:01:36,560
derisk here and then get this play back
 

7293
03:01:36,560 --> 03:01:38,309
derisk here and then get this play back
down and then rebid it back up if they

7294
03:01:38,309 --> 03:01:38,319
down and then rebid it back up if they
 

7295
03:01:38,319 --> 03:01:40,469
down and then rebid it back up if they
want. The fact that we haven't washed at

7296
03:01:40,469 --> 03:01:40,479
want. The fact that we haven't washed at
 

7297
03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:43,269
want. The fact that we haven't washed at
all into this it is a forced move.

7298
03:01:43,269 --> 03:01:43,279
all into this it is a forced move.
 

7299
03:01:43,279 --> 03:01:45,269
all into this it is a forced move.
There's no doubt about it. It's a forced

7300
03:01:45,269 --> 03:01:45,279
There's no doubt about it. It's a forced
 

7301
03:01:45,279 --> 03:01:47,349
There's no doubt about it. It's a forced
move up and I would not be surprised if

7302
03:01:47,349 --> 03:01:47,359
move up and I would not be surprised if
 

7303
03:01:47,359 --> 03:01:49,269
move up and I would not be surprised if
we do this if the backside of this week

7304
03:01:49,269 --> 03:01:49,279
we do this if the backside of this week
 

7305
03:01:49,279 --> 03:01:51,110
we do this if the backside of this week
becomes very very aggressive to the

7306
03:01:51,110 --> 03:01:51,120
becomes very very aggressive to the
 

7307
03:01:51,120 --> 03:01:53,510
becomes very very aggressive to the
downside. Wouldn't surprise me in the

7308
03:01:53,510 --> 03:01:53,520
downside. Wouldn't surprise me in the
 

7309
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:56,630
downside. Wouldn't surprise me in the
slightest. Not in the slightest. All
