1
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,870

Morning everyone.

2
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
Morning everyone.
 

3
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,950
Morning everyone.
Back at it. Back at it. Two more days

4
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
Back at it. Back at it. Two more days
 

5
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,749
Back at it. Back at it. Two more days
left. Two more days left until the

6
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
left. Two more days left until the
 

7
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,590
left. Two more days left until the
holidays. Right. So today it means we're

8
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
holidays. Right. So today it means we're
 

9
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,270
holidays. Right. So today it means we're
probably expecting some lighter volume

10
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
probably expecting some lighter volume
 

11
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,189
probably expecting some lighter volume
the next few days. Uh last time we had

12
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
the next few days. Uh last time we had
 

13
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,510
the next few days. Uh last time we had
this, we obviously had a drift up for oh

14
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
this, we obviously had a drift up for oh
 

15
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,189
this, we obviously had a drift up for oh
quite a few days really when we think

16
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
quite a few days really when we think
 

17
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,590
quite a few days really when we think
about what we did over the holiday

18
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
about what we did over the holiday
 

19
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,749
about what we did over the holiday
season in November. One, two, three,

20
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
season in November. One, two, three,
 

21
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,909
season in November. One, two, three,
four, five, five days straight up and

22
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
four, five, five days straight up and
 

23
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,510
four, five, five days straight up and
then a little bit more of a drift after.

24
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
then a little bit more of a drift after.
 

25
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,990
then a little bit more of a drift after.
So be careful. Be careful with this

26
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
So be careful. Be careful with this
 

27
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,510
So be careful. Be careful with this
light volume. All right, you want to be

28
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
light volume. All right, you want to be
 

29
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,590
light volume. All right, you want to be
careful with your position sizing and

30
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
careful with your position sizing and
 

31
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,469
careful with your position sizing and
your risk tolerance. Might see just slow

32
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
your risk tolerance. Might see just slow
 

33
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,710
your risk tolerance. Might see just slow
drift. Might see the odd flush. Uh let's

34
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
drift. Might see the odd flush. Uh let's
 

35
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,350
drift. Might see the odd flush. Uh let's
just refresh this while uh trading

36
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
just refresh this while uh trading
 

37
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,189
just refresh this while uh trading
restarts the day. Going mental.

38
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199

 

39
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,110

Still doesn't like it. Anyway, starting

40
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
Still doesn't like it. Anyway, starting
 

41
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,870
Still doesn't like it. Anyway, starting
off on the daily. Okay, you can see nice

42
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
off on the daily. Okay, you can see nice
 

43
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,469
off on the daily. Okay, you can see nice
big gap up today right over uh Friday's

44
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
big gap up today right over uh Friday's
 

45
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,950
big gap up today right over uh Friday's
close. We're importantly over this low

46
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
close. We're importantly over this low
 

47
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,270
close. We're importantly over this low
volume node. That's the one important

48
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
volume node. That's the one important
 

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,990
volume node. That's the one important
thing that bulls needed to try and do um

50
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
thing that bulls needed to try and do um
 

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,830
thing that bulls needed to try and do um
early which they've done. Why is that

52
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
early which they've done. Why is that
 

53
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,150
early which they've done. Why is that
important? Well, we can use this now as

54
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
important? Well, we can use this now as
 

55
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,749
important? Well, we can use this now as
potentially support. All right, so we've

56
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
potentially support. All right, so we've
 

57
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,070
potentially support. All right, so we've
got 20-day and 50-day there. Any

58
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
got 20-day and 50-day there. Any
 

59
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,790
got 20-day and 50-day there. Any
pullback into there, we want to see, do

60
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
pullback into there, we want to see, do
 

61
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,270
pullback into there, we want to see, do
buyers come in somewhere in this area

62
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
buyers come in somewhere in this area
 

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,990
buyers come in somewhere in this area
and try and get back into this balance.

64
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
and try and get back into this balance.
 

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,189
and try and get back into this balance.
All right, this is what we've been

66
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
All right, this is what we've been
 

67
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,550
All right, this is what we've been
talking about for a while. Notice uh the

68
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
talking about for a while. Notice uh the
 

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,310
talking about for a while. Notice uh the
daily Ballinger bands, right? We talked

70
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
daily Ballinger bands, right? We talked
 

71
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,550
daily Ballinger bands, right? We talked
about this as well. They're starting to

72
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
about this as well. They're starting to
 

73
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,790
about this as well. They're starting to
contract, right? We're starting to see

74
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
contract, right? We're starting to see
 

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,830
contract, right? We're starting to see
contraction as we get the moving

76
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
contraction as we get the moving
 

77
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,310
contraction as we get the moving
averages tight. It means that probably

78
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:56,320
averages tight. It means that probably
 

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,150
averages tight. It means that probably
probably more likely into next year, but

80
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
probably more likely into next year, but
 

81
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,230
probably more likely into next year, but
we'll see. We're going to see something

82
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
we'll see. We're going to see something
 

83
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,150
we'll see. We're going to see something
like this. Something drastic is going to

84
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
like this. Something drastic is going to
 

85
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,950
like this. Something drastic is going to
happen. We cannot stay pinned in for too

86
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
happen. We cannot stay pinned in for too
 

87
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,710
happen. We cannot stay pinned in for too
long. We have lots of highs up here to

88
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
long. We have lots of highs up here to
 

89
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,629
long. We have lots of highs up here to
run. If bulls do manage to hold a

90
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
run. If bulls do manage to hold a
 

91
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,110
run. If bulls do manage to hold a
pullback, build liquidity, and go again.

92
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
pullback, build liquidity, and go again.
 

93
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,110
pullback, build liquidity, and go again.
If we get that rally, whether it's this

94
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
If we get that rally, whether it's this
 

95
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,629
If we get that rally, whether it's this
side of the year or ne next side of the

96
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
side of the year or ne next side of the
 

97
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,870
side of the year or ne next side of the
year, we have liquidity to aim for, but

98
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
year, we have liquidity to aim for, but
 

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,150
year, we have liquidity to aim for, but
they're going to have to get back above

100
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
they're going to have to get back above
 

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,870
they're going to have to get back above
this. If this is nothing more than a

102
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
this. If this is nothing more than a
 

103
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,309
this. If this is nothing more than a
failed push, then we're going to expect

104
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
failed push, then we're going to expect
 

105
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,909
failed push, then we're going to expect
sellers to defend this range, right? So,

106
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
sellers to defend this range, right? So,
 

107
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,189
sellers to defend this range, right? So,
it's interesting that we're doing it

108
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
it's interesting that we're doing it
 

109
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,790
it's interesting that we're doing it
this type of this time of year because

110
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
this type of this time of year because
 

111
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,909
this type of this time of year because
there might be that there's less

112
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
there might be that there's less
 

113
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,510
there might be that there's less
participants up there, but we will see.

114
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
participants up there, but we will see.
 

115
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,350
participants up there, but we will see.
So, initially,

116
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
So, initially,
 

117
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,749
So, initially,
um, momentum pretty bullish off the back

118
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
um, momentum pretty bullish off the back
 

119
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,270
um, momentum pretty bullish off the back
of last week, off the close of last

120
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
of last week, off the close of last
 

121
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,189
of last week, off the close of last
week. We just need to think about the

122
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
week. We just need to think about the
 

123
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,110
week. We just need to think about the
range that we're starting to get into

124
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
range that we're starting to get into
 

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,029
range that we're starting to get into
right here. You can see we're we're

126
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
right here. You can see we're we're
 

127
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,189
right here. You can see we're we're
starting to lose location. It's swing

128
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
starting to lose location. It's swing
 

129
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,510
starting to lose location. It's swing
bulls that have the most fun right here.

130
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
bulls that have the most fun right here.
 

131
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,590
bulls that have the most fun right here.
And uh even something like this if we

132
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:49,600
And uh even something like this if we
 

133
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,309
And uh even something like this if we
just wanted to measure out Monday.

134
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
just wanted to measure out Monday.
 

135
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,110
just wanted to measure out Monday.
Let's just do that whole balance.

136
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
Let's just do that whole balance.
 

137
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,710
Let's just do that whole balance.
Okay, there you go. So this is like a

138
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
Okay, there you go. So this is like a
 

139
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,870
Okay, there you go. So this is like a
two week balance. Um what contract is

140
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
two week balance. Um what contract is
 

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,550
two week balance. Um what contract is
this? NQ1. So it should have it all.

142
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
this? NQ1. So it should have it all.
 

143
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,150
this? NQ1. So it should have it all.
Just be careful by the way folks if

144
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
Just be careful by the way folks if
 

145
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,589
Just be careful by the way folks if
you're measuring balance on the new

146
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
you're measuring balance on the new
 

147
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,510
you're measuring balance on the new
contract up here. You're probably going

148
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
contract up here. You're probably going
 

149
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,909
contract up here. You're probably going
to get incorrect uh figures because

150
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
to get incorrect uh figures because
 

151
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,510
to get incorrect uh figures because
obviously when we were trading the new

152
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
obviously when we were trading the new
 

153
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,950
obviously when we were trading the new
contract, we weren't trading up here. We

154
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
contract, we weren't trading up here. We
 

155
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,790
contract, we weren't trading up here. We
hadn't rolled over. So it' be very light

156
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
hadn't rolled over. So it' be very light
 

157
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,629
hadn't rolled over. So it' be very light
volume. So it might give you odd prints.

158
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
volume. So it might give you odd prints.
 

159
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,550
volume. So it might give you odd prints.
So just be aware of that. You need to be

160
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
So just be aware of that. You need to be
 

161
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,430
So just be aware of that. You need to be
measuring out the old contract. [sighs]

162
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
measuring out the old contract. [sighs]
 

163
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,870
measuring out the old contract. [sighs]
Okay. So that's the range we're looking

164
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
Okay. So that's the range we're looking
 

165
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,710
Okay. So that's the range we're looking
at. Um can we hold acceptance into 700s

166
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:26,720
at. Um can we hold acceptance into 700s
 

167
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,110
at. Um can we hold acceptance into 700s
and 600s? Can we get up into this old

168
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
and 600s? Can we get up into this old
 

169
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,510
and 600s? Can we get up into this old
point of control in towards the 900s?

170
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
point of control in towards the 900s?
 

171
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,110
point of control in towards the 900s?
How do we react when we get there?

172
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
How do we react when we get there?
 

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,710
How do we react when we get there?
That's the big question this morning. So

174
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
That's the big question this morning. So
 

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,629
That's the big question this morning. So
is it a push and fail for a pullback and

176
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
is it a push and fail for a pullback and
 

177
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,550
is it a push and fail for a pullback and
we hold this old rotation? Is it a

178
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
we hold this old rotation? Is it a
 

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,950
we hold this old rotation? Is it a
morning flush which gets absorbed? Or is

180
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
morning flush which gets absorbed? Or is
 

181
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,629
morning flush which gets absorbed? Or is
it neither of those and just a slow

182
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
it neither of those and just a slow
 

183
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,629
it neither of those and just a slow
grind and and drift higher? We will see.

184
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
grind and and drift higher? We will see.
 

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,629
grind and and drift higher? We will see.
Time will tell. But those are all

186
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
Time will tell. But those are all
 

187
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,110
Time will tell. But those are all
possible today. [snorts] Moving into

188
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
possible today. [snorts] Moving into
 

189
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,350
possible today. [snorts] Moving into
the higher well the the hourly. We can

190
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
the higher well the the hourly. We can
 

191
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,950
the higher well the the hourly. We can
have a look at what we looked at what we

192
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
have a look at what we looked at what we
 

193
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,869
have a look at what we looked at what we
saw on the hourly. Let me just make this

194
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
saw on the hourly. Let me just make this
 

195
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,830
saw on the hourly. Let me just make this
a bit bigger for you and pull this down.

196
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
a bit bigger for you and pull this down.
 

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,589
a bit bigger for you and pull this down.
I hate it when the trading view mouse

198
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
I hate it when the trading view mouse
 

199
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,790
I hate it when the trading view mouse
mouse does this. Very annoying. Right.

200
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
mouse does this. Very annoying. Right.
 

201
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,390
mouse does this. Very annoying. Right.
So you can see old week's value. Um

202
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
So you can see old week's value. Um
 

203
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,150
So you can see old week's value. Um
probably need to take that off

204
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
probably need to take that off
 

205
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,950
probably need to take that off
extending. There we go. And let's pull

206
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
extending. There we go. And let's pull
 

207
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,830
extending. There we go. And let's pull
that

208
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
that
 

209
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,150
that
into Friday.

210
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
into Friday.
 

211
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,189
into Friday.
There we go. All right. Old week's value

212
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
There we go. All right. Old week's value
 

213
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,309
There we go. All right. Old week's value
left below. So, we're gapping up over uh

214
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
left below. So, we're gapping up over uh
 

215
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,230
left below. So, we're gapping up over uh
previous week, which is strong, but

216
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
previous week, which is strong, but
 

217
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,070
previous week, which is strong, but
we're coming into that two week balance

218
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
we're coming into that two week balance
 

219
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,670
we're coming into that two week balance
range. All right. So, remember this. So,

220
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
range. All right. So, remember this. So,
 

221
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,790
range. All right. So, remember this. So,
we've effectively got balance in here,

222
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
we've effectively got balance in here,
 

223
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,589
we've effectively got balance in here,
point of control, an old PC around uh

224
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
point of control, an old PC around uh
 

225
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,509
point of control, an old PC around uh
what did we just say it was? Let me just

226
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
what did we just say it was? Let me just
 

227
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,990
what did we just say it was? Let me just
check that. Lost it. I think it's about

228
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
check that. Lost it. I think it's about
 

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,590
check that. Lost it. I think it's about
just inside of 900. One second. So,

230
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
just inside of 900. One second. So,
 

231
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,470
just inside of 900. One second. So,
let's just get this on to make sure when

232
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
let's just get this on to make sure when
 

233
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,070
let's just get this on to make sure when
we go from Monday to Friday

234
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
we go from Monday to Friday
 

235
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,030
we go from Monday to Friday
923. And if we extend that to a two week

236
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
923. And if we extend that to a two week
 

237
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,710
923. And if we extend that to a two week
balance,

238
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
balance,
 

239
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,590
balance,
yeah, 9 uh 8

240
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
yeah, 9 uh 8
 

241
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,430
yeah, 9 uh 8
8.90 to 923. So, we're just going to

242
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
8.90 to 923. So, we're just going to
 

243
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,070
8.90 to 923. So, we're just going to
mark that out really quickly in here.

244
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
mark that out really quickly in here.
 

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:14,790
mark that out really quickly in here.
8.90 to 923.

246
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800

 

247
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,630

somewhere in here, right? Is an old PC

248
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
somewhere in here, right? Is an old PC
 

249
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,150
somewhere in here, right? Is an old PC
naked,

250
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
naked,
 

251
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,590
naked,
right? Since we left it. So, we're

252
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
right? Since we left it. So, we're
 

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,230
right? Since we left it. So, we're
watching that, right? Gapping up over

254
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
watching that, right? Gapping up over
 

255
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,590
watching that, right? Gapping up over
the previous week, which is strong,

256
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
the previous week, which is strong,
 

257
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,509
the previous week, which is strong,
drifting higher. Tech's had a pretty

258
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
drifting higher. Tech's had a pretty
 

259
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,829
drifting higher. Tech's had a pretty
good start to the session. Uh you would

260
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
good start to the session. Uh you would
 

261
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,110
good start to the session. Uh you would
have seen uh well, the curve in Japan

262
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
have seen uh well, the curve in Japan
 

263
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,590
have seen uh well, the curve in Japan
doesn't look good, but hey, but we're

264
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
doesn't look good, but hey, but we're
 

265
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,030
doesn't look good, but hey, but we're
not reacting to it. Like I said, it

266
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
not reacting to it. Like I said, it
 

267
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,110
not reacting to it. Like I said, it
might be a very, very crowded trade that

268
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
might be a very, very crowded trade that
 

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,710
might be a very, very crowded trade that
takes a while to set up. It has

270
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
takes a while to set up. It has
 

271
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,470
takes a while to set up. It has
historically taken a while to set up. It

272
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
historically taken a while to set up. It
 

273
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,670
historically taken a while to set up. It
doesn't always happen straight out the

274
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
doesn't always happen straight out the
 

275
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,949
doesn't always happen straight out the
boat, especially when we're expecting

276
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
boat, especially when we're expecting
 

277
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,590
boat, especially when we're expecting
it. So, let's see if price drifts into

278
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
it. So, let's see if price drifts into
 

279
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,949
it. So, let's see if price drifts into
here. All right, let's see if price

280
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
here. All right, let's see if price
 

281
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,550
here. All right, let's see if price
drifts in. Let's see if we pop and fail

282
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
drifts in. Let's see if we pop and fail
 

283
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,150
drifts in. Let's see if we pop and fail
this morning, come back and test old

284
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
this morning, come back and test old
 

285
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,389
this morning, come back and test old
value. If we do fail without a pop,

286
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
value. If we do fail without a pop,
 

287
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,310
value. If we do fail without a pop,
let's see if we hold value and then try

288
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
let's see if we hold value and then try
 

289
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,670
let's see if we hold value and then try
and go higher. And that will be the same

290
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
and go higher. And that will be the same
 

291
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,430
and go higher. And that will be the same
for the next few days, unless we close

292
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
for the next few days, unless we close
 

293
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,269
for the next few days, unless we close
well outside. All right, so that's what

294
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
well outside. All right, so that's what
 

295
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,990
well outside. All right, so that's what
I'm watching at. Do we hold value for a

296
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm watching at. Do we hold value for a
 

297
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,990
I'm watching at. Do we hold value for a
drive higher? Do we reject the old

298
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
drive higher? Do we reject the old
 

299
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,910
drive higher? Do we reject the old
balance? All right, a push in which

300
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
balance? All right, a push in which
 

301
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,150
balance? All right, a push in which
failed backto back test the old value or

302
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
failed backto back test the old value or
 

303
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,150
failed backto back test the old value or
are we just going to drift in here?

304
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
are we just going to drift in here?
 

305
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,590
are we just going to drift in here?
Right. Are we going to drift in here and

306
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
Right. Are we going to drift in here and
 

307
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,910
Right. Are we going to drift in here and
just do nothing? Also very possible.

308
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
just do nothing? Also very possible.
 

309
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,590
just do nothing? Also very possible.
It's what we did before. It's what we

310
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
It's what we did before. It's what we
 

311
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,829
It's what we did before. It's what we
could do again. All right, let's have a

312
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
could do again. All right, let's have a
 

313
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,670
could do again. All right, let's have a
look at overnight. You can see what's

314
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
look at overnight. You can see what's
 

315
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,590
look at overnight. You can see what's
happened here. Here's the cash gap right

316
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
happened here. Here's the cash gap right
 

317
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,630
happened here. Here's the cash gap right
all the way down here. Nice big gap up

318
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
all the way down here. Nice big gap up
 

319
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,230
all the way down here. Nice big gap up
and just a drift higher. We haven't

320
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
and just a drift higher. We haven't
 

321
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,069
and just a drift higher. We haven't
washed anyone out. I'd be slightly

322
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
washed anyone out. I'd be slightly
 

323
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,430
washed anyone out. I'd be slightly
concerned about that. It's not an

324
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
concerned about that. It's not an
 

325
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,150
concerned about that. It's not an
automatically short, but we are somewhat

326
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
automatically short, but we are somewhat
 

327
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,670
automatically short, but we are somewhat
extended. All right, we're trying to

328
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
extended. All right, we're trying to
 

329
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,230
extended. All right, we're trying to
drive into here, but uh you know all

330
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
drive into here, but uh you know all
 

331
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,870
drive into here, but uh you know all
these players, anyone who was long

332
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
these players, anyone who was long
 

333
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,790
these players, anyone who was long
Thursday, Friday, last week swing.

334
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
Thursday, Friday, last week swing.
 

335
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,870
Thursday, Friday, last week swing.
Anyone who bought the open of the new

336
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
Anyone who bought the open of the new
 

337
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,509
Anyone who bought the open of the new
session, anyone who has bought in Asia

338
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
session, anyone who has bought in Asia
 

339
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,590
session, anyone who has bought in Asia
or in London has been left in the money.

340
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
or in London has been left in the money.
 

341
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,509
or in London has been left in the money.
We have not washed anyone out. Doesn't

342
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
We have not washed anyone out. Doesn't
 

343
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,269
We have not washed anyone out. Doesn't
mean we have to do it today. Maybe we do

344
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
mean we have to do it today. Maybe we do
 

345
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,030
mean we have to do it today. Maybe we do
it tomorrow. Maybe we save all of that

346
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
it tomorrow. Maybe we save all of that
 

347
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,790
it tomorrow. Maybe we save all of that
for post Christmas. I don't know. Maybe

348
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
for post Christmas. I don't know. Maybe
 

349
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,829
for post Christmas. I don't know. Maybe
this is the Santa rally. We will see,

350
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
this is the Santa rally. We will see,
 

351
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,509
this is the Santa rally. We will see,
folks. Time will tell, but all I can say

352
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
folks. Time will tell, but all I can say
 

353
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,430
folks. Time will tell, but all I can say
is we are drifting higher right now.

354
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
is we are drifting higher right now.
 

355
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,110
is we are drifting higher right now.
Right, let's go and have a look at

356
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
Right, let's go and have a look at
 

357
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,389
Right, let's go and have a look at
what's going on in some of the other

358
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
what's going on in some of the other
 

359
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,430
what's going on in some of the other
indexes.

360
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440

 

361
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,670

Same story on the ES right now. You can

362
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
Same story on the ES right now. You can
 

363
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,430
Same story on the ES right now. You can
see drive and back up. It's already into

364
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
see drive and back up. It's already into
 

365
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,350
see drive and back up. It's already into
that old range. All right, so that's the

366
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
that old range. All right, so that's the
 

367
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,750
that old range. All right, so that's the
divergence strength in the ES. It's

368
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
divergence strength in the ES. It's
 

369
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,150
divergence strength in the ES. It's
already into this old range into it's

370
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
already into this old range into it's
 

371
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,990
already into this old range into it's
finding acceptance back into here. That

372
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
finding acceptance back into here. That
 

373
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,110
finding acceptance back into here. That
should look above um crucially above the

374
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
should look above um crucially above the
 

375
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,350
should look above um crucially above the
900s, I would say. So big big level

376
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
900s, I would say. So big big level
 

377
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,230
900s, I would say. So big big level
there at 900s. Let's have a look at the

378
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
there at 900s. Let's have a look at the
 

379
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,389
there at 900s. Let's have a look at the
spiders.

380
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
spiders.
 

381
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,069
spiders.
All right, that gamma level, that huge

382
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
All right, that gamma level, that huge
 

383
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,829
All right, that gamma level, that huge
level we had last week, never even quite

384
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
level we had last week, never even quite
 

385
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,150
level we had last week, never even quite
got down to it. The 70s, it's reclaimed

386
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
got down to it. The 70s, it's reclaimed
 

387
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,350
got down to it. The 70s, it's reclaimed
the 80s. Remember 70s, 75, 80s, and 82s

388
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
the 80s. Remember 70s, 75, 80s, and 82s
 

389
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,670
the 80s. Remember 70s, 75, 80s, and 82s
have all been big level. Now, I assume

390
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
have all been big level. Now, I assume
 

391
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,670
have all been big level. Now, I assume
will be 85s

392
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
will be 85s
 

393
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,190
will be 85s
on the spy. So, watching to see if we

394
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
on the spy. So, watching to see if we
 

395
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,389
on the spy. So, watching to see if we
get reaction there. We have got

396
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
get reaction there. We have got
 

397
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,069
get reaction there. We have got
liquidity above and then all the way at

398
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
liquidity above and then all the way at
 

399
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,949
liquidity above and then all the way at
90s. Uh, last time I checked, 700 was a

400
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
90s. Uh, last time I checked, 700 was a
 

401
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,829
90s. Uh, last time I checked, 700 was a
massive level. I very much doubt we do

402
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
massive level. I very much doubt we do
 

403
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,910
massive level. I very much doubt we do
that in two days, but strange things

404
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
that in two days, but strange things
 

405
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,230
that in two days, but strange things
have happened, right? Strange of things

406
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
have happened, right? Strange of things
 

407
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,269
have happened, right? Strange of things
have happened. All right, Q's, same

408
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
have happened. All right, Q's, same
 

409
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,949
have happened. All right, Q's, same
story. All right, we've pivoted back

410
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
story. All right, we've pivoted back
 

411
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,590
story. All right, we've pivoted back
above again that gamma level uh was

412
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
above again that gamma level uh was
 

413
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,269
above again that gamma level uh was
bought up. All right, we couldn't get

414
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
bought up. All right, we couldn't get
 

415
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,710
bought up. All right, we couldn't get
through it. So 600 held, reclaimed uh 10

416
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
through it. So 600 held, reclaimed uh 10
 

417
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,590
through it. So 600 held, reclaimed uh 10
and now 15s and now 20s. So it's on a

418
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
and now 15s and now 20s. So it's on a
 

419
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,590
and now 15s and now 20s. So it's on a
flyer. It just depends. Can we get back

420
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
flyer. It just depends. Can we get back
 

421
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,430
flyer. It just depends. Can we get back
into this old range? Remember the thick

422
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
into this old range? Remember the thick
 

423
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,550
into this old range? Remember the thick
old range here, thick balance here. Do

424
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
old range here, thick balance here. Do
 

425
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,310
old range here, thick balance here. Do
we reject that and find a bid here to

426
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
we reject that and find a bid here to
 

427
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,829
we reject that and find a bid here to
get back in or do we drift in and chop?

428
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
get back in or do we drift in and chop?
 

429
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,470
get back in or do we drift in and chop?
Just want to have a quick look at the

430
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
Just want to have a quick look at the
 

431
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,190
Just want to have a quick look at the
VIX. All right, slow drift down.

432
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
VIX. All right, slow drift down.
 

433
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,590
VIX. All right, slow drift down.
Remember, the lower we go, the more slow

434
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
Remember, the lower we go, the more slow
 

435
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,350
Remember, the lower we go, the more slow
drift higher we are likely to see. All

436
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
drift higher we are likely to see. All
 

437
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,230
drift higher we are likely to see. All
right, and we're now sub 15s that is in

438
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
right, and we're now sub 15s that is in
 

439
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,389
right, and we're now sub 15s that is in
uh volatility will be very low if it

440
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
uh volatility will be very low if it
 

441
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,829
uh volatility will be very low if it
stays down here. It just be a slow

442
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
stays down here. It just be a slow
 

443
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,069
stays down here. It just be a slow
grindy kind of session, but we will see.

444
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
grindy kind of session, but we will see.
 

445
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:54,069
grindy kind of session, but we will see.
Let's have a look at the mag.

446
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079

 

447
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,990

Okay, failed look down here on Apple.

448
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay, failed look down here on Apple.
 

449
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,710
Okay, failed look down here on Apple.
Range is still above yet to reclaim.

450
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
Range is still above yet to reclaim.
 

451
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,550
Range is still above yet to reclaim.
This is like it needs to get back above

452
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
This is like it needs to get back above
 

453
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,430
This is like it needs to get back above
76s. All right, so still lower high

454
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
76s. All right, so still lower high
 

455
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,069
76s. All right, so still lower high
break down higher low but hasn't taken

456
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
break down higher low but hasn't taken
 

457
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,230
break down higher low but hasn't taken
out this 76s. So maybe builds out

458
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
out this 76s. So maybe builds out
 

459
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,230
out this 76s. So maybe builds out
liquidity here. If it reclaims 76s,

460
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
liquidity here. If it reclaims 76s,
 

461
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,470
liquidity here. If it reclaims 76s,
that's a strong sign that it's been

462
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
that's a strong sign that it's been
 

463
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,310
that's a strong sign that it's been
bought back up. I'm still long Apple

465
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,550

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,069
that is looking much better. I'm still
again swinging long Amazon. No reason to

474
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
again swinging long Amazon. No reason to
 

475
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,069
again swinging long Amazon. No reason to
sell yet. There's your double bottom.

476
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
sell yet. There's your double bottom.
 

477

They've got a clear target to aim up for

482
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
They've got a clear target to aim up for
 

483
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,990
They've got a clear target to aim up for
into the 232s right now. So, if we can

484
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
into the 232s right now. So, if we can
 

485
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,670
into the 232s right now. So, if we can
get it going on Amazon, we're going to

486
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
get it going on Amazon, we're going to
 

487
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,590
get it going on Amazon, we're going to
try and get upside. If they can hold as

488
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
try and get upside. If they can hold as
 

489
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,910
try and get upside. If they can hold as
long as they hold dips into sort of 27

490
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
long as they hold dips into sort of 27
 

491
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,230
long as they hold dips into sort of 27
26s and 27s, they look good. As long as

00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
26s and 27s, they look good. As long as
 

493
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,550
26s and 27s, they look good. As long as
they can hold dips. Google again, same

494
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
they can hold dips. Google again, same
 

495
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,069
they can hold dips. Google again, same
story. Look at that. We talked about

there's the look below. So, it tried
 

503
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,910
there's the look below. So, it tried
once, tried again, and then reclaimed,

00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
once, tried again, and then reclaimed,
 

505
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,230
once, tried again, and then reclaimed,
and now we're drifting upside. And very

acceptance back into that old range for
 

513
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,150
acceptance back into that old range for

but we haven't pulled back down into

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
but we haven't pulled back down into
 

527
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,910
but we haven't pulled back down into
here yet for me. Um, it's looking pretty

528
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
here yet for me. Um, it's looking pretty
 

529
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,750
here yet for me. Um, it's looking pretty
good. I'll be honest with you, that's

530
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
good. I'll be honest with you, that's

533
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,990
looking pretty good. That is I'm long
for 580. So, somewhere around here. All

534
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
for 580. So, somewhere around here. All
 

535
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,310
for 580. So, somewhere around here. All
right. That's a good hold, a good push,

536
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
right. That's a good hold, a good push,
 

537
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,470
right. That's a good hold, a good push,
a pullback, which has held that range.

538
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
a pullback, which has held that range.
 

539
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,350
a pullback, which has held that range.
It's probably like a 30 to 50% pullback

540
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
It's probably like a 30 to 50% pullback
 

541
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,110
It's probably like a 30 to 50% pullback
and it's question is can they break out.

542
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
and it's question is can they break out.
 

543
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,550
and it's question is can they break out.
I was actually looking to see if we come

544
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
I was actually looking to see if we come
 

545
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,550
I was actually looking to see if we come
back down into here for a rebid. So a

546
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
back down into here for a rebid. So a
 

547
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,949
back down into here for a rebid. So a
two leg but we will see. At the moment

548
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
two leg but we will see. At the moment
 

549
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,710
two leg but we will see. At the moment
it looks pretty strong. So so far all of

550
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
it looks pretty strong. So so far all of
 

551
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,069
it looks pretty strong. So so far all of
the mag looking pretty good.

552
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
the mag looking pretty good.
 

553

Uh gapping up all that uh Microsoft

554
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
Uh gapping up all that uh Microsoft
 

555
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,509
Uh gapping up all that uh Microsoft
got here five minutes. Another gap up on

556
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
got here five minutes. Another gap up on
 

557
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,430
got here five minutes. Another gap up on
Microsoft right not by a lot but it is

558
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
Microsoft right not by a lot but it is
 

559
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,269
Microsoft right not by a lot but it is
into a two-day balance. All right. So

560
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
into a two-day balance. All right. So
 

561
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,629
into a two-day balance. All right. So
it's one question here on Microsoft.

562
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
it's one question here on Microsoft.
 

563
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,870
it's one question here on Microsoft.
We're into a two-day balance, right?

564
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
We're into a two-day balance, right?
 

565
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,710
We're into a two-day balance, right?
Kind of get out of that balance for a

566
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
Kind of get out of that balance for a
 

567
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,470
Kind of get out of that balance for a
rebid up. And you can see the level up

568
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
rebid up. And you can see the level up
 

569
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,790
rebid up. And you can see the level up
here we've got marked out for a break.

570
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
here we've got marked out for a break.
 

571
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,710
here we've got marked out for a break.
And then Nvidia, this is the big one.

572
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
And then Nvidia, this is the big one.
 

573
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,590
And then Nvidia, this is the big one.
This was the big driver last week, uh,

574
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
This was the big driver last week, uh,
 

575
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,350
This was the big driver last week, uh,
back end of last week, right? We came

576
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
back end of last week, right? We came
 

577
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,829
back end of last week, right? We came
down, held this pivot. That's what's

578
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
down, held this pivot. That's what's
 

579
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,269
down, held this pivot. That's what's
key. That white dotted line, we still

580
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
key. That white dotted line, we still
 

581
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,829
key. That white dotted line, we still
have a price. We broke this, but we

582
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
have a price. We broke this, but we
 

583
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,990
have a price. We broke this, but we
could not flush underneath. We held,

584
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
could not flush underneath. We held,
 

585
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,750
could not flush underneath. We held,
reclaimed, and we've gone right back to

586
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:29,760
reclaimed, and we've gone right back to
 

587
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,990
reclaimed, and we've gone right back to
the upside. So, basically, no acceptance

588
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
the upside. So, basically, no acceptance
 

589
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,829
the upside. So, basically, no acceptance
outside of 74. 10 points higher. And if

590
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
outside of 74. 10 points higher. And if
 

591
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,110
outside of 74. 10 points higher. And if
we zoom out now, it will want to attack

592
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
we zoom out now, it will want to attack
 

593
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,550
we zoom out now, it will want to attack
85s and then 91s. All right, so if we

594
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
85s and then 91s. All right, so if we
 

595
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,870
85s and then 91s. All right, so if we
get back above, let's just mark some of

596
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
get back above, let's just mark some of
 

597
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,389
get back above, let's just mark some of
these out because we're going to want to

598
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
these out because we're going to want to
 

599
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,030
these out because we're going to want to
know if Tesla's

600
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
know if Tesla's
 

601
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,110
know if Tesla's
going to go mental today. All right,

602
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
going to go mental today. All right,
 

603
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,629
going to go mental today. All right,
let's mark 86s and then 91 break.

604
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
let's mark 86s and then 91 break.
 

605
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,629
let's mark 86s and then 91 break.
All right, can it find acceptance above

606
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
All right, can it find acceptance above
 

607
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,550
All right, can it find acceptance above
those or a drive out above those? If it

608
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
those or a drive out above those? If it
 

609
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,189
those or a drive out above those? If it
does, uh, the squeeze is on. All right,

610
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
does, uh, the squeeze is on. All right,
 

611
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,790

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,870
this point, technically, this is a big
look above and another look above into

616
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
look above and another look above into
 

617
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,870
look above and another look above into
range and a look below and fail. And

618
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
range and a look below and fail. And
 

619
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,629
range and a look below and fail. And
this can just do this for a little bit.

620
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
this can just do this for a little bit.
 

621
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,310
this can just do this for a little bit.
But if we start breaking through here,

622
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
But if we start breaking through here,
 

623
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,590
But if we start breaking through here,
expect some stops to start to be popped.

624
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
expect some stops to start to be popped.
 

625
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,470
expect some stops to start to be popped.
And then Tesla

626
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
And then Tesla
 

627
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,790
And then Tesla
still has been very bullish. Uh

628
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
still has been very bullish. Uh
 

629
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,870
still has been very bullish. Uh
just zoom out this minute. Yeah, it's

630
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
just zoom out this minute. Yeah, it's
 

631
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,910
just zoom out this minute. Yeah, it's
still holding really well. Um, but you

632
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
still holding really well. Um, but you
 

633
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,430
still holding really well. Um, but you
wonder how much juice it's got left.

634
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
wonder how much juice it's got left.
 

635
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,189
wonder how much juice it's got left.
Hasn't quite got to those 500s yet,

636
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
Hasn't quite got to those 500s yet,
 

637
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,310
Hasn't quite got to those 500s yet,
which is where it wants to go.

638
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
which is where it wants to go.
 

639
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,230
which is where it wants to go.
Day is this Wednesday. So, we can watch

640
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
Day is this Wednesday. So, we can watch
 

641
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,069
Day is this Wednesday. So, we can watch
Wednesday's high and low. All right,

642
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
Wednesday's high and low. All right,
 

643
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,829
Wednesday's high and low. All right,
we're trading in a range within that.

644
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
we're trading in a range within that.
 

645
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,629
we're trading in a range within that.
Once it breaks out, either side of that,

646
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
Once it breaks out, either side of that,
 

647
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,990
Once it breaks out, either side of that,
we will probably either get a breakout

648
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
we will probably either get a breakout
 

649
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,670
we will probably either get a breakout
or fail breakout. So, again, I can set

650
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
or fail breakout. So, again, I can set
 

651
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,230
or fail breakout. So, again, I can set
price alerts.

652
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240

 

653
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,629

Uh

654
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
Uh
 

655
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,069
Uh
previous week high breakout and do one

656
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
previous week high breakout and do one
 

657
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:11,829
previous week high breakout and do one
of the low.

658
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839

 

659
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,591

Okay.

660
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:13,601

665
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,710
absolutely gutted it didn't get filled
on that. All right. As soon as it filled

666
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
on that. All right. As soon as it filled
 

667
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,669
on that. All right. As soon as it filled
that gap at 78 we talked about for about

668
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
that gap at 78 we talked about for about

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,710
and just over a minute here till the
open. So, we're going to look to see if

730
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
open. So, we're going to look to see if
 

731
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,270
open. So, we're going to look to see if
they do that morning drive up and if

732
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
they do that morning drive up and if
 

733
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,350
they do that morning drive up and if
they find acceptance or if they sell it.

734
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
they find acceptance or if they sell it.
 

735
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,190
they find acceptance or if they sell it.
All right, they find acceptance into

736
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
All right, they find acceptance into
 

737
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,789
All right, they find acceptance into
that gray box and the old point of

738
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
that gray box and the old point of
 

739
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,110
that gray box and the old point of
control, the red box above. Do they sell

740
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
control, the red box above. Do they sell
 

741
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,190
control, the red box above. Do they sell
it or do they just hold price up there?

742
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,200
it or do they just hold price up there?
 

743
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,909
it or do they just hold price up there?
If we get the morning flush,

744
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
If we get the morning flush,
 

745
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,270
If we get the morning flush,
right, then I'm going to look to see if

746
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
right, then I'm going to look to see if
 

747
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,029
right, then I'm going to look to see if
we wash out any of this sort of trend

748
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
we wash out any of this sort of trend
 

749
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,270
we wash out any of this sort of trend
line liquidity. Do we come back down

750
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
line liquidity. Do we come back down
 

751
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,669
line liquidity. Do we come back down
into GlobeEx and previous day high into

752
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
into GlobeEx and previous day high into
 

753
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,590
into GlobeEx and previous day high into
this blue blocks or even into previous

754
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
this blue blocks or even into previous
 

755
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,830
this blue blocks or even into previous
day value area high would be fantastic.

756
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
day value area high would be fantastic.
 

757
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,310
day value area high would be fantastic.
But uh it's a long way down. So we will

758
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
But uh it's a long way down. So we will
 

759
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:13,669
But uh it's a long way down. So we will
see. We will see.

760
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679

 

761
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,388

Yeah, gold's going. I mean,

762
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:17,398
Yeah, gold's going. I mean,
 

763
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:18,310
Yeah, gold's going. I mean,
[sighs]

764
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
[sighs]
 

765
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,110
[sighs]
it's mad to see that breakout

766
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
it's mad to see that breakout
 

767
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,750
it's mad to see that breakout
uh over in the Asian markets

768
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760
uh over in the Asian markets
 

769
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,150
uh over in the Asian markets
in the yields and we're not really

770
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
in the yields and we're not really
 

771
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,270
in the yields and we're not really
reacting off it. So, uh I think it might

772
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
reacting off it. So, uh I think it might
 

773
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,070
reacting off it. So, uh I think it might
just be very crowded, but we will see.

774
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
just be very crowded, but we will see.
 

775
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,830
just be very crowded, but we will see.
Like I said, sometimes these these

776
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
Like I said, sometimes these these
 

777
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,110
Like I said, sometimes these these
things can take a while to play out.

778
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120

 

779
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,150

I'm definitely watching move into 930s.

780
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
I'm definitely watching move into 930s.
 

781
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,110
I'm definitely watching move into 930s.

793
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,590

We can afford to come a long way down.

794
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
We can afford to come a long way down.
 

795
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,909
We can afford to come a long way down.
Zoom this out.

Zoom this out.
This

798
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
This
 

799
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,549
This
very steep.

800
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
very steep.
 

801
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,230
very steep.
Let's see if they come down or not. At

802
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
Let's see if they come down or not. At
 

803
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,909
Let's see if they come down or not. At
the moment, they're just absorbing the

804
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
the moment, they're just absorbing the
 

805
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,390
the moment, they're just absorbing the
tape at the lows.

806
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400

 

807
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,544

Bit of a choppy start here.

808
00:20:23,544 --> 00:20:23,554
Bit of a choppy start here.

I have a very healthy hairline for my

I have a very healthy hairline for my
 

815
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,590
I have a very healthy hairline for my
age. It's uh I don't have the bald gene

816
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
age. It's uh I don't have the bald gene
 

817
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,830
age. It's uh I don't have the bald gene
clearly. Unfortunately, a lot of my

818
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840
clearly. Unfortunately, a lot of my
 

819
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,390
clearly. Unfortunately, a lot of my
mates have already lost everything.

820
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
mates have already lost everything.
 

821
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,310
mates have already lost everything.
It happens. It's called aging. Unless

822
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
It happens. It's called aging. Unless
 

823
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,909
It happens. It's called aging. Unless
you want to go to Turkey and get a funny

00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
you want to go to Turkey and get a funny
 

825
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,270
you want to go to Turkey and get a funny
turkey job.

826
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280

 

827
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,630

All right, just chopping around here.

828
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
All right, just chopping around here.
 

829
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,750
All right, just chopping around here.
So, very slow open so far.

830
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760

 

831
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,590

But uh buyers are trying to come in and

832
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:13,600
But uh buyers are trying to come in and
 

833
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,430
But uh buyers are trying to come in and
expand this higher. We can go to that

834
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
expand this higher. We can go to that
 

835
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,830
expand this higher. We can go to that
gray box above potentially. There's the

836
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
gray box above potentially. There's the
 

837
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,510
gray box above potentially. There's the
New York open. So tapping into that New

838
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
New York open. So tapping into that New
 

839
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,350
New York open. So tapping into that New
York open at the moment if they want to

840
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
York open at the moment if they want to
 

841
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,350
York open at the moment if they want to
get going, but I'd much rather see them

842
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
get going, but I'd much rather see them
 

843
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,029
get going, but I'd much rather see them
come down and offer some dips this

844
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
come down and offer some dips this
 

845
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,470
come down and offer some dips this
morning. But maybe that was it and

846
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
morning. But maybe that was it and
 

847
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,390
morning. But maybe that was it and
they're going to look for it. We will

848
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
they're going to look for it. We will
 

849
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,990
they're going to look for it. We will
see. Like I said, light volume today.

850
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
see. Like I said, light volume today.
 

851
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,549
see. Like I said, light volume today.
Not expecting too much. Okay, so here's

852
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
Not expecting too much. Okay, so here's
 

853
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,950
Not expecting too much. Okay, so here's
the drive towards 800. ES coming up to

854
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
the drive towards 800. ES coming up to
 

855
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,430
the drive towards 800. ES coming up to
an old level of 930. There's liquidity

856
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
an old level of 930. There's liquidity
 

857
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,190
an old level of 930. There's liquidity
sat there.

858
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
sat there.
 

859
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,630
sat there.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, seeing

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, seeing
 

861
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,230
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, seeing
divergence there. But all of the Mad

divergence there. But all of the Mad
 

863
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,070
divergence there. But all of the Mad

877
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,909

And Tesla crossing that alert already.

878
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
And Tesla crossing that alert already.
 

879
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,190
And Tesla crossing that alert already.
So that thing is going for it right now

880
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,200
So that thing is going for it right now
 

881
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,029
So that thing is going for it right now
through the 9550s.

882
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039

 

883
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,270

So bids holding so far on that New York

884
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
So bids holding so far on that New York
 

885
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,870
So bids holding so far on that New York
open. I just want to let this settle

886
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880
open. I just want to let this settle
 

887
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,549
open. I just want to let this settle
down. All right. That wasn't a deep

888
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559
down. All right. That wasn't a deep
 

889
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,310
down. All right. That wasn't a deep
enough pullback for me to get long into.

890
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
enough pullback for me to get long into.
 

891
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,310
enough pullback for me to get long into.
We didn't get rid of every anything. We

892
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
We didn't get rid of every anything. We
 

893
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,310
We didn't get rid of every anything. We
did go wick to wick. Just think. Just

894
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
did go wick to wick. Just think. Just
 

895
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,070
did go wick to wick. Just think. Just
let this settle down, guys. We are we're

896
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
let this settle down, guys. We are we're
 

897
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,149
let this settle down, guys. We are we're
gapping up over 200. Well, we've driven

898
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
gapping up over 200. Well, we've driven
 

899
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,029
gapping up over 200. Well, we've driven
over 200 points with a big gap up. Just

900
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
over 200 points with a big gap up. Just
 

901
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,789
over 200 points with a big gap up. Just
don't really want to buy the highs until

902
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
don't really want to buy the highs until
 

903
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,510
don't really want to buy the highs until
I see a nice retest somewhere.

904
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520

 

905
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,669

Am I bullish? I'm I'm bullish if we hold

906
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:45,679
Am I bullish? I'm I'm bullish if we hold
 

907
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,750
Am I bullish? I'm I'm bullish if we hold
pullbacks. All right. I'm bullish if we

908
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
pullbacks. All right. I'm bullish if we
 

909
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,070
pullbacks. All right. I'm bullish if we
hold pullbacks. But you got to think,

910
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
hold pullbacks. But you got to think,
 

911
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,870
hold pullbacks. But you got to think,
all right, understand where value is.

912
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
all right, understand where value is.
 

913
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,470
all right, understand where value is.
This was premium on Friday. This was

914
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
This was premium on Friday. This was
 

915
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,470
This was premium on Friday. This was
premium last week. We're gapping up over

916
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
premium last week. We're gapping up over
 

917
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,870
premium last week. We're gapping up over
it, which is good. But here's your gap.

918
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
it, which is good. But here's your gap.
 

919
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,390
it, which is good. But here's your gap.
All right. Here's what we've done

920
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
All right. Here's what we've done
 

921
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,750
All right. Here's what we've done
overnight. I'm not going to buy up

922
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
overnight. I'm not going to buy up
 

923
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,110
overnight. I'm not going to buy up
there. I want to see if we come down

924
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
there. I want to see if we come down
 

925
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,350
there. I want to see if we come down
into this or even gap fill and bid off

926
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
into this or even gap fill and bid off
 

927
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,590
into this or even gap fill and bid off
that. Right.

928
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,600
that. Right.
 

929
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,830
that. Right.
I'm bullish if we can hold pullbacks

930
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
I'm bullish if we can hold pullbacks
 

931
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,390
I'm bullish if we can hold pullbacks
into big levels. Otherwise, I'm not

932
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
into big levels. Otherwise, I'm not
 

933
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,149
into big levels. Otherwise, I'm not
buying all the way up here, right? We

934
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
buying all the way up here, right? We
 

935
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,310
buying all the way up here, right? We
we've talked about this where we are in

936
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,320
we've talked about this where we are in
 

937
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,470
we've talked about this where we are in
the range where we are near supply. What

938
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
the range where we are near supply. What
 

939
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,190
the range where we are near supply. What
kind can happen? All right. What can

940
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
kind can happen? All right. What can
 

941
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,870
kind can happen? All right. What can
happen washing out all those players

942
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
happen washing out all those players
 

943
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,390
happen washing out all those players
overnight who've been bidding all night

944
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
overnight who've been bidding all night
 

945
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,909
overnight who've been bidding all night
long and been absolutely fine? Is the

946
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
long and been absolutely fine? Is the
 

947
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,230
long and been absolutely fine? Is the
move into VWAP. So, do they bid off VWAP

948
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
move into VWAP. So, do they bid off VWAP
 

949
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,510
move into VWAP. So, do they bid off VWAP
now is the question.

950
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
now is the question.
 

951
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,270
now is the question.
ES couldn't get through. Can take that

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
red on the session here. Can we get back
 

963
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,110

00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
into previous week high into
 

965
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,830
into previous week high into
670s? This blue box down here. Right.

966
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
670s? This blue box down here. Right.
 

967
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,510
670s? This blue box down here. Right.
This is the trend line. I'd like to see

968
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
This is the trend line. I'd like to see
 

969
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,190
This is the trend line. I'd like to see
this just crack and come down at this

970
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
this just crack and come down at this
 

971
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,230
this just crack and come down at this
point and offer us a really good value

972
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
point and offer us a really good value
 

973
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,549
point and offer us a really good value
buy if if they can bid down here. Right?

974
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
buy if if they can bid down here. Right?
 

975
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,990
buy if if they can bid down here. Right?
I'm not bidding against I'm not just

976
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm not bidding against I'm not just
 

977
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,590
I'm not bidding against I'm not just
going to bid against momentum. But if we

978
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
going to bid against momentum. But if we
 

979
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,190
going to bid against momentum. But if we
come down here and do something like

980
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
come down here and do something like
 

981
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,029
come down here and do something like
this, I'm interested. If they don't

982
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
this, I'm interested. If they don't
 

983
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,470
this, I'm interested. If they don't
don't hold this level, they can come all

984
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
don't hold this level, they can come all
 

985
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,830
don't hold this level, they can come all
the way down here. Previous uh highs gap

986
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
the way down here. Previous uh highs gap
 

987
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,669
the way down here. Previous uh highs gap
fill previous day value area high. We

988
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
fill previous day value area high. We
 

989
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,350
fill previous day value area high. We
can come and fill this. Remember this is

990
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
can come and fill this. Remember this is
 

991
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,269
can come and fill this. Remember this is
all overnight. We can come and do this

992
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
all overnight. We can come and do this
 

993
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,269
all overnight. We can come and do this
and then bid back off. So that would be

994
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
and then bid back off. So that would be
 

995
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,950
and then bid back off. So that would be
either one of these blue blue boxes

996
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
either one of these blue blue boxes
 

997
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,516
either one of these blue blue boxes
would be uh the most ideal location.

998
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:28,526
would be uh the most ideal location.
 

999
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:40,789
would be uh the most ideal location.

Excel coming in here getting himself a

Excel coming in here getting himself a

Excel coming in here getting himself a
little caught if they reclaim VWAP. This

1004
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
little caught if they reclaim VWAP. This
 

1005
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,830
little caught if they reclaim VWAP. This
is going to be interesting little battle

1006
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
is going to be interesting little battle
 

1007
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,750
is going to be interesting little battle
here starting to develop.

1008
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760

 

1009
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,549

Huge delta came in at 704 sellside side

1010
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
Huge delta came in at 704 sellside side
 

1011
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,390
Huge delta came in at 704 sellside side
and got themselves caught here. So I'm

1012
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
and got themselves caught here. So I'm
 

1013
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,390
and got themselves caught here. So I'm
interested if they hold reclaims not

1014
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
interested if they hold reclaims not
 

1015
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,110
interested if they hold reclaims not
otherwise.

1016
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
otherwise.
 

1017
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,870
otherwise.
Yeah, still not down to its VWAP either.

1018
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
Yeah, still not down to its VWAP either.
 

1019
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,350
Yeah, still not down to its VWAP either.
There's the reclaim of VWAP. So sellers

1020
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
There's the reclaim of VWAP. So sellers
 

1021
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,669
There's the reclaim of VWAP. So sellers
are stuck on the 705s. Interested in

1022
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
are stuck on the 705s. Interested in
 

1023
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,029
are stuck on the 705s. Interested in
feathering in here little piece. Another

1024
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
feathering in here little piece. Another
 

1025
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,070
feathering in here little piece. Another
sellers come in at 27s there. So new

1026
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
sellers come in at 27s there. So new
 

1027
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,549
sellers come in at 27s there. So new
range being developed here at between 27

1028
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
range being developed here at between 27
 

1029
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,430
range being developed here at between 27
and 705. If they pop through 27, there's

1030
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,440
and 705. If they pop through 27, there's
 

1031
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,430
and 705. If they pop through 27, there's
a potential drift. If they hold uh 704s,

1032
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
a potential drift. If they hold uh 704s,
 

1033
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,110
a potential drift. If they hold uh 704s,
they're just going to keep all 705s are

1034
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
they're just going to keep all 705s are
 

1035
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,029
they're just going to keep all 705s are
going to keep going in rotation. I

1036
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
going to keep going in rotation. I
 

1037
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,710
going to keep going in rotation. I
really want to be a buyer down here.

1038
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
really want to be a buyer down here.
 

1039
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,510
really want to be a buyer down here.
Let me see. Get this on. There we go.

1040
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
Let me see. Get this on. There we go.
 

1041
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,549
Let me see. Get this on. There we go.
All right. So, you can see the low

1042
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
All right. So, you can see the low
 

1043
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,549
All right. So, you can see the low
volume load there. So, sellers

1044
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
volume load there. So, sellers
 

1045
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,070
volume load there. So, sellers
protecting that. They are still stuck at

1046
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
protecting that. They are still stuck at
 

1047
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,510
protecting that. They are still stuck at
these 704s. Now, they're getting

1048
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
these 704s. Now, they're getting
 

1049
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,110
these 704s. Now, they're getting
acceptance lower. Okay. So, my

1050
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
acceptance lower. Okay. So, my
 

1051
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,710
acceptance lower. Okay. So, my
expectation is that they should drive

1052
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
expectation is that they should drive
 

1053
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,590
expectation is that they should drive
down into this blue box. Now, I'm going

1054
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:43,600
down into this blue box. Now, I'm going
 

1055
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,789
down into this blue box. Now, I'm going
to get rid of this because we've broken

1056
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
to get rid of this because we've broken
 

1057
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,772
to get rid of this because we've broken
it. Here we go. Nice.

1058
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:47,782
it. Here we go. Nice.
 

1059
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:50,070
it. Here we go. Nice.

1061
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,870

Okay, that's getting close to view up as

1062
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
Okay, that's getting close to view up as
 

1063
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,310
Okay, that's getting close to view up as
well. Where's the spiders? Underneath

1064
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
well. Where's the spiders? Underneath
 

1065
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,549
well. Where's the spiders? Underneath
its view up right now. We're going to

1066

its view up right now. We're going to
 

1067
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,549
its view up right now. We're going to
wash out lots of these guys. I want to

1068
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
wash out lots of these guys. I want to
 

1069
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,990
wash out lots of these guys. I want to
see this lower at this point into this

1070
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
see this lower at this point into this
 

1071
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,590
see this lower at this point into this
blue box. And then I can think about a

1072
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:01,600
blue box. And then I can think about a
 

1073
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,510
blue box. And then I can think about a
buy if we start to see absorption or

1074
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,520
buy if we start to see absorption or
 

1075
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,430
buy if we start to see absorption or
traps. If we don't hold this blue box,

1076
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
traps. If we don't hold this blue box,
 

1077
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:16,149
traps. If we don't hold this blue box,
then I'll be watching the next blue box.

1078
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159

 

1079
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,029

Do not expect uh like nice smooth

Do not expect uh like nice smooth
 

1081
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,110
Do not expect uh like nice smooth
conditions here this morning. All right,

1082
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
conditions here this morning. All right,
 

1083
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,230

1239
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,430
going on for sure.
Yes, back to VWOP again.

1240
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440

 

1241
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,190

Definite absorption we're seeing here.

1242
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
Definite absorption we're seeing here.
 

1243
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,830
Definite absorption we're seeing here.
Back to VWOP on Q's. All right. Are we

1244
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
Back to VWOP on Q's. All right. Are we
 

1245
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,029
Back to VWOP on Q's. All right. Are we
going to start ripping? If we're going

1246
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
going to start ripping? If we're going
 

1247
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,710
going to start ripping? If we're going
to start breaking out through here, I'm

1248
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
to start breaking out through here, I'm
 

1249
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,510
to start breaking out through here, I'm
interested.

1250
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
interested.
 

1251
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,230
interested.
The sell is defending that uh low volume

1252
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
The sell is defending that uh low volume
 

1253
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,590
The sell is defending that uh low volume
node right now. But if we're going to

1254
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,600
node right now. But if we're going to
 

1255
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,789
node right now. But if we're going to
start breaking out through it, I'm

1256
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
start breaking out through it, I'm
 

1257
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,389
start breaking out through it, I'm
interested. I would have rather we got

1258
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
interested. I would have rather we got
 

1259
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,389
interested. I would have rather we got
into this blue box if I'm honest. I'd

1260
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399
into this blue box if I'm honest. I'd
 

1261
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,830
into this blue box if I'm honest. I'd
rather we get into here first before I

1262
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,840
rather we get into here first before I
 

1263
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,149
rather we get into here first before I
do anything. But I will consider if we

1264
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:22,159
do anything. But I will consider if we
 

1265
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,350
do anything. But I will consider if we
break above and start holding above 28.

1266
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,360
break above and start holding above 28.
 

1267
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,310
break above and start holding above 28.
Let's call it 30s. I'll consider it.

1268
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
Let's call it 30s. I'll consider it.
 

1269
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,830
Let's call it 30s. I'll consider it.
Otherwise, I'm looking for that move to

1270
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
Otherwise, I'm looking for that move to
 

1271
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,470
Otherwise, I'm looking for that move to
previous week high and see if they trap

1272
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,480
previous week high and see if they trap
 

1273
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,269
previous week high and see if they trap
sellers down there.

1274
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
sellers down there.
 

1275
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,870
sellers down there.
Are they going to test previous day

1276
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
Are they going to test previous day
 

1277
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,190
Are they going to test previous day
value high? They very well could. Yeah,

1278
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,200
value high? They very well could. Yeah,
 

1279
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,549
value high? They very well could. Yeah,
this other blue box. So, it's either

1280
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:40,559
this other blue box. So, it's either
 

1281
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,149
this other blue box. So, it's either
this one or this one where I'm

1282
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:42,159
this one or this one where I'm
 

1283
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,950
this one or this one where I'm
potentially interested in bidding off if

1284
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:44,960
potentially interested in bidding off if
 

1285
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,710
potentially interested in bidding off if
they can trap.

1286
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720

 

1287
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,789

Yes, still absorbing into view up right

1288
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
Yes, still absorbing into view up right
 

1289
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,750
Yes, still absorbing into view up right
now. No break below. Spies under it. Q's

1290
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
now. No break below. Spies under it. Q's
 

1291
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,990
now. No break below. Spies under it. Q's
are under it. VIX is trying to sort of

1292
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
are under it. VIX is trying to sort of
 

1293
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,070
are under it. VIX is trying to sort of
get back towards the 15s right now. It's

1294
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
get back towards the 15s right now. It's
 

1295
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,269
get back towards the 15s right now. It's
not there yet.

1296
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
not there yet.
 

1297
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,310
not there yet.
Okay, please come into this blue box and

1298
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:04,320
Okay, please come into this blue box and
 

1299
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:13,110
Okay, please come into this blue box and
then let's see what happens.

1300
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120

 

1301
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,990

some buying here. 680 675 670 all

1302
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
some buying here. 680 675 670 all
 

1303
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,789
some buying here. 680 675 670 all
stacked up.

1304
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799

 

1305
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:33,830

Come on.

1306
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840

 

1307
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,269

It might well get it anyhow, but I don't

1308
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:35,279
It might well get it anyhow, but I don't
 

1309
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,710
It might well get it anyhow, but I don't
think it would be huge. If you do get

1310
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
think it would be huge. If you do get
 

1311
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,230
think it would be huge. If you do get
it, I think it'd be 1020 to any point

1312
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,240
it, I think it'd be 1020 to any point
 

1313
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,269
it, I think it'd be 1020 to any point
little run

1314
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:41,279
little run
 

1315
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,110
little run
unless we get down to previous day value

1316
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
unless we get down to previous day value
 

1317
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,509
unless we get down to previous day value
high, which would be mega. But uh we we

1318
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:45,519
high, which would be mega. But uh we we
 

1319
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,509
high, which would be mega. But uh we we
will see.

1320
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
will see.
 

1321
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,710
will see.
We will see. Right into this blue box or

1322
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
We will see. Right into this blue box or
 

1323
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,389
We will see. Right into this blue box or
close

1324
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:52,399
close
 

1325
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,990
close
into this previous week high, this red

1326
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
into this previous week high, this red
 

1327
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,190
into this previous week high, this red
line and orange line is GloEx low.

1328
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
line and orange line is GloEx low.
 

1329
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,029
line and orange line is GloEx low.
We started to develop some volume up

1330
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
We started to develop some volume up
 

1331
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,509
We started to develop some volume up
here now,

1332
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
here now,
 

1333
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,350
here now,
which they can lean on.

1334
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,360

 

1335
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,830

build those last lot buyers. So, passive

1336
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
build those last lot buyers. So, passive
 

1337
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,149
build those last lot buyers. So, passive
buyers now sat down at 70s and 60s

1338
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
buyers now sat down at 70s and 60s
 

1339
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:25,110
buyers now sat down at 70s and 60s
and we're going to come down for them.

1340
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120

 

1341
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,590

Yep. There we go. Into the 70s. Can they

1342
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
Yep. There we go. Into the 70s. Can they
 

1343
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,350
Yep. There we go. Into the 70s. Can they
fill this guy? 70s and 60s. They're not

1344
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,360
fill this guy? 70s and 60s. They're not
 

1345
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:38,470
fill this guy? 70s and 60s. They're not
big. They're not big bids right now.

1346
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480

 

1347
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,389

It's trying to get up to previous day

1348
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:40,399
It's trying to get up to previous day
 

1349
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,750
It's trying to get up to previous day
low. So, we're coming into very

1350
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
low. So, we're coming into very
 

1351
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,070
low. So, we're coming into very
interesting pop points here. It's all

1352
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,080
interesting pop points here. It's all
 

1353
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,149
interesting pop points here. It's all
depends if the market is able to trap

1354
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:46,159
depends if the market is able to trap
 

1355
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,710
depends if the market is able to trap
around here or not. I would say starting

1356
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:48,720
around here or not. I would say starting
 

1357
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,470
around here or not. I would say starting
to find some bids around here. At the

1358
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,480
to find some bids around here. At the
 

1359
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,430
to find some bids around here. At the
moment, we're probably a little bit

1360
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
moment, we're probably a little bit
 

1361
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,950
moment, we're probably a little bit
early. Just want to see us flush into

1362
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
early. Just want to see us flush into
 

1363
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,269
early. Just want to see us flush into
here, trap some shorts, and then if we

1364
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
here, trap some shorts, and then if we
 

1365
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,630
here, trap some shorts, and then if we
can do that, I'll think about going the

1366
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:58,640
can do that, I'll think about going the
 

1367
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,190
can do that, I'll think about going the
other way. Starting to get interesting

1368
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
other way. Starting to get interesting
 

1369
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,029
other way. Starting to get interesting
here. here. Some shorts just got caught.

1370
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:03,039
here. here. Some shorts just got caught.
 

1371
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,110
here. here. Some shorts just got caught.
Maybe not enough for me. Back to point

1372
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,120
Maybe not enough for me. Back to point
 

1373
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,830
Maybe not enough for me. Back to point
of control on the day again.

1374
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840

 

1375
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,230

So this is the box right here. Above

1376
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240
So this is the box right here. Above
 

1377
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,310
So this is the box right here. Above
this there is squeeze potential right

1378
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,320
this there is squeeze potential right
 

1379
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,549
this there is squeeze potential right
above this. There's squeeze potential.

1380
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
above this. There's squeeze potential.
 

1381
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,070
above this. There's squeeze potential.
And this is the blue box of interest.

1382
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
And this is the blue box of interest.
 

1383
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,190
And this is the blue box of interest.
Here we go. Bidding in. So 705s is that

1384
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
Here we go. Bidding in. So 705s is that
 

1385
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,350
Here we go. Bidding in. So 705s is that
same level where that huge seller came

1386
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
same level where that huge seller came
 

1387
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,669
same level where that huge seller came
in earlier. They don't defend that. We

1388
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:25,679
in earlier. They don't defend that. We
 

1389
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,950
in earlier. They don't defend that. We
will start squeezing. We got to watch

1390
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:26,960
will start squeezing. We got to watch
 

1391
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,350
will start squeezing. We got to watch
these VWAPs here as well.

1392
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360

 

1393
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:41,750

00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
gray box for a bid? I'll still consider
 

1703
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,470
gray box for a bid? I'll still consider
this if they hold gray box on a bid. If

1704
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,480
this if they hold gray box on a bid. If
 

1705
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,750
this if they hold gray box on a bid. If
they lose it, then we're going to go

1706
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:41,760
they lose it, then we're going to go
 

1707
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,670
they lose it, then we're going to go
back into the blue box below because the

1708
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
back into the blue box below because the
 

1709
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,190
back into the blue box below because the
end the bottom of the auction is not

1710
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
end the bottom of the auction is not
 

1711
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,390
end the bottom of the auction is not
that great. All right, we're holding

1712
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,400
that great. All right, we're holding
 

1713
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,550
that great. All right, we're holding
gray box. That's a good sign. We got to

1714
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:48,560
gray box. That's a good sign. We got to
 

1715
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,109
gray box. That's a good sign. We got to
bid through this now. We got to go 38s.

1716
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:51,119
bid through this now. We got to go 38s.
 

1717
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,510
bid through this now. We got to go 38s.
And here we go. All right, come on then.

1718
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:53,520
And here we go. All right, come on then.
 

1719
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,589
And here we go. All right, come on then.
Come on then. Go, go, go, go, go, go,

1720
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:55,599
Come on then. Go, go, go, go, go, go,
 

1721
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,390
Come on then. Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go. Let's go. Finally, you've

1722
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,400
go, go, go. Let's go. Finally, you've
 

1723
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,829
go, go, go. Let's go. Finally, you've
turned up, mate. Finally.

1724
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:01,839
turned up, mate. Finally.
 

1725
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,030
turned up, mate. Finally.
All right, beautiful. Into these

1726
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040
All right, beautiful. Into these
 

1727
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,470
All right, beautiful. Into these
imbalances. So, I'm going to partial

1728
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
imbalances. So, I'm going to partial
 

1729
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,710
imbalances. So, I'm going to partial
some out here into 40 and 45s.

1730
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:08,720

 

1731
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,990

I want to be careful. So, we're just

1732
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,000
I want to be careful. So, we're just
 

1733
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,349
I want to be careful. So, we're just
playing this imbalance. You can see how

1734
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:11,359
playing this imbalance. You can see how
 

1735
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,710
playing this imbalance. You can see how
thin we got here. And if we get

1736
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:12,720
thin we got here. And if we get
 

1737
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,790
thin we got here. And if we get
acceptance through 55s, we can think

1738
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:14,800
acceptance through 55s, we can think
 

1739
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,069
acceptance through 55s, we can think
about higher day, but we're already

1740
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:16,079
about higher day, but we're already
 

1741
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,870
about higher day, but we're already
taking some off. ES into New York open.

1742
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880

 

1743
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,950

What a tricky bugger. this, but it's

1744
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:22,960
What a tricky bugger. this, but it's
 

1745
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,390
What a tricky bugger. this, but it's
it's actually not a seller on the tape

1746
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
it's actually not a seller on the tape
 

1747
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,829
it's actually not a seller on the tape
that's being a pain. It's actually the

1748
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:25,839
that's being a pain. It's actually the
 

1749
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,349
that's being a pain. It's actually the
buyer

1750
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:27,359
buyer
 

1751
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,510
buyer
when he should show that impetus and go.

1752
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
when he should show that impetus and go.
 

1753
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,069
when he should show that impetus and go.
He's he's he's pulling his bids lower

1754
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079
He's he's he's pulling his bids lower
 

1755
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,069
He's he's he's pulling his bids lower
instead of chasing up. So, I want to be

1756
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
instead of chasing up. So, I want to be
 

1757
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,190
instead of chasing up. So, I want to be
a little bit careful. I've already

1758
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,200
a little bit careful. I've already
 

1759
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,150
a little bit careful. I've already
partialed some out into these 45s. Now,

1760
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
partialed some out into these 45s. Now,
 

1761
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,630
partialed some out into these 45s. Now,
that gray box held though. All right.

1762
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
that gray box held though. All right.
 

1763
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,069
that gray box held though. All right.
So, we flipped this gray box. We came

1764
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:42,079
So, we flipped this gray box. We came
 

1765
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,309
So, we flipped this gray box. We came
into the blue. This wasn't the best low

1766
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:44,319
into the blue. This wasn't the best low
 

1767
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,750
into the blue. This wasn't the best low
of auction. Going to be honest. I would

1768
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:45,760
of auction. Going to be honest. I would
 

1769
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,190
of auction. Going to be honest. I would
have liked to seen more sellers trapped

1770
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
have liked to seen more sellers trapped
 

1771
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,430
have liked to seen more sellers trapped
down there. Got above gray. Hell gray

1772
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
down there. Got above gray. Hell gray
 

1773
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,030
down there. Got above gray. Hell gray
into this imbalance. All right. We're

1774
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,040
into this imbalance. All right. We're
 

1775
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,270
into this imbalance. All right. We're
selling most of our money now. And let's

1776
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
selling most of our money now. And let's
 

1777
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,870
selling most of our money now. And let's
see if we can get up into this for an

1778
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:54,880
see if we can get up into this for an
 

1779
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,750
see if we can get up into this for an
extension today. But the move was highly

1780
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:57,760
extension today. But the move was highly
 

1781
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,829
extension today. But the move was highly
probable to come and fill this once we

1782
00:41:59,829 --> 00:41:59,839
probable to come and fill this once we
 

1783
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,990
probable to come and fill this once we
held this. I don't know what happens

1784
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,000
held this. I don't know what happens
 

1785
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,589
held this. I don't know what happens
now, folks. It depends on this guy on

1786
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:03,599
now, folks. It depends on this guy on
 

1787
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,349
now, folks. It depends on this guy on
the tape if he wants to play ball. Mag's

1788
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,359
the tape if he wants to play ball. Mag's
 

1789
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,069
the tape if he wants to play ball. Mag's
looking good. Microsoft and Apple red.

1790
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
looking good. Microsoft and Apple red.
 

1791
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,950
looking good. Microsoft and Apple red.
The rest of the mag green now. How much

1792
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
The rest of the mag green now. How much
 

1793
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,750
The rest of the mag green now. How much
aggression have they got? Probably not a

1794
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:13,760
aggression have they got? Probably not a
 

1795
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,390
aggression have they got? Probably not a
lot in a holiday week, but uh there we

1796
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
lot in a holiday week, but uh there we
 

1797
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,230
lot in a holiday week, but uh there we
go.

1798
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:20,240

 

1799
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,510

left without you, Raph. Yeah, it was

1800
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,520
left without you, Raph. Yeah, it was
 

1801
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,750
left without you, Raph. Yeah, it was
tricky. It was tricky. I almost cut it

1802
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
tricky. It was tricky. I almost cut it
 

1803
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,309
tricky. It was tricky. I almost cut it
the second time round. I'll be honest. I

1804
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:26,319
the second time round. I'll be honest. I
 

1805
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,589
the second time round. I'll be honest. I
was had my stop just under PC. Okay,

1806
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
was had my stop just under PC. Okay,
 

1807
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,349
was had my stop just under PC. Okay,
I'll cut this if it can't hold. I didn't

1808
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
I'll cut this if it can't hold. I didn't
 

1809
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,990
I'll cut this if it can't hold. I didn't
read add heavy because I don't like this

1810
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
read add heavy because I don't like this
 

1811
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,750
read add heavy because I don't like this
buy on the tape. You can see now like

1812
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:37,760
buy on the tape. You can see now like
 

1813
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,750
buy on the tape. You can see now like
he's juggling. Don't like what he's

1814
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:39,760
he's juggling. Don't like what he's
 

1815
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,829
he's juggling. Don't like what he's
doing.

1816
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:43,839

 

1817
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,910

When I say he's juggling, what I mean is

1818
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
When I say he's juggling, what I mean is
 

1819
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,550
When I say he's juggling, what I mean is
he puts a firm level in and when he

1820
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,560
he puts a firm level in and when he
 

1821
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,790
he puts a firm level in and when he
should move up and support the bid, he's

1822
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:50,800
should move up and support the bid, he's
 

1823
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,550
should move up and support the bid, he's
actually moving down and then when it

1824
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:52,560
actually moving down and then when it
 

1825
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,990
actually moving down and then when it
comes down, then he's getting aggressive

1826
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,000
comes down, then he's getting aggressive
 

1827
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,030
comes down, then he's getting aggressive
and then he's pulling and then he's

1828
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,040
and then he's pulling and then he's
 

1829
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,870
and then he's pulling and then he's
getting aggressive. So, he's like moving

1830
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
getting aggressive. So, he's like moving
 

1831
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,630
getting aggressive. So, he's like moving
in and out pretty quickly rather than

1832
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:58,640
in and out pretty quickly rather than
 

1833
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,309
in and out pretty quickly rather than
putting his flag in the ground and

1834
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:00,319
putting his flag in the ground and
 

1835
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,309
putting his flag in the ground and
saying, "Hey, I'm holding this and I'm

1836
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:02,319
saying, "Hey, I'm holding this and I'm
 

1837
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,510
saying, "Hey, I'm holding this and I'm
going to start bidding above this

1838
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:03,520
going to start bidding above this
 

1839
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,950
going to start bidding above this
aggressively to get to where I want to

1840
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:04,960
aggressively to get to where I want to
 

1841
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,870
aggressively to get to where I want to
go." He's not I'm not seeing that kind

1842
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
go." He's not I'm not seeing that kind
 

1843
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,589
go." He's not I'm not seeing that kind
of aggression. And the one thing I'd say

1844
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:09,599
of aggression. And the one thing I'd say
 

1845
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,309
of aggression. And the one thing I'd say
the low of day I it's not shorts trapped

1846
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
the low of day I it's not shorts trapped
 

1847
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,550
the low of day I it's not shorts trapped
at the low of day right we've got shorts

1848
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,560
at the low of day right we've got shorts
 

1849
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,069
at the low of day right we've got shorts
trapped from sort of 97 to 92 and then a

1850
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:18,079
trapped from sort of 97 to 92 and then a
 

1851

you can see the transition in tape but
it's not like we we've got a lot caught

it's not like we we've got a lot caught

we go. Can we see any more upside?

00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:54,400
we go. Can we see any more upside?
 

1879
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,390
we go. Can we see any more upside?
Can you guys get back through to the

Can you guys get back through to the

upside? Can you get back over the New

1885
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,670

There's uh the last big seller above us

There's uh the last big seller above us
 

1887
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,230
There's uh the last big seller above us
was at 760. So just be careful in case

1888
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
was at 760. So just be careful in case
 

1889
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:23,510
was at 760. So just be careful in case
he reloads at 760. [snorts]

Here we go. All right, let's see if we

Here we go. All right, let's see if we
 

1893
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,630
Here we go. All right, let's see if we
can get to 60 and then through that

1894
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
can get to 60 and then through that
 

1895
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,990
can get to 60 and then through that
we're going to see if we can get to 80.

we're going to see if we can get to 80.
 

1897
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,950
we're going to see if we can get to 80.
And then through that, we're going to

00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:28,960
And then through that, we're going to
 

1899
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,069
And then through that, we're going to
see if we can get a high day.

1900
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:32,079
see if we can get a high day.
 

1901
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,589

Like I said, wanted to be bullish today

1902
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:33,599
Like I said, wanted to be bullish today

Like I said, wanted to be bullish today
on dips. Blue box was the area. Didn't

1904
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:36,079
on dips. Blue box was the area. Didn't
 

1905
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,670
on dips. Blue box was the area. Didn't
love the end of the auction down there.

1906
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
love the end of the auction down there.
 

1907
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,270
love the end of the auction down there.
It's a shame we didn't dip a little bit

1908
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,280
It's a shame we didn't dip a little bit
 

1909
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,550
It's a shame we didn't dip a little bit
lower, but there we go.

1910
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
lower, but there we go.
 

1911
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,470
lower, but there we go.
We look good here. Buyers just got

1912
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:44,480
We look good here. Buyers just got
 

1913
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,670
We look good here. Buyers just got
caught in that last little push. I want

1914
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:45,680
caught in that last little push. I want
 

1915
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,190
caught in that last little push. I want
to see push through now because they all

1916
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,200
to see push through now because they all
 

1917
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,870
to see push through now because they all
know there's a big seller who's been up

1918
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
know there's a big seller who's been up
 

1919
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,030
know there's a big seller who's been up
there at 60. Buyers just got a little

1920
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
there at 60. Buyers just got a little
 

1921
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,109
there at 60. Buyers just got a little
bit stuck here at 50s. Come on. You got

1922
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:53,119
bit stuck here at 50s. Come on. You got
 

1923
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,190
bit stuck here at 50s. Come on. You got
to reload and push 60. Come on. Come on.

1924
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:57,200
to reload and push 60. Come on. Come on.
 

1925
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,910
to reload and push 60. Come on. Come on.
Don't get stuck up here.

1926
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
Don't get stuck up here.
 

1927
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,430
Don't get stuck up here.
I need to see acceleration. I need to

1928
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:01,440
I need to see acceleration. I need to
 

1929
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,190
I need to see acceleration. I need to
see it now into this 60, please. And

1930
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:05,200
see it now into this 60, please. And
 

1931
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,710
see it now into this 60, please. And
then get through to 80s. They're

1932
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:06,720
then get through to 80s. They're
 

1933
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,790
then get through to 80s. They're
reloading 60s, these sellers. Okay, so

1934
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:08,800
reloading 60s, these sellers. Okay, so
 

1935
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,390
reloading 60s, these sellers. Okay, so
60 is definitely a level. We got to get

1936
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:10,400
60 is definitely a level. We got to get
 

1937
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,390
60 is definitely a level. We got to get
back over 60s now. Definitely a level.

1938
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,400
back over 60s now. Definitely a level.
 

1939
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,430
back over 60s now. Definitely a level.
We got to get over 60s up into 80s. ES

1940
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
We got to get over 60s up into 80s. ES
 

1941
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,109
We got to get over 60s up into 80s. ES
looking good. And once we do that, we

1942
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:19,119
looking good. And once we do that, we
 

1943
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,349
looking good. And once we do that, we
can look for this New York open 80s and

1944
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
can look for this New York open 80s and
 

1945
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,750
can look for this New York open 80s and
then high of day. Battle here though.

1946
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
then high of day. Battle here though.
 

1947
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,510
then high of day. Battle here though.
Definitely sellers coming in in front of

1948
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:25,520
Definitely sellers coming in in front of
 

1949
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,109
Definitely sellers coming in in front of
60s right now. I think if we get through

1950
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:27,119
60s right now. I think if we get through
 

1951
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,710
60s right now. I think if we get through
that there's a squeeze otherwise there

1952
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
that there's a squeeze otherwise there
 

1953
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,589
that there's a squeeze otherwise there
there's a pullback due here into this

1954
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:31,599
there's a pullback due here into this
 

1955
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,349
there's a pullback due here into this
probably into this kind of shelf here

1956
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359
probably into this kind of shelf here
 

1957
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,349
probably into this kind of shelf here
into 30s. So we got to try and get

1958
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:35,359
into 30s. So we got to try and get
 

1959
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,150
into 30s. So we got to try and get
through 60s basically here there was a

1960
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
through 60s basically here there was a
 

1961
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,230
through 60s basically here there was a
big seller. All right when we broke down

1962
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:40,240
big seller. All right when we broke down
 

1963
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,550
big seller. All right when we broke down
from here he's still here at the moment

1964
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:42,560
from here he's still here at the moment
 

1965
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,030
from here he's still here at the moment
being protected. So maybe this happens

1966
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
being protected. So maybe this happens
 

1967
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,030
being protected. So maybe this happens
maybe they squeeze through. So I'm still

1968
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,040
maybe they squeeze through. So I'm still
 

1969
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,430
maybe they squeeze through. So I'm still
bullish.

1970
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
bullish.
 

1971
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,349
bullish.
I don't want them to pull back too far.

1972
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
I don't want them to pull back too far.
 

1973
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,270
I don't want them to pull back too far.
Just I'd love a rip. I would just love a

1974
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,280
Just I'd love a rip. I would just love a
 

1975
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,109
Just I'd love a rip. I would just love a
straight rip. But at the moment, I'd say

1976
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
straight rip. But at the moment, I'd say
 

1977
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,710
straight rip. But at the moment, I'd say
buyers over 54s keep getting stuck.

1978
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:58,720
buyers over 54s keep getting stuck.
 

1979
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,589
buyers over 54s keep getting stuck.
We might need a pullback here

1980
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
We might need a pullback here
 

1981
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,190
We might need a pullback here
and then see if they reabsorb the

1982
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,200
and then see if they reabsorb the
 

1983
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,990
and then see if they reabsorb the
pullback that comes.

1984
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,000
pullback that comes.
 

1985
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,870
pullback that comes.
You'd really want pullbacks to hold 30s.

1986
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:08,880
You'd really want pullbacks to hold 30s.
 

1987
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,510
You'd really want pullbacks to hold 30s.
Wouldn't want it under 30s.

1988
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,520

 

1989
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,510

Nice. Pass pasta on this.

1990
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:15,520
Nice. Pass pasta on this.
 

1991
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:23,349
Nice. Pass pasta on this.
Congratulations.

1992
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:23,359

 

1993
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,710

Here we come. Can we hold ideally 30s?

1994
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
Here we come. Can we hold ideally 30s?
 

1995
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,230
Here we come. Can we hold ideally 30s?
That kind of level. We've got a pretty

1996
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,240
That kind of level. We've got a pretty
 

1997
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,390
That kind of level. We've got a pretty
good shelf here around there. Somewhere

1998
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:30,400
good shelf here around there. Somewhere
 

1999
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,430
good shelf here around there. Somewhere
around here would be good for a

2000
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
around here would be good for a
 

2001
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,950
around here would be good for a
pullback. We just need to be careful

2002
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
pullback. We just need to be careful
 

2003
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,030
pullback. We just need to be careful
because if they sell back under here,

2004
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
because if they sell back under here,
 

2005
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,309
because if they sell back under here,
right? If they do something like this,

2006
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:36,319
right? If they do something like this,
 

2007
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,990
right? If they do something like this,
I'd become uninterested, especially

2008
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,000
I'd become uninterested, especially
 

2009
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,230
I'd become uninterested, especially
because of this low of day is not the

2010
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,240
because of this low of day is not the
 

2011
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,069
because of this low of day is not the
best low of day I've ever seen.

2012
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:44,079
best low of day I've ever seen.
 

2013
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,829
best low of day I've ever seen.
If I was a seller, I'd be reselling

2014
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
If I was a seller, I'd be reselling
 

2015
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,589
If I was a seller, I'd be reselling
this.

2016
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
this.
 

2017
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,030
this.
If I was a seller, I would be trying to

2018
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:49,040
If I was a seller, I would be trying to
 

2019
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,670
If I was a seller, I would be trying to
resell this in fairness. I think about

2020
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:51,680
resell this in fairness. I think about
 

2021
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,309
resell this in fairness. I think about
how we opened, flush, built liquidity,

2022
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:54,319
how we opened, flush, built liquidity,
 

2023
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,990
how we opened, flush, built liquidity,
but I think there's a chance to move

2024
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
but I think there's a chance to move
 

2025
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,670
but I think there's a chance to move
higher today. So, that's why I'm trying

2026
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,680
higher today. So, that's why I'm trying
 

2027
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,750
higher today. So, that's why I'm trying
to play that side rather than the

2028
00:46:59,750 --> 00:46:59,760
to play that side rather than the
 

2029
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,670
to play that side rather than the
counter trend at the moment. Here they

2030
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:01,680
counter trend at the moment. Here they
 

2031
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,790
counter trend at the moment. Here they
go. So, I'm going to test these buyers

2032
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
go. So, I'm going to test these buyers
 

2033
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,150
go. So, I'm going to test these buyers
at 50. What was that level? 54s. They

2034
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,160
at 50. What was that level? 54s. They
 

2035
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,829
at 50. What was that level? 54s. They
keep getting trapped at 54s. If we get

2036
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:07,839
keep getting trapped at 54s. If we get
 

2037
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,230
keep getting trapped at 54s. If we get
over 54s, we should go 60s. We get over

2038
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:10,240
over 54s, we should go 60s. We get over
 

2039
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,550
over 54s, we should go 60s. We get over
60s, we go 80s. We get over 80s, we go

2040
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:12,560
60s, we go 80s. We get over 80s, we go
 

2041
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,309
60s, we go 80s. We get over 80s, we go
high day. And then we can think about

2042
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
high day. And then we can think about
 

2043
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,670
high day. And then we can think about
this gray box above, right? Just manage

2044
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
this gray box above, right? Just manage
 

2045
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,190
this gray box above, right? Just manage
manage the trade that you're currently

2046
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:19,200
manage the trade that you're currently
 

2047
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,790
manage the trade that you're currently
in. You should be sort of managing this

2048
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:20,800
in. You should be sort of managing this
 

2049
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,430
in. You should be sort of managing this
trade right now. Again, I don't think

2050
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:23,440
trade right now. Again, I don't think
 

2051
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,550
trade right now. Again, I don't think
you want it back below 30s, 25s and 30s.

2052
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:26,560
you want it back below 30s, 25s and 30s.
 

2053
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,910
you want it back below 30s, 25s and 30s.
You don't want it back into there. You

2054
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:27,920
You don't want it back into there. You
 

2055
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,109
You don't want it back into there. You
need to see them absorb that level.

2056
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:31,119
need to see them absorb that level.
 

2057
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,790
need to see them absorb that level.
Nice. I think we're going to go here. ES

Nice. I think we're going to go here. ES

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,630
Nice. I think we're going to go here. ES

Where are we looking on the ETFs? Got to

Where are we looking on the ETFs? Got to
 

2065

Where are we looking on the ETFs? Got to
watch 85 here on the spiders. It's

00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,200
watch 85 here on the spiders. It's
 

2067
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:51,910
watch 85 here on the spiders. It's
probably a gamma level. His

still going to manage this trade because
it wants to move higher. I will still

it wants to move higher. I will still

00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,670
it wants to move higher. I will still
sit in it. But we've got to we've got to

sit in it. But we've got to we've got to
 

2109
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,670
sit in it. But we've got to we've got to
come and break uh 54s here. It's where

2110
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
come and break uh 54s here. It's where
 

2111
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,870
come and break uh 54s here. It's where
the buyers keep getting trapped. We

the buyers keep getting trapped. We
 

2113
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,870
the buyers keep getting trapped. We
break that, we go 60s, we break that, we

00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:44,880
break that, we go 60s, we break that, we

should we should really get up towards
 

2117
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,069
should we should really get up towards
the highs at that point. So it's 55

the highs at that point. So it's 55
 

2119

00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
caught up here. The longer we're caught
 

2153
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,309
caught up here. The longer we're caught
up here without moving higher will be a

2154
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:30,319
up here without moving higher will be a
 

2155
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,069
up here without moving higher will be a
problem. We've developed another little

2156
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:32,079
problem. We've developed another little
 

2157
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,510
problem. We've developed another little
shelf here into 50 now as well.

2158
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
shelf here into 50 now as well.
 

2159
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,109
shelf here into 50 now as well.
And we have an imbalance all the way

2160
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:37,119
And we have an imbalance all the way
 

2161
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,510
And we have an imbalance all the way
down to 37 which I'm also aware of. We

2162
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
down to 37 which I'm also aware of. We
 

2163
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,230
down to 37 which I'm also aware of. We
might need to come and fill.

2164
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
might need to come and fill.
 

2165
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,309
might need to come and fill.
Don't like what I'm seeing here. These

2166
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:44,319
Don't like what I'm seeing here. These
 

2167
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,069
Don't like what I'm seeing here. These
buyers got to step in and step in soon.

2168
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:46,079
buyers got to step in and step in soon.
 

2169
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,589
buyers got to step in and step in soon.
They're having another go up here. Are

2170
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
They're having another go up here. Are
 

2171
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,589
They're having another go up here. Are
they into these 55s and 60s again? Can

2172
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
they into these 55s and 60s again? Can
 

2173
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,430
they into these 55s and 60s again? Can
we see acceleration through 55s and 60s?

2174
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
we see acceleration through 55s and 60s?
 

2175
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,790
we see acceleration through 55s and 60s?
Getting ready to sell if we can't

2176
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:56,800
Getting ready to sell if we can't
 

2177
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,309
Getting ready to sell if we can't
because there's a refresh seller up here

2178
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
because there's a refresh seller up here
 

2179
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:05,589
because there's a refresh seller up here
into 55 again.

2180
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:05,599

 

2181
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,950

Can't keep getting trapped up here

2182
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:06,960
Can't keep getting trapped up here
 

2183
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,630
Can't keep getting trapped up here
without a move higher. We will get

2184
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
without a move higher. We will get
 

2185
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,230
without a move higher. We will get
stuck. If they keep getting trapped up

2186
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:10,240
stuck. If they keep getting trapped up
 

2187
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,670
stuck. If they keep getting trapped up
here without that acceleration, we're

2188
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:11,680
here without that acceleration, we're
 

2189
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,670
here without that acceleration, we're
going to get stuck.

2190
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:15,680

 

2191
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,190

There's the cell starting to get sucked.

2192
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:17,200
There's the cell starting to get sucked.
 

2193
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,870
There's the cell starting to get sucked.
So, into this imbalance, this imbalance

2194
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880
So, into this imbalance, this imbalance
 

2195
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,829
So, into this imbalance, this imbalance
is down to 37s. If they don't absorb 30s

2196
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:21,839
is down to 37s. If they don't absorb 30s
 

2197
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,270
is down to 37s. If they don't absorb 30s
amounts, like I said, if they don't

2198
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
amounts, like I said, if they don't
 

2199
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,870
amounts, like I said, if they don't
absorb around 30's amount, here's the

2200
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:24,880
absorb around 30's amount, here's the
 

2201
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,030
absorb around 30's amount, here's the
cell. Here's the last chance for them to

2202
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:27,040
cell. Here's the last chance for them to
 

2203
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:34,549
cell. Here's the last chance for them to
absorb. Otherwise, I'm out.

2204
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:34,559

2209
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,430
the S and the spiders. Now and ever. Now
and ever. I'm out. Don't like what I'm

2210
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:41,440
and ever. I'm out. Don't like what I'm
 

2211
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,549
and ever. I'm out. Don't like what I'm
seeing. Cut. There we go. They have the

2212
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:44,559
seeing. Cut. There we go. They have the
 

2213
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,109

chance. Can always get back in. Can

2214
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
chance. Can always get back in. Can
 

2215
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,870
chance. Can always get back in. Can
always get back in.

2216
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880

 

2217
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,710

So all that was was buyers getting stuck

2218
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:54,720
So all that was was buyers getting stuck
 

2219
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,710
So all that was was buyers getting stuck
up here. That 55s and 60s. I kept

2220
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:56,720
up here. That 55s and 60s. I kept
 

2221
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,549
up here. That 55s and 60s. I kept
talking about 60s was the level we built

2222
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:58,559
talking about 60s was the level we built
 

2223
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,870
talking about 60s was the level we built
this sort of shelf out. 60 was the old

2224
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
this sort of shelf out. 60 was the old
 

2225
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,190
this sort of shelf out. 60 was the old
level where there was a big seller right

2226
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:03,200
level where there was a big seller right
 

2227
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,589
level where there was a big seller right
where we broke down from and they kept

2228
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:05,599
where we broke down from and they kept
 

2229
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,030
where we broke down from and they kept
trying. These buyers kept trying up

2230
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
trying. These buyers kept trying up
 

2231
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,390
trying. These buyers kept trying up
here. This is what we didn't see up

2232
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:08,400
here. This is what we didn't see up
 

2233
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,150
here. This is what we didn't see up
here. Buyers kept trying up here failed.

2234
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:10,160
here. Buyers kept trying up here failed.
 

2235
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,910
here. Buyers kept trying up here failed.
So, we've returned back in. Might come

2236
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920
So, we've returned back in. Might come
 

2237
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,549
So, we've returned back in. Might come
all the way down now. So, flat on this

2238
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:14,559
all the way down now. So, flat on this
 

2239
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:21,430
all the way down now. So, flat on this
now and now we just wait.

2240
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:21,440

 

2241
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,270

The only thing I'd say the low of day,

2242
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:23,280
The only thing I'd say the low of day,
 

2243
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,190
The only thing I'd say the low of day,
like I said, doesn't feel uh

2244
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
like I said, doesn't feel uh
 

2245
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,430
like I said, doesn't feel uh
don't feel too good to me.

2246
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
don't feel too good to me.
 

2247
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,870
don't feel too good to me.
Don't think there's much excess down

2248
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:30,880
Don't think there's much excess down
 

2249
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:49,349
Don't think there's much excess down
there.

2250
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359

 

2251
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,549

Just want to have a quick look at the

2252
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:50,559
Just want to have a quick look at the
 

2253
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,510
Just want to have a quick look at the
mag here. What's going on?

2254
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:53,520

Not too good.

Good.

2262

2263
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,030

I can't fill that. That looks bad. Okay.

2264
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:19,040
I can't fill that. That looks bad. Okay.
 

2265
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,430
I can't fill that. That looks bad. Okay.
Mix bag out there right now.

2266
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:23,440

 

2267
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,630

All

2268
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:28,640

 

2269
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:42,470

right, view up holding there.

2270
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480

 

2271
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,630

I'd say more buyers got stuck at this uh

2272
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:44,640
I'd say more buyers got stuck at this uh
 

2273
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,470
I'd say more buyers got stuck at this uh
little pivot high we've had than sellers

2274
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:46,480
little pivot high we've had than sellers
 

2275
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,790
little pivot high we've had than sellers
at the low. So,

2276
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:48,800
at the low. So,
 

2277
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,390
at the low. So,
we might just get stuck here for a

2278
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,400
we might just get stuck here for a
 

2279
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,069
we might just get stuck here for a
while.

2280
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079

 

2281
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,670

Yeah, I'm try. Yeah, sorry. I just see

I don't execute on Trading View, but I
 

2291
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,630
I don't execute on Trading View, but I
can't teach on Ninja Trader. The drawing

2292
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
can't teach on Ninja Trader. The drawing
 

2293
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,870
can't teach on Ninja Trader. The drawing
tools are nowhere near as good and I

2294
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
tools are nowhere near as good and I
 

2295
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,950

can't flick around through the ETFs or

00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:12,960
can't flick around through the ETFs or
 

2297
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,470
can't flick around through the ETFs or

2298
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,480
through the uh stocks on Ninja Trader.

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,829

All right, so we are holding VW up.

2300
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:17,839
All right, so we are holding VW up.
 

2301
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:18,950
All right, so we are holding VW up.
We're going to come and test value area

2302
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
We're going to come and test value area
 

2303
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,870
We're going to come and test value area
high probably around 30 35. That was the

2304
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:20,880
high probably around 30 35. That was the
 

2305
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,950
high probably around 30 35. That was the
overunder before on the way down. So the

2306
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
overunder before on the way down. So the
 

2307
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,109
overunder before on the way down. So the
question is, can they uh reclaim that or

2308
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
question is, can they uh reclaim that or
 

2309
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,670
question is, can they uh reclaim that or
not?

2310
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:29,680

 

2311
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,510

Would I consider entering a buy again?

2312
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:31,520
Would I consider entering a buy again?
 

2313
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,190
Would I consider entering a buy again?
Yeah, if it I consider doing anything if

2314
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200
Yeah, if it I consider doing anything if
 

2315
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,510
Yeah, if it I consider doing anything if
it sets up. But right now, you know,

2316
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:35,520
it sets up. But right now, you know,
 

2317
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,510
it sets up. But right now, you know,
what do we have? Buyers caught the

2318
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:37,520
what do we have? Buyers caught the
 

2319
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,030
what do we have? Buyers caught the
highest. Could we find acceptance back

2320
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,040
highest. Could we find acceptance back
 

2321
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,109
highest. Could we find acceptance back
into here? No. So, what are we doing?

2322
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:41,119
into here? No. So, what are we doing?
 

2323
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,510
into here? No. So, what are we doing?
Buyers caught rotation. Maybe they come

2324
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,520
Buyers caught rotation. Maybe they come
 

2325
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,190
Buyers caught rotation. Maybe they come
and resell this. Do I like this low of

2326
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:45,200
and resell this. Do I like this low of
 

2327
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,710
and resell this. Do I like this low of
day? Like I said, no. I don't think it's

2328
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,720
day? Like I said, no. I don't think it's
 

2329
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,549
day? Like I said, no. I don't think it's
a good low of day. So, I'm not going to

2330
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
a good low of day. So, I'm not going to
 

2331
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,069
a good low of day. So, I'm not going to
bid on this in the midpoint of the

2332
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:50,079
bid on this in the midpoint of the
 

2333
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,150
bid on this in the midpoint of the
range. If I see sellers come in here and

2334
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:52,160
range. If I see sellers come in here and
 

2335
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,829
range. If I see sellers come in here and
get stuck, then we can think about it.

2336
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:55,839
get stuck, then we can think about it.
 

2337
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,030
get stuck, then we can think about it.
You know, we're not going to buy for no

2338
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,040
You know, we're not going to buy for no
 

2339
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,230
You know, we're not going to buy for no
reason. Look at the flow zones. They're

2340
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
reason. Look at the flow zones. They're
 

2341
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,510
reason. Look at the flow zones. They're
all flattened. They have the chance to

2342
00:53:59,510 --> 00:53:59,520
all flattened. They have the chance to
 

2343
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,030
all flattened. They have the chance to
hold and absorb. They had the chance to

2344
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,040
hold and absorb. They had the chance to
 

2345
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,710
hold and absorb. They had the chance to
hold the upside of this and absorb.

2346
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:02,720
hold the upside of this and absorb.
 

2347
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,030
hold the upside of this and absorb.
They're not doing it right. So, no

2348
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:05,040
They're not doing it right. So, no
 

2349
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,670
They're not doing it right. So, no
random setups. We trade actual setups.

2350
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:07,680
random setups. We trade actual setups.
 

2351
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:21,910
random setups. We trade actual setups.
There's no setup right now to trade.

2352
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:21,920

 

2353
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,270

And we couldn't even get up to the New

2354
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,280
And we couldn't even get up to the New
 

2355
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,349
And we couldn't even get up to the New
York open. So weakness actually in the

2356
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:25,359
York open. So weakness actually in the
 

2357
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,910
York open. So weakness actually in the
cues. Actual weakness. And I wouldn't be

2358
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:27,920
cues. Actual weakness. And I wouldn't be
 

2359
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,670
cues. Actual weakness. And I wouldn't be
surprised if they put in a new low of

2360
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:29,680
surprised if they put in a new low of
 

2361
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,510
surprised if they put in a new low of
day because that low of day, like I

2362
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
day because that low of day, like I
 

2363
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,950
day because that low of day, like I
said, I don't like the low of the

2364
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:32,960
said, I don't like the low of the
 

2365
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,950
said, I don't like the low of the
auction. It doesn't look very good to me

2366
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
auction. It doesn't look very good to me
 

2367
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,549
auction. It doesn't look very good to me
down there, which is why I wasn't like

2368
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:36,559
down there, which is why I wasn't like
 

2369
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,270
down there, which is why I wasn't like
heavy heavy in size this morning.

2370
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280

 

2371
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,790

Point control going to be tested here.

2372
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:42,800
Point control going to be tested here.
 

2373
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,309
Point control going to be tested here.
And if they get under that, probably a

2374
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:44,319
And if they get under that, probably a
 

2375
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:51,510
And if they get under that, probably a
new low day, but we will see.

2376
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:51,520

 

2377
00:54:51,520 --> 00:55:01,030

Micro shelf here at 20s again.

2378
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:01,040

 

2379
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,750

Oh, might be a tough few days if they're

2380
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,760
Oh, might be a tough few days if they're
 

2381
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,829
Oh, might be a tough few days if they're
going to do this with these like

2382
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:05,839
going to do this with these like
 

2383
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,109
going to do this with these like
stacking these bids and then pulling

2384
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:07,119
stacking these bids and then pulling
 

2385
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,030
stacking these bids and then pulling
them. But we will see.

2386
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:09,040
them. But we will see.
 

2387
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,270
them. But we will see.
We thought it would be light. So, we're

2388
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
We thought it would be light. So, we're
 

2389
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,549
We thought it would be light. So, we're
getting what we expected.

2390
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559

 

2391
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,109

That 30 level is big old level right

2392
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
That 30 level is big old level right
 

2393
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,710
That 30 level is big old level right
now.

2394
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:20,720
now.
 

2395
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,390
now.
It's where the buyers just got stuck

2396
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,400
It's where the buyers just got stuck
 

2397
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,910
It's where the buyers just got stuck
because they had the chance to hold it

2398
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:23,920
because they had the chance to hold it
 

2399
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,870
because they had the chance to hold it
on the dip back in and they didn't. So,

2400
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:26,880
on the dip back in and they didn't. So,
 

2401
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,349
on the dip back in and they didn't. So,
sell side is basically from 15 down to

2402
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:29,359
sell side is basically from 15 down to
 

2403
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,470
sell side is basically from 15 down to
94s. Buy side is basically from 20s up

2404
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
94s. Buy side is basically from 20s up
 

2405
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,190
94s. Buy side is basically from 20s up
to 33s. So,

2406
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
to 33s. So,
 

2407
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,390
to 33s. So,
we're right in the middle of that

2408
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:36,400
we're right in the middle of that
 

2409
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:42,069
we're right in the middle of that
balance now.

2410
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079

 

2411
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,589

Look at this buying on the tape. It's

2412
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
Look at this buying on the tape. It's
 

2413
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,270
Look at this buying on the tape. It's
awful. It's awful what they're doing.

2414
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,280
awful. It's awful what they're doing.
 

2415
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,353
awful. It's awful what they're doing.
They're [\h__\h] about this morning.

2416
00:55:50,353 --> 00:55:50,363
They're [\h__\h] about this morning.
 

2417
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:51,270
They're [\h__\h] about this morning.
[snorts]

2418
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,280
[snorts]
 

2419
00:55:51,280 --> 00:56:00,069
[snorts]
They are [\h__\h] around.

2420
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079

 

2421
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,349

You're only looking for a previous day

2422
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:01,359
You're only looking for a previous day
 

2423
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,710
You're only looking for a previous day
value area high test. I mean, it would

2424
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
value area high test. I mean, it would
 

2425
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,630
value area high test. I mean, it would
be a great level to bid off if we get

2426
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:04,640
be a great level to bid off if we get
 

2427
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,270
be a great level to bid off if we get
there. be fantastic level to bid off at

2428
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
there. be fantastic level to bid off at
 

2429
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,069
there. be fantastic level to bid off at
if we get there. But uh at the moment,

2430
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
if we get there. But uh at the moment,
 

2431
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,109
if we get there. But uh at the moment,
you know, you're going to have to need

2432
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
you know, you're going to have to need
 

2433
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,950
you know, you're going to have to need
it to get under previous week close,

2434
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
it to get under previous week close,
 

2435
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,990
it to get under previous week close,
previous day close. GlobeEx,

2436
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
previous day close. GlobeEx,
 

2437
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,150
previous day close. GlobeEx,
it's quite it's quite a big ask at the

2438
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
it's quite it's quite a big ask at the
 

2439
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,990
it's quite it's quite a big ask at the
moment, but you know, maybe if we start

2440
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
moment, but you know, maybe if we start
 

2441
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,910
moment, but you know, maybe if we start
getting stuck.

2442
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:21,920
getting stuck.
 

2443
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,349
getting stuck.
Oh, don't do that. Maybe you get it. You

2444
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
Oh, don't do that. Maybe you get it. You
 

2445
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,789
Oh, don't do that. Maybe you get it. You
know, if we start getting stuck down

2446
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:26,799
know, if we start getting stuck down
 

2447
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,349
know, if we start getting stuck down
here and too many pile in, maybe you get

2448
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
here and too many pile in, maybe you get
 

2449
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,549
here and too many pile in, maybe you get
something like that. I mean, that would

2450
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
something like that. I mean, that would
 

2451
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,390
something like that. I mean, that would
be a great area to bid off. I'm with I'm

2452
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
be a great area to bid off. I'm with I'm
 

2453
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,950
be a great area to bid off. I'm with I'm
with you. It's why it's highlighted, but

2454
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,960
with you. It's why it's highlighted, but
 

2455
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,910
with you. It's why it's highlighted, but
I'm not convinced we get down there if

2456
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:37,920
I'm not convinced we get down there if
 

2457
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,589
I'm not convinced we get down there if
I'm honest. It would be great if we did.

2458
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:43,599

gap up. We're into like a volume week.
 

2465
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,069
gap up. We're into like a volume week.
You just wonder like are there going to

2466
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:52,079
You just wonder like are there going to
 

2467
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,910
You just wonder like are there going to
be any bears to sell it down that far?

2468
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:53,920
be any bears to sell it down that far?
 

2469
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,990
be any bears to sell it down that far?
It' be nice if there was. I would love

2470
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,000
It' be nice if there was. I would love

00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,430
to bid back off there with you as well.
It's why it's highlighted. It's

2474
00:56:59,430 --> 00:56:59,440
It's why it's highlighted. It's
 

2475
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,024
It's why it's highlighted. It's
definitely a level of interest.

2476
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:05,034

 

2477
00:57:05,034 --> 00:57:11,430

>> [clears throat]

2478
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:11,440

 

2479
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,670

>> back to these 30s probably towards these

2480
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:13,680
>> back to these 30s probably towards these
 

2481
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,430
>> back to these 30s probably towards these
30s where these buyers have been getting

2482
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,440
30s where these buyers have been getting
 

2483
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,270
30s where these buyers have been getting
stuck. We if we reclaim that we're going

2484
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,280
stuck. We if we reclaim that we're going
 

2485
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,870
stuck. We if we reclaim that we're going
to go. So, it's just it's a little bit

2486
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:20,880
to go. So, it's just it's a little bit
 

2487
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,349
to go. So, it's just it's a little bit
messy at the moment on the tape. Right.

2488
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:23,359
messy at the moment on the tape. Right.
 

2489
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:39,109
messy at the moment on the tape. Right.
The tape is a little bit messy.

2490
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:39,119

 

2491
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,870

Yeah, look at these buyers down below

2492
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:40,880
Yeah, look at these buyers down below
 

2493
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,789
Yeah, look at these buyers down below
like pulling constantly, mate.

2494
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
like pulling constantly, mate.
 

2495
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,710
like pulling constantly, mate.
Puts me off trading when it's like this,

2496
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,720
Puts me off trading when it's like this,
 

2497
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,990
Puts me off trading when it's like this,
honestly.

2498
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,000

 

2499
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,430

Test these 30s and 35s again. Are they?

2500
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440

 

2501
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,829

I still hear these sellers. They're

2502
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
I still hear these sellers. They're
 

2503
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,270
I still hear these sellers. They're
stacked against where those buyers are

2504
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
stacked against where those buyers are
 

2505
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,829
stacked against where those buyers are
caught. So, I think two things have

2506
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:03,839
caught. So, I think two things have
 

2507
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:07,510
caught. So, I think two things have
happened today. We passively sold uh 45s

2508
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:07,520
happened today. We passively sold uh 45s
 

2509
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,349
happened today. We passively sold uh 45s
and above. We're now passively selling

2510
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359
and above. We're now passively selling
 

2511
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,470
and above. We're now passively selling
25s and above. There are buyers on the

2512
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
25s and above. There are buyers on the
 

2513
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,309
25s and above. There are buyers on the
tape, but they keep pulling their

2514
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:14,319
tape, but they keep pulling their
 

2515
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,750
tape, but they keep pulling their
orders. So, they're filling lower and

2516
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:15,760
orders. So, they're filling lower and
 

2517
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,190
orders. So, they're filling lower and
lower because they're just yanking their

2518
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
lower because they're just yanking their
 

2519
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,750
lower because they're just yanking their
orders, running away right now. So,

2520
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:19,760
orders, running away right now. So,
 

2521
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,309
orders, running away right now. So,
sellers, I'd say, at the moment, um

2522
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:22,319
sellers, I'd say, at the moment, um
 

2523
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,309
sellers, I'd say, at the moment, um
since this little pivot, are in control.

2524
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:24,319
since this little pivot, are in control.
 

2525
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,750
since this little pivot, are in control.
The buyers are the ones that got stuck

2526
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:25,760
The buyers are the ones that got stuck
 

2527
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,430
The buyers are the ones that got stuck
up here. and buyers got stuck up here.

2528
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
up here. and buyers got stuck up here.
 

2529
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,349
up here. and buyers got stuck up here.
And so until we reclaim those levels, I

2530
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:29,359
And so until we reclaim those levels, I
 

2531
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,390
And so until we reclaim those levels, I
don't think there's much to do.

2532
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
don't think there's much to do.
 

2533
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,309
don't think there's much to do.
I don't think there's much to do here.

2534
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:34,319
I don't think there's much to do here.
 

2535
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,470
I don't think there's much to do here.
The range isn't that big either, folks.

2536
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
The range isn't that big either, folks.
 

2537
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,710
The range isn't that big either, folks.
Smaller range today as expected.

2538
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:42,720

 

2539
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,230

Back to these sevens. Look at all these

2540
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:44,240
Back to these sevens. Look at all these
 

2541
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,309
Back to these sevens. Look at all these
buyers down below. Keep they keep

2542
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
buyers down below. Keep they keep
 

2543
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,710
buyers down below. Keep they keep
pulling and then uh moving down. So 700

2544
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
pulling and then uh moving down. So 700
 

2545
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,349
pulling and then uh moving down. So 700
95 90s 82s right now.

2546
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:53,359
95 90s 82s right now.
 

2547
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,750
95 90s 82s right now.
And the upside again 20s and 30s is

2548
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:55,760
And the upside again 20s and 30s is
 

2549
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,190
And the upside again 20s and 30s is
what's key on the upside. That's where

2550
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,200
what's key on the upside. That's where
 

2551
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,030
what's key on the upside. That's where
the battle is. So you got sort of buyers

2552
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,040
the battle is. So you got sort of buyers
 

2553
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,670
the battle is. So you got sort of buyers
stuck. Show you on it. Probably get it

2554
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:01,680
stuck. Show you on it. Probably get it
 

2555
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:09,829
stuck. Show you on it. Probably get it
up on here. Maybe you get lucky.

2556
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:09,839

 

2557
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,430

All right. So we can see these buyers

2558
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,440
All right. So we can see these buyers
 

2559
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,190
All right. So we can see these buyers
kept trying up in around here. They got

2560
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:13,200
kept trying up in around here. They got
 

2561
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,349
kept trying up in around here. They got
stuck. They just tried again here. So

2562
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:15,359
stuck. They just tried again here. So
 

2563
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,430
stuck. They just tried again here. So
buyers got stuck here. These guys tried

2564
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:17,440
buyers got stuck here. These guys tried
 

2565
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,829
buyers got stuck here. These guys tried
again here. Got stuck again. The problem

2566
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:19,839
again here. Got stuck again. The problem
 

2567
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,510
again here. Got stuck again. The problem
I don't like, I don't think there's

2568
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:21,520
I don't like, I don't think there's
 

2569
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,510
I don't like, I don't think there's
enough excess down here. There could be,

2570
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,520
enough excess down here. There could be,
 

2571
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,630
enough excess down here. There could be,
but for me that's pretty small excess

2572
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:26,640
but for me that's pretty small excess
 

2573
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,750
but for me that's pretty small excess
wise.

2574
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:31,760

 

2575
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,990

Back into this gray box, which can

00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
Back into this gray box, which can
 

2577

Back into this gray box, which can
probably be removed right now to be

2578
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:35,520
probably be removed right now to be
 

2579
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,951
probably be removed right now to be
honest. We've moved it up a little bit.

2580
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:38,961
honest. We've moved it up a little bit.

honest. We've moved it up a little bit.

Oh, we're going to make a new low.

Oh, we're going to make a new low.

Oh, we're going to make a new low.
Probably should.

then maybe I can't remember who said
that they're looking to bid previous day

Arguably could have flipped short here

2682
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:38,480
Arguably could have flipped short here
 

2683
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,829
Arguably could have flipped short here
when I said those buyers were getting

2684
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
when I said those buyers were getting
 

2685
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,510
when I said those buyers were getting
stuck. But uh I just want to focus on

01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
stuck. But uh I just want to focus on
 

2687
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,829
stuck. But uh I just want to focus on
the longs either from here or here. So

2688
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:43,839
the longs either from here or here. So
 

2689
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,510
the longs either from here or here. So
that's uh what I'm trying to do at the

2690
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
that's uh what I'm trying to do at the
 

2691
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,750
that's uh what I'm trying to do at the
moment is just remain focused on the

2692
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
moment is just remain focused on the
 

2693
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,950
moment is just remain focused on the
side of the market I'm looking for.

2694
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:50,960
side of the market I'm looking for.

Short was clean. Yeah, it was clean once

2696
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:52,400
Short was clean. Yeah, it was clean once
 

2697
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,990
Short was clean. Yeah, it was clean once
they got stuck up there. It was it was

2698
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
they got stuck up there. It was it was
 

2699
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,430
they got stuck up there. It was it was
clean up there. I'm not going to argue

2700
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:55,440
clean up there. I'm not going to argue
 

2701
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,109
clean up there. I'm not going to argue
with that. Even here once they started

2702
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,119
with that. Even here once they started
 

2703
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,270
with that. Even here once they started
reloading. I just don't want to flip my

2704
01:03:59,270 --> 01:03:59,280
reloading. I just don't want to flip my
 

2705
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,630
reloading. I just don't want to flip my
bias when No, I'm up. Nice. Been looking

2706
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:02,640
bias when No, I'm up. Nice. Been looking
 

2707
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,510
bias when No, I'm up. Nice. Been looking

2708
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
for one clean thing. I'm going to stay
 

2709
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,630
for one clean thing. I'm going to stay
looking for that all the time. We're

2710
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:06,640
looking for that all the time. We're
 

2711
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,150

01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:10,400
value area low. So, you know, if you are
 

2715
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,829
value area low. So, you know, if you are
short, if you took where the buyers were

2716
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:11,839
short, if you took where the buyers were
 

2717
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,990
short, if you took where the buyers were
trapped or faded this back in, your

2718
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,000
trapped or faded this back in, your
 

2719
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,829
trapped or faded this back in, your
cover points are now and then down here.

2789
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,349

Spiders running a beard, man.

2790
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
Spiders running a beard, man.
 

2791
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,870
Spiders running a beard, man.
Messy messy. We expect this this sort of

2792
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
Messy messy. We expect this this sort of
 

2793
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,950
Messy messy. We expect this this sort of
time of year, though. I'm still not

2794
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:20,960
time of year, though. I'm still not
 

2795
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,789
time of year, though. I'm still not
convinced. Lower days in. There is there

2796
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:22,799
convinced. Lower days in. There is there
 

2797
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:24,390
convinced. Lower days in. There is there
are some sellers stuck down there, but

2798
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,400
are some sellers stuck down there, but
 

2799
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,029
are some sellers stuck down there, but
it's so light. Um, but we keep tapping

2800
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:27,039
it's so light. Um, but we keep tapping
 

2801
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,109
it's so light. Um, but we keep tapping
into this PC. I would like to see one

2802
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:29,119
into this PC. I would like to see one
 

2803
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,470
into this PC. I would like to see one
more flush lower first.

2804
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:32,480
more flush lower first.
 

2805
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,190
more flush lower first.
Yes, GG. I I do agree with you there.

2806
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,200
Yes, GG. I I do agree with you there.
 

2807
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,829
Yes, GG. I I do agree with you there.
If PC check again here and if they lift

2808
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:39,839
If PC check again here and if they lift
 

2809
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:40,870
If PC check again here and if they lift
through this, they're probably going to

2810
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:40,880
through this, they're probably going to
 

2811
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,230
through this, they're probably going to
check VWAP. And if they lift through

2812
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,240
check VWAP. And if they lift through
 

2813
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,710
check VWAP. And if they lift through
that, they're going to check value.

2814
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720

 

2815
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,390

This is where the sellers last came in.

2816
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:48,400
This is where the sellers last came in.
 

2817
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,910
This is where the sellers last came in.
705. So 705. 715s is where the big

2818
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:51,920
705. So 705. 715s is where the big
 

2819
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,589
705. So 705. 715s is where the big
sellers come in. Buyers are sort of

2820
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:53,599
sellers come in. Buyers are sort of
 

2821
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,670
sellers come in. Buyers are sort of
stuck from 7:15 to 7:30. So if that gets

2822
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:57,680
stuck from 7:15 to 7:30. So if that gets
 

2823
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,910
stuck from 7:15 to 7:30. So if that gets
refreshed on the sell side, we might

2824
01:06:59,910 --> 01:06:59,920
refreshed on the sell side, we might
 

2825
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,829
refreshed on the sell side, we might
break lower.

2826
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:01,839
break lower.
 

2827
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,029
break lower.
All right. So basically, what am I

2828
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:03,039
All right. So basically, what am I
 

2829
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,309
All right. So basically, what am I
trying to say? I can draw it out for you

2830
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:04,319
trying to say? I can draw it out for you
 

2831
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,670
trying to say? I can draw it out for you
here. Sellers came in 7:15 to 7:30.

2832
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
here. Sellers came in 7:15 to 7:30.
 

2833
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,390
here. Sellers came in 7:15 to 7:30.
7:15. So buyers came in here and

2834
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:10,400
7:15. So buyers came in here and
 

2835
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,829
7:15. So buyers came in here and
couldn't hold, right? They kept trying

2836
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:11,839
couldn't hold, right? They kept trying
 

2837
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,750
couldn't hold, right? They kept trying
to fight here. So buyers are stuck here

2838
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:13,760
to fight here. So buyers are stuck here
 

2839
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,750
to fight here. So buyers are stuck here
and here. So all the time they sell

2840
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:15,760
and here. So all the time they sell
 

2841
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,670
and here. So all the time they sell
against this, we can break lower. I

2842
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:17,680
against this, we can break lower. I
 

2843
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,109
against this, we can break lower. I
don't think there's enough excess down

2844
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:19,119
don't think there's enough excess down
 

2845
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,910
don't think there's enough excess down
here still. So, I'm going to repeat that

2846
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:21,920
here still. So, I'm going to repeat that
 

2847
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,990
here still. So, I'm going to repeat that
structure-wise. Buyers got caught.

2848
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000
structure-wise. Buyers got caught.
 

2849
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,069
structure-wise. Buyers got caught.
There's your lower low. You know, maybe

2850
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
There's your lower low. You know, maybe
 

2851
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,589
There's your lower low. You know, maybe
we get one of these I'll be interested

2852
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
we get one of these I'll be interested
 

2853
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,750
we get one of these I'll be interested
in. Maybe we do that here. I'll be

2854
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:29,760
in. Maybe we do that here. I'll be
 

2855
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,510
in. Maybe we do that here. I'll be
interested in. If we go back in here, I

2856
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:31,520
interested in. If we go back in here, I
 

2857
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,950
interested in. If we go back in here, I
won't be interested in anything at all.

2858
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:34,960
won't be interested in anything at all.
 

2859
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,470
won't be interested in anything at all.
We're trying to lead long bias because

2860
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
We're trying to lead long bias because
 

2861
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,789
We're trying to lead long bias because
we're gapping up over value. I just

2862
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
we're gapping up over value. I just
 

2863
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:41,190
we're gapping up over value. I just
didn't want to buy up here. It's too uh

2864
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,200
didn't want to buy up here. It's too uh
 

2865
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,029
didn't want to buy up here. It's too uh
too close to that two week balance

2866
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
too close to that two week balance
 

2867
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,470
too close to that two week balance
range. But I'm interested here and here

2868
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:46,480
range. But I'm interested here and here
 

2869
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,109
range. But I'm interested here and here
as the levels

2870
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:49,119
as the levels
 

2871
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,870
as the levels
for anyone joining a bit later.

2872
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880

 

2873
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,309

Okay, so they're still defending point

2874
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:56,319
Okay, so they're still defending point
 

2875
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,309
Okay, so they're still defending point
control. Sellers still attacking this.

2876
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:58,319
control. Sellers still attacking this.
 

2877
01:07:58,319 --> 01:07:59,190
control. Sellers still attacking this.
I'll give you a little readout on the

2878
01:07:59,190 --> 01:07:59,200
I'll give you a little readout on the
 

2879
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:03,910
I'll give you a little readout on the
map. Tesla 1.21% up. Nvidia 1.14% up.

2880
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:03,920
map. Tesla 1.21% up. Nvidia 1.14% up.
 

2881
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,589
map. Tesla 1.21% up. Nvidia 1.14% up.
Meta 1% up. Amazon just about green. And

2882
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:07,599
Meta 1% up. Amazon just about green. And
 

2883
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,630
Meta 1% up. Amazon just about green. And
then you've got Microsoft 0.22% down.

2884
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:10,640
then you've got Microsoft 0.22% down.
 

2885
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:19,510
then you've got Microsoft 0.22% down.
Google 0.15% down. Apple 0.58% down.

2886
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:19,520

 

2887
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,990

So, let's get starting to build at these

2888
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:22,000
So, let's get starting to build at these
 

2889
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,149
So, let's get starting to build at these
lows without breaking lower. All right.

2890
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:24,159
lows without breaking lower. All right.
 

2891
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:26,470
lows without breaking lower. All right.
I want to see a break lower be absorbed.

2892
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
I want to see a break lower be absorbed.
 

2893
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,590
I want to see a break lower be absorbed.
That's what I would would like to see.

2894
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:29,600
That's what I would would like to see.
 

2895
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,430
That's what I would would like to see.
There is some absorption down here from

2896
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,440
There is some absorption down here from
 

2897
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,870
There is some absorption down here from
buyers, but I'd actually like to see

2898
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
buyers, but I'd actually like to see
 

2899
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,789
buyers, but I'd actually like to see
just a little break lower and it be

2900
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
just a little break lower and it be
 

2901
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,470
just a little break lower and it be
absorbed. But we just had a big lock

2902
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:36,480
absorbed. But we just had a big lock
 

2903
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,229
absorbed. But we just had a big lock
come flying on the tape here sell side.

2904
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:38,239
come flying on the tape here sell side.
 

2905
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:43,189
come flying on the tape here sell side.
And again here. Who's this guy?

2906
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:43,199
And again here. Who's this guy?
 

2907
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:45,749
And again here. Who's this guy?
115 lots. So they're defending. What's

2908
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:45,759
115 lots. So they're defending. What's
 

2909
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,110
115 lots. So they're defending. What's
his average here? 87s,

2910
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:49,120
his average here? 87s,
 

2911
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,070
his average here? 87s,
84s, and he's going to try again here at

2912
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,080
84s, and he's going to try again here at
 

2913
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,829
84s, and he's going to try again here at
90s. And if he doesn't get his way,

2914
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:53,839
90s. And if he doesn't get his way,
 

2915
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,590
90s. And if he doesn't get his way,
we're going to lift to 700 and go point

2916
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:55,600
we're going to lift to 700 and go point
 

2917
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,630
we're going to lift to 700 and go point
of control. There we go. Lifting to 700.

2918
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:58,640
of control. There we go. Lifting to 700.
 

2919
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,829
of control. There we go. Lifting to 700.
He's not getting his way. So was

2920
01:08:59,829 --> 01:08:59,839
He's not getting his way. So was
 

2921
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,269
He's not getting his way. So was
aggressive selling down there being

2922
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:01,279
aggressive selling down there being
 

2923
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,630
aggressive selling down there being
absorbed on the tape. So we're starting

2924
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:02,640
absorbed on the tape. So we're starting
 

2925
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,870
absorbed on the tape. So we're starting
to see some bulls try and absorb the

2926
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:04,880
to see some bulls try and absorb the
 

2927
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,030
to see some bulls try and absorb the
tape at these lows right now. So perking

2928
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:07,040
tape at these lows right now. So perking
 

2929
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,470
tape at these lows right now. So perking
my interest as we go back to point of

2930
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,480
my interest as we go back to point of
 

2931
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,630
my interest as we go back to point of
control. I'm watching to see if we go up

2932
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
control. I'm watching to see if we go up
 

2933
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,189
control. I'm watching to see if we go up
to 15s now.

2934
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:13,199
to 15s now.
 

2935
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,749
to 15s now.
So, I'd say 15s to 30s is the level

2936
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
So, I'd say 15s to 30s is the level
 

2937
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,149
So, I'd say 15s to 30s is the level
where buyers got trapped. Right. 15s to

2938
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:18,159
where buyers got trapped. Right. 15s to
 

2939
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:20,070
where buyers got trapped. Right. 15s to
30s is the level that sellers will need

2940
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:20,080
30s is the level that sellers will need
 

2941
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,390
30s is the level that sellers will need
to defend. So, it might be a rotation

2942
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
to defend. So, it might be a rotation
 

2943
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,990
to defend. So, it might be a rotation
from here to there. It's not a lot, is

2944
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,000
from here to there. It's not a lot, is
 

2945
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,910
from here to there. It's not a lot, is
it? It's like 15 to 30 points, but

2946
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920
it? It's like 15 to 30 points, but
 

2947
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,149
it? It's like 15 to 30 points, but
that's the rotation at the moment. Well,

2948
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:28,159
that's the rotation at the moment. Well,
 

2949
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:29,829
that's the rotation at the moment. Well,
at the moment, we're just sat at P at

2950
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:29,839
at the moment, we're just sat at P at
 

2951
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,829
at the moment, we're just sat at P at
these 700s. There's a micro shelf at

2952
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:31,839
these 700s. There's a micro shelf at
 

2953
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,630
these 700s. There's a micro shelf at
705. So if we go through 705s, I think

2954
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:34,640
705. So if we go through 705s, I think
 

2955
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,189
705. So if we go through 705s, I think
we probably get 1520s and then through

2956
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
we probably get 1520s and then through
 

2957
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,829
we probably get 1520s and then through
their 30s. But we can still build this

2958
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
their 30s. But we can still build this
 

2959
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,430
their 30s. But we can still build this
out and roll. But right now, there are

2960
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:41,440
out and roll. But right now, there are
 

2961
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,829
out and roll. But right now, there are
sellers down here who are caught

2962
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
sellers down here who are caught
 

2963
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:47,510
sellers down here who are caught
underneath. What was this guy's level?

2964
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
underneath. What was this guy's level?
 

2965
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,990
underneath. What was this guy's level?
87s.

2966
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,000
87s.
 

2967
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,309
87s.
Okay, here we go.

2968
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:52,319
Okay, here we go.
 

2969
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,950
Okay, here we go.
All right, so let's see then. Let's see

2970
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:54,960
All right, so let's see then. Let's see
 

2971
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,950
All right, so let's see then. Let's see
then, folks.

2972
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
then, folks.
 

2973
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,750
then, folks.

into these 30s. 15s to 30s is where

2976
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:02,480
into these 30s. 15s to 30s is where
 

2977
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,910
into these 30s. 15s to 30s is where
sellers will want to defend. If they

2978
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
sellers will want to defend. If they
 

2979
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,590
sellers will want to defend. If they
can't defend that, we will rotate

2980
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:05,600
can't defend that, we will rotate
 

2981
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,630
can't defend that, we will rotate
aggressively higher. Taking some profit

2982
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
aggressively higher. Taking some profit
 

2983
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,229
aggressively higher. Taking some profit
here

2984
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:10,239
here
 

2985
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,630
here
from PC. It's only a 15 point trade.

2986
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:12,640
from PC. It's only a 15 point trade.
 

2987
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,470
from PC. It's only a 15 point trade.
Let's see if we can get back above 20s

2988
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,480
Let's see if we can get back above 20s
 

2989
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:20,149
Let's see if we can get back above 20s
and 30s. And I'll reload if we can.

2990
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:20,159

 

2991
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,830

Lots of sellers stacking up here. So, we

2992
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
Lots of sellers stacking up here. So, we
 

2993
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,910
Lots of sellers stacking up here. So, we
know 15 to 30s is where the buyers got

2994
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:23,920
know 15 to 30s is where the buyers got
 

2995
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,270
know 15 to 30s is where the buyers got
stuck. So this is where sellers, you can

2996
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
stuck. So this is where sellers, you can
 

2997
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,550
stuck. So this is where sellers, you can
see them on the tape are trying to

2998
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
see them on the tape are trying to
 

2999
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,350
see them on the tape are trying to
defend, right? We just went over this.

3000
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:29,360
defend, right? We just went over this.
 

3001
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:34,470
defend, right? We just went over this.
If we get back above that squeeze is on.

3002
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:34,480
If we get back above that squeeze is on.
 

3003
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,310
If we get back above that squeeze is on.
This is where strong selling came in now

3004
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:36,320
This is where strong selling came in now
 

3005
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,149
This is where strong selling came in now
and where buyers got trapped is just

3006
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:38,159
and where buyers got trapped is just
 

3007
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,470
and where buyers got trapped is just
above up to 30. So sellers need to

3008
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:40,480
above up to 30. So sellers need to
 

3009
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,910
above up to 30. So sellers need to
defend this level here. It's why I've

3010
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:41,920
defend this level here. It's why I've
 

3011
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:48,229
defend this level here. It's why I've
taken profit here.

3012
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:48,239

 

3013
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:56,630

Let's

3014
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:56,640

 

3015
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,950

see if they resupport the bid at 700.

3016
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:00,960
see if they resupport the bid at 700.
 

3017
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,550
see if they resupport the bid at 700.
It' be a good sign if we support the bid

3018
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:02,560
It' be a good sign if we support the bid
 

3019
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,270
It' be a good sign if we support the bid
at 7 or above seven here. It' be a good

3020
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:05,280
at 7 or above seven here. It' be a good
 

3021
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,950
at 7 or above seven here. It' be a good
sign that we're going to leave those

3022
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:06,960
sign that we're going to leave those
 

3023
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,790
sign that we're going to leave those
sellers on that last leg trapped at the

3024
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:08,800
sellers on that last leg trapped at the
 

3025
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,550
sellers on that last leg trapped at the
lows. They got to support PC, which is

3026
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:12,560
lows. They got to support PC, which is
 

3027
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,669
lows. They got to support PC, which is
basically 700.

3028
01:11:15,669 --> 01:11:15,679
basically 700.
 

3029
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:18,499
basically 700.
Otherwise, I'll probably cut Slow

3030
01:11:18,499 --> 01:11:18,509
Otherwise, I'll probably cut Slow
 

3031
01:11:18,509 --> 01:11:27,750
Otherwise, I'll probably cut Slow
[clears throat]

3032

3033
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:36,310

day today.

3034
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:36,320

 

3035
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:41,830

Are they going to support the bid here?

3036
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:41,840

 

3037
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,950

There's P check coming up here into

3038
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:44,960
There's P check coming up here into
 

3039
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,669
There's P check coming up here into
sevens. There's the P check.

3040
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:47,679
sevens. There's the P check.
 

3041
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,669
sevens. There's the P check.
And do they hold this or not now is the

3042
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:49,679
And do they hold this or not now is the
 

3043
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:51,030
And do they hold this or not now is the
question. If not, we go back down to

3044
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040
question. If not, we go back down to
 

3045
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,270
question. If not, we go back down to
lower day. If we get absorption here,

3046
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:53,280
lower day. If we get absorption here,
 

3047
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:59,350
lower day. If we get absorption here,
then they got a break back above 15s.

3048
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360

 

3049
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,270

Bu's just left. Now the book's thinned

3050
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,280
Bu's just left. Now the book's thinned
 

3051
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,510
Bu's just left. Now the book's thinned
out.

3052
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:03,520

What is going on?

3054
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:06,560
What is going on?
 

3055
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,310
What is going on?
Anyone want to play today at all or is

3056
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:08,320
Anyone want to play today at all or is
 

3057

Anyone want to play today at all or is
volume just going to completely

3059
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,870
volume just going to completely
dissipate at this point?

3061
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,590

There's literally no bid now on my book.

3062
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:19,600
There's literally no bid now on my book.
 

3063
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:25,270
There's literally no bid now on my book.
It's like completely gone to sleep.

3064
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:25,280

 

3065
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,830

Very slow. Yeah, very slow. It's okay

3066
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:27,840
Very slow. Yeah, very slow. It's okay
 

3067
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,550
Very slow. Yeah, very slow. It's okay
though.

3068
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:30,560
though.
 

3069
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,030
though.
It's easy to read because it's slow. I

3070
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
It's easy to read because it's slow. I
 

3071
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,550
It's easy to read because it's slow. I
just don't get what this buyer is doing.

3072
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:34,560
just don't get what this buyer is doing.
 

3073
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,590
just don't get what this buyer is doing.
This guy here, I don't know if you can

01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:35,600
This guy here, I don't know if you can

So back down to value area low on the

3082
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:44,400
So back down to value area low on the
 

3083
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,229
So back down to value area low on the
day which is 82s. That's where the

3084
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
day which is 82s. That's where the
 

3085
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,229
day which is 82s. That's where the
sellers last got stuck is there and

3086
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:48,239
sellers last got stuck is there and
 

3087

01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,550
at 89s.
The rotations are so small here folks is

3092
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:54,560
The rotations are so small here folks is
 

3093
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:59,510
The rotations are so small here folks is
why I'm not trying to read too much.

3094
01:12:59,510 --> 01:12:59,520

 

3095
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,310

Relative weakness is uh

3096
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:04,320
Relative weakness is uh
 

3097
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,510
Relative weakness is uh
is also on cues today. Be aware of that.

3098
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:09,520

Nice work.
We're just in rotation now. So if you

3106
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:17,199
We're just in rotation now. So if you
 

3107
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,590
We're just in rotation now. So if you
look at today, all right, this is value

3108
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:19,600
look at today, all right, this is value
 

3109
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,510
look at today, all right, this is value
for this current session. We can't get

3110
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:21,520
for this current session. We can't get
 

3111
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,669
for this current session. We can't get
above. We're not getting below. If we

3112
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:23,679
above. We're not getting below. If we
 

3113
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,189
above. We're not getting below. If we
look at previous day, we were down here.

3114
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
look at previous day, we were down here.
 

3115
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,550
look at previous day, we were down here.
All right, so we're gapping up. We're

3116
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
All right, so we're gapping up. We're
 

3117
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,790
All right, so we're gapping up. We're
holding a key level. If we break this

3118
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
holding a key level. If we break this
 

3119
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,229
holding a key level. If we break this
key level, we're going to come down into

3120
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:32,239
key level, we're going to come down into
 

3121
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,149
key level, we're going to come down into
here or unless we do a look below and

3122
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:34,159
here or unless we do a look below and
 

3123
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,149
here or unless we do a look below and
reclaim. Right? So I want to be bullish

3124
01:13:36,149 --> 01:13:36,159
reclaim. Right? So I want to be bullish
 

3125
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,270
reclaim. Right? So I want to be bullish
because we're gapping up. I don't want

3126
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
because we're gapping up. I don't want
 

3127
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,630
because we're gapping up. I don't want
to be bullish here. I want to be bullish

3128
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:38,640
to be bullish here. I want to be bullish
 

3129
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,310
to be bullish here. I want to be bullish
on this pullback either into here or to

3130
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
on this pullback either into here or to
 

3131
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,709
on this pullback either into here or to
here. If we lose this, then we're going

3132
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
here. If we lose this, then we're going
 

3133
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,229
here. If we lose this, then we're going
to rotation. Technically, you could be

3134
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:44,239
to rotation. Technically, you could be
 

3135
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,750
to rotation. Technically, you could be
bearish in that rotation. I'm not going

3136
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:45,760
bearish in that rotation. I'm not going
 

3137
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,950
bearish in that rotation. I'm not going
to be not not on a holiday volume all

3138
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:48,960
to be not not on a holiday volume all
 

3139
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,470
to be not not on a holiday volume all
the time. I'm holding this. I'd rather

3140
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:50,480
the time. I'm holding this. I'd rather
 

3141
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,070
the time. I'm holding this. I'd rather
think about bullish moves. I know flow

3142
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:52,080
think about bullish moves. I know flow
 

3143
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,470
think about bullish moves. I know flow
zones are flat to negative, which is why

3144
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:54,480
zones are flat to negative, which is why
 

3145
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,590
zones are flat to negative, which is why
got to be bit careful in the rotation.

3146
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:57,600
got to be bit careful in the rotation.
 

3147
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,149
got to be bit careful in the rotation.
So, PC reclaimed again 700. They're

3148
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
So, PC reclaimed again 700. They're
 

3149
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,189
So, PC reclaimed again 700. They're
going to have another attempt here. So,

3150
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:01,199
going to have another attempt here. So,
 

3151
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,790
going to have another attempt here. So,
this is a higher low. This is a fail

3152
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:02,800
this is a higher low. This is a fail
 

3153
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,950
this is a higher low. This is a fail
break lower here from bears, right? They

3154
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:04,960
break lower here from bears, right? They
 

3155
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,189
break lower here from bears, right? They
just failed to break lower. We have to

3156
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:07,199
just failed to break lower. We have to
 

3157
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,110
just failed to break lower. We have to
say what we're seeing here. Bears failed

3158
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,120
say what we're seeing here. Bears failed
 

3159
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,030
say what we're seeing here. Bears failed
to break lower. They're now stuck. We're

3160
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:11,040
to break lower. They're now stuck. We're
 

3161
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,149
to break lower. They're now stuck. We're
probably going to come and test 715s,

3162
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:14,159
probably going to come and test 715s,
 

3163
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,310
probably going to come and test 715s,
720, 730. 730s is the level. Uh 715s to

01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
720, 730. 730s is the level. Uh 715s to
 

3165
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,310
720, 730. 730s is the level. Uh 715s to
730s is where buyers last got stuck. If

3166
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:20,320
730s is where buyers last got stuck. If
 

3167
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,830
730s is where buyers last got stuck. If
we get through there, then I expect the

3168
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840

3310
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
go here at breaking out through New York
 

3311
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:11,350
go here at breaking out through New York
open.

3312
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:11,360

 

3313
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,189

So, ES, it's a weird one. It made a

3314
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
So, ES, it's a weird one. It made a
 

3315
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,709
So, ES, it's a weird one. It made a
lower low today and it's now trying to

3316
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:14,719
lower low today and it's now trying to
 

3317
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:17,590
lower low today and it's now trying to
bust through New York open. So basically

3318
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:17,600
bust through New York open. So basically
 

3319
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,310
bust through New York open. So basically
ES has done this this swept and this is

3320
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:20,320
ES has done this this swept and this is
 

3321
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,910
ES has done this this swept and this is
right back up here and it's trying to

3322
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:21,920
right back up here and it's trying to
 

3323
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,390
right back up here and it's trying to
bust through this pivot which is next to

3324
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:24,400
bust through this pivot which is next to
 

3325
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,870
bust through this pivot which is next to
this. It cannot get through that New

3326
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
this. It cannot get through that New
 

3327
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,110
this. It cannot get through that New
York open right now on ES. That's its

3328
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,120
York open right now on ES. That's its
 

3329
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:42,594
York open right now on ES. That's its
big problem.

3330
01:18:42,594 --> 01:18:42,604

this level, even that's a bit dangerous

3344
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:02,719
this level, even that's a bit dangerous
 

3345
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,470
this level, even that's a bit dangerous
now. But if we get bid above this,

3346
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,480
now. But if we get bid above this,
 

3347
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,149
now. But if we get bid above this,
especially if ES gets above New York

3348
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:06,159
especially if ES gets above New York

pulling orders or I reckon there's one
 

3363
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,870
pulling orders or I reckon there's one
buyer being a bit of a knob today. And

3364
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:24,880
buyer being a bit of a knob today. And
 

3365
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,790
buyer being a bit of a knob today. And

this pivot, if we think about what we

3368
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:28,239
this pivot, if we think about what we
 

3369
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,149
this pivot, if we think about what we
saw this morning, this is where buyers

3370
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:30,159
saw this morning, this is where buyers
 

3371
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,310
saw this morning, this is where buyers
got stuck and the next level they got

3372
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:32,320
got stuck and the next level they got
 

3373
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,590
got stuck and the next level they got
stuck at was 20s or 15s to 30s. All

3374
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:35,600
stuck at was 20s or 15s to 30s. All
 

3375

Feels like it.

3540
01:24:41,669 --> 01:24:41,679

 

3541
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,350

3545
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,830

3695
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,030
anything.
Okay,

3696
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:13,040
Okay,
 

3697
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,750
Okay,
shorts currently came in at these lows

3698
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:15,760
shorts currently came in at these lows
 

3699
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,030
shorts currently came in at these lows
at 40. I'm watching previous week high

3700
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:19,040
at 40. I'm watching previous week high
 

3701
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,470
at 40. I'm watching previous week high
to see if we start getting back above

3702
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
to see if we start getting back above
 

3703
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,310
to see if we start getting back above
that and back into value area low on the

3704
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:22,320
that and back into value area low on the
 

3705
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,149
that and back into value area low on the
session. So, do we start going do we do

3706
01:29:24,149 --> 01:29:24,159
session. So, do we start going do we do
 

3707
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:26,470
session. So, do we start going do we do
a initial balance break into gap and

3708
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:26,480
a initial balance break into gap and
 

3709
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,550
a initial balance break into gap and
reclaim or are we going to resell these

3710
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:28,560
reclaim or are we going to resell these
 

3711
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,709
reclaim or are we going to resell these
levels? All right. So, the trades I'm

3712
01:29:30,709 --> 01:29:30,719
levels? All right. So, the trades I'm
 

3713
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:31,990
levels? All right. So, the trades I'm
again, I'm not going to focus on the

3714
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:32,000
again, I'm not going to focus on the
 

3715
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,830
again, I'm not going to focus on the
short. It might very well play out back

3716
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:33,840
short. It might very well play out back
 

3717
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,590
short. It might very well play out back
down to here. I'm going to either look

3718
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:35,600
down to here. I'm going to either look
 

3719
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,430
down to here. I'm going to either look
for this

3720
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:37,440
for this
 

3721
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,350
for this
or something like this. Those are the

3722
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:39,360
or something like this. Those are the
 

3723
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,790
or something like this. Those are the
only two things I'm looking at today on

3724
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
only two things I'm looking at today on
 

3725
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,310
only two things I'm looking at today on
low volume. I don't I don't want to

3726
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:42,320
low volume. I don't I don't want to
 

3727
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:47,990
low volume. I don't I don't want to
touch anything else.

Sellers came in again at the low of this

Sellers came in again at the low of this
 

3749
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,110
Sellers came in again at the low of this
candle. Sellers really need this back

candle. Sellers really need this back
 

3751
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,590
candle. Sellers really need this back
below 40. If buyers start reclaiming 50,

3752
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:31,600
below 40. If buyers start reclaiming 50,
 

3753
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,750
below 40. If buyers start reclaiming 50,
there's probably a little move up to 75.

there's probably a little move up to 75.
 

3755

there's probably a little move up to 75.
But sellers need this back below 40

3756

But sellers need this back below 40
 

3757
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,189
But sellers need this back below 40
because they've come in sellside heavy

3758
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:37,199
because they've come in sellside heavy
 

3759

01:31:06,709 --> 01:31:06,719
difference between futures and CFDs?
 

3777
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,390

and go for the reclaim. Watching IB now.

3804
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,320

 

3805
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:58,149

Can we get going back through value?

3806
01:31:58,149 --> 01:31:58,159

 

3807
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,430

They're going to look for 80s if they

3810
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:00,880
They're going to look for 80s if they
 

3811
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,070
They're going to look for 80s if they
can get up there or 77ish.

3812
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,080
can get up there or 77ish.
 

3813
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,750
can get up there or 77ish.
And if we get inside that, this will be

And if we get inside that, this will be
 

3815
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,590
And if we get inside that, this will be
a look below in fail. But I wouldn't

3816
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:07,600
a look below in fail. But I wouldn't
 

3817
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,189
a look below in fail. But I wouldn't
bank on that.

3818

01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:30,320
would be my question I would be posing
 

3831
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:37,750
would be my question I would be posing
at the moment.

3832

3839
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,590
initial balance, then the IB2V up trade
is possible. I'd be watching this node

3840
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:47,600
is possible. I'd be watching this node
 

3841
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,590
is possible. I'd be watching this node
here at 92,

3842
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:51,600

 

3843
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,629

right? So, if we're going to trade

3844
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:52,639
right? So, if we're going to trade
 

3845
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,550
right? So, if we're going to trade
upside, I'd be watching this and this.

3846
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:54,560
upside, I'd be watching this and this.

3854
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,920
bit caught up here at the highs right
 

3855
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,189
bit caught up here at the highs right
now. So, I'm going to wait a little bit

3856
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:03,199
now. So, I'm going to wait a little bit
 

3857
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,350
now. So, I'm going to wait a little bit
longer. It's good defense from bears

3858
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:05,360
longer. It's good defense from bears
 

3859
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,350
longer. It's good defense from bears
there. So I'd say buyers now they need

3860
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,360
there. So I'd say buyers now they need
 

3861
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,910
there. So I'd say buyers now they need
to hold above 50s and definitely above

3862
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:09,920
to hold above 50s and definitely above
 

3863
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:15,830
to hold above 50s and definitely above
40s.

3864
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:15,840

 

3865
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,510

Big divergence to ES.

3866
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:19,520
Big divergence to ES.
 

3867
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,030
Big divergence to ES.
Big big divergence to ES here which is

3868
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,040
Big big divergence to ES here which is
 

3869
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,669
Big big divergence to ES here which is
all the way back at VWAP. So we are

3870
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
all the way back at VWAP. So we are
 

3871
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,910
all the way back at VWAP. So we are
around this initial balance. Can we see

3872
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:27,920
around this initial balance. Can we see
 

3873
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,910
around this initial balance. Can we see
a drive back through it now up into this

3874
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:29,920
a drive back through it now up into this
 

3875
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,470
a drive back through it now up into this
gray box and potentially VWAP? Here we

3876
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:32,480
gray box and potentially VWAP? Here we
 

3877
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,910
gray box and potentially VWAP? Here we
go. Have we got anything here?

3878
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:35,920
go. Have we got anything here?
 

3879
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,550
go. Have we got anything here?

01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:44,960
Still refreshed selling here. He's still
 

3931
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,870
Still refreshed selling here. He's still

3933
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,110
refreshed. He's still not moved. They
haven't chopped them all up yet. They're

3934
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:49,120
haven't chopped them all up yet. They're
 

3935
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,629
haven't chopped them all up yet. They're
going to have another go at him. He's

3936
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:50,639
going to have another go at him. He's
 

3937
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,510
going to have another go at him. He's
still refreshed. Another go. And he's

3938
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:53,520
still refreshed. Another go. And he's
 

3939
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,189
still refreshed. Another go. And he's
still refreshed. Right. He's selling 80.

3940
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:55,199
still refreshed. Right. He's selling 80.
 

3941
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,350
still refreshed. Right. He's selling 80.
He's got inventory to unload here. Once

3942
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:57,360
He's got inventory to unload here. Once
 

3943
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,030
He's got inventory to unload here. Once
that moves, there might be a squeeze,

3944
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
that moves, there might be a squeeze,
 

3945
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,189
that moves, there might be a squeeze,
but until that moves, he's refreshed

3946
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:01,199
but until that moves, he's refreshed
 

3947
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:04,470
but until that moves, he's refreshed
again with more size there. He's holding

3948
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:04,480
again with more size there. He's holding
 

3949
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,950
again with more size there. He's holding
very firm here at 80, this seller. It's

3950
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:06,960
very firm here at 80, this seller. It's
 

3951
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:13,510
very firm here at 80, this seller. It's
impressive.

3952
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:13,520

 

3953
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,110

And we have imbalances all the way down

3954
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:15,120
And we have imbalances all the way down
 

3955
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:18,950
And we have imbalances all the way down
to 60.

3956
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:18,960

 

3957
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,110

So that that seller is still on the tape

3958
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:21,120
So that that seller is still on the tape
 

3959
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,790
So that that seller is still on the tape
up pit, passively selling into every

3960
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
up pit, passively selling into every
 

3961
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:53,030
up pit, passively selling into every
push into him.

3962
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,040

 

3963
01:35:53,040 --> 01:36:07,750

I'm going to come feel this imbalance.

3964
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:07,760

 

3965
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,390

ES looking very strong here back to its

3966
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:10,400
ES looking very strong here back to its
 

3967
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,110
ES looking very strong here back to its
New York open. It's still in a range,

3968
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:13,120
New York open. It's still in a range,
 

3969
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:16,070
New York open. It's still in a range,
but it's much much stronger than NQDs.

3970
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:16,080
but it's much much stronger than NQDs.
 

3971
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,070
but it's much much stronger than NQDs.
There's the 80 break. So, can they find

3972
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,080
There's the 80 break. So, can they find
 

3973
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,910
There's the 80 break. So, can they find
a bid over this now? Yep. Okay. So, can

3974
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:21,920
a bid over this now? Yep. Okay. So, can
 

3975
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,229
a bid over this now? Yep. Okay. So, can
we get to V Park, which would be sort of

3976
01:36:24,229 --> 01:36:24,239
we get to V Park, which would be sort of
 

3977
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:27,189
we get to V Park, which would be sort of
97ish,

3978
01:36:27,189 --> 01:36:27,199
97ish,
 

3979
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,189
97ish,
or is this going to be a look into the

3980
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:29,199
or is this going to be a look into the
 

3981
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:43,750
or is this going to be a look into the
above 80s and slammed?

3982
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:43,760

 

3983
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,830

Oh, we're going to reload 80. Buyers

3984
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:45,840
Oh, we're going to reload 80. Buyers
 

3985
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,830
Oh, we're going to reload 80. Buyers
need to step back in 80 because they

3986
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:47,840
need to step back in 80 because they
 

3987
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,470
need to step back in 80 because they
just loaded there. So really would want

3988
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:50,480
just loaded there. So really would want
 

3989
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,550
just loaded there. So really would want
to step back in there and then not. So

3990
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:52,560
to step back in there and then not. So
 

3991
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,750
to step back in there and then not. So
value area low again here in 275s and we

3992
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:55,760
value area low again here in 275s and we
 

3993
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,590
value area low again here in 275s and we
still have those imbalances down to 60s

3994
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:57,600
still have those imbalances down to 60s
 

3995
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,830
still have those imbalances down to 60s
I talked about

3996
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:01,840

 

3997
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,430

PC and fail. Yeah, it didn't even make

3998
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:03,440
PC and fail. Yeah, it didn't even make
 

3999
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,510
PC and fail. Yeah, it didn't even make
it. Didn't even make it yet. The problem

4000
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:05,520
it. Didn't even make it yet. The problem
 

4001
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,550
it. Didn't even make it yet. The problem
is now it's quite messy. So if we look

4002
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:08,560
is now it's quite messy. So if we look
 

4003
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,310
is now it's quite messy. So if we look
at the auction at the low, where is it?

4004
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:12,320
at the auction at the low, where is it?
 

4005
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,229
at the auction at the low, where is it?
Right. This is this is nice excess. This

4006
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:14,239
Right. This is this is nice excess. This
 

4007
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,790
Right. This is this is nice excess. This
is what we didn't have earlier. Remember

4008
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:16,800
is what we didn't have earlier. Remember
 

4009
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,310
is what we didn't have earlier. Remember
the earlier lower day I said there's no

4010
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:18,320
the earlier lower day I said there's no
 

4011
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,149
the earlier lower day I said there's no
excess. This is nice. All right. Sellers

4012
01:37:20,149 --> 01:37:20,159
excess. This is nice. All right. Sellers
 

4013
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:21,590
excess. This is nice. All right. Sellers
are caught here for sure. And we have a

4014
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
are caught here for sure. And we have a
 

4015
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,149
are caught here for sure. And we have a
buying balance down here.

4016
01:37:24,149 --> 01:37:24,159
buying balance down here.
 

4017
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:27,910
buying balance down here.
So, if buyers are going to hold this, it

4018
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:27,920
So, if buyers are going to hold this, it
 

4019
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,750
So, if buyers are going to hold this, it
looks good. It's just like a little bit

4020
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:29,760
looks good. It's just like a little bit
 

4021
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,390
looks good. It's just like a little bit
messy because you got IB uh what else

4022
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
messy because you got IB uh what else
 

4023
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:37,270
messy because you got IB uh what else
you got? Is this uh imb um uh orb

4024
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:37,280
you got? Is this uh imb um uh orb
 

4025
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,149
you got? Is this uh imb um uh orb
and IBL and then balance down here,

4026
01:37:40,149 --> 01:37:40,159
and IBL and then balance down here,
 

4027
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,669
and IBL and then balance down here,
which they need to absorb off. So, they

4028
01:37:41,669 --> 01:37:41,679
which they need to absorb off. So, they
 

4029
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:44,149
which they need to absorb off. So, they
might absorb higher first. But the the

4030
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:44,159
might absorb higher first. But the the
 

4031
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:45,910
might absorb higher first. But the the
lower day actually looks good now. That

4032
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:45,920
lower day actually looks good now. That
 

4033
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,350
lower day actually looks good now. That
looks good. Didn't look good earlier.

4034
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:47,360
looks good. Didn't look good earlier.
 

4035
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,750
looks good. Didn't look good earlier.
That looks like a better low day in my

4036
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:49,760
That looks like a better low day in my
 

4037
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,229
That looks like a better low day in my
mind and it's coming to the gap. All

4038
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:52,239
mind and it's coming to the gap. All
 

4039
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:57,830
mind and it's coming to the gap. All
right. So, it looks better.

4040
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:57,840

 

4041
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,070

So, I'm interested, but we've got to

4042
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:00,080
So, I'm interested, but we've got to
 

4043
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,390
So, I'm interested, but we've got to
show some sort of uh strength on

4044
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:02,400
show some sort of uh strength on
 

4045
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,350
show some sort of uh strength on
reclaims and stuff, you know,

4046
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:05,360
reclaims and stuff, you know,
 

4047

4049
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,669
and I'm also [clears throat] in my head
like smaller size, smaller range day,

4050
01:38:09,669 --> 01:38:09,679
like smaller size, smaller range day,
 

4051
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,070
like smaller size, smaller range day,
lower volume day. Do you need to trade?

4052
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:12,080
lower volume day. Do you need to trade?
 

4053
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,669
lower volume day. Do you need to trade?
Can just be here? You've made some

4054

Can just be here? You've made some

narrative in my head? I can show you

4058
01:38:17,669 --> 01:38:17,679
narrative in my head? I can show you
 

4059
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:19,910
narrative in my head? I can show you
like I flipped a few accounts and then

4060
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:19,920
like I flipped a few accounts and then
 

4061
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,350
like I flipped a few accounts and then
I've traded a couple with a bit more

4062
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:21,360
I've traded a couple with a bit more
 

4063

01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:24,960
size. So 141 and one down here, 603 and
 

4065
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:26,550
size. So 141 and one down here, 603 and
191. I don't know why these are

4066
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:26,560
191. I don't know why these are
 

4067
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,950
191. I don't know why these are
negative. I can trade copious being

4068
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:28,960
negative. I can trade copious being
 

4069
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,950
negative. I can trade copious being
annoying. But the others look are fine.

4070

some imbalances down there. It would be
 

4087
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,750
some imbalances down there. It would be
fun if they came down there and hold it.

one is into 61ish.

4160
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:16,320

 

4161
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,310

And then do they hold versus 50? That

4162
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:18,320
And then do they hold versus 50? That
 

4163
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,310
And then do they hold versus 50? That
would be the question. They hold versus

4164
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:20,320
would be the question. They hold versus
 

4165
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,030
would be the question. They hold versus
50 or are we going to go into expansion?

4166
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,040
50 or are we going to go into expansion?
 

4167
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,030
50 or are we going to go into expansion?
This is a twole and expansion lower. So

4168
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:25,040
This is a twole and expansion lower. So
 

4169
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,109
This is a twole and expansion lower. So
then buyers wanted to step in versus 50

4170
01:40:27,109 --> 01:40:27,119
then buyers wanted to step in versus 50
 

4171
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:29,430
then buyers wanted to step in versus 50
here.

4172
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:29,440
here.
 

4173
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,510
here.
Some aggressive selling here.

4174
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:33,520

 

4175
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,350

And you can see the bid is at 50. It's

4176
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:35,360
And you can see the bid is at 50. It's
 

4177
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,750
And you can see the bid is at 50. It's
only 29 lot, man. So, they are trying to

4178
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:37,760
only 29 lot, man. So, they are trying to
 

4179
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:41,430
only 29 lot, man. So, they are trying to
absorb this.

4180
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:41,440

 

4181
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,790

Market really doesn't know what it wants

4182
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:42,800
Market really doesn't know what it wants
 

4183
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,470
Market really doesn't know what it wants

absorption into those 60s.

4190
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:51,040

4191
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,790

So, they're trying to find a bid here.

4192
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:52,800
So, they're trying to find a bid here.
 

4193
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,629
So, they're trying to find a bid here.
And if we find a bid here, it's possible

4194
01:40:54,629 --> 01:40:54,639
And if we find a bid here, it's possible
 

4195
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:56,629
And if we find a bid here, it's possible
to point to control and VWAP. All right.

4196
01:40:56,629 --> 01:40:56,639
to point to control and VWAP. All right.
 

4197
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,390

So, the IB trade will be from here to

4198
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:58,400
So, the IB trade will be from here to
 

4199

01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:39,350
A bit of a sleepy market here, folks.
Have I taken a trade yet? I'm waiting

4314
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:39,360
Have I taken a trade yet? I'm waiting
 

4315
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,229
Have I taken a trade yet? I'm waiting
now. I'm not in this long yet.

4316
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:42,239
now. I'm not in this long yet.
 

4317
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:44,790
now. I'm not in this long yet.
Letting this develop a minute. So, I'm

4318
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:44,800
Letting this develop a minute. So, I'm
 

4319
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,830
Letting this develop a minute. So, I'm
not seeing strength. What I'm seeing is

4320
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:47,840
not seeing strength. What I'm seeing is
 

4321
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,550
not seeing strength. What I'm seeing is
all right buyers keep coming in over 78

4322
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,560
all right buyers keep coming in over 78
 

4323
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,310
all right buyers keep coming in over 78
and there is a passive seller up there.

4324
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:52,320
and there is a passive seller up there.
 

4325
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,070
and there is a passive seller up there.
If we start if we start holding this

4326
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:54,080
If we start if we start holding this
 

4327
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,830
If we start if we start holding this
right here right now at 73s and

4328
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:55,840
right here right now at 73s and
 

4329
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,510
right here right now at 73s and
absorbing I'm interested.

4330
01:43:59,510 --> 01:43:59,520

 

4331
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,189

I'm looking for like some momentum

4332
01:44:01,189 --> 01:44:01,199
I'm looking for like some momentum
 

4333
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:02,790
I'm looking for like some momentum
someone on the tape to come in someone

4334
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:02,800
someone on the tape to come in someone
 

4335
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,590
someone on the tape to come in someone
to say hey we want this higher like I'm

4336
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:05,600
to say hey we want this higher like I'm
 

4337
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,270
to say hey we want this higher like I'm
not seeing ES do it. We're starting to

4338
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:07,280
not seeing ES do it. We're starting to
 

4339
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,550
not seeing ES do it. We're starting to
see it now. It's trying now. Is the 80s

4340
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:10,560
see it now. It's trying now. Is the 80s
 

4341
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:15,109
see it now. It's trying now. Is the 80s
again? Can we see acceleration?

4342
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:15,119
again? Can we see acceleration?
 

4343
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:17,030
again? Can we see acceleration?
Just waiting to see like some volume

4344
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:17,040
Just waiting to see like some volume
 

4345
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,350
Just waiting to see like some volume
come in. Someone saying I don't want

4346
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:19,360
come in. Someone saying I don't want
 

4347
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,669
come in. Someone saying I don't want
this lower. We're going to rotate to

4348
01:44:21,669 --> 01:44:21,679
this lower. We're going to rotate to
 

4349
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:23,510
this lower. We're going to rotate to
point of control on VWAP. And even then,

4350
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:23,520
point of control on VWAP. And even then,
 

4351
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,109
point of control on VWAP. And even then,
like how many points am I really playing

4352
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:25,119
like how many points am I really playing
 

4353
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:26,629
like how many points am I really playing
for?

4354
01:44:26,629 --> 01:44:26,639
for?
 

4355
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,950
for?
20 to 30 points. It's not a lot for me

4356
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:28,960
20 to 30 points. It's not a lot for me
 

4357
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,390
20 to 30 points. It's not a lot for me
to play for. You know what I'm like? I

4358
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:30,400
to play for. You know what I'm like? I
 

4359
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,229
to play for. You know what I'm like? I
like 50 to 100 point trades I can sit

4360
01:44:32,229 --> 01:44:32,239
like 50 to 100 point trades I can sit
 

4361
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:38,070
like 50 to 100 point trades I can sit
in.

4362
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:38,080

 

4363
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,830

Now I'm developing a bit of this shelf

4364
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:39,840
Now I'm developing a bit of this shelf
 

4365
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,270
Now I'm developing a bit of this shelf
here. So level here.

4366
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,280
here. So level here.
 

4367
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,870
here. So level here.
We keep holding dips. there. I am

4368
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:44,880
We keep holding dips. there. I am
 

4369
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,790
We keep holding dips. there. I am
interested for sure. It's a big if at

4370
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
interested for sure. It's a big if at
 

4371
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:58,950
interested for sure. It's a big if at
the moment.

4372
01:44:58,950 --> 01:44:58,960

 

4373
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,910

It's trying. It is try trying. I can see

4374
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
It's trying. It is try trying. I can see
 

4375
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,590
It's trying. It is try trying. I can see
them trying to be aggressive here. Here

4376
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:03,600
them trying to be aggressive here. Here
 

4377
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,990
them trying to be aggressive here. Here
we go. Here's the 80s and still

4378
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:06,000
we go. Here's the 80s and still
 

4379
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,990
we go. Here's the 80s and still
passively sold. So, still someone

4380
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:08,000
passively sold. So, still someone
 

4381
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,149
passively sold. So, still someone
selling everything above 78 at the

4382
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:10,159
selling everything above 78 at the
 

4383
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,870
selling everything above 78 at the
moment.

4384
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:12,880
moment.
 

4385
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,030
moment.
They are trying to step on the tape. ES

4386
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:15,040
They are trying to step on the tape. ES
 

4387
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:19,830
They are trying to step on the tape. ES
still not through that New York open.

4388
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:19,840

 

4389
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,030

Yeah, they're going to have another go

4390
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:21,040
Yeah, they're going to have another go
 

4391
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,910
Yeah, they're going to have another go
and reload 80s, are they? So, they're

4392
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:23,920
and reload 80s, are they? So, they're
 

4393
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,790
and reload 80s, are they? So, they're
bidding 775

4394
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:26,800
bidding 775
 

4395
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,910
bidding 775
67s and they're selling every pop into

4396
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:29,920
67s and they're selling every pop into
 

4397
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,709
67s and they're selling every pop into
and above 80 right now.

4398
01:45:32,709 --> 01:45:32,719
and above 80 right now.
 

4399
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:34,229
and above 80 right now.
Very tight range. I'm going to use a

4400
01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:34,239
Very tight range. I'm going to use a
 

4401
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:36,149
Very tight range. I'm going to use a
bathroom while this does whatever it

4402
01:45:36,149 --> 01:45:36,159
bathroom while this does whatever it
 

4403
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:39,510
bathroom while this does whatever it
needs to do. Let me just see if

4404
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:39,520
needs to do. Let me just see if
 

4405
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,870
needs to do. Let me just see if
a few things out here just in case.

4406
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:42,880
a few things out here just in case.
 

4407
01:45:42,880 --> 01:47:14,390
a few things out here just in case.
Just in case. All right, be right back.

4408
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:14,400

 

4409
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,430

Okay, it's trying, folks. It's trying,

4410
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:17,440
Okay, it's trying, folks. It's trying,
 

4411
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:21,910
Okay, it's trying, folks. It's trying,
folks.

4412
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:21,920

 

4413
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,910

Look at ES in that New York open. That

4414
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:23,920
Look at ES in that New York open. That
 

4415
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,390
Look at ES in that New York open. That
is massive level. Where's Spy? It's not

4416
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:26,400
is massive level. Where's Spy? It's not
 

4417
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,030
is massive level. Where's Spy? It's not
even at the 85s.

4418
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:29,040
even at the 85s.
 

4419
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,109
even at the 85s.
Is there gamma at 84? Can anyone tell

4420
01:47:31,109 --> 01:47:31,119
Is there gamma at 84? Can anyone tell
 

4421
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,669
Is there gamma at 84? Can anyone tell
me? Is there some form of put wall at

4422
01:47:33,669 --> 01:47:33,679
me? Is there some form of put wall at
 

4423
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:35,669
me? Is there some form of put wall at
84? Why are we struggling up there so

4424
01:47:35,669 --> 01:47:35,679
84? Why are we struggling up there so
 

4425
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:39,109
84? Why are we struggling up there so
much?

4426
01:47:39,109 --> 01:47:39,119

 

4427
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:42,149

We should be going here.

4428
01:47:42,149 --> 01:47:42,159
We should be going here.
 

4429
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:43,830
We should be going here.
We should be going here. We should try

4430
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:43,840
We should be going here. We should try
 

4431
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,750
We should be going here. We should try
and get it through. This spy is causing

4432
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:45,760
and get it through. This spy is causing
 

4433
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,830
and get it through. This spy is causing
the bigger issue. If if spy just starts

4434
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:47,840
the bigger issue. If if spy just starts
 

4435
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,510
the bigger issue. If if spy just starts
driving through 84, I think we get a

4436
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:49,520
driving through 84, I think we get a
 

4437
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,310
driving through 84, I think we get a
squeeze out here into VPO and VWOP and

4438
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:52,320
squeeze out here into VPO and VWOP and
 

4439
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,629
squeeze out here into VPO and VWOP and
then maybe if we get lucky

4440
01:47:54,629 --> 01:47:54,639
then maybe if we get lucky
 

4441
01:47:54,639 --> 01:48:02,470
then maybe if we get lucky
into value area high

4442
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:02,480

 

4443
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,189

84 and 85. Yeah, knew it. Knew it. We

4444
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:05,199
84 and 85. Yeah, knew it. Knew it. We
 

4445
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:06,950
84 and 85. Yeah, knew it. Knew it. We
keep getting stuck up there. Has to be

4446
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:06,960
keep getting stuck up there. Has to be
 

4447
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:13,990
keep getting stuck up there. Has to be
some put wall up there.

4448
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:14,000

 

4449
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,270

Still stuck up there again.

4450
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:19,280

 

4451
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:24,950

We've got imbalances now. 83 down to 78.

4452
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:24,960
We've got imbalances now. 83 down to 78.
 

4453
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,550
We've got imbalances now. 83 down to 78.
Going to come fill and then it's going

4454
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:26,560
Going to come fill and then it's going
 

4455
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,990
Going to come fill and then it's going
to have to hold that value area low

4456
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:28,000
to have to hold that value area low
 

4457
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,990
to have to hold that value area low
again. So, still no acceptance on SPY

4458
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:30,000
again. So, still no acceptance on SPY
 

4459
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,629
again. So, still no acceptance on SPY
above 84.

4460
01:48:32,629 --> 01:48:32,639
above 84.
 

4461
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:35,430
above 84.
Uh, no acceptance underneath this. Do we

4462
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:35,440
Uh, no acceptance underneath this. Do we
 

4463
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,109
Uh, no acceptance underneath this. Do we
have any more imbalances to fill lower?

4464
01:48:37,109 --> 01:48:37,119
have any more imbalances to fill lower?
 

4465
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:39,910
have any more imbalances to fill lower?
I mean, yes,

4466
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:39,920
I mean, yes,
 

4467
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,629
I mean, yes,

trap short. So, it's not moved low
enough. The the volatility is getting

enough. The the volatility is getting
 

4755
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,589

it's just a trade from IB to here. So

4780
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:30,400
it's just a trade from IB to here. So
 

4781
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,310
it's just a trade from IB to here. So
PC's now shifted as well. Interesting.

Let's see if they hold PC. Now on the

Let's see if they hold PC. Now on the
 

4785
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:37,589
Let's see if they hold PC. Now on the
other chart, it's still at 97.

4786
01:55:37,589 --> 01:55:37,599
other chart, it's still at 97.
 

4787
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:40,470
other chart, it's still at 97.
There's 97. So here it's gray box

4788
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:40,480
There's 97. So here it's gray box
 

4789
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:47,990
There's 97. So here it's gray box
basically.

4790
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:48,000

01:56:56,159 --> 01:57:03,990
Especially if ES goes and takes out IB
and we don't move.

There's someone is passively selling

4890
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,440
There's someone is passively selling
 

4891
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,510
There's someone is passively selling
every little pop. Like they are just

4892
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:45,520
every little pop. Like they are just
 

4893
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,510
every little pop. Like they are just
nonstop selling the pops here, but we're

4894
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:47,520
nonstop selling the pops here, but we're
 

4895
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,950
nonstop selling the pops here, but we're
not moving lower. So we're like we're

4896
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:48,960
not moving lower. So we're like we're
 

4897
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,550
not moving lower. So we're like we're
pinned like this. So they're absorbing

4898
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:50,560
pinned like this. So they're absorbing
 

4899
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:52,550
pinned like this. So they're absorbing
the lows and they're absorbing the highs

4900
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,560
the lows and they're absorbing the highs
 

4901
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:55,510
the lows and they're absorbing the highs
in this little range. So like there's a

4902
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:55,520
in this little range. So like there's a
 

4903
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,910
in this little range. So like there's a
buyer hanging out here and there's a

4904
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:57,920
buyer hanging out here and there's a
 

4905
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,790
buyer hanging out here and there's a
seller hanging out from basically 85s

4906
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:00,800
seller hanging out from basically 85s
 

4907
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,550
seller hanging out from basically 85s
here.

4908
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:02,560
here.
 

4909
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,589
here.
And so this is the range.

4910
01:59:05,589 --> 01:59:05,599
And so this is the range.
 

4911
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:08,950
And so this is the range.
There's just nothing.

4912
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:08,960
There's just nothing.
 

4913
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:12,550
There's just nothing.

Big if, but that's what I'd be looking

4940

4942
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:46,080
at if they run it. And then 710s. I
 

4943

4949
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,910

which means what? Spy 685 is the next

4958
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:05,280
which means what? Spy 685 is the next
 

4959
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,589
which means what? Spy 685 is the next
level is it? So Spy Spy needs to hold

4960
02:00:07,589 --> 02:00:07,599
level is it? So Spy Spy needs to hold
 

4961
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:17,990
level is it? So Spy Spy needs to hold
684 and trade 685s basically.

4963
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:24,709

Second time's a charm. Can we go VWAP?
 

4971
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,350
Second time's a charm. Can we go VWAP?
And then can we go value area high? So

4972
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:35,360
And then can we go value area high? So
 

4973
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:39,350
And then can we go value area high? So

I'm going to trim. If it takes IB high
 

4983

I'm going to trim. If it takes IB high
before we take V up, I'm trimming.

02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:04,000
locked most in here into VWAP because ES
 

5043
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,350
locked most in here into VWAP because ES
is coming to IB high. So, it's a

5044
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:05,360
is coming to IB high. So, it's a
 

5045
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,709
is coming to IB high. So, it's a
rotational day. So, we're going to lock

02:02:06,709 --> 02:02:06,719
rotational day. So, we're going to lock
 

5047
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,030
rotational day. So, we're going to lock
in. Remember the trade is from IB low to

5051
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,990

butter. We looked below IB. We came in
 

5055
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,629
butter. We looked below IB. We came in
to remember the gap. We trapped shorts

5056
02:02:18,629 --> 02:02:18,639
to remember the gap. We trapped shorts
 

5057
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:20,229
to remember the gap. We trapped shorts
down here. It's the first time I've seen

02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,669
the end of the auction look good. This
is a little bit gross, unfortunately.

VW up above here, we're looking at

5066
02:02:27,669 --> 02:02:27,679
VW up above here, we're looking at
 

5067
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:29,510
VW up above here, we're looking at
value. And if we get above there, well,

5068
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:29,520
value. And if we get above there, well,
 

5069
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,189
value. And if we get above there, well,
we've got the New York open and IB high

5070
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:31,199
we've got the New York open and IB high
 

5071
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:33,109
we've got the New York open and IB high
to aim for, but we do have relative

5073
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:35,189
to aim for, but we do have relative
weakness in NQ today. So, it might be

02:02:35,189 --> 02:02:35,199
weakness in NQ today. So, it might be
 

5075
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:37,270
weakness in NQ today. So, it might be
that it doesn't do it. ES is looking

5076
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:37,280
that it doesn't do it. ES is looking
 

5077
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,030
that it doesn't do it. ES is looking
absolutely fantastic. Right. I was

5078
02:02:39,030 --> 02:02:39,040
absolutely fantastic. Right. I was
 

5079
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,870
absolutely fantastic. Right. I was
trying to time this with this. There you

5080
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:40,880
trying to time this with this. There you
 

5081
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,149
trying to time this with this. There you
go. So, there was the break. That was

5082
02:02:42,149 --> 02:02:42,159
go. So, there was the break. That was
 

5083
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,070
go. So, there was the break. That was
the gamma break. There's the IB high.

5084
02:02:44,070 --> 02:02:44,080
the gamma break. There's the IB high.
 

5085
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,430
the gamma break. There's the IB high.
This is the unfinished business into

02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:45,440
This is the unfinished business into
 

5087
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,189
This is the unfinished business into
9:30. All right. So, I'm still long a

5088
02:02:47,189 --> 02:02:47,199
9:30. All right. So, I'm still long a
 

5089
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:49,350
9:30. All right. So, I'm still long a
little piece and we'll see. We will just

5090
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:49,360
little piece and we'll see. We will just
 

5091
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:56,310
little piece and we'll see. We will just
see now. Why am I doing NQZ? I need NQ.

5092
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,320

 

5093
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:57,750

Okay. [sighs]

5094
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:57,760
Okay. [sighs]
 

5095
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:59,109
Okay. [sighs]
All right. So, it took a couple attempts

5096
02:02:59,109 --> 02:02:59,119
All right. So, it took a couple attempts
 

5097
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:02,310
All right. So, it took a couple attempts
here. Sorry, folks. ENQ's being a little

5098
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:02,320
here. Sorry, folks. ENQ's being a little
 

5099
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,709
here. Sorry, folks. ENQ's being a little
bit of a [\h__\h] today, but we're down to

5100
02:03:04,709 --> 02:03:04,719
bit of a [\h__\h] today, but we're down to
 

5101
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:06,470
bit of a [\h__\h] today, but we're down to
tiny size now because we can reject this

5102
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:06,480
tiny size now because we can reject this
 

5103
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,390
tiny size now because we can reject this
if we want. But if we can get up to

5104
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:08,400
if we want. But if we can get up to
 

5105
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,950
if we want. But if we can get up to
here, it'd be fantastic. And if we get

5106
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:10,960
here, it'd be fantastic. And if we get
 

5107
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,669
here, it'd be fantastic. And if we get
up to here, it' be a monster trade.

5108
02:03:15,669 --> 02:03:15,679

 

5109
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:18,470

Just a little piece left now from the

5110
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:18,480
Just a little piece left now from the
 

5111
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:21,270
Just a little piece left now from the
80s. Here we go. All right, let's see.

5112
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:21,280
80s. Here we go. All right, let's see.
 

5113
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:25,510
80s. Here we go. All right, let's see.
Can we get some acceleration here?

5114
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:25,520
Can we get some acceleration here?
 

5115
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:29,910
Can we get some acceleration here?
ES now taken.

5116
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:29,920

 

5117
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,270

Take an eye behind. So you want to be

5118
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:31,280
Take an eye behind. So you want to be
 

5119
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,189
Take an eye behind. So you want to be
careful and a failed look above and fail

5120
02:03:33,189 --> 02:03:33,199
careful and a failed look above and fail
 

5121
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:50,790
careful and a failed look above and fail
on ES.

5122
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:50,800

 

5123
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,870

point controls moved up to here to 700

5124
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:52,880
point controls moved up to here to 700
 

5125
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:57,990
point controls moved up to here to 700
now. So we really we want to hold 96s.

5126
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:58,000
now. So we really we want to hold 96s.
 

5127
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,750
now. So we really we want to hold 96s.
Don't I don't really want to see it come

5128
02:03:59,750 --> 02:03:59,760
Don't I don't really want to see it come
 

5129
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,669
Don't I don't really want to see it come
back down into like those 80s and 90s. I

5130
02:04:01,669 --> 02:04:01,679
back down into like those 80s and 90s. I
 

5131
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:03,910
back down into like those 80s and 90s. I
want to hit see it hold 96s and

5132
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:03,920
want to hit see it hold 96s and
 

5133
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,149
want to hit see it hold 96s and
accelerate here.

5134
02:04:06,149 --> 02:04:06,159
accelerate here.
 

5135
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:11,830
accelerate here.
Still long.

5136
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:11,840

 

5137
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,629

What triggered me to enter there? Uh

5138
02:04:14,629 --> 02:04:14,639
What triggered me to enter there? Uh
 

5139
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:17,589
What triggered me to enter there? Uh
trap volume underneath, right? Blue blue

5140
02:04:17,589 --> 02:04:17,599
trap volume underneath, right? Blue blue
 

5141
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:19,350
trap volume underneath, right? Blue blue
box, remember, was where I potentially

5142
02:04:19,350 --> 02:04:19,360
box, remember, was where I potentially
 

5143
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,030
box, remember, was where I potentially
wanted to buy off. We trapped

5144
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:21,040
wanted to buy off. We trapped
 

5145
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:22,629
wanted to buy off. We trapped
underneath. We tapped the gap. We held

5146
02:04:22,629 --> 02:04:22,639
underneath. We tapped the gap. We held
 

5147
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:25,270
underneath. We tapped the gap. We held
higher low. We did all this nonsense and

5148
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:25,280
higher low. We did all this nonsense and
 

5149
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,830
higher low. We did all this nonsense and
then we saw ES starting to go, the mag

5150
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:27,840
then we saw ES starting to go, the mag
 

5151
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:30,550
then we saw ES starting to go, the mag
starting to rotate back to green and uh

5152
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:30,560
starting to rotate back to green and uh
 

5153
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,910
starting to rotate back to green and uh
buyer starting to get a bit more

5154
02:04:31,910 --> 02:04:31,920
buyer starting to get a bit more
 

5155
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:33,270
buyer starting to get a bit more
aggressive. Remember the seller kept

5156
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:33,280
aggressive. Remember the seller kept
 

5157
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:36,310
aggressive. Remember the seller kept
reloading at 80s and 85. So, he was here

5158
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320
reloading at 80s and 85. So, he was here
 

5159
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,950
reloading at 80s and 85. So, he was here
from 10:46 to He was there for like

5160
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:38,960
from 10:46 to He was there for like
 

5161
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,430
from 10:46 to He was there for like
basically 20 30 minutes. He He's run out

5162
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:41,440
basically 20 30 minutes. He He's run out
 

5163
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:43,990
basically 20 30 minutes. He He's run out
of uh stuff inventory to sell. So, now

5164
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:44,000
of uh stuff inventory to sell. So, now
 

5165
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:51,030
of uh stuff inventory to sell. So, now
I'm looking for that rotation

5166
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:51,040

 

5167
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:52,790

and just want to see if we can get a

5168
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:52,800
and just want to see if we can get a
 

5169
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,390
and just want to see if we can get a
little bit more here. I'm trying to hold

5170
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:54,400
little bit more here. I'm trying to hold
 

5171
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,870
little bit more here. I'm trying to hold
the runner for current value area high.

5172
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880
the runner for current value area high.
 

5173
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,189
the runner for current value area high.
And if we get lucky, if we get lucky

5174
02:04:59,189 --> 02:04:59,199
And if we get lucky, if we get lucky
 

5175
02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:01,589
And if we get lucky, if we get lucky
above value area high, which is GlobeEx,

5176
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:01,599
above value area high, which is GlobeEx,
 

5177
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:04,950
above value area high, which is GlobeEx,
then we get up here. But I really like I

5178
02:05:04,950 --> 02:05:04,960
then we get up here. But I really like I
 

5179
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:07,109
then we get up here. But I really like I
will move my stop up as as we get into

5180
02:05:07,109 --> 02:05:07,119
will move my stop up as as we get into
 

5181
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:10,390
will move my stop up as as we get into
this

5182
02:05:10,390 --> 02:05:10,400

 

5183
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,910

ES about to finish that unfinished

5184
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:11,920
ES about to finish that unfinished
 

5185
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:13,189
ES about to finish that unfinished
business we talked about as well.

5186
02:05:13,189 --> 02:05:13,199
business we talked about as well.
 

5187
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:15,510

I'm not going to take profit up here
 

5239
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,990
I'm not going to take profit up here
because I've only got one left. But, uh,

5240
02:06:17,990 --> 02:06:18,000
because I've only got one left. But, uh,
 

5241
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,750
because I've only got one left. But, uh,
I will move my stop up as we get into

5242
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:19,760
I will move my stop up as we get into
 

5243
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:21,669
I will move my stop up as we get into
this. But, you never know. We might come

5244
02:06:21,669 --> 02:06:21,679
this. But, you never know. We might come
 

5245
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:23,189
this. But, you never know. We might come
for all this liquidity up here if we get

5246
02:06:23,189 --> 02:06:23,199
for all this liquidity up here if we get
 

5247
02:06:23,199 --> 02:06:29,030
for all this liquidity up here if we get
really, really lucky.

5248
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:29,040

 

5249
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,109

So, unfinished business now taken ES.

5250
02:06:31,109 --> 02:06:31,119
So, unfinished business now taken ES.
 

5251
02:06:31,119 --> 02:06:34,069
So, unfinished business now taken ES.
So, be very careful here. Here we go,

5252
02:06:34,069 --> 02:06:34,079
So, be very careful here. Here we go,
 

5253
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:37,589
So, be very careful here. Here we go,
folks. We're looking fantastic.

5254
02:06:37,589 --> 02:06:37,599
folks. We're looking fantastic.
 

5255
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:39,589
folks. We're looking fantastic.
So, you can trim some as we get into

5256
02:06:39,589 --> 02:06:39,599
So, you can trim some as we get into
 

5257
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:41,030
So, you can trim some as we get into
value area high. The only reason I'm not

5258
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:41,040
value area high. The only reason I'm not
 

5259
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,790
value area high. The only reason I'm not
is I only got one left. All right. But

5260
02:06:42,790 --> 02:06:42,800
is I only got one left. All right. But
 

5261
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,470
is I only got one left. All right. But
you can trim some as we get into these

5262
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:44,480
you can trim some as we get into these
 

5263
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,870
you can trim some as we get into these
value area highs. You do not want this

5264
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:46,880
value area highs. You do not want this
 

5265
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:48,709
value area highs. You do not want this
to come back beneath point of control

5266
02:06:48,709 --> 02:06:48,719
to come back beneath point of control
 

5267
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:50,390
to come back beneath point of control
700s. You want all dips there to be

5268
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:50,400
700s. You want all dips there to be
 

5269
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:52,550
700s. You want all dips there to be
absorbed. But ES did just take that big

5270
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:52,560
absorbed. But ES did just take that big
 

5271
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,069
absorbed. But ES did just take that big
level I talked about. All right. It just

5272
02:06:54,069 --> 02:06:54,079
level I talked about. All right. It just
 

5273
02:06:54,079 --> 02:06:55,990
level I talked about. All right. It just
absor just just swiped that and it's

5274
02:06:55,990 --> 02:06:56,000
absor just just swiped that and it's
 

5275
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,990
absor just just swiped that and it's
come back down inside. So that could be

5276
02:06:57,990 --> 02:06:58,000
come back down inside. So that could be
 

5277
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,350
come back down inside. So that could be
the end of it for the day. We will see.

5278
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:01,360
the end of it for the day. We will see.
 

5279
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,030
the end of it for the day. We will see.
So I'm going to manage this no matter

5280
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:03,040
So I'm going to manage this no matter
 

5281
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:04,870
So I'm going to manage this no matter
what.

5282
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:04,880
what.
 

5283
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:07,990
what.
You never know. So I've got my stop now

5284
02:07:07,990 --> 02:07:08,000
You never know. So I've got my stop now
 

5285
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,589
You never know. So I've got my stop now
underneath point of control. I don't

5286
02:07:09,589 --> 02:07:09,599
underneath point of control. I don't
 

5287
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:11,750
underneath point of control. I don't
want it to come under 96. So we've got a

5288
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:11,760
want it to come under 96. So we've got a
 

5289
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:14,229
want it to come under 96. So we've got a
little low volume node. Move my stop up

5290
02:07:14,229 --> 02:07:14,239
little low volume node. Move my stop up
 

5291
02:07:14,239 --> 02:07:16,709
little low volume node. Move my stop up
to 94s here. And I want that to be

5292
02:07:16,709 --> 02:07:16,719
to 94s here. And I want that to be
 

5293
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:18,950
to 94s here. And I want that to be
protected on the next squeeze up. If we

5294
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:18,960
protected on the next squeeze up. If we
 

5295
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,550
protected on the next squeeze up. If we
get a next squeeze up, I'll move my stop

5296
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:20,560
get a next squeeze up, I'll move my stop
 

5297
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:28,790
get a next squeeze up, I'll move my stop
up.

5298
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:28,800

 

5299
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,629

They need to make a new high here in my

5300
02:07:30,629 --> 02:07:30,639
They need to make a new high here in my
 

5301
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:43,578
They need to make a new high here in my
opinion here.

5302

stuck here a little bit. I want to give

5306
02:07:50,149 --> 02:07:50,159
stuck here a little bit. I want to give
 

5307
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:52,149
stuck here a little bit. I want to give
this too much room at the moment.

this too much room at the moment.

want ES ES has got to get back above
 

5319
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:17,270
want ES ES has got to get back above
930s, right? 6930s. Got to get back

02:08:17,270 --> 02:08:17,280
930s, right? 6930s. Got to get back

02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:19,589
930s, right? 6930s. Got to get back
above that in base. I'm playing ENQ,

02:08:19,589 --> 02:08:19,599
above that in base. I'm playing ENQ,
 

5323
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:21,109
above that in base. I'm playing ENQ,
right? I'm playing ENQ. My stop's

5324
02:08:21,109 --> 02:08:21,119
right? I'm playing ENQ. My stop's
 

5325
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:24,069
right? I'm playing ENQ. My stop's
currently at 9425. I'm long from 81.

I've already trimmed a few off.

02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:27,280
I've already trimmed a few off.
 

5329
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:29,589
I've already trimmed a few off.
I know technically I could uh give this

5330
02:08:29,589 --> 02:08:29,599
I know technically I could uh give this
 

5331
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:31,430
I know technically I could uh give this
more room, but I want it to hold VWAP

5332
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:31,440
more room, but I want it to hold VWAP
 

5333
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:33,910
more room, but I want it to hold VWAP
and this little low volume shelf, which

5334
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:33,920
and this little low volume shelf, which
 

5335
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:35,669
and this little low volume shelf, which
is not there on this, but they've got

5336
02:08:35,669 --> 02:08:35,679
is not there on this, but they've got
 

5337
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:39,189
is not there on this, but they've got
one at 94s here. So, I'm looking for

5338
02:08:39,189 --> 02:08:39,199
one at 94s here. So, I'm looking for
 

5339
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:41,990
one at 94s here. So, I'm looking for
this to hold and base. All right. If I'm

5340
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:42,000
this to hold and base. All right. If I'm
 

5341
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,910
this to hold and base. All right. If I'm
going to get my move, it needs to hold

5342
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:43,920
going to get my move, it needs to hold
 

5343
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:46,310
going to get my move, it needs to hold
this kind of level here into here and

5344
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:46,320
this kind of level here into here and
 

5345
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:47,830
this kind of level here into here and
then above that if I get really lucky.

5346
02:08:47,830 --> 02:08:47,840
then above that if I get really lucky.
 

5347
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,990
then above that if I get really lucky.
It's what I'm looking for on the runner.

5348
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:50,000
It's what I'm looking for on the runner.
 

5349
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,069
It's what I'm looking for on the runner.
Right. If we collapse under here, I'm

5350
02:08:52,069 --> 02:08:52,079
Right. If we collapse under here, I'm
 

5351
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:53,589
Right. If we collapse under here, I'm
not interested because this can be a

5352
02:08:53,589 --> 02:08:53,599
not interested because this can be a
 

5353
02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:54,950
not interested because this can be a
peak out. Right. If we're going to go

5354
02:08:54,950 --> 02:08:54,960
peak out. Right. If we're going to go
 

5355
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:59,109
peak out. Right. If we're going to go
into rotation,

5356
02:08:59,109 --> 02:08:59,119

 

5357
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:00,950

we're going to go into rotation. This

5358
02:09:00,950 --> 02:09:00,960
we're going to go into rotation. This
 

5359
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:02,870
we're going to go into rotation. This
can be a sweep and a peak and a move

5360
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:02,880
can be a sweep and a peak and a move
 

5361
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:05,990
can be a sweep and a peak and a move
back down. And what I'm very aware of is

5362
02:09:05,990 --> 02:09:06,000
back down. And what I'm very aware of is
 

5363
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,750
back down. And what I'm very aware of is
what the ES has done because it's just

5364
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:07,760
what the ES has done because it's just
 

5365
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,910
what the ES has done because it's just
taken out this big key level. All right.

5366
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:09,920
taken out this big key level. All right.
 

5367
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:11,350
taken out this big key level. All right.
So,

5368
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:11,360
So,
 

5369
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,270
So,
ES needs to hold above this now.

5370
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:13,280
ES needs to hold above this now.
 

5371
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:15,030
ES needs to hold above this now.
Definitely wants to hold IB. Look at the

5372
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:15,040
Definitely wants to hold IB. Look at the
 

5373
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:16,550
Definitely wants to hold IB. Look at the
difference. So good. So that was what we

5374
02:09:16,550 --> 02:09:16,560
difference. So good. So that was what we
 

5375
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,709
difference. So good. So that was what we
took really with the long. The break for

5376
02:09:18,709 --> 02:09:18,719
took really with the long. The break for
 

5377
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:21,350
took really with the long. The break for
this squeeze on ES helped us get long in

5378
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:21,360
this squeeze on ES helped us get long in
 

5379
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,910
this squeeze on ES helped us get long in
ENQ because this just looked so good on

5380
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:23,920
ENQ because this just looked so good on
 

5381
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:25,669
ENQ because this just looked so good on
ES. We just knew once it got through

5382
02:09:25,669 --> 02:09:25,679
ES. We just knew once it got through
 

5383
02:09:25,679 --> 02:09:28,709
ES. We just knew once it got through
this 694 positive gamma up into the

5384
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:28,719
this 694 positive gamma up into the
 

5385
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:30,390
this 694 positive gamma up into the
highs into this level. This was the

5386
02:09:30,390 --> 02:09:30,400
highs into this level. This was the
 

5387
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:31,830
highs into this level. This was the
unfinished business which is why we

5388
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:31,840
unfinished business which is why we
 

5389
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:34,069
unfinished business which is why we
trimmed into it.

5390
02:09:34,069 --> 02:09:34,079
trimmed into it.
 

5391
02:09:34,079 --> 02:09:37,430
trimmed into it.
So, this is how I trade them together.

5392
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:37,440
So, this is how I trade them together.
 

5393
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:39,830
So, this is how I trade them together.
And then we just sit and hopefully we

5394
02:09:39,830 --> 02:09:39,840
And then we just sit and hopefully we
 

5395
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:47,750
And then we just sit and hopefully we
can get going here.

5396
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:47,760

 

5397
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,430

Yeah. W's in chat if you got any of

5398
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:49,440
Yeah. W's in chat if you got any of
 

5399
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,109
Yeah. W's in chat if you got any of
this. Not sure you get any. Sloth got

5400
02:09:51,109 --> 02:09:51,119
this. Not sure you get any. Sloth got
 

5401
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:54,390
this. Not sure you get any. Sloth got
it. Inferris. Got it. Holding runner.

5402
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:54,400
it. Inferris. Got it. Holding runner.
 

5403
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:55,910
it. Inferris. Got it. Holding runner.
Yeah, nice. Same as me, mate. Just in a

5404
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:55,920
Yeah, nice. Same as me, mate. Just in a
 

5405
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:58,629
Yeah, nice. Same as me, mate. Just in a
runner. Here we go, folks. Almost at

5406
02:09:58,629 --> 02:09:58,639
runner. Here we go, folks. Almost at
 

5407
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:00,149
runner. Here we go, folks. Almost at
that value area high. So, if you haven't

5408
02:10:00,149 --> 02:10:00,159
that value area high. So, if you haven't
 

5409
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:02,550
that value area high. So, if you haven't
trimmed some, you want to trim some. Uh

5410
02:10:02,550 --> 02:10:02,560
trimmed some, you want to trim some. Uh
 

5411
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,069
trimmed some, you want to trim some. Uh
you can trim anywhere from now really

5412
02:10:04,069 --> 02:10:04,079
you can trim anywhere from now really
 

5413
02:10:04,079 --> 02:10:05,750
you can trim anywhere from now really
into this. There is a little shelf here.

5414
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:05,760
into this. There is a little shelf here.
 

5415
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:09,830
into this. There is a little shelf here.
So I'd say anywhere from uh 20s to 26s

5416
02:10:09,830 --> 02:10:09,840
So I'd say anywhere from uh 20s to 26s
 

5417
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:11,350
So I'd say anywhere from uh 20s to 26s
is a partial if you haven't taken it.

5418
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:11,360
is a partial if you haven't taken it.
 

5419
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:13,350
is a partial if you haven't taken it.
And if we get lucky, we get this and

5420
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:13,360
And if we get lucky, we get this and
 

5421
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:16,709
And if we get lucky, we get this and
these if we get lucky.

5422
02:10:16,709 --> 02:10:16,719
these if we get lucky.
 

5423
02:10:16,719 --> 02:10:19,030
these if we get lucky.
So in the mag Apple the only one now

5424
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:19,040
So in the mag Apple the only one now
 

5425
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,189
So in the mag Apple the only one now
red. So we're seeing rotation in the

5426
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:21,199
red. So we're seeing rotation in the
 

5427
02:10:21,199 --> 02:10:23,189
red. So we're seeing rotation in the
mag. We got a passive seller here. 20

5428
02:10:23,189 --> 02:10:23,199
mag. We got a passive seller here. 20
 

5429
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:26,310
mag. We got a passive seller here. 20
25s. Is there anyone about 30s and then

5430
02:10:26,310 --> 02:10:26,320
25s. Is there anyone about 30s and then
 

5431
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,149
25s. Is there anyone about 30s and then
50s and then there is some more

5432
02:10:28,149 --> 02:10:28,159
50s and then there is some more
 

5433
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:29,669
50s and then there is some more
liquidity starting to be added onto the

5434
02:10:29,669 --> 02:10:29,679
liquidity starting to be added onto the
 

5435
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:32,390
liquidity starting to be added onto the
tape higher. So we look good. We are a

5436
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:32,400
tape higher. So we look good. We are a
 

5437
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,669
tape higher. So we look good. We are a
little bit extended, so we might get a

5438
02:10:33,669 --> 02:10:33,679
little bit extended, so we might get a
 

5439
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:35,430
little bit extended, so we might get a
pullback at some point. So, just make

5440
02:10:35,430 --> 02:10:35,440
pullback at some point. So, just make
 

5441
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:36,870
pullback at some point. So, just make
sure you're paying yourself. This is

5442
02:10:36,870 --> 02:10:36,880
sure you're paying yourself. This is
 

5443
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:39,510
sure you're paying yourself. This is
fantastic, guys. Basically into your

5444
02:10:39,510 --> 02:10:39,520
fantastic, guys. Basically into your
 

5445
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:41,350
fantastic, guys. Basically into your
target now. Your TP's just been hit

5446
02:10:41,350 --> 02:10:41,360
target now. Your TP's just been hit
 

5447
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:52,550
target now. Your TP's just been hit
here.

5448
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:52,560

 

5449
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,950

Another green day on stream. Let's hope

5450
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:54,960
Another green day on stream. Let's hope
 

5451
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:56,870
Another green day on stream. Let's hope
we get another one tomorrow. And then

5452
02:10:56,870 --> 02:10:56,880
we get another one tomorrow. And then
 

5453
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:58,470
we get another one tomorrow. And then
really nice way to go into Christmas. I

5454
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:58,480
really nice way to go into Christmas. I
 

5455
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,310
really nice way to go into Christmas. I
didn't think we'd get much today, but

5456
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:00,320
didn't think we'd get much today, but
 

5457
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,310
didn't think we'd get much today, but
you know, the blue box was the level we

5458
02:11:02,310 --> 02:11:02,320
you know, the blue box was the level we
 

5459
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:03,910
you know, the blue box was the level we
talked about. Two blue boxes I wanted to

5460
02:11:03,910 --> 02:11:03,920
talked about. Two blue boxes I wanted to
 

5461
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:05,510
talked about. Two blue boxes I wanted to
buy off. This one and this one. We

5462
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:05,520
buy off. This one and this one. We
 

5463
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,030
buy off. This one and this one. We
tapped the gap. We reclaimed the blue

5464
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:07,040
tapped the gap. We reclaimed the blue
 

5465
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,870
tapped the gap. We reclaimed the blue
box. This is what we always look for.

5466
02:11:08,870 --> 02:11:08,880
box. This is what we always look for.
 

5467
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:11,990
box. This is what we always look for.
This kind of move with excess big down

5468
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:12,000
This kind of move with excess big down
 

5469
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,790
This kind of move with excess big down
candle riced higher low. This was the

5470
02:11:14,790 --> 02:11:14,800
candle riced higher low. This was the
 

5471
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,990
candle riced higher low. This was the
dip in when we had the buy side

5472
02:11:15,990 --> 02:11:16,000
dip in when we had the buy side
 

5473
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,390
dip in when we had the buy side
imbalance and that was the signal. Took

5474
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:18,400
imbalance and that was the signal. Took
 

5475
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,149
imbalance and that was the signal. Took
me two attempts here, folks. All right.

5476
02:11:20,149 --> 02:11:20,159
me two attempts here, folks. All right.
 

5477
02:11:20,159 --> 02:11:22,709
me two attempts here, folks. All right.
Like I said, I will happily cut when I

5478
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:22,719
Like I said, I will happily cut when I
 

5479
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:24,229
Like I said, I will happily cut when I
feel unsure about it. I'd rather be out

5480
02:11:24,229 --> 02:11:24,239
feel unsure about it. I'd rather be out
 

5481
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:26,390
feel unsure about it. I'd rather be out
of a trade than in a tra in a trade I

5482
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,400
of a trade than in a tra in a trade I
 

5483
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,310
of a trade than in a tra in a trade I
don't like. So I think I had a go here,

5484
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:28,320
don't like. So I think I had a go here,
 

5485
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:29,510
don't like. So I think I had a go here,
didn't really like it and then had

5486
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:29,520
didn't really like it and then had
 

5487
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:32,470
didn't really like it and then had
another go and we went.

5488
02:11:32,470 --> 02:11:32,480
another go and we went.
 

5489
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,470
another go and we went.
So failing in front of value high this

5490
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:34,480
So failing in front of value high this
 

5491
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:36,069
So failing in front of value high this
little shelf I just talked about this

5492
02:11:36,069 --> 02:11:36,079
little shelf I just talked about this
 

5493
02:11:36,079 --> 02:11:39,350
little shelf I just talked about this
shelf here being important [snorts] 21s.

5494
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:39,360
shelf here being important [snorts] 21s.
 

5495
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,030
shelf here being important [snorts] 21s.
We fail that. This is where they're

5496
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:41,040
We fail that. This is where they're
 

5497
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:42,629
We fail that. This is where they're
trying to protect right now. You can see

5498
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:42,639
trying to protect right now. You can see
 

5499
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:46,149
trying to protect right now. You can see
clear rotation.

5500
02:11:46,149 --> 02:11:46,159
clear rotation.
 

5501
02:11:46,159 --> 02:11:47,990
clear rotation.
This shelf right here. Look how sharp

5502
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:48,000
This shelf right here. Look how sharp
 

5503
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,510
This shelf right here. Look how sharp
that is. All right, they are selling

5504
02:11:49,510 --> 02:11:49,520
that is. All right, they are selling
 

5505
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:51,589
that is. All right, they are selling
against that right now. So buyers have

5506
02:11:51,589 --> 02:11:51,599
against that right now. So buyers have
 

5507
02:11:51,599 --> 02:12:00,390
against that right now. So buyers have
got to get back above 21s.

5508
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:00,400

 

5509
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:03,910

I'm not going to read into this.

5510
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:03,920
I'm not going to read into this.
 

5511
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:05,430
I'm not going to read into this.
Tempted to move at my stop up. It's

5512
02:12:05,430 --> 02:12:05,440
Tempted to move at my stop up. It's
 

5513
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,790
Tempted to move at my stop up. It's
still at 94s

5514
02:12:08,790 --> 02:12:08,800
still at 94s
 

5515
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:12,870
still at 94s
30 points. O

5516
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:12,880

 

5517
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:14,470

thing is because we've squeezed we can

5518
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:14,480
thing is because we've squeezed we can
 

5519
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:17,750
thing is because we've squeezed we can
offer quite a big snap. We can we can do

5520
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:17,760
offer quite a big snap. We can we can do
 

5521
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:19,990
offer quite a big snap. We can we can do
something like this if we're going to go

5522
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,000
something like this if we're going to go
 

5523
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,830
something like this if we're going to go
and we can also do this and then I'll

5524
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:21,840
and we can also do this and then I'll
 

5525
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,270
and we can also do this and then I'll
give the whole thing back is this is

5526
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:23,280
give the whole thing back is this is
 

5527
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:24,470
give the whole thing back is this is
always where it's tricky when we're in a

5528
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:24,480
always where it's tricky when we're in a
 

5529
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:25,750
always where it's tricky when we're in a
rotation. I'm going to try and give it a

5530
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:25,760
rotation. I'm going to try and give it a
 

5531
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:28,149
rotation. I'm going to try and give it a
bit more room.

5532
02:12:28,149 --> 02:12:28,159
bit more room.
 

5533
02:12:28,159 --> 02:12:29,830
bit more room.
But the moment I see big selling coming

5534
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:29,840
But the moment I see big selling coming
 

5535
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,550
But the moment I see big selling coming
in and weakness and no buyers like now

5536
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:32,560
in and weakness and no buyers like now
 

5537
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:34,149
in and weakness and no buyers like now
we're starting to see stronger selling.

5538
02:12:34,149 --> 02:12:34,159
we're starting to see stronger selling.
 

5539
02:12:34,159 --> 02:12:35,750
we're starting to see stronger selling.
If I don't see a buyer step up, I'll

5540
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:35,760
If I don't see a buyer step up, I'll
 

5541
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:37,430
If I don't see a buyer step up, I'll
probably cut early. Watch this into VW

5542
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:37,440
probably cut early. Watch this into VW
 

5543
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:43,030
probably cut early. Watch this into VW
up. Watch ES into IB.

5544
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,040

 

5545
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:45,189

Point of control still at 700. So, I'm

5546
02:12:45,189 --> 02:12:45,199
Point of control still at 700. So, I'm
 

5547
02:12:45,199 --> 02:12:47,669
Point of control still at 700. So, I'm
still underneath that. And this is a big

5548
02:12:47,669 --> 02:12:47,679
still underneath that. And this is a big
 

5549
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:51,589
still underneath that. And this is a big
D-shape.

5550
02:12:51,589 --> 02:12:51,599

 

5551
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:53,270

All right. So, we're just in a rotation.

5552
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:53,280
All right. So, we're just in a rotation.
 

5553
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,589
All right. So, we're just in a rotation.
I'd love to see this accelerate now.

5554
02:12:55,589 --> 02:12:55,599
I'd love to see this accelerate now.
 

5555
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:57,350
I'd love to see this accelerate now.
Would make me feel a bit more confident

5556
02:12:57,350 --> 02:12:57,360
Would make me feel a bit more confident
 

5557
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:59,910
Would make me feel a bit more confident
if we can get over 21 about holding this

5558
02:12:59,910 --> 02:12:59,920
if we can get over 21 about holding this
 

5559
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:02,629
if we can get over 21 about holding this
last runner.

5560
02:13:02,629 --> 02:13:02,639
last runner.
 

5561
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:05,030
last runner.
We're still in it. You can see it here.

5562
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:05,040
We're still in it. You can see it here.
 

5563
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:07,750
We're still in it. You can see it here.
All right. 702. Up 72 in this. Just

5564
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:07,760
All right. 702. Up 72 in this. Just
 

5565
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,270
All right. 702. Up 72 in this. Just
looking to see if we can expand a little

5566
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:09,280
looking to see if we can expand a little
 

5567
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:21,350
looking to see if we can expand a little
bit higher.

5568
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:21,360

 

5569
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:23,669

Do I think it would go New York open or

5570
02:13:23,669 --> 02:13:23,679
Do I think it would go New York open or
 

5571
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:26,550
Do I think it would go New York open or
open high? Uh, I don't know, mate. Like,

5572
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:26,560
open high? Uh, I don't know, mate. Like,
 

5573
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:28,149
open high? Uh, I don't know, mate. Like,
it

5574
02:13:28,149 --> 02:13:28,159
it
 

5575
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:30,550
it
I can't predict. All I know is right

5576
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:30,560
I can't predict. All I know is right
 

5577
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:32,470
I can't predict. All I know is right
now, this is a big level. If we get

5578
02:13:32,470 --> 02:13:32,480
now, this is a big level. If we get
 

5579
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:34,149
now, this is a big level. If we get
through this level and base above, we've

5580
02:13:34,149 --> 02:13:34,159
through this level and base above, we've
 

5581
02:13:34,159 --> 02:13:35,830
through this level and base above, we've
got an imbalance here to fill. This is

5582
02:13:35,830 --> 02:13:35,840
got an imbalance here to fill. This is
 

5583
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:37,910
got an imbalance here to fill. This is
thin. All right, we might want to attack

5584
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:37,920
thin. All right, we might want to attack
 

5585
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,589
thin. All right, we might want to attack
this. Right, so one thing at a time,

5586
02:13:39,589 --> 02:13:39,599
this. Right, so one thing at a time,
 

5587
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:40,790
this. Right, so one thing at a time,
right? Let's try and get through this

5588
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:40,800
right? Let's try and get through this
 

5589
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,189
right? Let's try and get through this
first. see how we act here. If we take

5590
02:13:43,189 --> 02:13:43,199
first. see how we act here. If we take
 

5591
02:13:43,199 --> 02:13:44,790
first. see how we act here. If we take
this liquidity here, yeah, then I think

5592
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:44,800
this liquidity here, yeah, then I think
 

5593
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:46,870
this liquidity here, yeah, then I think
we are. But right now, I know that we're

5594
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:46,880
we are. But right now, I know that we're
 

5595
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,669
we are. But right now, I know that we're
into a very big level. If I was train a

5596
02:13:49,669 --> 02:13:49,679
into a very big level. If I was train a
 

5597
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:52,390
into a very big level. If I was train a
range rotator trader, I'd be trying to

5598
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:52,400
range rotator trader, I'd be trying to
 

5599
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,709
range rotator trader, I'd be trying to
sell this or this move back here, right?

5600
02:13:54,709 --> 02:13:54,719
sell this or this move back here, right?
 

5601
02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:56,229
sell this or this move back here, right?
So, I I don't want to predict whether

5602
02:13:56,229 --> 02:13:56,239
So, I I don't want to predict whether
 

5603
02:13:56,239 --> 02:13:57,910
So, I I don't want to predict whether
we're coming here or not yet, right?

5604
02:13:57,910 --> 02:13:57,920
we're coming here or not yet, right?
 

5605
02:13:57,920 --> 02:13:59,589
we're coming here or not yet, right?
Because this could be the end the end of

5606
02:13:59,589 --> 02:13:59,599
Because this could be the end the end of
 

5607
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:01,517
Because this could be the end the end of
the move where we're into at the moment.

5608
02:14:01,517 --> 02:14:01,527
the move where we're into at the moment.
 

5609
02:14:01,527 --> 02:14:02,870
the move where we're into at the moment.

Close to golden pocket. Yeah, we will be

5664
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:00,960
Close to golden pocket. Yeah, we will be
 

5665
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:02,470
Close to golden pocket. Yeah, we will be
probably a bit more left I would have

5666
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:02,480
probably a bit more left I would have
 

5667
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:05,990
probably a bit more left I would have
thought of current day.

5668
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:06,000
thought of current day.
 

5669
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:10,470
thought of current day.
Golden pocket, I would imagine.

5670
02:15:10,470 --> 02:15:10,480
Golden pocket, I would imagine.
 

5671
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:12,709
Golden pocket, I would imagine.
Yeah, 50%. If we go from swing to swing,

5672
02:15:12,709 --> 02:15:12,719
Yeah, 50%. If we go from swing to swing,
 

5673
02:15:12,719 --> 02:15:16,709
Yeah, 50%. If we go from swing to swing,
we're definitely being it. Yeah,

5674
02:15:16,709 --> 02:15:16,719
we're definitely being it. Yeah,
 

5675
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:18,229
we're definitely being it. Yeah,
we're right on the edge. ES starting to

5676
02:15:18,229 --> 02:15:18,239
we're right on the edge. ES starting to
 

5677
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:20,310
we're right on the edge. ES starting to
come back to IB. If ES loses IB, I will

5678
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:20,320
come back to IB. If ES loses IB, I will
 

5679
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,629
come back to IB. If ES loses IB, I will
cut this early

5680
02:15:22,629 --> 02:15:22,639
cut this early
 

5681
02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:24,629
cut this early
cuz it's taking its low hanging through.

5682
02:15:24,629 --> 02:15:24,639
cuz it's taking its low hanging through.
 

5683
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:32,790
cuz it's taking its low hanging through.
At the moment, it's okay.

5684
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:32,800

 

5685
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,229

Golden Pocket, it's just a fib

5686
02:15:34,229 --> 02:15:34,239
Golden Pocket, it's just a fib
 

5687
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:35,990
Golden Pocket, it's just a fib
retracement. All right. When if anyone

5688
02:15:35,990 --> 02:15:36,000
retracement. All right. When if anyone
 

5689
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,189
retracement. All right. When if anyone
says golden pocket, right, they're

5690
02:15:37,189 --> 02:15:37,199
says golden pocket, right, they're
 

5691
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:40,229
says golden pocket, right, they're
talking about the fib, right? Into I

5692
02:15:40,229 --> 02:15:40,239
talking about the fib, right? Into I
 

5693
02:15:40,239 --> 02:15:42,790
talking about the fib, right? Into I
would call it the 618 to 786. Some

5694
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:42,800
would call it the 618 to 786. Some
 

5695
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:45,030
would call it the 618 to 786. Some
people call it the 05 to 61, but really

5696
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:45,040
people call it the 05 to 61, but really
 

5697
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:46,550
people call it the 05 to 61, but really
the 61 is what you want to look at,

5698
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:46,560
the 61 is what you want to look at,
 

5699
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:49,189
the 61 is what you want to look at,
right? 61. When we come to these, all

5700
02:15:49,189 --> 02:15:49,199
right? 61. When we come to these, all
 

5701
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:50,550
right? 61. When we come to these, all
right, these are normally good areas to

5702
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:50,560
right, these are normally good areas to
 

5703
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:53,109
right, these are normally good areas to
sell in based on fibs. All right? But if

5704
02:15:53,109 --> 02:15:53,119
sell in based on fibs. All right? But if
 

5705
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:54,790
sell in based on fibs. All right? But if
you're going to do I'm going from higher

5706
02:15:54,790 --> 02:15:54,800
you're going to do I'm going from higher
 

5707
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,310
you're going to do I'm going from higher
day to lower day. If we come from here,

5708
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:56,320
day to lower day. If we come from here,
 

5709
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:57,669
day to lower day. If we come from here,
we're already into it. If we come from

5710
02:15:57,669 --> 02:15:57,679
we're already into it. If we come from
 

5711
02:15:57,679 --> 02:15:59,510
we're already into it. If we come from
swing to swing, we're already into it.

5712
02:15:59,510 --> 02:15:59,520
swing to swing, we're already into it.
 

5713
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,589
swing to swing, we're already into it.
But my bias is not lower today. Right?

5714
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599
But my bias is not lower today. Right?
 

5715
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:03,350
But my bias is not lower today. Right?
My bias, if you we're here for the

5716
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:03,360
My bias, if you we're here for the
 

5717
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:05,669
My bias, if you we're here for the
pre-market show, my bias was to

5718
02:16:05,669 --> 02:16:05,679
pre-market show, my bias was to
 

5719
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:07,189
pre-market show, my bias was to
potentially come up into here, but we're

5720
02:16:07,189 --> 02:16:07,199
potentially come up into here, but we're
 

5721
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:08,790
potentially come up into here, but we're
not buying the highs. So, this is why

5722
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:08,800
not buying the highs. So, this is why
 

5723
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,550
not buying the highs. So, this is why
the blue boxes, if you ever see a blue

5724
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:10,560
the blue boxes, if you ever see a blue
 

5725
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:12,629
the blue boxes, if you ever see a blue
box on my screen, it's an area of

5726
02:16:12,629 --> 02:16:12,639
box on my screen, it's an area of
 

5727
02:16:12,639 --> 02:16:14,149
box on my screen, it's an area of
interest for me to buy at. It's probably

5728
02:16:14,149 --> 02:16:14,159
interest for me to buy at. It's probably
 

5729
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:17,109
interest for me to buy at. It's probably
an RBS zone. We keep failing up here,

5730
02:16:17,109 --> 02:16:17,119
an RBS zone. We keep failing up here,
 

5731
02:16:17,119 --> 02:16:19,189
an RBS zone. We keep failing up here,
not going to hold this much longer.

5732
02:16:19,189 --> 02:16:19,199
not going to hold this much longer.
 

5733
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:20,550
not going to hold this much longer.
They've just developed another little

5734
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:20,560
They've just developed another little
 

5735
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,470
They've just developed another little
node here.

5736
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:22,480
node here.
 

5737
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:23,990
node here.
Very tempted to take my profit here. I'm

5738
02:16:23,990 --> 02:16:24,000
Very tempted to take my profit here. I'm
 

5739
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:29,109
Very tempted to take my profit here. I'm
trying not to, but this is uh

5740
02:16:29,109 --> 02:16:29,119

Right. If ES loses IB or we lose VWOP or

5748
02:16:39,110 --> 02:16:39,120
Right. If ES loses IB or we lose VWOP or
 

5749
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:41,030
Right. If ES loses IB or we lose VWOP or
VPO. In fact, I'm going to move my stop

5750
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:41,040
VPO. In fact, I'm going to move my stop
 

5751
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:43,349
VPO. In fact, I'm going to move my stop
up a little bit cuz someone can't give

5752
02:16:43,349 --> 02:16:43,359
up a little bit cuz someone can't give
 

5753
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:46,790
up a little bit cuz someone can't give
[\h__\h] 30 40 points back. So, let's

5754
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:46,800
[\h__\h] 30 40 points back. So, let's
 

5755
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,429
[\h__\h] 30 40 points back. So, let's
see. I want to see VWOP defended. I want

5756
02:16:49,429 --> 02:16:49,439
see. I want to see VWOP defended. I want
 

5757
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:51,750
see. I want to see VWOP defended. I want
to see point control defended. Uh point

5758
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:51,760
to see point control defended. Uh point
 

5759
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:53,190
to see point control defended. Uh point
control is not here, folks. Where it

5760
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:53,200
control is not here, folks. Where it
 

5761
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,950
control is not here, folks. Where it
thinks it is. It's at 700. All right.

5762
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:54,960
thinks it is. It's at 700. All right.
 

5763
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:56,950
thinks it is. It's at 700. All right.
So, your point control right now is

5764
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:56,960
So, your point control right now is
 

5765
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:59,910
So, your point control right now is
here. So basically this area needs to be

5766
02:16:59,910 --> 02:16:59,920
here. So basically this area needs to be
 

5767
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,309
here. So basically this area needs to be
defended,

5768
02:17:02,309 --> 02:17:02,319
defended,
 

5769
02:17:02,319 --> 02:17:04,709
defended,
right? Or I'm cutting the trade. This is

5770
02:17:04,709 --> 02:17:04,719
right? Or I'm cutting the trade. This is
 

5771
02:17:04,719 --> 02:17:07,270
right? Or I'm cutting the trade. This is
my area. Bulls defend that or I'm out.

5772
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:07,280
my area. Bulls defend that or I'm out.
 

5773
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:10,230
my area. Bulls defend that or I'm out.

I'm trying to do and implement. Yeah.

5790
02:17:27,509 --> 02:17:27,519
I'm trying to do and implement. Yeah.
 

5791
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:30,870

02:17:34,709 --> 02:17:34,719
into lunch. It's really important you
 

5797
02:17:34,719 --> 02:17:38,230
into lunch. It's really important you
guys try and get here at 9:15. Like 9:15

5798

guys try and get here at 9:15. Like 9:15
 

5799
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:40,150
guys try and get here at 9:15. Like 9:15
to 9:30 is when I tell you what I'm

5800
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,160
to 9:30 is when I tell you what I'm
 

5801
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:42,389
to 9:30 is when I tell you what I'm
looking at and why. And it's important

5802
02:17:42,389 --> 02:17:42,399
looking at and why. And it's important
 

5803
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:44,309
looking at and why. And it's important
we do that analysis. So, so when I'm not

5804
02:17:44,309 --> 02:17:44,319
we do that analysis. So, so when I'm not
 

5805
02:17:44,319 --> 02:17:45,589
we do that analysis. So, so when I'm not
here, you'll be able to do the same

5806
02:17:45,589 --> 02:17:45,599
here, you'll be able to do the same
 

5807
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:46,950
here, you'll be able to do the same
thing for yourself because we do the

5808
02:17:46,950 --> 02:17:46,960
thing for yourself because we do the
 

5809
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:49,270
thing for yourself because we do the
same thing every day. It's habits which

5810
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:49,280
same thing every day. It's habits which
 

5811
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:50,790
same thing every day. It's habits which
are going to make you profitable, right?

5812
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:50,800
are going to make you profitable, right?
 

5813
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,790
are going to make you profitable, right?
Good process, good habits. ES right into

5814
02:17:52,790 --> 02:17:52,800
Good process, good habits. ES right into
 

5815
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:55,509
Good process, good habits. ES right into
this IB.

5816
02:17:55,509 --> 02:17:55,519
this IB.
 

5817
02:17:55,519 --> 02:17:58,309
this IB.
I want to give this too much more time.

5818
02:17:58,309 --> 02:17:58,319
I want to give this too much more time.
 

5819
02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:00,709
I want to give this too much more time.
That's fine. There new 30 minute, 15

5820
02:18:00,709 --> 02:18:00,719
That's fine. There new 30 minute, 15
 

5821
02:18:00,719 --> 02:18:02,709
That's fine. There new 30 minute, 15
minute, 5 minute bar coming in about 90

5822
02:18:02,709 --> 02:18:02,719
minute, 5 minute bar coming in about 90
 

5823
02:18:02,719 --> 02:18:06,150
minute, 5 minute bar coming in about 90
seconds.

5824
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:06,160

 

5825
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,469

The problem is ES can swipe down from

5826
02:18:08,469 --> 02:18:08,479
The problem is ES can swipe down from
 

5827
02:18:08,479 --> 02:18:10,309
The problem is ES can swipe down from
that squeeze up and that will drag us.

5828
02:18:10,309 --> 02:18:10,319
that squeeze up and that will drag us.
 

5829
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:15,669
that squeeze up and that will drag us.
So let's see.

5830
02:18:15,669 --> 02:18:15,679

 

5831
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:25,669

Let's see.

5832
02:18:25,669 --> 02:18:25,679

 

5833
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:28,150

See that transition here? Where are the

5834
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:28,160
See that transition here? Where are the
 

5835
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:30,070
See that transition here? Where are the
shorts stuck? They're not really stuck,

5836
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:30,080
shorts stuck? They're not really stuck,
 

5837
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:33,110
shorts stuck? They're not really stuck,
these shorts until we get to 700 to 94.

5838
02:18:33,110 --> 02:18:33,120
these shorts until we get to 700 to 94.
 

5839
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:35,750
these shorts until we get to 700 to 94.
So, if we bust through this, we're going

5840
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:35,760
So, if we bust through this, we're going
 

5841
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:37,589
So, if we bust through this, we're going
to go. But we got to I don't want to

5842
02:18:37,589 --> 02:18:37,599
to go. But we got to I don't want to
 

5843
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:39,750

really risk. I'm not risking below this.

5844
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:39,760
really risk. I'm not risking below this.
 

5845
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:41,669
really risk. I'm not risking below this.
So, basically, I need these guys to stay

Don't want ES to fail these 30s now. All

5860
02:19:00,629 --> 02:19:00,639
Don't want ES to fail these 30s now. All
 

5861

5863
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:04,389
right, because it's looked above, come
back underneath. I want ES to flag and

5864
02:19:04,389 --> 02:19:04,399
back underneath. I want ES to flag and
 

5865
02:19:04,399 --> 02:19:06,469
back underneath. I want ES to flag and
go. Otherwise, I might cut this a little

5866
02:19:06,469 --> 02:19:06,479
go. Otherwise, I might cut this a little
 

5867
02:19:06,479 --> 02:19:08,549
go. Otherwise, I might cut this a little
bit early. I'm trying to give it room,

5868
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:08,559
bit early. I'm trying to give it room,
 

5869
02:19:08,559 --> 02:19:10,709
bit early. I'm trying to give it room,
but I don't on a day where there's not a

5870
02:19:10,709 --> 02:19:10,719
but I don't on a day where there's not a
 

5871
02:19:10,719 --> 02:19:11,990
but I don't on a day where there's not a
huge amount of volatility, I don't want

5872
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:12,000
huge amount of volatility, I don't want
 

5873
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:22,150
huge amount of volatility, I don't want
to give too much back.

5874
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,160

 

5875
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:24,870

Spider's trying to hold it. ES trying to

02:19:24,870 --> 02:19:24,880
Spider's trying to hold it. ES trying to
 

5877
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:26,230
Spider's trying to hold it. ES trying to
hold it, but it's can't get back through

5878
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:26,240
hold it, but it's can't get back through
 

5879
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:28,709
hold it, but it's can't get back through
those 30s at the moment.

5880
02:19:28,709 --> 02:19:28,719
those 30s at the moment.
 

5881
02:19:28,719 --> 02:19:30,469
those 30s at the moment.
Slightly concerned about a look above

5882
02:19:30,469 --> 02:19:30,479
Slightly concerned about a look above
 

5883
02:19:30,479 --> 02:19:32,070
Slightly concerned about a look above
and fail because it was the low hanging

5884
02:19:32,070 --> 02:19:32,080
and fail because it was the low hanging
 

5885
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:34,870
and fail because it was the low hanging
fruit trade on ES which we've taken. So,

5886
02:19:34,870 --> 02:19:34,880
fruit trade on ES which we've taken. So,
 

5887
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:36,469
fruit trade on ES which we've taken. So,
I I will be honest. I'm slightly

5888
02:19:36,469 --> 02:19:36,479
I I will be honest. I'm slightly
 

5889
02:19:36,479 --> 02:19:37,990
I I will be honest. I'm slightly
concerned about a look above and fail

5890
02:19:37,990 --> 02:19:38,000
concerned about a look above and fail
 

5891
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,190
concerned about a look above and fail
there on the ES. Okay, last chance

5892
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:41,200
there on the ES. Okay, last chance
 

5893
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,270
there on the ES. Okay, last chance
saloon for this market to hold on this

5894
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:43,280
saloon for this market to hold on this
 

5895
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:59,110
saloon for this market to hold on this
dip. Otherwise, I'm out on the runner.

5896
02:19:59,110 --> 02:19:59,120

 

5897
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:01,110

This is that new 5 minute, 15 minute, 30

This is that new 5 minute, 15 minute, 30
 

5899
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:02,710
This is that new 5 minute, 15 minute, 30
minute bar we just talked about. This is

5900
02:20:02,710 --> 02:20:02,720
minute bar we just talked about. This is
 

5901
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:05,190
minute bar we just talked about. This is
increased volatility just for this next

5902
02:20:05,190 --> 02:20:05,200
increased volatility just for this next
 

5903
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:08,790
increased volatility just for this next
minute or two.

I'm going to move my stop right up now
 

5925
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:44,309

lives that explains everything what is
 

5937
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:59,110
lives that explains everything what is
happening. I know. It's cuz most don't

5938
02:20:59,110 --> 02:20:59,120
happening. I know. It's cuz most don't
 

5939
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:01,429
happening. I know. It's cuz most don't
know what they're talking about. Need a

bunch more green day to have money for
 

5943
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,830
bunch more green day to have money for
the course. But so far, compared to

5944
02:21:05,830 --> 02:21:05,840
the course. But so far, compared to
 

5945
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:07,349
the course. But so far, compared to
others I see online, you're amazing

5946
02:21:07,349 --> 02:21:07,359
others I see online, you're amazing

5949
02:21:08,479 --> 02:21:09,590
explaining. Thank you, mate. All right,
I'm out of this. Don't like that

5950
02:21:09,590 --> 02:21:09,600
I'm out of this. Don't like that
 

5951
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:11,670
I'm out of this. Don't like that
rejection. It might hold VPO, but I'm

5952
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:11,680
rejection. It might hold VPO, but I'm
 

5953
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:13,030
rejection. It might hold VPO, but I'm
done. I don't want to give too much back

5954
02:21:13,030 --> 02:21:13,040
done. I don't want to give too much back
 

5955
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,030
done. I don't want to give too much back
on this. We've seen strong sellers and

5956
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:15,040
on this. We've seen strong sellers and
 

5957
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:16,950
on this. We've seen strong sellers and
they can wash down to 90s. I just can't

5958
02:21:16,950 --> 02:21:16,960
they can wash down to 90s. I just can't
 

5959
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:18,870
they can wash down to 90s. I just can't
give too much back. Gray is the area of

5960
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:18,880
give too much back. Gray is the area of
 

5961
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:20,870
give too much back. Gray is the area of
control for these buyers that they need

5962
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:20,880
control for these buyers that they need
 

5963
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,550
control for these buyers that they need
to hold at. All right, so this is the

5964
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:22,560
to hold at. All right, so this is the
 

5965
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,990
to hold at. All right, so this is the
area that buyers will want to absorb

5966
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:24,000
area that buyers will want to absorb
 

5967
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,910
area that buyers will want to absorb
this gray box. But I just can't I cannot

5968
02:21:27,910 --> 02:21:27,920
this gray box. But I just can't I cannot
 

5969
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:29,750
this gray box. But I just can't I cannot
justify this is just justification of

5970
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:29,760
justify this is just justification of
 

5971
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:31,670
justify this is just justification of
the trade. I can't justify trading from

5972
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:31,680
the trade. I can't justify trading from
 

5973
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:34,230
the trade. I can't justify trading from
here partial partial and giving the

5974
02:21:34,230 --> 02:21:34,240
here partial partial and giving the
 

5975
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:35,510
here partial partial and giving the
whole thing back into here. All right.

5976
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:35,520
whole thing back into here. All right.
 

5977
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:37,429
whole thing back into here. All right.
So I cut I moved it tighter and tighter

5978
02:21:37,429 --> 02:21:37,439
So I cut I moved it tighter and tighter
 

5979
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:39,590
So I cut I moved it tighter and tighter
and tighter. I got a bit impatient but

5980
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:39,600
and tighter. I got a bit impatient but
 

5981
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:43,030
and tighter. I got a bit impatient but
it's mainly due to ES again. This is why

5982
02:21:43,030 --> 02:21:43,040
it's mainly due to ES again. This is why
 

5983
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,110
it's mainly due to ES again. This is why
I watched multiple charts. ES starting

5984
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:45,120
I watched multiple charts. ES starting
 

5985
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:47,830
I watched multiple charts. ES starting
to reject this red level. All right. So

5986
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:47,840
to reject this red level. All right. So
 

5987
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:50,950
to reject this red level. All right. So
they look above and fail and it's

5988
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:50,960
they look above and fail and it's
 

5989
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:52,790
they look above and fail and it's
starting to reject that. My danger is if

5990
02:21:52,790 --> 02:21:52,800
starting to reject that. My danger is if
 

5991
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:54,870
starting to reject that. My danger is if
they lose this, we come right the way

5992
02:21:54,870 --> 02:21:54,880
they lose this, we come right the way
 

5993
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:58,070
they lose this, we come right the way
back down to 84 gamma on the spy. So

5994
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,080
back down to 84 gamma on the spy. So
 

5995
02:21:58,080 --> 02:21:59,510
back down to 84 gamma on the spy. So
I've cut this now. I'm just being honest

5996
02:21:59,510 --> 02:21:59,520
I've cut this now. I'm just being honest
 

5997
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:03,030
I've cut this now. I'm just being honest
with you.

5998
02:22:03,030 --> 02:22:03,040

 

5999
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:04,469

Might be that it still goes for you, but

6000
02:22:04,469 --> 02:22:04,479
Might be that it still goes for you, but
 

6001
02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:06,230
Might be that it still goes for you, but
I have cut this at this point. Why have

6002
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:06,240
I have cut this at this point. Why have
 

6003
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:09,270
I have cut this at this point. Why have
we lost in Q?

6004
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:09,280
we lost in Q?
 

6005
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:11,990
we lost in Q?
There we go. Nice trade nonetheless. We

6006
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:12,000
There we go. Nice trade nonetheless. We
 

6007
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,990
There we go. Nice trade nonetheless. We
traded uh what we could get out of it.

6008
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:14,000
traded uh what we could get out of it.
 

6009
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,230
traded uh what we could get out of it.
So, the max we got was from 80. It's a

6010
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:16,240
So, the max we got was from 80. It's a
 

6011
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:17,750
So, the max we got was from 80. It's a
shame we couldn't hold that first

6012
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:17,760
shame we couldn't hold that first
 

6013
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:20,870
shame we couldn't hold that first
attempt or whatever it was. 80 to 20 40

6014
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:20,880
attempt or whatever it was. 80 to 20 40
 

6015
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:22,469
attempt or whatever it was. 80 to 20 40
points. I don't think that's too bad in

6016
02:22:22,469 --> 02:22:22,479
points. I don't think that's too bad in
 

6017
02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:29,190
points. I don't think that's too bad in
the range that we've got today.

6018
02:22:29,190 --> 02:22:29,200

 

6019
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:31,590

Yeah, I would agree, Joe. I mean, SPY

6020
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:31,600
Yeah, I would agree, Joe. I mean, SPY
 

6021
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:33,830
Yeah, I would agree, Joe. I mean, SPY
looks better. What Spy is trying to do

6022
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:33,840
looks better. What Spy is trying to do
 

6023
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:35,590
looks better. What Spy is trying to do
is just hold its initial balance high.

6024
02:22:35,590 --> 02:22:35,600
is just hold its initial balance high.
 

6025
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:37,429
is just hold its initial balance high.
All right, it's trying to hold its IB

6026
02:22:37,429 --> 02:22:37,439
All right, it's trying to hold its IB
 

6027
02:22:37,439 --> 02:22:39,190
All right, it's trying to hold its IB
high and it's trying to, if you look at

6028
02:22:39,190 --> 02:22:39,200
high and it's trying to, if you look at
 

6029
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:41,429
high and it's trying to, if you look at
the morning drive, Joe on spy, you look

6030
02:22:41,429 --> 02:22:41,439
the morning drive, Joe on spy, you look
 

6031
02:22:41,439 --> 02:22:43,190
the morning drive, Joe on spy, you look
at a fiveminute chart in spy, look at

6032
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:43,200
at a fiveminute chart in spy, look at
 

6033
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,030
at a fiveminute chart in spy, look at
the 9:30 high where we've created that

6034
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:45,040
the 9:30 high where we've created that
 

6035
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:47,429
the 9:30 high where we've created that
IB high, right? It's trying to hold

6036
02:22:47,429 --> 02:22:47,439
IB high, right? It's trying to hold
 

6037
02:22:47,439 --> 02:22:49,830
IB high, right? It's trying to hold
that. The problem, right, for those who

6038
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:49,840
that. The problem, right, for those who
 

6039
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:51,830
that. The problem, right, for those who
are new joining, is that we've taken

6040
02:22:51,830 --> 02:22:51,840
are new joining, is that we've taken
 

6041
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:54,309
are new joining, is that we've taken
lowhanging fruit on SPY. So, if Spy is

6042
02:22:54,309 --> 02:22:54,319
lowhanging fruit on SPY. So, if Spy is
 

6043
02:22:54,319 --> 02:22:56,469
lowhanging fruit on SPY. So, if Spy is
going to help us find a bid today,

6044
02:22:56,469 --> 02:22:56,479
going to help us find a bid today,
 

6045
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:58,790
going to help us find a bid today,
right, then we're going to struggle now

6046
02:22:58,790 --> 02:22:58,800
right, then we're going to struggle now
 

6047
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:00,950
right, then we're going to struggle now
because we've taken low hanging fruit.

6048
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:00,960
because we've taken low hanging fruit.
 

6049
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,630
because we've taken low hanging fruit.
And you know my rules. Once low hanging

6050
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:02,640
And you know my rules. Once low hanging
 

6051
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:04,710
And you know my rules. Once low hanging
fruit goes, I become far less interested

6052
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:04,720
fruit goes, I become far less interested
 

6053
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:06,150
fruit goes, I become far less interested
in the market. I'm always looking for

6054
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:06,160
in the market. I'm always looking for
 

6055
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:10,550
in the market. I'm always looking for
that lowhanging fruit trade.

6056
02:23:10,550 --> 02:23:10,560
that lowhanging fruit trade.
 

6057
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:11,990
that lowhanging fruit trade.

Well, most of it depends on liquidity.

6090
02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:51,200
Well, most of it depends on liquidity.
 

6091
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:54,150
Well, most of it depends on liquidity.
So, opening drive, if I if if I know one

6092
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:54,160
So, opening drive, if I if if I know one
 

6093

So, opening drive, if I if if I know one
side's trapped, opening drive, uh,

6094
02:23:56,309 --> 02:23:56,319
side's trapped, opening drive, uh,
 

6095
02:23:56,319 --> 02:23:59,830

02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:01,760
balance rotation,
 

6099
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:03,349
balance rotation,
uh, trend day setup, if we're looking

6100
02:24:03,349 --> 02:24:03,359
uh, trend day setup, if we're looking
 

6101
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:06,070
uh, trend day setup, if we're looking
for dips and flow zones on trend day,

6102
02:24:06,070 --> 02:24:06,080
for dips and flow zones on trend day,
 

6103
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:08,950
for dips and flow zones on trend day,
and I would say like value, value

6104
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:08,960
and I would say like value, value
 

6105
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:11,270
and I would say like value, value
migrating higher, value migrating lower.

6106
02:24:11,270 --> 02:24:11,280
migrating higher, value migrating lower.
 

6107
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:14,309
migrating higher, value migrating lower.
Um, the setup that I don't take, which

6108
02:24:14,309 --> 02:24:14,319
Um, the setup that I don't take, which
 

6109
02:24:14,319 --> 02:24:16,389
Um, the setup that I don't take, which
people here probably take and I don't

6110
02:24:16,389 --> 02:24:16,399
people here probably take and I don't
 

6111
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:18,630
people here probably take and I don't
take, is I don't take a rotation, right?

6112
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:18,640
take, is I don't take a rotation, right?
 

6113
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:20,230
take, is I don't take a rotation, right?
I try and avoid a rotation. You can

6114
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:20,240
I try and avoid a rotation. You can
 

6115
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,230
I try and avoid a rotation. You can
argue today I've taken a rotation. You

6116
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:22,240
argue today I've taken a rotation. You
 

6117
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:24,150
argue today I've taken a rotation. You
can argue that, right? You can argue

6118
02:24:24,150 --> 02:24:24,160
can argue that, right? You can argue
 

6119
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:25,990
can argue that, right? You can argue
I've taken this rotation, but what I'm

6120
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:26,000
I've taken this rotation, but what I'm
 

6121
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,630
I've taken this rotation, but what I'm
trying to say is I won't sell that. All

6122
02:24:28,630 --> 02:24:28,640
trying to say is I won't sell that. All
 

6123
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,710
trying to say is I won't sell that. All
right, back down. It's a legit setup,

6124
02:24:30,710 --> 02:24:30,720
right, back down. It's a legit setup,
 

6125
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,550
right, back down. It's a legit setup,
but I won't sell that back down on a

6126
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:32,560
but I won't sell that back down on a
 

6127
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:34,150
but I won't sell that back down on a
rotation. That's the trade I try and

6128
02:24:34,150 --> 02:24:34,160
rotation. That's the trade I try and
 

6129
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:36,950
rotation. That's the trade I try and
avoid. Um, my favorite favorite favorite

6130
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:36,960
avoid. Um, my favorite favorite favorite
 

6131
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:40,469
avoid. Um, my favorite favorite favorite
favorite favorite trade A+ trade is when

6132
02:24:40,469 --> 02:24:40,479
favorite favorite trade A+ trade is when
 

6133
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:43,349
favorite favorite trade A+ trade is when
we're leaving higher time frame volume

6134
02:24:43,349 --> 02:24:43,359
we're leaving higher time frame volume
 

6135
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:44,710
we're leaving higher time frame volume
trapped. All right, you would have seen

6136
02:24:44,710 --> 02:24:44,720
trapped. All right, you would have seen
 

6137
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:46,630
trapped. All right, you would have seen
we did it a few times last week. The

6138
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:46,640
we did it a few times last week. The
 

6139
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,790
we did it a few times last week. The
break lower two weeks ago was that

6140
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:48,800
break lower two weeks ago was that
 

6141
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:50,950
break lower two weeks ago was that
trade, right? That's my A+ trade. If

6142
02:24:50,950 --> 02:24:50,960
trade, right? That's my A+ trade. If
 

6143
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:53,110
trade, right? That's my A+ trade. If
we're leaving higher time frame volume

6144
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:53,120
we're leaving higher time frame volume
 

6145
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,590
we're leaving higher time frame volume
trapped, that's when I like attacking

6146
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:55,600
trapped, that's when I like attacking
 

6147
02:24:55,600 --> 02:25:01,590
trapped, that's when I like attacking
the market with more size.

6148
02:25:01,590 --> 02:25:01,600

 

6149
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:04,230

Um, do I think we go back and fill the

6150
02:25:04,230 --> 02:25:04,240
Um, do I think we go back and fill the
 

6151
02:25:04,240 --> 02:25:05,990
Um, do I think we go back and fill the
gap?

6152
02:25:05,990 --> 02:25:06,000
gap?
 

6153
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,670
gap?
I don't know. Not Not at the moment.

6154
02:25:07,670 --> 02:25:07,680
I don't know. Not Not at the moment.
 

6155
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:09,270
I don't know. Not Not at the moment.
Like I said, I don't I don't think we

6156
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:09,280
Like I said, I don't I don't think we
 

6157
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:11,429
Like I said, I don't I don't think we
need to do that. All right. If we just

6158
02:25:11,429 --> 02:25:11,439
need to do that. All right. If we just
 

6159
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:14,389
need to do that. All right. If we just
trade take the indicators off,

6160
02:25:14,389 --> 02:25:14,399
trade take the indicators off,
 

6161
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:15,910
trade take the indicators off,
I'm just going to take everything off

6162
02:25:15,910 --> 02:25:15,920
I'm just going to take everything off
 

6163
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:17,590
I'm just going to take everything off
for a second and just look at what we've

6164
02:25:17,590 --> 02:25:17,600
for a second and just look at what we've
 

6165
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:19,990
for a second and just look at what we've
got. Right. Let's just let's just think

6166
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:20,000
got. Right. Let's just let's just think
 

6167
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,309
got. Right. Let's just let's just think
about migration of value. Let's think

6168
02:25:22,309 --> 02:25:22,319
about migration of value. Let's think
 

6169
02:25:22,319 --> 02:25:25,030
about migration of value. Let's think
about what we're seeing. Remember, we

6170
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:25,040
about what we're seeing. Remember, we
 

6171
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:26,950
about what we're seeing. Remember, we
traded long last week when lots of

6172
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:26,960
traded long last week when lots of
 

6173
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:28,710
traded long last week when lots of
people were trying to trade short. So at

6174
02:25:28,710 --> 02:25:28,720
people were trying to trade short. So at
 

6175
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:32,070
people were trying to trade short. So at
these lows, let's just think what about

6176
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:32,080
these lows, let's just think what about
 

6177
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:33,510
these lows, let's just think what about
I'm going to move to like a five minute

6178
02:25:33,510 --> 02:25:33,520
I'm going to move to like a five minute
 

6179
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,070
I'm going to move to like a five minute
chart. Make this make sense. Let's think

6180
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:36,080
chart. Make this make sense. Let's think
 

6181
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:37,830
chart. Make this make sense. Let's think
about what we've had develop over the

6182
02:25:37,830 --> 02:25:37,840
about what we've had develop over the
 

6183
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:39,670
about what we've had develop over the
last few weeks and think about where we

6184
02:25:39,670 --> 02:25:39,680
last few weeks and think about where we
 

6185
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:43,510
last few weeks and think about where we
are. Right? This is a twoe balance

6186
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:43,520
are. Right? This is a twoe balance
 

6187
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:45,110
are. Right? This is a twoe balance
range.

6188
02:25:45,110 --> 02:25:45,120
range.
 

6189
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:48,070
range.
This we traded short aggressively. Okay.

6190
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:48,080
This we traded short aggressively. Okay.
 

6191
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:50,309
This we traded short aggressively. Okay.
This we traded short aggressively. Why?

6192
02:25:50,309 --> 02:25:50,319
This we traded short aggressively. Why?
 

6193
02:25:50,319 --> 02:25:51,910
This we traded short aggressively. Why?
These are the A+ trades I just went

6194
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:51,920
These are the A+ trades I just went
 

6195
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:54,790
These are the A+ trades I just went
over. Leaving two weeks trapped. We're

6196
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:54,800
over. Leaving two weeks trapped. We're
 

6197
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:57,030
over. Leaving two weeks trapped. We're
going to use their pain trade lower.

6198
02:25:57,030 --> 02:25:57,040
going to use their pain trade lower.
 

6199
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:00,550
going to use their pain trade lower.
Right. This we avoided if everyone can

6200
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:00,560
Right. This we avoided if everyone can
 

6201
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:02,389
Right. This we avoided if everyone can
remember this and this I said is

6202
02:26:02,389 --> 02:26:02,399
remember this and this I said is
 

6203
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:04,309
remember this and this I said is
probably likely to be a bull trap which

6204
02:26:04,309 --> 02:26:04,319
probably likely to be a bull trap which
 

6205
02:26:04,319 --> 02:26:06,550
probably likely to be a bull trap which
is sold. This we traded short. Right.

6206
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:06,560
is sold. This we traded short. Right.
 

6207
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:09,429
is sold. This we traded short. Right.
Because why? This is a two-leg into trap

6208
02:26:09,429 --> 02:26:09,439
Because why? This is a two-leg into trap
 

6209
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:11,110
Because why? This is a two-leg into trap
players. You got trap buyers here. We

6210
02:26:11,110 --> 02:26:11,120
players. You got trap buyers here. We
 

6211
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:13,190
players. You got trap buyers here. We
trade short. Trap buyers here. We trade

6212
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:13,200
trade short. Trap buyers here. We trade
 

6213
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:15,510
trade short. Trap buyers here. We trade
short. First attempt back in off a

6214
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:15,520
short. First attempt back in off a
 

6215
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:18,150
short. First attempt back in off a
two-leg. We trade short. This down here

6216
02:26:18,150 --> 02:26:18,160
two-leg. We trade short. This down here
 

6217
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:19,910
two-leg. We trade short. This down here
was an old naked point of control. Those

6218
02:26:19,910 --> 02:26:19,920
was an old naked point of control. Those
 

6219
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:21,190
was an old naked point of control. Those
who have been here the last two weeks

6220
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:21,200
who have been here the last two weeks
 

6221
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:22,389
who have been here the last two weeks
will know that we were looking for that.

6222
02:26:22,389 --> 02:26:22,399
will know that we were looking for that.
 

6223
02:26:22,399 --> 02:26:24,309
will know that we were looking for that.
It's in the free newsletter. All right.

6224
02:26:24,309 --> 02:26:24,319
It's in the free newsletter. All right.
 

6225
02:26:24,319 --> 02:26:25,990
It's in the free newsletter. All right.
This is your overunder. So they wash

6226
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:26,000
This is your overunder. So they wash
 

6227
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,070
This is your overunder. So they wash
underneath. They find a bid over. They

6228
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:28,080
underneath. They find a bid over. They
 

6229
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:29,750
underneath. They find a bid over. They
hold it. Now what we going to do? Trade

6230
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,760
hold it. Now what we going to do? Trade
 

6231
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:32,469
hold it. Now what we going to do? Trade
long to where this this pain point,

6232
02:26:32,469 --> 02:26:32,479
long to where this this pain point,
 

6233
02:26:32,479 --> 02:26:36,870
long to where this this pain point,
right? Because this move here is a 61 on

6234
02:26:36,870 --> 02:26:36,880
right? Because this move here is a 61 on
 

6235
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:38,870
right? Because this move here is a 61 on
a daily and weekly. This is a the golden

6236
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:38,880
a daily and weekly. This is a the golden
 

6237
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:40,469
a daily and weekly. This is a the golden
zone on the daily and weekly. So we bid

6238
02:26:40,469 --> 02:26:40,479
zone on the daily and weekly. So we bid
 

6239
02:26:40,479 --> 02:26:43,349
zone on the daily and weekly. So we bid
up here. The same thing. We bid up. But

6240
02:26:43,349 --> 02:26:43,359
up here. The same thing. We bid up. But
 

6241
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:45,349
up here. The same thing. We bid up. But
here we don't want to bid up in this

6242
02:26:45,349 --> 02:26:45,359
here we don't want to bid up in this
 

6243
02:26:45,359 --> 02:26:47,429
here we don't want to bid up in this
part in this part. Remember the ma main

6244
02:26:47,429 --> 02:26:47,439
part in this part. Remember the ma main
 

6245
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:50,150
part in this part. Remember the ma main
money long was made here and here. We're

6246
02:26:50,150 --> 02:26:50,160
money long was made here and here. We're
 

6247
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:51,590
money long was made here and here. We're
breaking out of this cycle, this

6248
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:51,600
breaking out of this cycle, this
 

6249
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:53,190
breaking out of this cycle, this
downtrend. But we don't want to be a new

6250
02:26:53,190 --> 02:26:53,200
downtrend. But we don't want to be a new
 

6251
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:54,870
downtrend. But we don't want to be a new
money long up here. So, we want to play

6252
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:54,880
money long up here. So, we want to play
 

6253
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:57,510
money long up here. So, we want to play
dips back down. So, I remove all this,

6254
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:57,520
dips back down. So, I remove all this,
 

6255
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:58,870
dips back down. So, I remove all this,
then we can think about what's happened

6256
02:26:58,870 --> 02:26:58,880
then we can think about what's happened
 

6257
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:04,150
then we can think about what's happened
last week and where we're trading from.

6258
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:04,160
last week and where we're trading from.
 

6259
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:08,790
last week and where we're trading from.
So, if we draw out last week's value,

6260
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:08,800
So, if we draw out last week's value,
 

6261
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:11,190
So, if we draw out last week's value,
previous week value area high, previous

6262
02:27:11,190 --> 02:27:11,200
previous week value area high, previous
 

6263
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:14,630
previous week value area high, previous
week value area low is here.

6264
02:27:14,630 --> 02:27:14,640
week value area low is here.
 

6265
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:16,389
week value area low is here.
Friday

6266
02:27:16,389 --> 02:27:16,399
Friday
 

6267
02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:19,270
Friday
is here.

6268
02:27:19,270 --> 02:27:19,280
is here.
 

6269
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:21,990
is here.
Gap is this gray box. So, if we're

6270
02:27:21,990 --> 02:27:22,000
Gap is this gray box. So, if we're
 

6271
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,309
Gap is this gray box. So, if we're
opening higher,

6272
02:27:24,309 --> 02:27:24,319
opening higher,
 

6273
02:27:24,319 --> 02:27:26,950
opening higher,
who's trapped right now, right? Who's

6274
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:26,960
who's trapped right now, right? Who's
 

6275
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:29,590
who's trapped right now, right? Who's
trapped from the previous week? Well, if

6276
02:27:29,590 --> 02:27:29,600
trapped from the previous week? Well, if
 

6277
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:33,590
trapped from the previous week? Well, if
you were short here or here or here,

6278
02:27:33,590 --> 02:27:33,600
you were short here or here or here,
 

6279
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:35,349
you were short here or here or here,
you're out the money, right? So, the

6280
02:27:35,349 --> 02:27:35,359
you're out the money, right? So, the
 

6281
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:37,590
you're out the money, right? So, the
participant who's trapped right now is a

6282
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:37,600
participant who's trapped right now is a
 

6283
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,150
participant who's trapped right now is a
seller. So, we want to bid up. The

6284
02:27:40,150 --> 02:27:40,160
seller. So, we want to bid up. The
 

6285
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:43,429
seller. So, we want to bid up. The
problem is if we look left, the

6286
02:27:43,429 --> 02:27:43,439
problem is if we look left, the
 

6287
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:46,230
problem is if we look left, the
participant who's trapped in here is a

6288
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:46,240
participant who's trapped in here is a
 

6289
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:52,150
participant who's trapped in here is a
buyer. So, our range we need to respect

6290
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:52,160

 

6291
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:54,469

this this week's value or last week's

6292
02:27:54,469 --> 02:27:54,479
this this week's value or last week's
 

6293
02:27:54,479 --> 02:27:56,309
this this week's value or last week's
value

6294
02:27:56,309 --> 02:27:56,319
value
 

6295
02:27:56,319 --> 02:27:58,630
value
to this week's value. We're trading in

6296
02:27:58,630 --> 02:27:58,640
to this week's value. We're trading in
 

6297
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:01,110
to this week's value. We're trading in
between this. Does that make sense? This

6298
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:01,120
between this. Does that make sense? This
 

6299
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:04,230
between this. Does that make sense? This
is buyers stuck. This is seller stuck.

6300
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:04,240
is buyers stuck. This is seller stuck.
 

6301
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:06,309
is buyers stuck. This is seller stuck.
This is where we are. So, we don't want

6302
02:28:06,309 --> 02:28:06,319
This is where we are. So, we don't want
 

6303
02:28:06,319 --> 02:28:08,710
This is where we are. So, we don't want
to buy up here and we don't want to sell

6304
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:08,720
to buy up here and we don't want to sell
 

6305
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:11,110
to buy up here and we don't want to sell
down here. So, we want to buy the dips

6306
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:11,120
down here. So, we want to buy the dips
 

6307
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:13,910
down here. So, we want to buy the dips
for this move up. And you want to sell

6308
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:13,920
for this move up. And you want to sell
 

6309
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:16,550
for this move up. And you want to sell
if you're really bearish the move back

6310
02:28:16,550 --> 02:28:16,560
if you're really bearish the move back
 

6311
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,870
if you're really bearish the move back
down from here where they're stuck back

6312
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:18,880
down from here where they're stuck back
 

6313
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:21,030
down from here where they're stuck back
down. I don't want to take that move in

6314
02:28:21,030 --> 02:28:21,040
down. I don't want to take that move in
 

6315
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:23,510
down. I don't want to take that move in
in a holiday session especially, okay?

6316
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,520
in a holiday session especially, okay?
 

6317
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:26,070
in a holiday session especially, okay?
Unless things change. So that's why we

6318
02:28:26,070 --> 02:28:26,080
Unless things change. So that's why we
 

6319
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:28,230
Unless things change. So that's why we
were biased to the upside today and it's

6320
02:28:28,230 --> 02:28:28,240
were biased to the upside today and it's
 

6321
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:30,070
were biased to the upside today and it's
also why we didn't buy the open because

6322
02:28:30,070 --> 02:28:30,080
also why we didn't buy the open because
 

6323
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:32,630
also why we didn't buy the open because
we're too close to this box where those

6324
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:32,640
we're too close to this box where those
 

6325
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:34,710
we're too close to this box where those
participants who are buyers are trapped.

6326
02:28:34,710 --> 02:28:34,720
participants who are buyers are trapped.
 

6327
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:38,630
participants who are buyers are trapped.
So we wanted to buy two possible levels.

6328
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:38,640
So we wanted to buy two possible levels.
 

6329
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:42,550
So we wanted to buy two possible levels.
One level is here and one level is here.

6330
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:42,560
One level is here and one level is here.
 

6331
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:44,150
One level is here and one level is here.
All right. So we want to buy for this

6332
02:28:44,150 --> 02:28:44,160
All right. So we want to buy for this
 

6333
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:46,150
All right. So we want to buy for this
move. We want to buy for this move. Now,

6334
02:28:46,150 --> 02:28:46,160
move. We want to buy for this move. Now,
 

6335
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:48,389
move. We want to buy for this move. Now,
if they collapse this, right, once we

6336
02:28:48,389 --> 02:28:48,399
if they collapse this, right, once we
 

6337
02:28:48,399 --> 02:28:50,070
if they collapse this, right, once we
hit this, I'm taking my profit. Now, if

6338
02:28:50,070 --> 02:28:50,080
hit this, I'm taking my profit. Now, if
 

6339
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:52,150
hit this, I'm taking my profit. Now, if
they want to sell that back down, then I

6340
02:28:52,150 --> 02:28:52,160
they want to sell that back down, then I
 

6341
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:54,309
they want to sell that back down, then I
will participate. All right, once we get

6342
02:28:54,309 --> 02:28:54,319
will participate. All right, once we get
 

6343
02:28:54,319 --> 02:28:57,270
will participate. All right, once we get
up into this old point of control, if

6344
02:28:57,270 --> 02:28:57,280
up into this old point of control, if
 

6345
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:59,190
up into this old point of control, if
they want to do something like this,

6346
02:28:59,190 --> 02:28:59,200
they want to do something like this,
 

6347
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:00,710
they want to do something like this,
right, then I'll sell back down. That

6348
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:00,720
right, then I'll sell back down. That
 

6349
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:02,150
right, then I'll sell back down. That
becomes the protren. And that would be a

6350
02:29:02,150 --> 02:29:02,160
becomes the protren. And that would be a
 

6351
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:03,750
becomes the protren. And that would be a
bull trap, something we can go over

6352
02:29:03,750 --> 02:29:03,760
bull trap, something we can go over
 

6353
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:06,070
bull trap, something we can go over
maybe next week or whenever we're back

6354
02:29:06,070 --> 02:29:06,080
maybe next week or whenever we're back
 

6355
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:08,950
maybe next week or whenever we're back
in the market. If we collapse this now

6356
02:29:08,950 --> 02:29:08,960
in the market. If we collapse this now
 

6357
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:10,950
in the market. If we collapse this now
and come back into previous days value

6358
02:29:10,950 --> 02:29:10,960
and come back into previous days value
 

6359
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:12,950
and come back into previous days value
and previous week's value, previous days

6360
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:12,960
and previous week's value, previous days
 

6361
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:17,429
and previous week's value, previous days
value and previous week's value, right?

6362
02:29:17,429 --> 02:29:17,439
value and previous week's value, right?
 

6363
02:29:17,439 --> 02:29:19,670
value and previous week's value, right?
Do I want to buy it? I'm happy to buy

6364
02:29:19,670 --> 02:29:19,680
Do I want to buy it? I'm happy to buy
 

6365
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:21,429
Do I want to buy it? I'm happy to buy
all the time we're holding, but if we

6366
02:29:21,429 --> 02:29:21,439
all the time we're holding, but if we
 

6367
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:23,670
all the time we're holding, but if we
come back in here, these are the trades

6368
02:29:23,670 --> 02:29:23,680
come back in here, these are the trades
 

6369
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:25,670
come back in here, these are the trades
I try and avoid. I don't want to trade

6370
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:25,680
I try and avoid. I don't want to trade
 

6371
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:27,750
I try and avoid. I don't want to trade
in previous week's value, right? I

6372
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:27,760
in previous week's value, right? I
 

6373
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:29,990
in previous week's value, right? I
really don't. I I want to see us bid up

6374
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:30,000
really don't. I I want to see us bid up
 

6375
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,670
really don't. I I want to see us bid up
or I want to sell high for the trade

6376
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:31,680
or I want to sell high for the trade
 

6377
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:33,510
or I want to sell high for the trade
back down into there and hold runners. I

6378
02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:33,520
back down into there and hold runners. I
 

6379
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:36,309
back down into there and hold runners. I
don't want to participate in value. for

6380
02:29:36,309 --> 02:29:36,319
don't want to participate in value. for
 

6381
02:29:36,319 --> 02:29:39,349
don't want to participate in value. for
me. That's for me. That's my setup. I

6382
02:29:39,349 --> 02:29:39,359
me. That's for me. That's my setup. I
 

6383
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:41,510
me. That's for me. That's my setup. I
choose to try and avoid that because I

6384
02:29:41,510 --> 02:29:41,520
choose to try and avoid that because I
 

6385
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:45,670
choose to try and avoid that because I
hate trading rotations. I hate it. So,

6386
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:45,680
hate trading rotations. I hate it. So,
 

6387
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:48,230
hate trading rotations. I hate it. So,
if I can avoid trading it, you'll find

6388
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:48,240
if I can avoid trading it, you'll find
 

6389
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:50,230
if I can avoid trading it, you'll find
my P&L factor goes up. So, hopefully

6390
02:29:50,230 --> 02:29:50,240
my P&L factor goes up. So, hopefully
 

6391
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:51,830
my P&L factor goes up. So, hopefully
that makes sense to you guys. There's a

6392
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:51,840
that makes sense to you guys. There's a
 

6393
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:53,349
that makes sense to you guys. There's a
little lesson there on why. See, this

6394
02:29:53,349 --> 02:29:53,359
little lesson there on why. See, this
 

6395
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:55,110
little lesson there on why. See, this
gray box is still holding. I said buyers

6396
02:29:55,110 --> 02:29:55,120
gray box is still holding. I said buyers
 

6397
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,870
gray box is still holding. I said buyers
will want to hold that. It's just based

6398
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:56,880
will want to hold that. It's just based
 

6399
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:59,590
will want to hold that. It's just based
on volume.

6400
02:29:59,590 --> 02:29:59,600
on volume.
 

6401
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,830
on volume.
Um, [sighs]

6402
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:01,840
Um, [sighs]
 

6403
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:04,469
Um, [sighs]
ever tried ICT? I've looked at it, man.

6404
02:30:04,469 --> 02:30:04,479
ever tried ICT? I've looked at it, man.
 

6405
02:30:04,479 --> 02:30:07,030
ever tried ICT? I've looked at it, man.
But it's

6406
02:30:07,030 --> 02:30:07,040
But it's
 

6407
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:10,273
But it's
look,

6408
02:30:10,273 --> 02:30:10,283

 

6409
02:30:10,283 --> 02:30:12,309

[laughter] there are some useful

6410
02:30:12,309 --> 02:30:12,319
[laughter] there are some useful
 

6411
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:15,910
[laughter] there are some useful
teachings there, all right? But they are

6412
02:30:15,910 --> 02:30:15,920
teachings there, all right? But they are
 

6413
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:18,230
teachings there, all right? But they are
not his teachings and they lack real

6414
02:30:18,230 --> 02:30:18,240
not his teachings and they lack real
 

6415
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:20,389
not his teachings and they lack real
detail and

6416
02:30:20,389 --> 02:30:20,399
detail and
 

6417
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:23,670
detail and
um

6418
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:23,680

 

6419
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:25,750

well, I'm just going to avoid saying any

6420
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:25,760
well, I'm just going to avoid saying any
 

6421
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:27,190
well, I'm just going to avoid saying any
more than that. There are people that

6422
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:27,200
more than that. There are people that
 

6423
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:30,070
more than that. There are people that
make a lot of money from it. Um

6424
02:30:30,070 --> 02:30:30,080
make a lot of money from it. Um
 

6425
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,349
make a lot of money from it. Um
but I think they make money because

6426
02:30:31,349 --> 02:30:31,359
but I think they make money because
 

6427
02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:32,630
but I think they make money because
they're good traders. And I think you

6428
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:32,640
they're good traders. And I think you
 

6429
02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:34,309
they're good traders. And I think you
find they use lots of other tools that

6430
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:34,319
find they use lots of other tools that
 

6431
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:37,670
find they use lots of other tools that
they don't talk about. Um,

6432
02:30:37,670 --> 02:30:37,680
they don't talk about. Um,
 

6433
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:40,309
they don't talk about. Um,
can I re recommend some resources? What

6434
02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:40,319
can I re recommend some resources? What
 

6435
02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:42,389
can I re recommend some resources? What
do you want the on what, Jacks? If you

6436
02:30:42,389 --> 02:30:42,399
do you want the on what, Jacks? If you
 

6437
02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:43,910
do you want the on what, Jacks? If you
let me know on what, then I will give

6438
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:43,920
let me know on what, then I will give
 

6439
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:46,070
let me know on what, then I will give
you some resources. I've taken the

6440
02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:46,080
you some resources. I've taken the
 

6441
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:47,830
you some resources. I've taken the
previous course. It was like an intro

6442
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:47,840
previous course. It was like an intro
 

6443
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:51,110
previous course. It was like an intro
course. Way overpriced.

6444
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:51,120
course. Way overpriced.
 

6445
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:55,270
course. Way overpriced.
Which course? You think the $649

6446
02:30:55,270 --> 02:30:55,280
Which course? You think the $649
 

6447
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:59,830
Which course? You think the $649

02:34:49,670 --> 02:34:49,680
trapped here and we have an imbalance
 

6609
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:51,270
trapped here and we have an imbalance
here and if we hold this we're going to

6611
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,750
here and if we hold this we're going to
come back up. That's the difference. I

02:34:53,750 --> 02:34:53,760
come back up. That's the difference. I
 

6613
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:55,510
come back up. That's the difference. I
can see what's going on inside of all

02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:55,520
can see what's going on inside of all
 

6615

02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:02,550
bookmap or footprint or whatever else
works for you. I need to know what's

02:35:02,550 --> 02:35:02,560
works for you. I need to know what's
 

6621
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:05,830
works for you. I need to know what's
really going on. And most most trades in

6622
02:35:05,830 --> 02:35:05,840
really going on. And most most trades in
 

6623
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:07,750
really going on. And most most trades in
the market come from trap traders. Where

6624
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:07,760
the market come from trap traders. Where
 

6625
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:09,510
the market come from trap traders. Where
are trap traders? Edge of auction,

6626
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:09,520
are trap traders? Edge of auction,
 

6627
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:11,830
are trap traders? Edge of auction,
right? The last seller sold here. Why

6628
02:35:11,830 --> 02:35:11,840
right? The last seller sold here. Why
 

6629
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:13,910
right? The last seller sold here. Why
did he sell there? Well, he got stuck

6630
02:35:13,910 --> 02:35:13,920
did he sell there? Well, he got stuck
 

6631
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:15,190
did he sell there? Well, he got stuck
trying to think we were going to close

6632
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:15,200
trying to think we were going to close
 

6633
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:17,270
trying to think we were going to close
this gap. So, he tra he sold the gap

6634
02:35:17,270 --> 02:35:17,280
this gap. So, he tra he sold the gap
 

6635
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:19,750
this gap. So, he tra he sold the gap
fill. Well, he got stuck. So, whose pain

6636
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
fill. Well, he got stuck. So, whose pain
 

6637
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,429
fill. Well, he got stuck. So, whose pain
do we use? His. Where do we go? This

6638
02:35:21,429 --> 02:35:21,439
do we use? His. Where do we go? This
 

6639
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:23,030
do we use? His. Where do we go? This
way. Remember earlier in the day I said,

money in the market. But if you do the
 

6813
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,510
money in the market. But if you do the
course for $99 and you complete it, you

6814
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:03,520
course for $99 and you complete it, you

6817
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,670
get a $100 gift voucher off the 20hour
course. So you get the beginner course

6818
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:07,680
course. So you get the beginner course
 

6819
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:09,830
course. So you get the beginner course
and you get beginner to advance then for

golf is not a game of perfect. I think

6866
02:40:38,710 --> 02:40:38,720
golf is not a game of perfect. I think
 

6867
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:40,950
golf is not a game of perfect. I think
that is probably the best non-trading

6868
02:40:40,950 --> 02:40:40,960
that is probably the best non-trading
 

6869
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:43,830
that is probably the best non-trading

So simple. Okay, they've held this gray

6872
02:40:45,910 --> 02:40:45,920
So simple. Okay, they've held this gray
 

6873
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:47,190
So simple. Okay, they've held this gray
box. You can see they've held this

6874
02:40:47,190 --> 02:40:47,200
box. You can see they've held this
 

6875
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:49,190
box. You can see they've held this
shelf. They're trying to find a bid to

6876
02:40:49,190 --> 02:40:49,200
shelf. They're trying to find a bid to
 

6877
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:51,429
shelf. They're trying to find a bid to
move higher. So shorts fail to get the

6878
02:40:51,429 --> 02:40:51,439
move higher. So shorts fail to get the
 

6879
02:40:51,439 --> 02:40:53,510
move higher. So shorts fail to get the
rotation there. All right. So they tried

6880
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:53,520
rotation there. All right. So they tried
 

6881
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:55,110
rotation there. All right. So they tried
they've tried to break here. They've

6882
02:40:55,110 --> 02:40:55,120
they've tried to break here. They've
 

6883
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:57,910
they've tried to break here. They've
tried once, twice. If they start seeing

6884
02:40:57,910 --> 02:40:57,920
tried once, twice. If they start seeing
 

6885
02:40:57,920 --> 02:40:59,510
tried once, twice. If they start seeing
absorption here, this is going to happen

6886
02:40:59,510 --> 02:40:59,520
absorption here, this is going to happen
 

6887
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:01,190
absorption here, this is going to happen
through this. I'm not playing anymore,

6888
02:41:01,190 --> 02:41:01,200
through this. I'm not playing anymore,
 

6889
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:12,230
through this. I'm not playing anymore,
folks. I've lost interest.

Candlesticks are confirmation for order
 

6893
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:16,070
Candlesticks are confirmation for order
flow. Yeah, I mean like I said, look,

6894
02:41:16,070 --> 02:41:16,080
flow. Yeah, I mean like I said, look,
 

6895
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:18,710
flow. Yeah, I mean like I said, look,
you can you don't have to use orderflow.

6896
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:18,720
you can you don't have to use orderflow.
 

6897
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:21,270
you can you don't have to use orderflow.
You don't like it's not for everyone,

You don't like it's not for everyone,
but like I would advise you at least use

6900
02:41:23,349 --> 02:41:23,359
but like I would advise you at least use
 

6901
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:25,990
but like I would advise you at least use
volume. It's the easiest thing to use on

6902
02:41:25,990 --> 02:41:26,000
volume. It's the easiest thing to use on

a chart is a profile. This is telling

6904
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:29,200
a chart is a profile. This is telling
 

6905
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:30,870
a chart is a profile. This is telling
you where we're finding acceptance.

6906
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:30,880
you where we're finding acceptance.
 

6907
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:32,550
you where we're finding acceptance.
We're not finding acceptance under,

02:41:34,630 --> 02:41:34,640
we're not finding acceptance over. We're
 

6911
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:36,950
we're not finding acceptance over. We're
rotating in here. This is fair value for

6912
02:41:36,950 --> 02:41:36,960
rotating in here. This is fair value for
 

6913
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:38,389
rotating in here. This is fair value for
the day. I don't like trading around

6914
02:41:38,389 --> 02:41:38,399
the day. I don't like trading around
 

6915
02:41:38,399 --> 02:41:40,309
the day. I don't like trading around
fair value for the day. I try and avoid

6916
02:41:40,309 --> 02:41:40,319
fair value for the day. I try and avoid
 

6917
02:41:40,319 --> 02:41:41,830
fair value for the day. I try and avoid
trading around fair value. Why? because

6918
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:41,840
trading around fair value. Why? because
 

6919
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:43,110
trading around fair value. Why? because
it's going to be the most competitive

6920
02:41:43,110 --> 02:41:43,120
it's going to be the most competitive
 

6921
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:44,550
it's going to be the most competitive
price. If we're going to start moving

6922
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:44,560
price. If we're going to start moving
 

6923
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:46,309
price. If we're going to start moving
away, there's a trade there. We start

6924
02:41:46,309 --> 02:41:46,319
away, there's a trade there. We start
 

6925
02:41:46,319 --> 02:41:47,910
away, there's a trade there. We start
moving below, there's a trade there, but

6926
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:47,920
moving below, there's a trade there, but
 

6927
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:49,270
moving below, there's a trade there, but
there's only a trade to these levels

6928
02:41:49,270 --> 02:41:49,280
there's only a trade to these levels
 

6929
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:51,429
there's only a trade to these levels
until we prove otherwise. So, at least

6930
02:41:51,429 --> 02:41:51,439
until we prove otherwise. So, at least
 

6931
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:54,150
until we prove otherwise. So, at least
put profile on your chart. Only the

6932
02:41:54,150 --> 02:41:54,160
put profile on your chart. Only the
 

6933
02:41:54,160 --> 02:41:55,429
put profile on your chart. Only the
second streamer that you've seen that

6934
02:41:55,429 --> 02:41:55,439
second streamer that you've seen that
 

6935
02:41:55,439 --> 02:41:56,870
second streamer that you've seen that
has ads turned off. Yeah, I always have

6936
02:41:56,870 --> 02:41:56,880
has ads turned off. Yeah, I always have
 

6937
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:59,590
has ads turned off. Yeah, I always have
them turned off. I put them back. I put

6938
02:41:59,590 --> 02:41:59,600
them turned off. I put them back. I put
 

6939
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:03,910
them turned off. I put them back. I put
them on once I finished the stream.

6940
02:42:03,910 --> 02:42:03,920
them on once I finished the stream.
 

6941
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:05,510
them on once I finished the stream.
How would you know traders are trapped

6942
02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:05,520
How would you know traders are trapped
 

6943
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:07,110
How would you know traders are trapped
without order flow? Well, you wouldn't

6944
02:42:07,110 --> 02:42:07,120
without order flow? Well, you wouldn't
 

6945
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:09,750
without order flow? Well, you wouldn't
really. you'd be having to think about

6946
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:09,760
really. you'd be having to think about
 

6947
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:12,870
really. you'd be having to think about
uh like wicks on candles, right? So, you

6948
02:42:12,870 --> 02:42:12,880
uh like wicks on candles, right? So, you
 

6949
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:15,429
uh like wicks on candles, right? So, you
would have to make assumptions

6950
02:42:15,429 --> 02:42:15,439
would have to make assumptions
 

6951
02:42:15,439 --> 02:42:17,110
would have to make assumptions
and that's really what you're making.

6952
02:42:17,110 --> 02:42:17,120
and that's really what you're making.
 

6953
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:19,670
and that's really what you're making.
You're making an assumption in here. All

6954
02:42:19,670 --> 02:42:19,680
You're making an assumption in here. All
 

6955
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:22,950
You're making an assumption in here. All
right, that shorts are trapped and if we

6956
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:22,960
right, that shorts are trapped and if we
 

6957
02:42:22,960 --> 02:42:24,389
right, that shorts are trapped and if we
don't come back down to this level that

6958
02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:24,399
don't come back down to this level that
 

6959
02:42:24,399 --> 02:42:25,910
don't come back down to this level that
they remain trapped and the same for

6960
02:42:25,910 --> 02:42:25,920
they remain trapped and the same for
 

6961
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:29,030
they remain trapped and the same for
here.

6962
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:29,040

 

6963
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:33,270

So for example um this ICT concept which

6964
02:42:33,270 --> 02:42:33,280
So for example um this ICT concept which
 

6965
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:35,429
So for example um this ICT concept which
is not his concept but this ICT concept

6966
02:42:35,429 --> 02:42:35,439
is not his concept but this ICT concept
 

6967
02:42:35,439 --> 02:42:37,429
is not his concept but this ICT concept
down to 53. You all went oh the

6968
02:42:37,429 --> 02:42:37,439
down to 53. You all went oh the
 

6969
02:42:37,439 --> 02:42:38,950
down to 53. You all went oh the
imbalance is down there. No it wasn't.

6970
02:42:38,950 --> 02:42:38,960
imbalance is down there. No it wasn't.
 

6971
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:40,630
imbalance is down there. No it wasn't.
If you remember I can specifically

6972
02:42:40,630 --> 02:42:40,640
If you remember I can specifically
 

6973
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:43,429
If you remember I can specifically
remember saying it's to 60. Well that's

6974
02:42:43,429 --> 02:42:43,439
remember saying it's to 60. Well that's
 

6975
02:42:43,439 --> 02:42:45,030
remember saying it's to 60. Well that's
the imbalance. There actually is not an

6976
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,040
the imbalance. There actually is not an
 

6977
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:46,710
the imbalance. There actually is not an
imbalance down here but you would all

6978
02:42:46,710 --> 02:42:46,720
imbalance down here but you would all
 

6979
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:48,550
imbalance down here but you would all
think there is one if you're not using

6980
02:42:48,550 --> 02:42:48,560
think there is one if you're not using
 

6981
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:52,469
think there is one if you're not using
orderflow. The imbalance was to 60s.

6982
02:42:52,469 --> 02:42:52,479
orderflow. The imbalance was to 60s.
 

6983
02:42:52,479 --> 02:42:58,309
orderflow. The imbalance was to 60s.
So that's the advantage. It's accuracy.

6984
02:42:58,309 --> 02:42:58,319

 

6985
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:02,550

Looks fantastic. We talked about this

7242
02:49:05,349 --> 02:49:05,359
Looks fantastic. We talked about this
 

7243
02:49:05,359 --> 02:49:07,110
Looks fantastic. We talked about this
last week.

7244
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:07,120
last week.
 

7245
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:10,469
last week.
If we base out, we have the ability to

7246
02:49:10,469 --> 02:49:10,479
If we base out, we have the ability to
 

7247
02:49:10,479 --> 02:49:12,950
If we base out, we have the ability to
go. Look at that. All right. So, those I

7248
02:49:12,950 --> 02:49:12,960
go. Look at that. All right. So, those I
 

7249
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:14,230
go. Look at that. All right. So, those I
don't know if it was you asking last

7250
02:49:14,230 --> 02:49:14,240
don't know if it was you asking last
 

7251
02:49:14,240 --> 02:49:16,630
don't know if it was you asking last
week, but we talked about all the time.

7252
02:49:16,630 --> 02:49:16,640
week, but we talked about all the time.

7263
02:49:29,439 --> 02:49:31,110
trade to silver, and we're just going to
keep expanding. And now you can do

7264
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:31,120
keep expanding. And now you can do
 

7265
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:33,990
keep expanding. And now you can do
projections based on this last pullback.

7266
02:49:33,990 --> 02:49:34,000
projections based on this last pullback.
 

7267
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:37,190
projections based on this last pullback.
All right, so you can look at

7268
02:49:37,190 --> 02:49:37,200
All right, so you can look at
 

7269
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:42,150
All right, so you can look at
7 700s, 750s, and then really 5,000s.

7279
02:49:51,439 --> 02:49:55,269
happening all the time. time you're
having these pressures in uh Japan,

7280
02:49:55,269 --> 02:49:55,279
having these pressures in uh Japan,
 

7281
02:49:55,279 --> 02:49:57,190
having these pressures in uh Japan,
you're going to see, you know, they

7282
02:49:57,190 --> 02:49:57,200
you're going to see, you know, they
 

7283
02:49:57,200 --> 02:49:59,030
you're going to see, you know, they
might be positioning gold before they're

7284
02:49:59,030 --> 02:49:59,040
might be positioning gold before they're
 

7285
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:02,070
might be positioning gold before they're
positioning or or or

7286

positioning or or or
 

7287
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:04,389
positioning or or or
removing their positions, I should say,

7288
02:50:04,389 --> 02:50:04,399
removing their positions, I should say,
 

7289
02:50:04,399 --> 02:50:06,150
removing their positions, I should say,
from the US markets, but we'll see. We

7290
02:50:06,150 --> 02:50:06,160
from the US markets, but we'll see. We
 

7291
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:13,670
from the US markets, but we'll see. We
we'll have to deal with that in January.

7293
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:15,349

Is the volume profile indicator you're

7294
02:50:15,349 --> 02:50:15,359
Is the volume profile indicator you're
 

7295
02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:17,750
Is the volume profile indicator you're
using native to TV1? Yeah. Yeah. This is

7296
02:50:17,750 --> 02:50:17,760
using native to TV1? Yeah. Yeah. This is

are all native, guys. The the only thing
not native uh is uh the VWAP and uh the

Yeah,
 

7321
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:05,349
Yeah,
that's it. That's it. I'm still a

02:51:05,349 --> 02:51:05,359
that's it. That's it. I'm still a
 

7323
02:51:05,359 --> 02:51:06,630
that's it. That's it. I'm still a
student of the market. Markets are

7324
02:51:06,630 --> 02:51:06,640
student of the market. Markets are
 

7325
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:08,309
student of the market. Markets are
forever trading uh changing as well. We

7326
02:51:08,309 --> 02:51:08,319
forever trading uh changing as well. We
 

7327
02:51:08,319 --> 02:51:10,870
forever trading uh changing as well. We
need to be adaptive.

7328
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:10,880
need to be adaptive.
 

7329
02:51:10,880 --> 02:51:12,389
need to be adaptive.
How often do I follow the indicators

7330
02:51:12,389 --> 02:51:12,399
How often do I follow the indicators
 

7331
02:51:12,399 --> 02:51:16,070
How often do I follow the indicators
that pop up? That pop up. You mean this?

7332
02:51:16,070 --> 02:51:16,080
that pop up? That pop up. You mean this?
 

7333
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:17,510
that pop up? That pop up. You mean this?
I mean, this was a good buy signal,

7334
02:51:17,510 --> 02:51:17,520
I mean, this was a good buy signal,
 

7335
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:18,870
I mean, this was a good buy signal,
right? We bought in here at the same

7336
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:18,880
right? We bought in here at the same
 

7337
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:22,150
right? We bought in here at the same
time, right? But the best time to trade

7338
02:51:22,150 --> 02:51:22,160
time, right? But the best time to trade
 

7339
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:24,150
time, right? But the best time to trade
flow zones are really when we're in a

7340
02:51:24,150 --> 02:51:24,160
flow zones are really when we're in a
 

7341
02:51:24,160 --> 02:51:25,590
flow zones are really when we're in a
trend day. So, a trend day would be

7342
02:51:25,590 --> 02:51:25,600
trend day. So, a trend day would be
 

7343
02:51:25,600 --> 02:51:27,269
trend day. So, a trend day would be
outside of initial balance technically

7344
02:51:27,269 --> 02:51:27,279
outside of initial balance technically
 

7345
02:51:27,279 --> 02:51:29,269
outside of initial balance technically
where we have strong trend developing

7346
02:51:29,269 --> 02:51:29,279
where we have strong trend developing
 

7347
02:51:29,279 --> 02:51:31,349
where we have strong trend developing
outside of liquidity being built. Those

7348
02:51:31,349 --> 02:51:31,359
outside of liquidity being built. Those
 

7349
02:51:31,359 --> 02:51:33,110
outside of liquidity being built. Those
are the best times to use it. So when we

7350
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:33,120
are the best times to use it. So when we
 

7351
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:37,349
are the best times to use it. So when we
go into trend days, you know, let's say

7352
02:51:37,349 --> 02:51:37,359
go into trend days, you know, let's say
 

7353
02:51:37,359 --> 02:51:39,750
go into trend days, you know, let's say
today for example was above the IB.

7354
02:51:39,750 --> 02:51:39,760
today for example was above the IB.
 

7355
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:41,590
today for example was above the IB.
Let's pretend we didn't have supply up

7356
02:51:41,590 --> 02:51:41,600
Let's pretend we didn't have supply up
 

7357
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:43,910
Let's pretend we didn't have supply up
here and we built lots of volume out and

7358
02:51:43,910 --> 02:51:43,920
here and we built lots of volume out and
 

7359
02:51:43,920 --> 02:51:46,309
here and we built lots of volume out and
the profile, you know, maybe looked

7360
02:51:46,309 --> 02:51:46,319
the profile, you know, maybe looked
 

7361
02:51:46,319 --> 02:51:49,510
the profile, you know, maybe looked
something a bit more like this and this

7362
02:51:49,510 --> 02:51:49,520
something a bit more like this and this
 

7363
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:51,590
something a bit more like this and this
and this. This is like a typical trend

7364
02:51:51,590 --> 02:51:51,600
and this. This is like a typical trend
 

7365
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:53,590
and this. This is like a typical trend
day profile. And this and every dip's

7366
02:51:53,590 --> 02:51:53,600
day profile. And this and every dip's
 

7367
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:55,590
day profile. And this and every dip's
getting bought. Then we'd use flow zones

7368
02:51:55,590 --> 02:51:55,600
getting bought. Then we'd use flow zones
 

7369
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:58,389
getting bought. Then we'd use flow zones
for dips, right? It just shows you good

7370
02:51:58,389 --> 02:51:58,399
for dips, right? It just shows you good
 

7371
02:51:58,399 --> 02:51:59,910
for dips, right? It just shows you good
good areas that you might be interested

7372
02:51:59,910 --> 02:51:59,920
good areas that you might be interested
 

7373
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:02,230
good areas that you might be interested
in buying off. Yeah, we're going to do

7374
02:52:02,230 --> 02:52:02,240
in buying off. Yeah, we're going to do
 

7375
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,590
in buying off. Yeah, we're going to do
give. Yeah, we do giveaways. I didn't

7376
02:52:03,590 --> 02:52:03,600
give. Yeah, we do giveaways. I didn't
 

7377
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:07,110
give. Yeah, we do giveaways. I didn't
realize 9:00 already.

7378
02:52:07,110 --> 02:52:07,120
realize 9:00 already.
 

7379
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:09,110
realize 9:00 already.

7425
02:52:54,160 --> 02:52:55,349
right now with a killer hangover and
can't be [\h__\h] to turn up at their

7426
02:52:55,349 --> 02:52:55,359
can't be [\h__\h] to turn up at their
 

7427
02:52:55,359 --> 02:52:57,429
can't be [\h__\h] to turn up at their

trading desk, as in at the banks and
 

7429
02:52:57,439 --> 02:52:59,269
trading desk, as in at the banks and
stuff. So you're going to see lower

7430
02:52:59,269 --> 02:52:59,279
stuff. So you're going to see lower
 

7431
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:00,870
stuff. So you're going to see lower
liquidity. You're not going to see lots

7432
02:53:00,870 --> 02:53:00,880
liquidity. You're not going to see lots
 

7433
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:02,710
liquidity. You're not going to see lots
of liquidity probably return until

7434
02:53:02,710 --> 02:53:02,720
of liquidity probably return until
 

7435
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:04,150
of liquidity probably return until
January. All right. The volume's going

7436
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:04,160
January. All right. The volume's going
 

7437
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:06,070
January. All right. The volume's going
to be down. So that's why [snorts] the

7438
02:53:06,070 --> 02:53:06,080
to be down. So that's why [snorts] the
 

7439
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:08,469
to be down. So that's why [snorts] the
market's gone to sleep.

7440
02:53:08,469 --> 02:53:08,479
market's gone to sleep.
 

7441
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:10,389

7551
02:55:49,279 --> 02:55:54,550
on trade of eight, so I I'm not sure.
So, I've never really used it.

7552
02:55:54,550 --> 02:55:54,560

7565
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:23,030

I saw an OG trader 30 years saying that

7566
02:56:23,030 --> 02:56:23,040
I saw an OG trader 30 years saying that
 

7567
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:25,190
I saw an OG trader 30 years saying that
futures isn't the same anymore. Gamma

7568
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:25,200
futures isn't the same anymore. Gamma
 

7569
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:28,070
futures isn't the same anymore. Gamma
OT. Yeah, I I saw that video and I saw

7570
02:56:28,070 --> 02:56:28,080
OT. Yeah, I I saw that video and I saw
 

7571
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:29,670
OT. Yeah, I I saw that video and I saw
people saying like, "Oh, he needs to get

7572
02:56:29,670 --> 02:56:29,680
people saying like, "Oh, he needs to get
 

7573
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:33,830
people saying like, "Oh, he needs to get
over it." Um he he is he is right. He is

7574
02:56:33,830 --> 02:56:33,840
over it." Um he he is he is right. He is
 

7575
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:35,670
over it." Um he he is he is right. He is
right and I've maintained that and

7576
02:56:35,670 --> 02:56:35,680
right and I've maintained that and
 

7577
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:37,910
right and I've maintained that and
that's why I've like started paying more

7578
02:56:37,910 --> 02:56:37,920
that's why I've like started paying more
 

7579
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:40,630
that's why I've like started paying more
attention to it. You have to understand

7580
02:56:40,630 --> 02:56:40,640
attention to it. You have to understand
 

7581
02:56:40,640 --> 02:56:46,309
attention to it. You have to understand
right zero DTE changed everything in the

7582
02:56:46,309 --> 02:56:46,319
right zero DTE changed everything in the
 

7583
02:56:46,319 --> 02:56:49,030
right zero DTE changed everything in the
markets. You have to understand that uh

7584
02:56:49,030 --> 02:56:49,040
markets. You have to understand that uh
 

7585
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:50,870
markets. You have to understand that uh
because until when did they come in like

7586
02:56:50,870 --> 02:56:50,880
because until when did they come in like
 

7587
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:53,510
because until when did they come in like
three years ago. The extra liquidity

7588
02:56:53,510 --> 02:56:53,520
three years ago. The extra liquidity
 

7589
02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:55,910
three years ago. The extra liquidity
created by those is massive. It is like

7590
02:56:55,910 --> 02:56:55,920
created by those is massive. It is like
 

7591
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:58,230
created by those is massive. It is like
a gambler's addiction and they can move

7592
02:56:58,230 --> 02:56:58,240
a gambler's addiction and they can move
 

7593
02:56:58,240 --> 02:57:01,269
a gambler's addiction and they can move
the markets fast. Right. So, he is right

7594
02:57:01,269 --> 02:57:01,279
the markets fast. Right. So, he is right
 

7595
02:57:01,279 --> 02:57:02,950
the markets fast. Right. So, he is right
to an extent. It doesn't mean there's no

7596
02:57:02,950 --> 02:57:02,960
to an extent. It doesn't mean there's no
 

7597
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:05,590
to an extent. It doesn't mean there's no
edge. Um,

7598
02:57:05,590 --> 02:57:05,600
edge. Um,
 

7599
02:57:05,600 --> 02:57:07,990
edge. Um,
do futures have the most edge? No. I'm

7600
02:57:07,990 --> 02:57:08,000
do futures have the most edge? No. I'm
 

7601
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:09,429
do futures have the most edge? No. I'm
going to be honest with you. The futures

7602
02:57:09,429 --> 02:57:09,439
going to be honest with you. The futures
 

7603
02:57:09,439 --> 02:57:12,309
going to be honest with you. The futures
market does not have the most edge. Uh,

7604
02:57:12,309 --> 02:57:12,319
market does not have the most edge. Uh,
 

7605
02:57:12,319 --> 02:57:14,469
market does not have the most edge. Uh,
the biggest edge probably comes in small

7606
02:57:14,469 --> 02:57:14,479
the biggest edge probably comes in small
 

7607
02:57:14,479 --> 02:57:17,110
the biggest edge probably comes in small
caps if I'm honest. Um, that's where

7608
02:57:17,110 --> 02:57:17,120
caps if I'm honest. Um, that's where
 

7609
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:18,710
caps if I'm honest. Um, that's where
most edge is in the market because

7610
02:57:18,710 --> 02:57:18,720
most edge is in the market because
 

7611
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:21,590
most edge is in the market because
really your edge is created where

7612
02:57:21,590 --> 02:57:21,600
really your edge is created where
 

7613
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:24,309
really your edge is created where
opportunity is. And opportunity comes

7614
02:57:24,309 --> 02:57:24,319
opportunity is. And opportunity comes
 

7615
02:57:24,319 --> 02:57:26,070
opportunity is. And opportunity comes
where people get offside. Now, you can

7616
02:57:26,070 --> 02:57:26,080
where people get offside. Now, you can
 

7617
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:27,510
where people get offside. Now, you can
see that's how we trade in this market

7618
02:57:27,510 --> 02:57:27,520
see that's how we trade in this market
 

7619
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:28,309
see that's how we trade in this market
every day. Okay, we're looking for

7620
02:57:28,309 --> 02:57:28,319
every day. Okay, we're looking for
 

7621
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:30,550
every day. Okay, we're looking for
offside traders. The biggest offside

7622
02:57:30,550 --> 02:57:30,560
offside traders. The biggest offside
 

7623
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:32,309
offside traders. The biggest offside
traders will come in small caps because

7624
02:57:32,309 --> 02:57:32,319
traders will come in small caps because
 

7625
02:57:32,319 --> 02:57:34,630
traders will come in small caps because
they are the most manipulated market

7626
02:57:34,630 --> 02:57:34,640
they are the most manipulated market
 

7627
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:36,309
they are the most manipulated market
going, right? You're talking about [\h__\h]

7628
02:57:36,309 --> 02:57:36,319
going, right? You're talking about [\h__\h]
 

7629
02:57:36,319 --> 02:57:40,230
going, right? You're talking about [\h__\h]
stocks with [\h__\h] all PE with no cash on

7630
02:57:40,230 --> 02:57:40,240
stocks with [\h__\h] all PE with no cash on
 

7631
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:41,910
stocks with [\h__\h] all PE with no cash on
hand that need to like constantly cycle

7632
02:57:41,910 --> 02:57:41,920
hand that need to like constantly cycle
 

7633
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:45,349
hand that need to like constantly cycle
money to pay themselves. That's the the

7634
02:57:45,349 --> 02:57:45,359
money to pay themselves. That's the the
 

7635
02:57:45,359 --> 02:57:47,990
money to pay themselves. That's the the
best edge will be there. And a lot of

7636
02:57:47,990 --> 02:57:48,000
best edge will be there. And a lot of
 

7637
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,070
best edge will be there. And a lot of
those small caps won't have zero DTE

7638
02:57:50,070 --> 02:57:50,080
those small caps won't have zero DTE
 

7639
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:51,990
those small caps won't have zero DTE
either. So, you've got like a guy on the

7640
02:57:51,990 --> 02:57:52,000
either. So, you've got like a guy on the
 

7641
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,389
either. So, you've got like a guy on the
book pumping pumping pumping and pumping

7642
02:57:54,389 --> 02:57:54,399
book pumping pumping pumping and pumping
 

7643
02:57:54,399 --> 02:57:56,070
book pumping pumping pumping and pumping
looking for his exit. That's that's

7644
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:56,080
looking for his exit. That's that's
 

7645
02:57:56,080 --> 02:57:58,150
looking for his exit. That's that's
probably like once you understand the

7646
02:57:58,150 --> 02:57:58,160
probably like once you understand the
 

7647
02:57:58,160 --> 02:57:59,830
probably like once you understand the
markets, it's probably one of the best

7648
02:57:59,830 --> 02:57:59,840
markets, it's probably one of the best
 

7649
02:57:59,840 --> 02:58:01,590
markets, it's probably one of the best
markets to trade, but they've been very

7650
02:58:01,590 --> 02:58:01,600
markets to trade, but they've been very
 

7651
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:04,710
markets to trade, but they've been very
sleepy for a few years. So, we'll see.

7652
02:58:04,710 --> 02:58:04,720
sleepy for a few years. So, we'll see.
 

7653
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:12,230
sleepy for a few years. So, we'll see.
Um,

7654
02:58:12,230 --> 02:58:12,240

we leave higher time f higher time frame

7664
02:58:22,150 --> 02:58:22,160
we leave higher time f higher time frame

volume trapped happens fairly regularly

7666
02:58:24,469 --> 02:58:24,479
volume trapped happens fairly regularly
 

7667
02:58:24,479 --> 02:58:26,550
volume trapped happens fairly regularly
especially in this market when we've

7668
02:58:26,550 --> 02:58:26,560
especially in this market when we've
 

7669
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:28,389
especially in this market when we've
developed a big range and we leave or

developed a big range and we leave or
where we've done an overextended one

7672
02:58:30,230 --> 02:58:30,240
where we've done an overextended one
 

7673
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:31,750
where we've done an overextended one
move one way or the other and then we

7674
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:31,760
move one way or the other and then we
 

7675
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:34,630
move one way or the other and then we
leave that volume that's my A+ uh we had

7676
02:58:34,630 --> 02:58:34,640
leave that volume that's my A+ uh we had
 

7677
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:37,269
leave that volume that's my A+ uh we had
a few we had one last week off the lows

7678
02:58:37,269 --> 02:58:37,279
a few we had one last week off the lows
 

7679
02:58:37,279 --> 02:58:39,429
a few we had one last week off the lows
we had two last week off the highs so we

7680
02:58:39,429 --> 02:58:39,439
we had two last week off the highs so we
 

7681
02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:41,269

7685
02:58:46,479 --> 02:58:48,070

you get volume profile on trade of eight

7686
02:58:48,070 --> 02:58:48,080

7690
02:58:53,349 --> 02:58:53,359
trades with limit prices or market? Uh
 

7691
02:58:53,359 --> 02:58:55,110
trades with limit prices or market? Uh
but I always try and get in on a limit

7692
02:58:55,110 --> 02:58:55,120
but I always try and get in on a limit

if possible. I want my price on a uh to

get in on a limit if I'm forced to chase
 

7697
02:58:59,760 --> 02:59:01,510
get in on a limit if I'm forced to chase
a little bit. And I don't mean like 40

7698
02:59:01,510 --> 02:59:01,520
a little bit. And I don't mean like 40
 

7699
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:03,510
a little bit. And I don't mean like 40
50 60 points after. But if I've got a

7700
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:03,520
50 60 points after. But if I've got a
 

7701
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:05,910
50 60 points after. But if I've got a
limit dangling and I can't get filled, I

7702
02:59:05,910 --> 02:59:05,920
limit dangling and I can't get filled, I
 

7703
02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:07,750
limit dangling and I can't get filled, I
will take a market break if I have to.

7711
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:14,950

02:59:14,950 --> 02:59:14,960
not be in. But I'll obviously have to
 

7713
02:59:14,960 --> 02:59:16,950
not be in. But I'll obviously have to
size down a bit if I'm forfeiting

7714
02:59:16,950 --> 02:59:16,960
size down a bit if I'm forfeiting

03:02:05,510 --> 03:02:05,520
see you can see this node we're
 

7843
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:07,349
see you can see this node we're
developing guys. We're we're inside

7844
03:02:07,349 --> 03:02:07,359
developing guys. We're we're inside
 

7845
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:10,550
developing guys. We're we're inside
this. Okay. And this has become your

7846
03:02:10,550 --> 03:02:10,560
this. Okay. And this has become your
 

7847
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:13,349
this. Okay. And this has become your
shelf and here

7848
03:02:13,349 --> 03:02:13,359
shelf and here
 

7849
03:02:13,359 --> 03:02:14,710
shelf and here
and it's starting to get a little bit

7850
03:02:14,710 --> 03:02:14,720
and it's starting to get a little bit
 

7851
03:02:14,720 --> 03:02:16,550
and it's starting to get a little bit
messy in here. Right. This is why I've

7852
03:02:16,550 --> 03:02:16,560
messy in here. Right. This is why I've
 

7853
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:18,309
messy in here. Right. This is why I've
like become less interested. I think we

7854
03:02:18,309 --> 03:02:18,319
like become less interested. I think we
 

7855
03:02:18,319 --> 03:02:19,750
like become less interested. I think we
got probably the best trades. You could

7856
03:02:19,750 --> 03:02:19,760
got probably the best trades. You could
 

7857
03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:21,510
got probably the best trades. You could
have argued if we drove out higher I

7858
03:02:21,510 --> 03:02:21,520
have argued if we drove out higher I
 

7859
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:22,550
have argued if we drove out higher I
would have been willing to play that

7860
03:02:22,550 --> 03:02:22,560
would have been willing to play that
 

7861
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:24,230
would have been willing to play that
down this morning like we talked about

7862
03:02:24,230 --> 03:02:24,240
down this morning like we talked about
 

7863
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:27,590
down this morning like we talked about
in Discord.

7864
03:02:27,590 --> 03:02:27,600

 

7865
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:30,309

Um no trades. Lots of you saying no

7866
03:02:30,309 --> 03:02:30,319
Um no trades. Lots of you saying no
 

7867
03:02:30,319 --> 03:02:36,309
Um no trades. Lots of you saying no
trades. Say that's right.

7868
03:02:36,309 --> 03:02:36,319

 

7869
03:02:36,319 --> 03:02:39,269

was in the long trade on ES at 10:38. Is

7870
03:02:39,269 --> 03:02:39,279
was in the long trade on ES at 10:38. Is
 

7871
03:02:39,279 --> 03:02:41,750
was in the long trade on ES at 10:38. Is
that an A+? Let me have a look. Probably

7872
03:02:41,750 --> 03:02:41,760
that an A+? Let me have a look. Probably
 

7873
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:43,670
that an A+? Let me have a look. Probably
not an A+, but it's probably a good

7874
03:02:43,670 --> 03:02:43,680
not an A+, but it's probably a good
 

7875
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:46,870
not an A+, but it's probably a good
intraday trade. 10:38.

7876
03:02:46,870 --> 03:02:46,880
intraday trade. 10:38.
 

7877
03:02:46,880 --> 03:02:49,429
intraday trade. 10:38.
I would say that's an A trade for me.

7878
03:02:49,429 --> 03:02:49,439
I would say that's an A trade for me.
 

7879
03:02:49,439 --> 03:02:51,269
I would say that's an A trade for me.
Yeah. So, you have the look below. It's

7880
03:02:51,269 --> 03:02:51,279
Yeah. So, you have the look below. It's
 

7881
03:02:51,279 --> 03:02:53,830
Yeah. So, you have the look below. It's
really nice. It's very similar to this.

7882
03:02:53,830 --> 03:02:53,840
really nice. It's very similar to this.
 

7883
03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:57,190
really nice. It's very similar to this.
Um,

7884
03:02:57,190 --> 03:02:57,200

 

7885
03:02:57,200 --> 03:02:59,429

the only thing I'd say is we didn't The

7886
03:02:59,429 --> 03:02:59,439
the only thing I'd say is we didn't The
 

7887
03:02:59,439 --> 03:03:01,190
the only thing I'd say is we didn't The
difference is right, ES didn't sweep all

7888
03:03:01,190 --> 03:03:01,200
difference is right, ES didn't sweep all
 

7889
03:03:01,200 --> 03:03:04,070
difference is right, ES didn't sweep all
of this. Remember on ENQ we swept all of

7890
03:03:04,070 --> 03:03:04,080
of this. Remember on ENQ we swept all of
 

7891
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:06,950
of this. Remember on ENQ we swept all of
this.

7892
03:03:06,950 --> 03:03:06,960
this.
 

7893
03:03:06,960 --> 03:03:09,910
this.
So, oh, the S the SMT just the

7894
03:03:09,910 --> 03:03:09,920
So, oh, the S the SMT just the
 

7895
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:13,429
So, oh, the S the SMT just the
divergence was that NQ swept this. All

7896
03:03:13,429 --> 03:03:13,439
divergence was that NQ swept this. All
 

7897
03:03:13,439 --> 03:03:15,510
divergence was that NQ swept this. All
right. So, you had three drive attempts

7898
03:03:15,510 --> 03:03:15,520
right. So, you had three drive attempts
 

7899
03:03:15,520 --> 03:03:17,030
right. So, you had three drive attempts
lower on ES. Let's think about what

7900
03:03:17,030 --> 03:03:17,040
lower on ES. Let's think about what
 

7901
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:19,670
lower on ES. Let's think about what
you've done on ES. Three attempts lower.

7902
03:03:19,670 --> 03:03:19,680
you've done on ES. Three attempts lower.
 

7903
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:22,469
you've done on ES. Three attempts lower.
One, two, three. All right. We pin.

7904
03:03:22,469 --> 03:03:22,479
One, two, three. All right. We pin.
 

7905
03:03:22,479 --> 03:03:25,190
One, two, three. All right. We pin.
There's your initial balance. Okay. And

7906
03:03:25,190 --> 03:03:25,200
There's your initial balance. Okay. And
 

7907
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:27,830
There's your initial balance. Okay. And
we cannot

7908
03:03:27,830 --> 03:03:27,840
we cannot
 

7909
03:03:27,840 --> 03:03:29,670
we cannot
sustain the auction lower. So what are

7910
03:03:29,670 --> 03:03:29,680
sustain the auction lower. So what are
 

7911
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:32,070
sustain the auction lower. So what are
we looking? Market's looking for value.

7912
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:32,080
we looking? Market's looking for value.
 

7913
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:34,070
we looking? Market's looking for value.
So it thinks we're too expensive. So it

7914
03:03:34,070 --> 03:03:34,080
So it thinks we're too expensive. So it
 

7915
03:03:34,080 --> 03:03:36,550
So it thinks we're too expensive. So it
comes down. It's like, well, is this too

7916
03:03:36,550 --> 03:03:36,560
comes down. It's like, well, is this too
 

7917
03:03:36,560 --> 03:03:38,790
comes down. It's like, well, is this too
cheap? The answer is yes. You trade up,

7918
03:03:38,790 --> 03:03:38,800
cheap? The answer is yes. You trade up,
 

7919
03:03:38,800 --> 03:03:40,469
cheap? The answer is yes. You trade up,
you reclaim, and you go back to the

7920
03:03:40,469 --> 03:03:40,479
you reclaim, and you go back to the
 

7921
03:03:40,479 --> 03:03:42,230
you reclaim, and you go back to the
upside. And then you've got lots of

7922
03:03:42,230 --> 03:03:42,240
upside. And then you've got lots of
 

7923
03:03:42,240 --> 03:03:43,510
upside. And then you've got lots of
people to aim for, haven't you? This is

7924
03:03:43,510 --> 03:03:43,520
people to aim for, haven't you? This is
 

7925
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:44,710
people to aim for, haven't you? This is
your gamma level. And once you get

7926
03:03:44,710 --> 03:03:44,720
your gamma level. And once you get
 

7927
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:46,150
your gamma level. And once you get
through that here, and this was the

7928
03:03:46,150 --> 03:03:46,160
through that here, and this was the
 

7929
03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:47,750
through that here, and this was the
lowhanging fruit previous week high,

7930
03:03:47,750 --> 03:03:47,760
lowhanging fruit previous week high,
 

7931
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:49,190
lowhanging fruit previous week high,
which we're now at. All right. So the

7932
03:03:49,190 --> 03:03:49,200
which we're now at. All right. So the
 

7933
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:50,630
which we're now at. All right. So the
the trade's gone. This is why I saying

7934
03:03:50,630 --> 03:03:50,640
the trade's gone. This is why I saying
 

7935
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:53,269
the trade's gone. This is why I saying
the lowh hanging fruit trade was from

7936
03:03:53,269 --> 03:03:53,279
the lowh hanging fruit trade was from
 

7937
03:03:53,279 --> 03:03:56,630
the lowh hanging fruit trade was from
here to here and here. This is the move,

7938
03:03:56,630 --> 03:03:56,640
here to here and here. This is the move,
 

7939
03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:58,150
here to here and here. This is the move,
right? That's the move. It's been and

7940
03:03:58,150 --> 03:03:58,160
right? That's the move. It's been and
 

7941
03:03:58,160 --> 03:03:59,990
right? That's the move. It's been and
gone. Can it go higher? Yeah. Can it

7942
03:03:59,990 --> 03:04:00,000
gone. Can it go higher? Yeah. Can it
 

7943
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,630
gone. Can it go higher? Yeah. Can it
come back down? Yeah. But the a the a

7944
03:04:02,630 --> 03:04:02,640
come back down? Yeah. But the a the a
 

7945
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:04,469
come back down? Yeah. But the a the a
trade is there. So, it's a great trade.

7946
03:04:04,469 --> 03:04:04,479
trade is there. So, it's a great trade.
 

7947
03:04:04,479 --> 03:04:07,190
trade is there. So, it's a great trade.
38s.

7948
03:04:07,190 --> 03:04:07,200
38s.
 

7949
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:09,349
38s.
Um I mean, we can even have a look to

7950
03:04:09,349 --> 03:04:09,359
Um I mean, we can even have a look to
 

7951
03:04:09,359 --> 03:04:12,950
Um I mean, we can even have a look to
see

7952
03:04:12,950 --> 03:04:12,960

 

7953
03:04:12,960 --> 03:04:22,070

what happened at the lows.

7954
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:22,080

 

7955
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:25,349

load my template. No,

7956
03:04:25,349 --> 03:04:25,359
load my template. No,
 

7957
03:04:25,359 --> 03:04:26,630
load my template. No,
you're not going to give me a template

7958
03:04:26,630 --> 03:04:26,640
you're not going to give me a template
 

7959
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:28,309
you're not going to give me a template
here.

7960
03:04:28,309 --> 03:04:28,319
here.
 

7961
03:04:28,319 --> 03:04:44,710
here.
You're not fantastic.

7962
03:04:44,710 --> 03:04:44,720

 

7963
03:04:44,720 --> 03:04:47,190

All

7964
03:04:47,190 --> 03:04:47,200

 

7965
03:04:47,200 --> 03:04:49,990

right. And look at the low at that low

7966
03:04:49,990 --> 03:04:50,000
right. And look at the low at that low
 

7967
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:51,429
right. And look at the low at that low
that we just talked about. Right at the

7968
03:04:51,429 --> 03:04:51,439
that we just talked about. Right at the
 

7969
03:04:51,439 --> 03:04:54,870
that we just talked about. Right at the
low, you had 179 sellers caught offside.

7970
03:04:54,870 --> 03:04:54,880
low, you had 179 sellers caught offside.
 

7971
03:04:54,880 --> 03:04:57,910
low, you had 179 sellers caught offside.
Right. So that was your clue that you

7972
03:04:57,910 --> 03:04:57,920
Right. So that was your clue that you
 

7973
03:04:57,920 --> 03:04:59,349
Right. So that was your clue that you
trapped the sellers there and then even

7974
03:04:59,349 --> 03:04:59,359
trapped the sellers there and then even
 

7975
03:04:59,359 --> 03:05:01,990
trapped the sellers there and then even
the candle before. So where was sellers

7976
03:05:01,990 --> 03:05:02,000
the candle before. So where was sellers
 

7977
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:03,429
the candle before. So where was sellers
coming in late like we talked about

7978
03:05:03,429 --> 03:05:03,439
coming in late like we talked about
 

7979
03:05:03,439 --> 03:05:05,190
coming in late like we talked about
underneath initial balance. All right.

7980
03:05:05,190 --> 03:05:05,200
underneath initial balance. All right.
 

7981
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:07,030
underneath initial balance. All right.
So that's the look below initial balance

7982
03:05:07,030 --> 03:05:07,040
So that's the look below initial balance
 

7983
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:08,870
So that's the look below initial balance
and fail. It's a fantastic trade.

7984
03:05:08,870 --> 03:05:08,880
and fail. It's a fantastic trade.
 

7985
03:05:08,880 --> 03:05:11,510
and fail. It's a fantastic trade.
Whoever just asked was that A+. I

7986
03:05:11,510 --> 03:05:11,520
Whoever just asked was that A+. I
 

7987
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:12,870
Whoever just asked was that A+. I
wouldn't necessarily say it's A+, but

7988
03:05:12,870 --> 03:05:12,880
wouldn't necessarily say it's A+, but
 

7989
03:05:12,880 --> 03:05:16,630
wouldn't necessarily say it's A+, but
it's an it's a a an Agrade setup. A+ on

7990
03:05:16,630 --> 03:05:16,640
it's an it's a a an Agrade setup. A+ on
 

7991
03:05:16,640 --> 03:05:18,710
it's an it's a a an Agrade setup. A+ on
the day, but we're not leaving higher

7992
03:05:18,710 --> 03:05:18,720
the day, but we're not leaving higher
 

7993
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:21,363
the day, but we're not leaving higher
time frame, but it's a great setup.

7994
03:05:21,363 --> 03:05:21,373
time frame, but it's a great setup.
 

7995
03:05:21,373 --> 03:05:28,389
time frame, but it's a great setup.

So you need to be careful. Sometimes the
data can go a bit funny. So it's it's

8044
03:06:25,510 --> 03:06:25,520
data can go a bit funny. So it's it's
 

8045
03:06:25,520 --> 03:06:27,429
data can go a bit funny. So it's it's
making sure you're managing those

even have it, but something that some

8812
03:26:30,389 --> 03:26:30,399
even have it, but something that some
 

8813
03:26:30,399 --> 03:26:31,670

people really like and some people
 

8815
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:33,750

8819
03:26:37,200 --> 03:26:39,110
characters. I've got no problem with his
teachings. My problem is when people

8820
03:26:39,110 --> 03:26:39,120
teachings. My problem is when people
 

8821
03:26:39,120 --> 03:26:41,510
teachings. My problem is when people
think they're his teachings. That's the

8822
03:26:41,510 --> 03:26:41,520
think they're his teachings. That's the
 

8823
03:26:41,520 --> 03:26:46,309
think they're his teachings. That's the
difference.

8824
03:26:46,309 --> 03:26:46,319

 

8825
03:26:46,319 --> 03:26:48,229

8829
03:26:49,359 --> 03:26:50,550
I've never had it happen to me because
I've never been in that position, but

8830
03:26:50,550 --> 03:26:50,560
I've never been in that position, but
 

8831
03:26:50,560 --> 03:26:52,389
I've never been in that position, but
I'm That's a shame. It's a shame they

8835
03:26:54,960 --> 03:26:56,790
don't autoquidate.
Um, it might be worth you can probably

03:26:56,790 --> 03:26:56,800
Um, it might be worth you can probably
 

8837
03:26:56,800 --> 03:26:59,830
Um, it might be worth you can probably
put something in uh like Ninja Trader or

8838
03:26:59,830 --> 03:26:59,840
put something in uh like Ninja Trader or
 

8839

8841
03:27:02,239 --> 03:27:04,630
uh a copier to auto liquidate you at
certain time to stop that ever

8842
03:27:04,630 --> 03:27:04,640
certain time to stop that ever
 

8843
03:27:04,640 --> 03:27:09,429
certain time to stop that ever
happening.

8844
03:27:09,429 --> 03:27:09,439

 

8845
03:27:09,439 --> 03:27:13,030

Marmite uh Marmite is like it's like a

8846
03:27:13,030 --> 03:27:13,040
Marmite uh Marmite is like it's like a

Marmite uh Marmite is like it's like a
salted spread that you put on toast and

8848
03:27:16,630 --> 03:27:16,640
salted spread that you put on toast and
 

8849
03:27:16,640 --> 03:27:18,710
salted spread that you put on toast and
some people love it and some people hate

some people love it and some people hate
 

8851
03:27:18,720 --> 03:27:21,190

03:28:41,990 --> 03:28:42,000
should all be eight bucks. But this what
 

8925
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:43,510
should all be eight bucks. But this what
I'm saying like you have to be careful

8926
03:28:43,510 --> 03:28:43,520
I'm saying like you have to be careful
 

8927
03:28:43,520 --> 03:28:45,510
I'm saying like you have to be careful
when you link them all together. Some of

8928
03:28:45,510 --> 03:28:45,520
when you link them all together. Some of
 

8929
03:28:45,520 --> 03:28:47,190
when you link them all together. Some of
them get a bit of a lag on it. Well, at

8930
03:28:47,190 --> 03:28:47,200
them get a bit of a lag on it. Well, at
 

8931
03:28:47,200 --> 03:28:48,790
them get a bit of a lag on it. Well, at
least that's what I experience fairly

8932
03:28:48,790 --> 03:28:48,800
least that's what I experience fairly
 

8933
03:28:48,800 --> 03:28:50,389
least that's what I experience fairly
commonly. And you got to be careful with

8934
03:28:50,389 --> 03:28:50,399
commonly. And you got to be careful with
 

8935
03:28:50,399 --> 03:28:52,550
commonly. And you got to be careful with
the APIs, right? Especially on trade of

8936
03:28:52,550 --> 03:28:52,560
the APIs, right? Especially on trade of
 

8937
03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:56,309
the APIs, right? Especially on trade of
eight. Once you move into uh linking

8938
03:28:56,309 --> 03:28:56,319
eight. Once you move into uh linking
 

8939
03:28:56,319 --> 03:28:57,830
eight. Once you move into uh linking
accounts together, you can get some

8940
03:28:57,830 --> 03:28:57,840
accounts together, you can get some
 

8941
03:28:57,840 --> 03:29:04,630
accounts together, you can get some
issues.

8942
03:29:04,630 --> 03:29:04,640

 

8943
03:29:04,640 --> 03:29:05,910

this volume here. So, we could come
 

8993
03:30:04,720 --> 03:30:06,790
this volume here. So, we could come
right down into here if we if if they

8994

built all these buyers can potentially
 

8999
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:14,150
built all these buyers can potentially
get trapped there. If they reject this,

9000
03:30:14,150 --> 03:30:14,160
get trapped there. If they reject this,
 

9001
03:30:14,160 --> 03:30:15,510
get trapped there. If they reject this,
we can come all the way back down to

we can come all the way back down to
 

9003
03:30:15,520 --> 03:30:18,070

03:31:52,229 --> 03:31:52,239
them SFC and I've stopped using them
 

9079
03:31:52,239 --> 03:31:54,550
them SFC and I've stopped using them

9082
03:31:57,110 --> 03:31:57,120
subscription model. And I also think
 

9083
03:31:57,120 --> 03:32:03,670
subscription model. And I also think
genuinely think that AI um AI affordable

9085
03:32:03,680 --> 03:32:06,710

god affordable indicators is a superior

9086
03:32:06,710 --> 03:32:06,720

the max profit I want on this account.

9094
03:32:13,990 --> 03:32:14,000
the max profit I want on this account.
 

9095
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:15,670
the max profit I want on this account.
This is the max draw down I want on this

9096
03:32:15,670 --> 03:32:15,680
This is the max draw down I want on this
 

9097
03:32:15,680 --> 03:32:17,510
This is the max draw down I want on this
account. This is the max size I want to

9098
03:32:17,510 --> 03:32:17,520
account. This is the max size I want to
 

9099
03:32:17,520 --> 03:32:19,670
account. This is the max size I want to
use. I want to trade mini mini and micro

9100
03:32:19,670 --> 03:32:19,680
use. I want to trade mini mini and micro
 

9101
03:32:19,680 --> 03:32:21,830
use. I want to trade mini mini and micro
micro on that. Like the the amount that

9102
03:32:21,830 --> 03:32:21,840
micro on that. Like the the amount that
 

9103
03:32:21,840 --> 03:32:23,670
micro on that. Like the the amount that
you can do on it is so good. So if

9104
03:32:23,670 --> 03:32:23,680
you can do on it is so good. So if
 

9105
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:25,110
you can do on it is so good. So if
you're trading lots of prop firms, it's

9106
03:32:25,110 --> 03:32:25,120
you're trading lots of prop firms, it's
 

9107
03:32:25,120 --> 03:32:26,389
you're trading lots of prop firms, it's
really good. Like if you have a trading

9108
03:32:26,389 --> 03:32:26,399
really good. Like if you have a trading
 

9109
03:32:26,399 --> 03:32:29,349
really good. Like if you have a trading
draw down one, like I could get long.

9110
03:32:29,349 --> 03:32:29,359
draw down one, like I could get long.
 

9111
03:32:29,359 --> 03:32:33,110
draw down one, like I could get long.
Let's say I have like TPT,

what's the other one? Tradeify all

9116
03:32:39,750 --> 03:32:39,760
what's the other one? Tradeify all
 

9117
03:32:39,760 --> 03:32:42,150
what's the other one? Tradeify all
linked. I could have it so it takes my

9118
03:32:42,150 --> 03:32:42,160
linked. I could have it so it takes my
 

9119
03:32:42,160 --> 03:32:44,389
linked. I could have it so it takes my
Apex as soon as they hit $300, for

9120
03:32:44,389 --> 03:32:44,399
Apex as soon as they hit $300, for
 

9121
03:32:44,399 --> 03:32:45,590
Apex as soon as they hit $300, for
example, because they've got a trailing

9122
03:32:45,590 --> 03:32:45,600
example, because they've got a trailing
 

9123
03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:46,950
example, because they've got a trailing
draw down. So, I just want to lock in

9124
03:32:46,950 --> 03:32:46,960
draw down. So, I just want to lock in
 

9125
03:32:46,960 --> 03:32:48,870
draw down. So, I just want to lock in
and let the other ones work. So, that's

9126
03:32:48,870 --> 03:32:48,880
and let the other ones work. So, that's
 

9127
03:32:48,880 --> 03:32:58,389
and let the other ones work. So, that's
why I really like it.

9295
03:36:14,080 --> 03:36:17,030
at that. You're looking for T. No,
you're just playing the trips. So is the

9296
03:36:17,030 --> 03:36:17,040
you're just playing the trips. So is the
 

9297
03:36:17,040 --> 03:36:18,309
you're just playing the trips. So is the
you're you're just playing a triple

9298
03:36:18,309 --> 03:36:18,319
you're you're just playing a triple
 

9299
03:36:18,319 --> 03:36:20,870
you're you're just playing a triple
leverage. TQQQ

leverage. TQQQ
 

9301
03:36:20,880 --> 03:36:23,110
leverage. TQQQ
is exactly the same. You're just triple

9302
03:36:23,110 --> 03:36:23,120
is exactly the same. You're just triple
 

9303
03:36:23,120 --> 03:36:26,630
is exactly the same. You're just triple
leveraged versus QQQ, right? So you're

9304
03:36:26,630 --> 03:36:26,640
leveraged versus QQQ, right? So you're
 

9305
03:36:26,640 --> 03:36:29,110
leveraged versus QQQ, right? So you're
playing the long triple leverage QS. If

9306
03:36:29,110 --> 03:36:29,120
playing the long triple leverage QS. If
 

9307
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:30,229
playing the long triple leverage QS. If
you want to play the short, you play

Uh yeah, so the course you just won's
 

9337
03:37:19,200 --> 03:37:21,590
Uh yeah, so the course you just won's
like a very introduction course SSC.

9338

like a very introduction course SSC.
 

9339
03:37:21,600 --> 03:37:23,349

It's for people who've like never really
 

9341
03:37:23,359 --> 03:37:25,429
It's for people who've like never really
traded before. But if you do that

9342
03:37:25,429 --> 03:37:25,439
traded before. But if you do that
 

9343
03:37:25,439 --> 03:37:27,269
traded before. But if you do that
course, you get money off the beginner

9344
03:37:27,269 --> 03:37:27,279
course, you get money off the beginner
 

9345
03:37:27,279 --> 03:37:29,429
course, you get money off the beginner
to advance course. That course I just

9346
03:37:29,429 --> 03:37:29,439
to advance course. That course I just
 

9347
03:37:29,439 --> 03:37:30,870
to advance course. That course I just
showed you there is brand new. It's just

9348
03:37:30,870 --> 03:37:30,880
showed you there is brand new. It's just
 

9349
03:37:30,880 --> 03:37:34,150
showed you there is brand new. It's just
on order flow. It's way way way more

9350
03:37:34,150 --> 03:37:34,160
on order flow. It's way way way more
 

9351
03:37:34,160 --> 03:37:36,150
on order flow. It's way way way more
advanced. I would say do the do the

9352
03:37:36,150 --> 03:37:36,160
advanced. I would say do the do the
 

9353
03:37:36,160 --> 03:37:39,030
advanced. I would say do the do the
20our course first. If you're if you're

9354
03:37:39,030 --> 03:37:39,040
20our course first. If you're if you're
 

9355
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:40,550
20our course first. If you're if you're
interested, say do the 20our course

9356
03:37:40,550 --> 03:37:40,560
interested, say do the 20our course
 

9357
03:37:40,560 --> 03:37:41,910
interested, say do the 20our course
first because you'll understand how I

9358
03:37:41,910 --> 03:37:41,920
first because you'll understand how I
 

9359
03:37:41,920 --> 03:37:44,950
first because you'll understand how I
view the markets. And then like a top up

9360
03:37:44,950 --> 03:37:44,960
view the markets. And then like a top up
 

9361
03:37:44,960 --> 03:37:47,990
view the markets. And then like a top up
to that would be the volume and order

9362
03:37:47,990 --> 03:37:48,000
to that would be the volume and order
 

9363
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:50,070
to that would be the volume and order
flow if you're interested in that stuff.

9364
03:37:50,070 --> 03:37:50,080
flow if you're interested in that stuff.
 

9365
03:37:50,080 --> 03:38:00,070
flow if you're interested in that stuff.
Again, no zero pressure

9366
03:38:00,070 --> 03:38:00,080

 

9367
03:38:00,080 --> 03:38:01,990

volume channel looks off. What? Compared

9368
03:38:01,990 --> 03:38:02,000
volume channel looks off. What? Compared
 

9369
03:38:02,000 --> 03:38:04,630
volume channel looks off. What? Compared
to TQ's, is that what you're saying? Let

9370
03:38:04,630 --> 03:38:04,640
to TQ's, is that what you're saying? Let
 

9371
03:38:04,640 --> 03:38:14,469
to TQ's, is that what you're saying? Let
me have a look.

9372
03:38:14,469 --> 03:38:14,479

 

9373
03:38:14,479 --> 03:38:15,910

thinks the same to me. Just might be

9374
03:38:15,910 --> 03:38:15,920
thinks the same to me. Just might be
 

9375
03:38:15,920 --> 03:38:19,190
thinks the same to me. Just might be
that there's less volume traded on this

9376
03:38:19,190 --> 03:38:19,200
that there's less volume traded on this
 

9377
03:38:19,200 --> 03:38:21,830
that there's less volume traded on this
because this is uh has to include

9378
03:38:21,830 --> 03:38:21,840
because this is uh has to include
 

9379
03:38:21,840 --> 03:38:23,910
because this is uh has to include
options. It's the same, mate. It's

9380
03:38:23,910 --> 03:38:23,920
options. It's the same, mate. It's
 

9381
03:38:23,920 --> 03:38:25,110
options. It's the same, mate. It's
exactly the same. You're just stuck in

9382
03:38:25,110 --> 03:38:25,120
exactly the same. You're just stuck in
 

9383
03:38:25,120 --> 03:38:28,309
exactly the same. You're just stuck in
the same range there or thereabouts.

9384
03:38:28,309 --> 03:38:28,319
the same range there or thereabouts.
 

9385
03:38:28,319 --> 03:38:30,150
the same range there or thereabouts.
So, your high is basically this pivot

9386
03:38:30,150 --> 03:38:30,160
So, your high is basically this pivot
 

9387
03:38:30,160 --> 03:38:32,389
So, your high is basically this pivot
from

9388
03:38:32,389 --> 03:38:32,399
from
 

9389
03:38:32,399 --> 03:38:35,190
from
1120 and your low is this pivot from IB

9390
03:38:35,190 --> 03:38:35,200
1120 and your low is this pivot from IB
 

9391
03:38:35,200 --> 03:38:37,349
1120 and your low is this pivot from IB
and you're stuck in this pivot into and

9392
03:38:37,349 --> 03:38:37,359
and you're stuck in this pivot into and
 

9393
03:38:37,359 --> 03:38:42,710
and you're stuck in this pivot into and
around here. Let's go back.

9394
03:38:42,710 --> 03:38:42,720

 

9395
03:38:42,720 --> 03:38:45,750

Yeah, it's basically exactly the same.

9396
03:38:45,750 --> 03:38:45,760
Yeah, it's basically exactly the same.
 

9397
03:38:45,760 --> 03:39:07,030
Yeah, it's basically exactly the same.
There's no difference. It's the same

9398
03:39:07,030 --> 03:39:07,040

 

9399
03:39:07,040 --> 03:39:09,750

FCT. Since you work with TPT, let the

9400
03:39:09,750 --> 03:39:09,760
FCT. Since you work with TPT, let the
 

9401
03:39:09,760 --> 03:39:12,790
FCT. Since you work with TPT, let the
people here know that they have to close

9402
03:39:12,790 --> 03:39:12,800
people here know that they have to close
 

9403
03:39:12,800 --> 03:39:14,630
people here know that they have to close
their positions manually so you don't

9404
03:39:14,630 --> 03:39:14,640
their positions manually so you don't
 

9405
03:39:14,640 --> 03:39:17,670
their positions manually so you don't
get effed over by this in my opinion

9406
03:39:17,670 --> 03:39:17,680
get effed over by this in my opinion
 

9407
03:39:17,680 --> 03:39:19,590
get effed over by this in my opinion
stupid rule. Well, we we just talked

9408
03:39:19,590 --> 03:39:19,600
stupid rule. Well, we we just talked
 

9409

9411
03:39:22,880 --> 03:39:25,030
about it. I mean, I Yeah, we just talked
about putting stuff in place so that you

9412
03:39:25,030 --> 03:39:25,040
about putting stuff in place so that you
 

9413
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:27,590
about putting stuff in place so that you
are protected against that. I've never

9414
03:39:27,590 --> 03:39:27,600
are protected against that. I've never
 

9415
03:39:27,600 --> 03:39:29,510
are protected against that. I've never
had that problem because I I don't trade

9416
03:39:29,510 --> 03:39:29,520
had that problem because I I don't trade
 

9417
03:39:29,520 --> 03:39:35,269
had that problem because I I don't trade
past 4:00. But uh

9418
03:39:35,269 --> 03:39:35,279

 

9419
03:39:35,279 --> 03:39:36,710

yeah, it's important to put what you

9420
03:39:36,710 --> 03:39:36,720
yeah, it's important to put what you
 

9421
03:39:36,720 --> 03:39:38,550
yeah, it's important to put what you

do,
they're going to look to come up to this

9462
03:40:34,389 --> 03:40:34,399
they're going to look to come up to this
 

9463
03:40:34,399 --> 03:40:36,630
they're going to look to come up to this
value error high again. They're going to

9464
03:40:36,630 --> 03:40:36,640
value error high again. They're going to
 

9465
03:40:36,640 --> 03:40:39,990
value error high again. They're going to
look to test this if they can.

9466
03:40:39,990 --> 03:40:40,000
look to test this if they can.
 

9467
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:41,990
look to test this if they can.
So, the rotation still happening. Oh my

9468
03:40:41,990 --> 03:40:42,000
So, the rotation still happening. Oh my
 

9469
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:44,469
So, the rotation still happening. Oh my
god. Let me draw it. This rotation still

9470
03:40:44,469 --> 03:40:44,479
god. Let me draw it. This rotation still
 

9471
03:40:44,479 --> 03:40:47,429
god. Let me draw it. This rotation still
happening here to here. Shorts tried to

9472
03:40:47,429 --> 03:40:47,439
happening here to here. Shorts tried to
 

9473
03:40:47,439 --> 03:40:49,590
happening here to here. Shorts tried to
come in under here. Couldn't get follow

9474
03:40:49,590 --> 03:40:49,600
come in under here. Couldn't get follow
 

9475
03:40:49,600 --> 03:40:51,269
come in under here. Couldn't get follow
through. Reclaimed instantly. Now we're

9476
03:40:51,269 --> 03:40:51,279
through. Reclaimed instantly. Now we're
 

9477
03:40:51,279 --> 03:40:52,309
through. Reclaimed instantly. Now we're
going to go back to this side and

9478
03:40:52,309 --> 03:40:52,319
going to go back to this side and
 

9479
03:40:52,319 --> 03:40:53,190
going to go back to this side and
they're going to see is there follow

9489
03:41:02,479 --> 03:41:14,309
can't move. Apple has been weak. It's
one of the big problems.

9490
03:41:14,309 --> 03:41:14,319

 

9491
03:41:14,319 --> 03:41:17,110

Decent day. Locked in some nice profits
early. Um, I would just watch the

9496
03:41:21,830 --> 03:41:21,840
early. Um, I would just watch the
 

9497
03:41:21,840 --> 03:41:24,229
early. Um, I would just watch the
rotations for the remainder of the day

9498
03:41:24,229 --> 03:41:24,239
rotations for the remainder of the day
 

9499
03:41:24,239 --> 03:41:25,590
rotations for the remainder of the day
if I was you. What? Just let me check

9500
03:41:25,590 --> 03:41:25,600
if I was you. What? Just let me check
 

9501
03:41:25,600 --> 03:41:29,510
if I was you. What? Just let me check
the volume which came in. VPO is at 700.

9502
03:41:29,510 --> 03:41:29,520
the volume which came in. VPO is at 700.
 

9503
03:41:29,520 --> 03:41:30,870
the volume which came in. VPO is at 700.
Bang in the middle. Is that the same

9504
03:41:30,870 --> 03:41:30,880
Bang in the middle. Is that the same
 

9505
03:41:30,880 --> 03:41:33,030
Bang in the middle. Is that the same
here? Yeah.

9506
03:41:33,030 --> 03:41:33,040
here? Yeah.
 

9507
03:41:33,040 --> 03:41:50,309
here? Yeah.
Just check this.

9508
03:41:50,309 --> 03:41:50,319

 

9509
03:41:50,319 --> 03:41:52,710

90s.

9510
03:41:52,710 --> 03:41:52,720
90s.
 

9511
03:41:52,720 --> 03:41:54,150
90s.
Yeah, it looks like it wants to go.

9512
03:41:54,150 --> 03:41:54,160
Yeah, it looks like it wants to go.
 

9513
03:41:54,160 --> 03:41:55,670

You're going to test value area high.

9514
03:41:55,670 --> 03:41:55,680
You're going to test value area high.
 

9515
03:41:55,680 --> 03:41:57,590
You're going to test value area high.
Now, if you find a bid above this, I'd

9516
03:41:57,590 --> 03:41:57,600
Now, if you find a bid above this, I'd
 

9517
03:41:57,600 --> 03:42:00,950
Now, if you find a bid above this, I'd
watch this imbalance. 33 to 39.

9518
03:42:00,950 --> 03:42:00,960
watch this imbalance. 33 to 39.
 

9519
03:42:00,960 --> 03:42:03,750
watch this imbalance. 33 to 39.
Where did the sellers last come in?

9520
03:42:03,750 --> 03:42:03,760
Where did the sellers last come in?
 

9521
03:42:03,760 --> 03:42:07,349
Where did the sellers last come in?
Right here. So, I'll be watching 33 to

9522
03:42:07,349 --> 03:42:07,359
Right here. So, I'll be watching 33 to
 

9523
03:42:07,359 --> 03:42:09,510
Right here. So, I'll be watching 33 to
39 if you get through the current value

9524
03:42:09,510 --> 03:42:09,520
39 if you get through the current value
 

9525
03:42:09,520 --> 03:42:12,389
39 if you get through the current value
high. And then 75s. Just check this here

9526
03:42:12,389 --> 03:42:12,399
high. And then 75s. Just check this here
 

9527
03:42:12,399 --> 03:42:19,429
high. And then 75s. Just check this here
as well.

9528
03:42:19,429 --> 03:42:19,439

 

9529
03:42:19,439 --> 03:42:22,550

Where is this 720s?

9530
03:42:22,550 --> 03:42:22,560
Where is this 720s?
 

9531
03:42:22,560 --> 03:42:24,469
Where is this 720s?
Is there buyers stuck in there? It's a

9532
03:42:24,469 --> 03:42:24,479
Is there buyers stuck in there? It's a
 

9533
03:42:24,479 --> 03:42:26,790
Is there buyers stuck in there? It's a
good transition.

9534
03:42:26,790 --> 03:42:26,800
good transition.
 

9535
03:42:26,800 --> 03:42:28,710
good transition.
All right.

9536
03:42:28,710 --> 03:42:28,720
All right.
 

9537
03:42:28,720 --> 03:42:31,190
All right.
Yeah. So, all this is is a rotation till

9538
03:42:31,190 --> 03:42:31,200
Yeah. So, all this is is a rotation till
 

9539
03:42:31,200 --> 03:42:33,349
Yeah. So, all this is is a rotation till
you find acceptance. So, you're pinned

9540
03:42:33,349 --> 03:42:33,359
you find acceptance. So, you're pinned
 

9541
03:42:33,359 --> 03:42:35,750
you find acceptance. So, you're pinned
from here to here right now. This is the

9542
03:42:35,750 --> 03:42:35,760
from here to here right now. This is the
 

9543
03:42:35,760 --> 03:42:37,670
from here to here right now. This is the
current rotation. If you find acceptance

9544
03:42:37,670 --> 03:42:37,680
current rotation. If you find acceptance
 

9545
03:42:37,680 --> 03:42:39,670
current rotation. If you find acceptance
over this, like those levels I just

9546
03:42:39,670 --> 03:42:39,680
over this, like those levels I just
 

9547
03:42:39,680 --> 03:42:42,150
over this, like those levels I just
talked about up into here to repric, if

9548
03:42:42,150 --> 03:42:42,160
talked about up into here to repric, if
 

9549
03:42:42,160 --> 03:42:43,510
talked about up into here to repric, if
they really want to squeeze, you got to

9550
03:42:43,510 --> 03:42:43,520
they really want to squeeze, you got to
 

9551
03:42:43,520 --> 03:42:44,870
they really want to squeeze, you got to
take this out to get it back up to the

9552
03:42:44,870 --> 03:42:44,880
take this out to get it back up to the
 

9553
03:42:44,880 --> 03:42:46,950
take this out to get it back up to the
New York high. And in here, I would

9554
03:42:46,950 --> 03:42:46,960
New York high. And in here, I would
 

9555
03:42:46,960 --> 03:42:48,870
New York high. And in here, I would
leave alone. All right. In this level

9556
03:42:48,870 --> 03:42:48,880
leave alone. All right. In this level
 

9557
03:42:48,880 --> 03:42:50,469
leave alone. All right. In this level
here, I'd leave alone. You need to see

9558
03:42:50,469 --> 03:42:50,479
here, I'd leave alone. You need to see
 

9559
03:42:50,479 --> 03:42:54,070
here, I'd leave alone. You need to see
if we find acceptance or not. But we're

9560
03:42:54,070 --> 03:42:54,080
if we find acceptance or not. But we're
 

9561
03:42:54,080 --> 03:42:56,309
if we find acceptance or not. But we're
in a fairly standard bell curve. So, I'd

9562
03:42:56,309 --> 03:42:56,319
in a fairly standard bell curve. So, I'd
 

9563
03:42:56,319 --> 03:42:58,950
in a fairly standard bell curve. So, I'd
be somewhat careful about buying much

9564
03:42:58,950 --> 03:42:58,960
be somewhat careful about buying much
 

9565
03:42:58,960 --> 03:43:01,190
be somewhat careful about buying much
above here, unless it really shows

9566
03:43:01,190 --> 03:43:01,200
above here, unless it really shows
 

9567
03:43:01,200 --> 03:43:02,870
above here, unless it really shows
itself and they build out like a new

9568
03:43:02,870 --> 03:43:02,880
itself and they build out like a new
 

9569
03:43:02,880 --> 03:43:04,550
itself and they build out like a new
shelf here. I'd be very very careful

9570
03:43:04,550 --> 03:43:04,560
shelf here. I'd be very very careful
 

9571
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:06,229
shelf here. I'd be very very careful
because it's very possible we do

9572
03:43:06,229 --> 03:43:06,239
because it's very possible we do
 

9573
03:43:06,239 --> 03:43:07,429
because it's very possible we do
something like this and then just come

9574
03:43:07,429 --> 03:43:07,439
something like this and then just come
 

9575
03:43:07,439 --> 03:43:08,790
something like this and then just come
straight back down inside which is why

9576
03:43:08,790 --> 03:43:08,800
straight back down inside which is why
 

9577
03:43:08,800 --> 03:43:11,670
straight back down inside which is why
I'm going to try and avoid it.

9578
03:43:11,670 --> 03:43:11,680
I'm going to try and avoid it.
 

9579
03:43:11,680 --> 03:43:14,070
I'm going to try and avoid it.
But we will see. ES is uh is starting to

9580
03:43:14,070 --> 03:43:14,080
But we will see. ES is uh is starting to
 

9581

But we will see. ES is uh is starting to
get going for you guys now. But that's

9582
03:43:15,590 --> 03:43:15,600
get going for you guys now. But that's
 

9583
03:43:15,600 --> 03:43:17,670
get going for you guys now. But that's
that's going to be it for me. I'm going

9584
03:43:17,670 --> 03:43:17,680
that's going to be it for me. I'm going
 

9585
03:43:17,680 --> 03:43:19,349
that's going to be it for me. I'm going
to lot this up for the day. We'll come

9586
03:43:19,349 --> 03:43:19,359
to lot this up for the day. We'll come

Christmas um that we're going to trade.

9590
03:43:23,990 --> 03:43:24,000
Christmas um that we're going to trade.
 

9591
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:25,590
Christmas um that we're going to trade.
We'll see what we'll get. Again, very

9592
03:43:25,590 --> 03:43:25,600
We'll see what we'll get. Again, very
 

9593
03:43:25,600 --> 03:43:28,150
We'll see what we'll get. Again, very
light in volume. We'll do some more

9594
03:43:28,150 --> 03:43:28,160
light in volume. We'll do some more
 

9595
03:43:28,160 --> 03:43:29,590
light in volume. We'll do some more
educational stuff tomorrow. We'll do

9596
03:43:29,590 --> 03:43:29,600
educational stuff tomorrow. We'll do
 

9597
03:43:29,600 --> 03:43:31,830
educational stuff tomorrow. We'll do
some more giveaways. Where's the VIX

9598
03:43:31,830 --> 03:43:31,840
some more giveaways. Where's the VIX
 

9599
03:43:31,840 --> 03:43:33,110
some more giveaways. Where's the VIX
coming into here? Let me just check

9600
03:43:33,110 --> 03:43:33,120
coming into here? Let me just check
 

9601
03:43:33,120 --> 03:43:35,830
coming into here? Let me just check
this. This is a big level. But where's

9602
03:43:35,830 --> 03:43:35,840
this. This is a big level. But where's
 

9603
03:43:35,840 --> 03:43:42,469
this. This is a big level. But where's
it from? This is a long time ago.

9604
03:43:42,469 --> 03:43:42,479

 

9605
03:43:42,479 --> 03:43:45,110

September 18.

9606
03:43:45,110 --> 03:43:45,120
September 18.
 

9607
03:43:45,120 --> 03:43:49,269
September 18.
Okay. I just watch VIX once we move from

9608
03:43:49,269 --> 03:43:49,279
Okay. I just watch VIX once we move from
 

9609
03:43:49,279 --> 03:43:52,710
Okay. I just watch VIX once we move from
1430s down to 1440s. Uh we've never

9610
03:43:52,710 --> 03:43:52,720
1430s down to 1440s. Uh we've never
 

9611
03:43:52,720 --> 03:43:55,590
1430s down to 1440s. Uh we've never
really been able to move under that. So

9612
03:43:55,590 --> 03:43:55,600
really been able to move under that. So
 

9613
03:43:55,600 --> 03:43:58,550
really been able to move under that. So
you might find that they hedge a bit on

9614
03:43:58,550 --> 03:43:58,560
you might find that they hedge a bit on
 

9615
03:43:58,560 --> 03:44:00,309
you might find that they hedge a bit on
the VIX as we get into that. So just be

9616
03:44:00,309 --> 03:44:00,319
the VIX as we get into that. So just be
 

9617
03:44:00,319 --> 03:44:02,790
the VIX as we get into that. So just be
cautious.

9618
03:44:02,790 --> 03:44:02,800
cautious.
 

9619
03:44:02,800 --> 03:44:04,229
cautious.
Wait, can I ask you one more question?

9620
03:44:04,229 --> 03:44:04,239
Wait, can I ask you one more question?
 

9621
03:44:04,239 --> 03:44:05,990
Wait, can I ask you one more question?
No worries. If not, it just came back to

9622
03:44:05,990 --> 03:44:06,000
No worries. If not, it just came back to
 

9623
03:44:06,000 --> 03:44:08,790
No worries. If not, it just came back to
stream. I can wait. Yeah, just ask. Ask

9624
03:44:08,790 --> 03:44:08,800
stream. I can wait. Yeah, just ask. Ask
 

9625
03:44:08,800 --> 03:44:17,670
stream. I can wait. Yeah, just ask. Ask
Matt. Ask now,

9626
03:44:17,670 --> 03:44:17,680

 

9627
03:44:17,680 --> 03:44:19,429

what do you mean by an an order of

9628
03:44:19,429 --> 03:44:19,439
what do you mean by an an order of
 

9629
03:44:19,439 --> 03:44:21,990
what do you mean by an an order of
priority? Pat, everything's higher time

9630
03:44:21,990 --> 03:44:22,000
priority? Pat, everything's higher time
 

9631
03:44:22,000 --> 03:44:24,950
priority? Pat, everything's higher time
frame for me. So,

9632
03:44:24,950 --> 03:44:24,960
frame for me. So,
 

9633
03:44:24,960 --> 03:44:27,990
frame for me. So,
weekly, daily, 4 hour, hour. The higher

9634
03:44:27,990 --> 03:44:28,000
weekly, daily, 4 hour, hour. The higher
 

9635
03:44:28,000 --> 03:44:30,070
weekly, daily, 4 hour, hour. The higher
it is, the more powerful it is for me.

9636
03:44:30,070 --> 03:44:30,080
it is, the more powerful it is for me.
 

9637
03:44:30,080 --> 03:44:32,070
it is, the more powerful it is for me.
on the point of knowing what not to do.

9638
03:44:32,070 --> 03:44:32,080
on the point of knowing what not to do.
 

9639
03:44:32,080 --> 03:44:35,269
on the point of knowing what not to do.
In the last two months, I've been up 14K

9640
03:44:35,269 --> 03:44:35,279
In the last two months, I've been up 14K
 

9641
03:44:35,279 --> 03:44:39,030
In the last two months, I've been up 14K
and cashed out 10K, but I lost all of it

9642
03:44:39,030 --> 03:44:39,040
and cashed out 10K, but I lost all of it
 

9643
03:44:39,040 --> 03:44:40,950
and cashed out 10K, but I lost all of it
both times

9644
03:44:40,950 --> 03:44:40,960
both times
 

9645
03:44:40,960 --> 03:44:43,110
both times
by going back

9646
03:44:43,110 --> 03:44:43,120
by going back
 

9647
03:44:43,120 --> 03:44:45,590
by going back
in after the market closed. Is that one

9648
03:44:45,590 --> 03:44:45,600
in after the market closed. Is that one
 

9649
03:44:45,600 --> 03:44:47,990
in after the market closed. Is that one
of your rules? After the market closes,

9650
03:44:47,990 --> 03:44:48,000
of your rules? After the market closes,
 

9651
03:44:48,000 --> 03:44:49,750
of your rules? After the market closes,
it seems to plateau, but I get excited

9652
03:44:49,750 --> 03:44:49,760
it seems to plateau, but I get excited
 

9653
03:44:49,760 --> 03:44:52,630
it seems to plateau, but I get excited
and go back in. Yeah, there's no The

9654
03:44:52,630 --> 03:44:52,640
and go back in. Yeah, there's no The
 

9655
03:44:52,640 --> 03:44:55,349
and go back in. Yeah, there's no The
only time I would trade outside of New

9656
03:44:55,349 --> 03:44:55,359
only time I would trade outside of New
 

9657
03:44:55,359 --> 03:44:58,469
only time I would trade outside of New
York hours. All right. The only time is

9658
03:44:58,469 --> 03:44:58,479
York hours. All right. The only time is
 

9659
03:44:58,479 --> 03:45:00,950
York hours. All right. The only time is
if there's a reason. You've got to

9660
03:45:00,950 --> 03:45:00,960
if there's a reason. You've got to
 

9661
03:45:00,960 --> 03:45:04,710
if there's a reason. You've got to
understand volume is king. So, let's

9662
03:45:04,710 --> 03:45:04,720
understand volume is king. So, let's
 

9663
03:45:04,720 --> 03:45:06,710
understand volume is king. So, let's
just show you what happens in the after

9664
03:45:06,710 --> 03:45:06,720
just show you what happens in the after
 

9665

9667
03:45:12,800 --> 03:45:16,790

Look at the difference in volume.

9668
03:45:16,790 --> 03:45:16,800
Look at the difference in volume.
 

9669
03:45:16,800 --> 03:45:20,070
Look at the difference in volume.

a lesson on it last week. We're going to
respect levels way more in the New York

9687
03:45:38,319 --> 03:45:40,150

03:45:40,150 --> 03:45:40,160
after hours, there's no one on the book
 

9689
03:45:40,160 --> 03:45:42,630
after hours, there's no one on the book

So, we can skip around. Your spread can

9692
03:45:44,469 --> 03:45:44,479
So, we can skip around. Your spread can
 

9693
03:45:44,479 --> 03:45:46,790
So, we can skip around. Your spread can
open up. Um, it doesn't mean there

9694
03:45:46,790 --> 03:45:46,800
open up. Um, it doesn't mean there
 

9695
03:45:46,800 --> 03:45:48,469
open up. Um, it doesn't mean there
aren't good trades to be had there, but

9696
03:45:48,469 --> 03:45:48,479
aren't good trades to be had there, but
 

9697
03:45:48,479 --> 03:45:49,830
aren't good trades to be had there, but
you're going to have to be very accurate

9698
03:45:49,830 --> 03:45:49,840
you're going to have to be very accurate
 

9699
03:45:49,840 --> 03:45:51,750
you're going to have to be very accurate
on when and why you're getting in. If

9700
03:45:51,750 --> 03:45:51,760
on when and why you're getting in. If
 

9701
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:53,110
on when and why you're getting in. If
you're just clicking buttons cuz you

9702
03:45:53,110 --> 03:45:53,120
you're just clicking buttons cuz you
 

9703
03:45:53,120 --> 03:45:55,110
you're just clicking buttons cuz you
want to be here in the after hours, then

9704
03:45:55,110 --> 03:45:55,120
want to be here in the after hours, then
 

9705
03:45:55,120 --> 03:45:56,070
want to be here in the after hours, then
yeah, you're going to give your money

9706
03:45:56,070 --> 03:45:56,080
yeah, you're going to give your money
 

9707
03:45:56,080 --> 03:46:02,790
yeah, you're going to give your money
back. All right,

9708
03:46:02,790 --> 03:46:02,800

 

9709
03:46:02,800 --> 03:46:06,950

UIX. I mean, in the NE, it's a funny

9710
03:46:06,950 --> 03:46:06,960
UIX. I mean, in the NE, it's a funny
 

9711
03:46:06,960 --> 03:46:10,436
UIX. I mean, in the NE, it's a funny
one, isn't it? Like

9712
03:46:10,436 --> 03:46:10,446
one, isn't it? Like
 

9713
03:46:10,446 --> 03:46:12,469
one, isn't it? Like
[sighs] over a holiday season. No, but I

9714
03:46:12,469 --> 03:46:12,479
[sighs] over a holiday season. No, but I
 

9715
03:46:12,479 --> 03:46:16,389
[sighs] over a holiday season. No, but I
think in January probably

9716
03:46:16,389 --> 03:46:16,399
think in January probably
 

9717
03:46:16,399 --> 03:46:18,469
think in January probably
RTH, mate. Yeah, RTH. The one on the

9718
03:46:18,469 --> 03:46:18,479
RTH, mate. Yeah, RTH. The one on the
 

9719
03:46:18,479 --> 03:46:20,630
RTH, mate. Yeah, RTH. The one on the
right side, RTH. Right. developing

9720
03:46:20,630 --> 03:46:20,640
right side, RTH. Right. developing
 

9721
03:46:20,640 --> 03:46:26,229
right side, RTH. Right. developing
volume RTH

9722
03:46:26,229 --> 03:46:26,239

 

9723
03:46:26,239 --> 03:46:28,150

pat I meant as far as looking at QZS VIX

9724
03:46:28,150 --> 03:46:28,160
pat I meant as far as looking at QZS VIX
 

9725
03:46:28,160 --> 03:46:30,870
pat I meant as far as looking at QZS VIX
and spy. Oh, okay. Um I don't give one

9726
03:46:30,870 --> 03:46:30,880
and spy. Oh, okay. Um I don't give one
 

9727
03:46:30,880 --> 03:46:33,429
and spy. Oh, okay. Um I don't give one
prefer. It's not like I give one more

9728
03:46:33,429 --> 03:46:33,439
prefer. It's not like I give one more
 

9729
03:46:33,439 --> 03:46:35,670
prefer. It's not like I give one more
validity than the other. So why would I

9730
03:46:35,670 --> 03:46:35,680
validity than the other. So why would I
 

9731
03:46:35,680 --> 03:46:37,990
validity than the other. So why would I
look at VI VIX? The relationship between

9732
03:46:37,990 --> 03:46:38,000
look at VI VIX? The relationship between
 

9733
03:46:38,000 --> 03:46:39,830
look at VI VIX? The relationship between
Vix and Spy. If we're getting divergence

9734
03:46:39,830 --> 03:46:39,840
Vix and Spy. If we're getting divergence
 

9735
03:46:39,840 --> 03:46:41,349
Vix and Spy. If we're getting divergence
where Vix and Spy are going the same

9736
03:46:41,349 --> 03:46:41,359
where Vix and Spy are going the same
 

9737
03:46:41,359 --> 03:46:43,429
where Vix and Spy are going the same
way, it's like a leave alone time for

9738
03:46:43,429 --> 03:46:43,439
way, it's like a leave alone time for
 

9739
03:46:43,439 --> 03:46:45,429
way, it's like a leave alone time for
me, right? So if Vix is starting to push

9740
03:46:45,429 --> 03:46:45,439
me, right? So if Vix is starting to push
 

9741
03:46:45,439 --> 03:46:47,590
me, right? So if Vix is starting to push
and Spy is still pushing, I'm like, well

9742
03:46:47,590 --> 03:46:47,600
and Spy is still pushing, I'm like, well
 

9743
03:46:47,600 --> 03:46:48,870
and Spy is still pushing, I'm like, well
that's not healthy. something's going to

9744
03:46:48,870 --> 03:46:48,880
that's not healthy. something's going to
 

9745
03:46:48,880 --> 03:46:52,229
that's not healthy. something's going to
go wrong there. When looking at SPY or

9746
03:46:52,229 --> 03:46:52,239
go wrong there. When looking at SPY or
 

9747
03:46:52,239 --> 03:46:55,030
go wrong there. When looking at SPY or
ES versus the Q's, right, we're all

9748
03:46:55,030 --> 03:46:55,040
ES versus the Q's, right, we're all
 

9749
03:46:55,040 --> 03:46:56,309
ES versus the Q's, right, we're all
we're looking for there is relative

9750
03:46:56,309 --> 03:46:56,319
we're looking for there is relative
 

9751
03:46:56,319 --> 03:46:57,750
we're looking for there is relative
strength. All we're really looking to

9752
03:46:57,750 --> 03:46:57,760
strength. All we're really looking to
 

9753
03:46:57,760 --> 03:46:59,189
strength. All we're really looking to
understand is what is the market

9754
03:46:59,189 --> 03:46:59,199
understand is what is the market
 

9755
03:46:59,199 --> 03:47:01,269
understand is what is the market
breadth, right? Because spy the breadth

9756
03:47:01,269 --> 03:47:01,279
breadth, right? Because spy the breadth
 

9757
03:47:01,279 --> 03:47:03,750
breadth, right? Because spy the breadth
would be bigger, more less waiting into

9758
03:47:03,750 --> 03:47:03,760
would be bigger, more less waiting into
 

9759
03:47:03,760 --> 03:47:05,590
would be bigger, more less waiting into
tech, more looking at like energy and

9760
03:47:05,590 --> 03:47:05,600
tech, more looking at like energy and
 

9761
03:47:05,600 --> 03:47:07,670
tech, more looking at like energy and
the finances. So, if we got a good

9762
03:47:07,670 --> 03:47:07,680
the finances. So, if we got a good
 

9763
03:47:07,680 --> 03:47:09,510
the finances. So, if we got a good
breath day

9764
03:47:09,510 --> 03:47:09,520
breath day
 

9765
03:47:09,520 --> 03:47:11,110
breath day
like we've probably got today, if I go

9766
03:47:11,110 --> 03:47:11,120
like we've probably got today, if I go
 

9767
03:47:11,120 --> 03:47:12,550
like we've probably got today, if I go
on Finn Viz and I have a look at the

9768
03:47:12,550 --> 03:47:12,560
on Finn Viz and I have a look at the
 

9769
03:47:12,560 --> 03:47:14,710
on Finn Viz and I have a look at the
breadth, I would imagine everything

9770
03:47:14,710 --> 03:47:14,720
breadth, I would imagine everything
 

9771
03:47:14,720 --> 03:47:17,269
breadth, I would imagine everything
really is pretty green. There we go. So

9772
03:47:17,269 --> 03:47:17,279
really is pretty green. There we go. So
 

9773
03:47:17,279 --> 03:47:18,710
really is pretty green. There we go. So
if we think about what the weakest thing

9774
03:47:18,710 --> 03:47:18,720
if we think about what the weakest thing
 

9775
03:47:18,720 --> 03:47:20,469
if we think about what the weakest thing
is

9776
03:47:20,469 --> 03:47:20,479
is
 

9777
03:47:20,479 --> 03:47:23,429
is
right now, all right, it's Apple. All

9778
03:47:23,429 --> 03:47:23,439
right now, all right, it's Apple. All
 

9779
03:47:23,439 --> 03:47:25,110
right now, all right, it's Apple. All
right, it's Apple that's holding cues

9780
03:47:25,110 --> 03:47:25,120
right, it's Apple that's holding cues
 

9781
03:47:25,120 --> 03:47:26,950
right, it's Apple that's holding cues
down. We look at finances, they look

9782
03:47:26,950 --> 03:47:26,960
down. We look at finances, they look
 

9783
03:47:26,960 --> 03:47:28,309
down. We look at finances, they look
good. Healthcare pretty good. All right,

9784
03:47:28,309 --> 03:47:28,319
good. Healthcare pretty good. All right,
 

9785
03:47:28,319 --> 03:47:30,150
good. Healthcare pretty good. All right,
Eli and Lily, not the best, but it's not

9786
03:47:30,150 --> 03:47:30,160
Eli and Lily, not the best, but it's not
 

9787
03:47:30,160 --> 03:47:32,070
Eli and Lily, not the best, but it's not
too bad. Most things are green, right?

9788
03:47:32,070 --> 03:47:32,080
too bad. Most things are green, right?
 

9789
03:47:32,080 --> 03:47:33,670
too bad. Most things are green, right?
So tech lagging a little bit from Apple,

9790
03:47:33,670 --> 03:47:33,680
So tech lagging a little bit from Apple,
 

9791
03:47:33,680 --> 03:47:35,429
So tech lagging a little bit from Apple,
but the breadth is good, which is why

9792
03:47:35,429 --> 03:47:35,439
but the breadth is good, which is why
 

9793
03:47:35,439 --> 03:47:37,189
but the breadth is good, which is why
you've got ES making bigger moves.

9794
03:47:37,189 --> 03:47:37,199
you've got ES making bigger moves.
 

9795
03:47:37,199 --> 03:47:39,429
you've got ES making bigger moves.
There's GlobeEx, so it's starting to go

9796
03:47:39,429 --> 03:47:39,439
There's GlobeEx, so it's starting to go
 

9797
03:47:39,439 --> 03:47:42,070
There's GlobeEx, so it's starting to go
now. It is such a shame they took so

9798
03:47:42,070 --> 03:47:42,080
now. It is such a shame they took so
 

9799
03:47:42,080 --> 03:47:43,590
now. It is such a shame they took so
long, but maybe could have traded that

9800
03:47:43,590 --> 03:47:43,600
long, but maybe could have traded that
 

9801
03:47:43,600 --> 03:47:45,269
long, but maybe could have traded that
reclaimer so low on volume. It's not

9802
03:47:45,269 --> 03:47:45,279
reclaimer so low on volume. It's not
 

9803
03:47:45,279 --> 03:47:51,269
reclaimer so low on volume. It's not
worth it over lunch in my opinion.

9804
03:47:51,269 --> 03:47:51,279

 

9805
03:47:51,279 --> 03:47:53,030

Trade the highest liquidity, highest

9806
03:47:53,030 --> 03:47:53,040
Trade the highest liquidity, highest
 

9807
03:47:53,040 --> 03:47:55,590
Trade the highest liquidity, highest
volume parts of the day and be done. I

9808
03:47:55,590 --> 03:47:55,600
volume parts of the day and be done. I
 

9809
03:47:55,600 --> 03:47:59,189
volume parts of the day and be done. I
agree. Once you truly learn what's going

9810
03:47:59,189 --> 03:47:59,199
agree. Once you truly learn what's going
 

9811
03:47:59,199 --> 03:48:01,670
agree. Once you truly learn what's going
on, you will realize all you need is

9812
03:48:01,670 --> 03:48:01,680
on, you will realize all you need is
 

9813
03:48:01,680 --> 03:48:03,429
on, you will realize all you need is
three to five good trades per week to

9814
03:48:03,429 --> 03:48:03,439
three to five good trades per week to
 

9815
03:48:03,439 --> 03:48:05,349
three to five good trades per week to
make great money. Yeah, even less, man.

9816
03:48:05,349 --> 03:48:05,359
make great money. Yeah, even less, man.
 

9817
03:48:05,359 --> 03:48:08,150
make great money. Yeah, even less, man.
One really banger of a trade a week or a

9818
03:48:08,150 --> 03:48:08,160
One really banger of a trade a week or a
 

9819
03:48:08,160 --> 03:48:09,990
One really banger of a trade a week or a
month, make all your money. I mean, if

9820
03:48:09,990 --> 03:48:10,000
month, make all your money. I mean, if
 

9821
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:11,670
month, make all your money. I mean, if
you've read Market Wizards, you will

9822
03:48:11,670 --> 03:48:11,680
you've read Market Wizards, you will
 

9823
03:48:11,680 --> 03:48:14,150
you've read Market Wizards, you will
know all those guys who made mega mega

9824
03:48:14,150 --> 03:48:14,160
know all those guys who made mega mega
 

9825
03:48:14,160 --> 03:48:16,469
know all those guys who made mega mega
money. Market Wizards, very rarely are

9826
03:48:16,469 --> 03:48:16,479
money. Market Wizards, very rarely are
 

9827
03:48:16,479 --> 03:48:18,870
money. Market Wizards, very rarely are
they scalpers. They're position traders.

9828
03:48:18,870 --> 03:48:18,880
they scalpers. They're position traders.
 

9829
03:48:18,880 --> 03:48:20,710

Um, right from the 80s up to now,

9830
03:48:20,710 --> 03:48:20,720
Um, right from the 80s up to now,
 

9831
03:48:20,720 --> 03:48:21,910
Um, right from the 80s up to now,
they're positioned and they're looking

they're positioned and they're looking
 

9833
03:48:21,920 --> 03:48:25,189
they're positioned and they're looking
for one big setup to come into their

9834
03:48:25,189 --> 03:48:25,199
for one big setup to come into their
 

9835
03:48:25,199 --> 03:48:26,950
for one big setup to come into their
life that they position for and that's

9836
03:48:26,950 --> 03:48:26,960
life that they position for and that's
 

9837
03:48:26,960 --> 03:48:28,870
life that they position for and that's
where they make the big big money.

9838
03:48:28,870 --> 03:48:28,880
where they make the big big money.
 

9839
03:48:28,880 --> 03:48:30,950
where they make the big big money.
Everything in between is pretty much

Everything in between is pretty much

Everything in between is pretty much
