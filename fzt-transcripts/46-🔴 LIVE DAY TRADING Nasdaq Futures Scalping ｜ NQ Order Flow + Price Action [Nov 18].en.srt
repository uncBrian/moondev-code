there's a problem with trade of eight,
but uh just warning you now is never a

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
but uh just warning you now is never a
 

29
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,390
but uh just warning you now is never a
nice thing to wake up to all these

30
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
nice thing to wake up to all these
 

31
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,309
nice thing to wake up to all these
issues.

32
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
issues.
 

33
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,865
issues.
Okay, let's start on the daily.

34
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:13,875
Okay, let's start on the daily.
 

35
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,710
Okay, let's start on the daily.
[cough and clears throat] And you can

36
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
[cough and clears throat] And you can
 

37
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,189
[cough and clears throat] And you can
see on the daily possible breakout,

38
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
see on the daily possible breakout,
 

39
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,430
see on the daily possible breakout,
possible breakout here. So this set

40
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
possible breakout here. So this set
 

41
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,070
possible breakout here. So this set
yesterday's range. This was set in

42
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
yesterday's range. This was set in
 

43
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,350
yesterday's range. This was set in
GlobeEx. This was set at the lows. We're

44
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
GlobeEx. This was set at the lows. We're
 

45
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,950
GlobeEx. This was set at the lows. We're
into this huge sort of cluster that I

46
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
into this huge sort of cluster that I
 

47
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,629
into this huge sort of cluster that I
talked about in the weekly newsletter.

48
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
talked about in the weekly newsletter.
 

49
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,389
talked about in the weekly newsletter.
All right, you have to be aware of this

50
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
All right, you have to be aware of this
 

51
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,070
All right, you have to be aware of this
cluster. Remember this is your yearly

52
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
cluster. Remember this is your yearly
 

53
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,389
cluster. Remember this is your yearly
profile. We get thick in here and then

54
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
profile. We get thick in here and then
 

55
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,029
profile. We get thick in here and then
we thin right right out. They are trying

56
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
we thin right right out. They are trying
 

57
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,029
we thin right right out. They are trying
desperately to hold on to this cluster.

58
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
desperately to hold on to this cluster.
 

59
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,269
desperately to hold on to this cluster.
Guess what that cluster is? 700s. All

60
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
Guess what that cluster is? 700s. All
 

61
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,350
Guess what that cluster is? 700s. All
right, who remembers the rotation 7 to

62
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
right, who remembers the rotation 7 to
 

63
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,990
right, who remembers the rotation 7 to
25K, right? It's very possible that we

64
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
25K, right? It's very possible that we
 

65
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,750
25K, right? It's very possible that we
do that same kind of rotation. We

66
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
do that same kind of rotation. We
 

67
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,829
do that same kind of rotation. We
basically have done that overnight. If

68
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
basically have done that overnight. If
 

69
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,310
basically have done that overnight. If
you think about we dip below, washed out

70
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
you think about we dip below, washed out
 

71
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,750
you think about we dip below, washed out
previous week's low. All right, so we

72
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
previous week's low. All right, so we
 

73
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,670
previous week's low. All right, so we
took these stops, turned back inside,

74
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
took these stops, turned back inside,
 

75
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,670
took these stops, turned back inside,
came back up to 25,000, turned back

76
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
came back up to 25,000, turned back
 

77
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,509
came back up to 25,000, turned back
down, came back down to 700. That's what

78
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
down, came back down to 700. That's what
 

79
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,430
down, came back down to 700. That's what
we've seen. So that's what we're seeing.

80
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
we've seen. So that's what we're seeing.
 

81
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,509
we've seen. So that's what we're seeing.
The same thing that we saw here for days

82
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
The same thing that we saw here for days
 

83
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,949
The same thing that we saw here for days
and days and weeks and weeks and ends.

84
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
and days and weeks and weeks and ends.
 

85
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,470
and days and weeks and weeks and ends.
So we have to be aware of that rotation.

86
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
So we have to be aware of that rotation.
 

87
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,190
So we have to be aware of that rotation.
It likes rotating there. We are also

88
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
It likes rotating there. We are also
 

89
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,550
It likes rotating there. We are also
near the low Ballinger band. And this is

90
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
near the low Ballinger band. And this is
 

91
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,070
near the low Ballinger band. And this is
currently pointing upwards. In a few

92
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
currently pointing upwards. In a few
 

93
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,750
currently pointing upwards. In a few
days or so, you're going to start to see

94
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
days or so, you're going to start to see
 

95
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,590
days or so, you're going to start to see
this. So, location not ideal for a short

96
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
this. So, location not ideal for a short
 

97
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,829
this. So, location not ideal for a short
down here because we know the market

98
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
down here because we know the market
 

99
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,430
down here because we know the market
does not on a regular basis like trading

100
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
does not on a regular basis like trading
 

101
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,070
does not on a regular basis like trading
outside the extremes of these two

102
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
outside the extremes of these two
 

103
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,710
outside the extremes of these two
standard deviations. However, we do have

104
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
standard deviations. However, we do have
 

105
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,949
standard deviations. However, we do have
black swan events. They do happen. Okay.

106
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
black swan events. They do happen. Okay.
 

107
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,750
black swan events. They do happen. Okay.
So if for some reason we start losing

108
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
So if for some reason we start losing
 

109
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,630
So if for some reason we start losing
these 700s and this market goes into a

110
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
these 700s and this market goes into a
 

111
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,829
these 700s and this market goes into a
bit of a panic and cannot find a bid.

112
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
bit of a panic and cannot find a bid.
 

113
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,470
bit of a panic and cannot find a bid.
All right, if that happens then we can

114
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
All right, if that happens then we can
 

115
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,949
All right, if that happens then we can
think about expansion down here. But our

116
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
think about expansion down here. But our
 

117
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,550
think about expansion down here. But our
location for a new money short there

118
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
location for a new money short there
 

119
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,310
location for a new money short there
unfortunately is not good. Like if you

120
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
unfortunately is not good. Like if you
 

121
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,550
unfortunately is not good. Like if you
were short swing short any of these or

122
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
were short swing short any of these or
 

123
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,710
were short swing short any of these or
you're long S triple Q's and you're

124
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
you're long S triple Q's and you're
 

125
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,150
you're long S triple Q's and you're
having a lot of fun right now. But for

126
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
having a lot of fun right now. But for
 

127
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,990
having a lot of fun right now. But for
day trading it's a little bit harder to

128
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
day trading it's a little bit harder to
 

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,430
day trading it's a little bit harder to
think about getting short down here. So

130
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
think about getting short down here. So
 

131
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,310
think about getting short down here. So
we need to be careful of the location.

132
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
we need to be careful of the location.
 

133
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,870
we need to be careful of the location.
Right, we have to be careful.

134
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
Right, we have to be careful.
 

135
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,670
Right, we have to be careful.
Okay, let's move into this

136
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
Okay, let's move into this
 

137
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,269
Okay, let's move into this
into the hourlys. Make this a little bit

138
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
into the hourlys. Make this a little bit
 

139
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,030
into the hourlys. Make this a little bit
bigger so you can see it. There we go.

140
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
bigger so you can see it. There we go.
 

141
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,990
bigger so you can see it. There we go.
Okay, so hourly you can see

142
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay, so hourly you can see
 

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,750
Okay, so hourly you can see
yesterday like we talked about once we

144
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
yesterday like we talked about once we
 

145
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,750
yesterday like we talked about once we
started letting go. Those in Discord

146
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
started letting go. Those in Discord
 

147
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,550
started letting go. Those in Discord
will know took the continuations, right?

148
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
will know took the continuations, right?
 

149
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,990
will know took the continuations, right?
Once yesterday built out all this

150
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
Once yesterday built out all this
 

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,269
Once yesterday built out all this
liquidity. Look how long it took to

152
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
liquidity. Look how long it took to
 

153
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,870
liquidity. Look how long it took to
build build it out. Lots and lots of

154
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
build build it out. Lots and lots of
 

155
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,190
build build it out. Lots and lots of
time to build it out. But once lunchtime

156
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
time to build it out. But once lunchtime
 

157
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,269
time to build it out. But once lunchtime
fa let go and they failed to complete

158
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
fa let go and they failed to complete
 

159
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,829
fa let go and they failed to complete
that rotation, it was a short all day

160
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
that rotation, it was a short all day
 

161
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,750
that rotation, it was a short all day
long. Okay. And we've continued that

162
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
long. Okay. And we've continued that
 

163
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,550
long. Okay. And we've continued that
overnight so far. So, so far what we're

164
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
overnight so far. So, so far what we're
 

165
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,150
overnight so far. So, so far what we're
seeing here is lower lows and lower

166
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
seeing here is lower lows and lower
 

167
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,310
seeing here is lower lows and lower
highs. Now, it's very possible, all

168
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
highs. Now, it's very possible, all
 

169
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,710
highs. Now, it's very possible, all
right, that we've got one of these going

170
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
right, that we've got one of these going
 

171
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,110
right, that we've got one of these going
on and this can build liquidity to break

172
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
on and this can build liquidity to break
 

173
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,030
on and this can build liquidity to break
down. All right, it absolutely can do

174
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
down. All right, it absolutely can do
 

175
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,110
down. All right, it absolutely can do
that because on the higher time frame,

176
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
that because on the higher time frame,
 

177
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,110
that because on the higher time frame,
this is exactly we just zoom out what

178
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
this is exactly we just zoom out what
 

179
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,829
this is exactly we just zoom out what
we're doing. It's fractal. Right? Think

180
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
we're doing. It's fractal. Right? Think
 

181
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,230
we're doing. It's fractal. Right? Think
about this push head and shoulder

182
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
about this push head and shoulder
 

183
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,550
about this push head and shoulder
breakdown. This this push head and

184
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
breakdown. This this push head and
 

185
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,110
breakdown. This this push head and
shoulder break down this. Right? This is

186
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
shoulder break down this. Right? This is
 

187
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,430
shoulder break down this. Right? This is
this pattern inside of it. So it's very

188
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
this pattern inside of it. So it's very
 

189
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,509
this pattern inside of it. So it's very
very possible. All right. It's very very

190
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
very possible. All right. It's very very
 

191
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,590
very possible. All right. It's very very
very possible because you're starting to

192
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
very possible because you're starting to
 

193
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,350
very possible because you're starting to
see weakness in the markets. But again

194
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
see weakness in the markets. But again
 

195
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,710
see weakness in the markets. But again
our location is not ideal here and we

196
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
our location is not ideal here and we
 

197
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,870
our location is not ideal here and we
have swept previous week lows which is a

198
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
have swept previous week lows which is a
 

199
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,750
have swept previous week lows which is a
big low to take out. But we need to be

200
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
big low to take out. But we need to be
 

201
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,069
big low to take out. But we need to be
aware of that if this market is going to

202
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
aware of that if this market is going to
 

203
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,910
aware of that if this market is going to
find a rally this morning. But remember

204
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
find a rally this morning. But remember
 

205
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,990
find a rally this morning. But remember
in bare markets you get short squeezes

206
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
in bare markets you get short squeezes
 

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,350
in bare markets you get short squeezes
and they can be violent. You would have

208
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
and they can be violent. You would have
 

209
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,269
and they can be violent. You would have
seen on Friday and the week before. So

210
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
seen on Friday and the week before. So
 

211
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,630
seen on Friday and the week before. So
if they're going to start breaking out

212
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
if they're going to start breaking out
 

213
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,350
if they're going to start breaking out
of this, right, bulls will attempt to

214
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
of this, right, bulls will attempt to
 

215
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,910
of this, right, bulls will attempt to
reclaim previous day value area high

216
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
reclaim previous day value area high
 

217
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,310
reclaim previous day value area high
that and previous day low for me are

218
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
that and previous day low for me are
 

219
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,230
that and previous day low for me are
going to be huge levels today. How we

220
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
going to be huge levels today. How we
 

221
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,030
going to be huge levels today. How we
act into previous day value area low and

222
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
act into previous day value area low and
 

223
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,470
act into previous day value area low and
previous day low. Right, we're currently

224
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
previous day low. Right, we're currently
 

225
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,910
previous day low. Right, we're currently
trading at sort of previous day low. If

226
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
trading at sort of previous day low. If
 

227
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,910
trading at sort of previous day low. If
we reclaim that and they want to get a

228
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
we reclaim that and they want to get a
 

229
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,310
we reclaim that and they want to get a
little short squeeze on, then how we act

230
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
little short squeeze on, then how we act
 

231
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,110
little short squeeze on, then how we act
here is going to be important. Can we

232
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
here is going to be important. Can we
 

233
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,389
here is going to be important. Can we
reject this kind of area for that trade

234
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
reject this kind of area for that trade
 

235
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,910
reject this kind of area for that trade
back downside? Now, if we have a look at

236
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
back downside? Now, if we have a look at
 

237
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,030
back downside? Now, if we have a look at
the volume uh profile built in yesterday

238
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
the volume uh profile built in yesterday
 

239
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,509
the volume uh profile built in yesterday
after

240
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
after
 

241
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,629
after
we're just going to have to do it from

242
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
we're just going to have to do it from
 

243
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,870
we're just going to have to do it from
9:00,

244
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
9:00,
 

245
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,190
9:00,
we're on an hourly chart. All right,

246
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
we're on an hourly chart. All right,
 

247
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,670
we're on an hourly chart. All right,
we've got a bit of a bit of a a move

248
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
we've got a bit of a bit of a a move
 

249
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,470
we've got a bit of a bit of a a move
here. 950s up to up to 25,5.

250
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
here. 950s up to up to 25,5.
 

251
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,509
here. 950s up to up to 25,5.
So, that kind of level

252
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
So, that kind of level
 

253
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,768
So, that kind of level
we're going to have to be careful of.

254
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:22,778
we're going to have to be careful of.
 

255
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:24,550
we're going to have to be careful of.
[snorts] All right. So watching to see

256
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
[snorts] All right. So watching to see
 

257
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,470
[snorts] All right. So watching to see
if they do that this morning. So

258
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
if they do that this morning. So
 

259
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,150
if they do that this morning. So
potentially there's a squeeze out to

260
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
potentially there's a squeeze out to
 

261
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,990
potentially there's a squeeze out to
there. I'm going to focus on the shorts,

262
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
there. I'm going to focus on the shorts,
 

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,430
there. I'm going to focus on the shorts,
right? I want to see if we come into

264
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
right? I want to see if we come into
 

265
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,710
right? I want to see if we come into
here. Do we fail for that rotation?

266
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
here. Do we fail for that rotation?
 

267
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,710
here. Do we fail for that rotation?
If we reclaim, all right, this is going

268
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
If we reclaim, all right, this is going
 

269
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,790
If we reclaim, all right, this is going
to be like yesterday. If shorts get a

270
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
to be like yesterday. If shorts get a
 

271
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,470
to be like yesterday. If shorts get a
squeeze up here and they build and

272
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
squeeze up here and they build and
 

273
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,470
squeeze up here and they build and
reclaim previous day value low, then

274
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
reclaim previous day value low, then
 

275
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,670
reclaim previous day value low, then
that rotation back upside is very, very

276
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
that rotation back upside is very, very
 

277
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,350
that rotation back upside is very, very
possible all the way back to previous

278
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
possible all the way back to previous
 

279
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,870
possible all the way back to previous
day value area high, previous day point

280
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
day value area high, previous day point
 

281
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,470
day value area high, previous day point
of control. Can't rule that out on a

282
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
of control. Can't rule that out on a
 

283
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,629
of control. Can't rule that out on a
squeeze back up. Okay. So, that would be

284
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
squeeze back up. Okay. So, that would be
 

285
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,990
squeeze back up. Okay. So, that would be
your rotation. If you're someone that's

286
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
your rotation. If you're someone that's
 

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,230
your rotation. If you're someone that's
looking to play rotation, that will be

288
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
looking to play rotation, that will be
 

289
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,350
looking to play rotation, that will be
it. If they do that, what else can we

290
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
it. If they do that, what else can we
 

291
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,590
it. If they do that, what else can we
think about? Well, break out of the loan

292
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
think about? Well, break out of the loan
 

293
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,870
think about? Well, break out of the loan
and fail breakout of the low. I don't I

294
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
and fail breakout of the low. I don't I
 

295
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,310
and fail breakout of the low. I don't I
don't really want to be looking for a

296
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
don't really want to be looking for a
 

297
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,990
don't really want to be looking for a
new short down here. It might well play

298
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
new short down here. It might well play
 

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,150
new short down here. It might well play
out, but the danger is you've got that

300
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
out, but the danger is you've got that
 

301
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,230
out, but the danger is you've got that
lower Ballinger band here, and you can

302
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
lower Ballinger band here, and you can
 

303
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,230
lower Ballinger band here, and you can
have a look below, fail, reclaim, and

304
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
have a look below, fail, reclaim, and
 

305
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,069
have a look below, fail, reclaim, and
upside we go. So, if you're looking for

306
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
upside we go. So, if you're looking for
 

307
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,710
upside we go. So, if you're looking for
a long trigger, you'd want to see a look

308
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
a long trigger, you'd want to see a look
 

309
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,069
a long trigger, you'd want to see a look
below and a fail and a reclaim. Ideally,

310
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
below and a fail and a reclaim. Ideally,
 

311
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,389
below and a fail and a reclaim. Ideally,
a previous day low and ideally up here.

312
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
a previous day low and ideally up here.
 

313
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,069
a previous day low and ideally up here.
Really, that's where it's a safer bet.

314
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
Really, that's where it's a safer bet.
 

315
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,750
Really, that's where it's a safer bet.
So,

316
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
So,
 

317
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,550
So,
location is really less than ideal. If

318
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
location is really less than ideal. If
 

319
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,670
location is really less than ideal. If
we zoom in here, this is our overnight

320
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
we zoom in here, this is our overnight
 

321
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,190
we zoom in here, this is our overnight
kind of rotation. You can see we built

322
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
kind of rotation. You can see we built
 

323
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,310
kind of rotation. You can see we built
out lots of volume here. All right. Lots

324
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
out lots of volume here. All right. Lots
 

325
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,430
out lots of volume here. All right. Lots
and lots of volume built out here. We

326
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
and lots of volume built out here. We
 

327
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,310
and lots of volume built out here. We
have to uh note this. hanging out here a

328
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
have to uh note this. hanging out here a
 

329
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,949
have to uh note this. hanging out here a
long time.

330
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
long time.
 

331
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,190
long time.
All right, that is a bit of a shelf. All

332
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,200
All right, that is a bit of a shelf. All
 

333
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,870
All right, that is a bit of a shelf. All
right, so I'd be watching this kind of

334
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
right, so I'd be watching this kind of
 

335
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,790
right, so I'd be watching this kind of
level at the open, under, over. Do we

336
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
level at the open, under, over. Do we
 

337
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,310
level at the open, under, over. Do we
get over it and base above it for a

338
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
get over it and base above it for a
 

339
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,870
get over it and base above it for a
squeeze up? Do we fail under it? Retest

340
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
squeeze up? Do we fail under it? Retest
 

341
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,350
squeeze up? Do we fail under it? Retest
it, stay heavy for a wash of those lows.

342
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
it, stay heavy for a wash of those lows.
 

343
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,189
it, stay heavy for a wash of those lows.
Overall, we are bearish. There is

344
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
Overall, we are bearish. There is
 

345
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,030
Overall, we are bearish. There is
absolutely no doubt about it. Like I

346
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
absolutely no doubt about it. Like I
 

347
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,629
absolutely no doubt about it. Like I
said, I think the edge has been with

348
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
said, I think the edge has been with
 

349
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,389
said, I think the edge has been with
bears. The newsletter quite clearly

350
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
bears. The newsletter quite clearly
 

351
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,470
bears. The newsletter quite clearly
states the edge is with bears. These are

352
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
states the edge is with bears. These are
 

353
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,389
states the edge is with bears. These are
lower lows and lower highs. But we can

354
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
lower lows and lower highs. But we can
 

355
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,790
lower lows and lower highs. But we can
get rallies which are resold into. So,

356
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
get rallies which are resold into. So,
 

357
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,550
get rallies which are resold into. So,
if we get too many shorts at the low and

358
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
if we get too many shorts at the low and
 

359
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,910
if we get too many shorts at the low and
they don't break down, that's when they

360
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
they don't break down, that's when they
 

361
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,350
they don't break down, that's when they
get stuck. And that's what you have to

362
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
get stuck. And that's what you have to
 

363
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,030
get stuck. And that's what you have to
be aware of in these markets, especially

364
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
be aware of in these markets, especially
 

365
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,870
be aware of in these markets, especially
when we're opening up near lows, just to

366
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
when we're opening up near lows, just to
 

367
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,189
when we're opening up near lows, just to
make it extra hard for us when they do

368
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
make it extra hard for us when they do
 

369
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,110
make it extra hard for us when they do
that. Right, moving up the time frames.

370
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
that. Right, moving up the time frames.
 

371
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,389
that. Right, moving up the time frames.

471
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,870
frighteningly dangerous right now,
folks. We have elevated levels on the

472
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
folks. We have elevated levels on the
 

473
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,990
folks. We have elevated levels on the
VIX for a sustained period of time and

474
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
VIX for a sustained period of time and
 

475
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,150
VIX for a sustained period of time and
we're putting in higher highs and higher

476
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
we're putting in higher highs and higher
 

477
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,030
we're putting in higher highs and higher
lows and we've got a clear level up here

478
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
lows and we've got a clear level up here
 

479
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,710
lows and we've got a clear level up here
that's going to break out or look for if

480
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
that's going to break out or look for if
 

481
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,389
that's going to break out or look for if
it can sustain this bid through this

482
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
it can sustain this bid through this
 

483
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,189
it can sustain this bid through this
supply zone. So I am very very cautious

484
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
supply zone. So I am very very cautious
 

485
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,030
supply zone. So I am very very cautious
right now. The volatility is high. Do

486
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
right now. The volatility is high. Do
 

487
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,949
right now. The volatility is high. Do
not be surprised to see 100 point candle

488
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
not be surprised to see 100 point candle
 

489
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,790
not be surprised to see 100 point candle
moves. And I'm not joking. I'm very very

490
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
moves. And I'm not joking. I'm very very
 

491
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,790
moves. And I'm not joking. I'm very very
serious. Right. So if we break through

492
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
serious. Right. So if we break through
 

493
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,430
serious. Right. So if we break through
here, next job is a spike like this up

494
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
here, next job is a spike like this up

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
absolutely slammed now as well. So I'd
 

619
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,270
absolutely slammed now as well. So I'd
be watching previous day low here on

620
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
be watching previous day low here on
 

621
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,190
be watching previous day low here on
Nvidia. This uh is it previous day low

622
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
Nvidia. This uh is it previous day low
 

623
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,310
Nvidia. This uh is it previous day low
or is it Friday? I'll be watching

624
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
or is it Friday? I'll be watching
 

625
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,070
or is it Friday? I'll be watching
Friday's low. If Friday's low starts

626
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
Friday's low. If Friday's low starts
 

627
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,549
Friday's low. If Friday's low starts
breaking, you're going to see um this

628
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
breaking, you're going to see um this
 

629
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,390
breaking, you're going to see um this
market really start to let go. So we can

630
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
market really start to let go. So we can
 

631
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:44,950
market really start to let go. So we can
even set a price alert in here.

632
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960

 

633
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,510

set price and ready for it. And Tesla

634
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
set price and ready for it. And Tesla
 

635
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,590
set price and ready for it. And Tesla
that looks uh well slight gap down it

636
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
that looks uh well slight gap down it
 

637
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,430
that looks uh well slight gap down it
looks better than the rest. So market

638
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
looks better than the rest. So market
 

639
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,029
looks better than the rest. So market
opening up very very weak. Um

640
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
opening up very very weak. Um
 

641
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,549
opening up very very weak. Um
it's always tricky when we see this.

642
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
it's always tricky when we see this.
 

643
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,990
it's always tricky when we see this.
Let's just check a couple other names.

644
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
Let's just check a couple other names.
 

645
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,590
Let's just check a couple other names.
Oracle very much like Nvidia. AMD

646
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
Oracle very much like Nvidia. AMD
 

647
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,669
Oracle very much like Nvidia. AMD
following suit like Nvidia back into the

648
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
following suit like Nvidia back into the
 

649
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,830
following suit like Nvidia back into the
lows. So this is always tricky when

650
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
lows. So this is always tricky when
 

651
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,350
lows. So this is always tricky when
we're gapping down this much. When we've

652
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
we're gapping down this much. When we've
 

653
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,350
we're gapping down this much. When we've
got this much fear in the market, these

654
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
got this much fear in the market, these
 

655
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,350
got this much fear in the market, these
are the areas where unfortunately shorts

656
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
are the areas where unfortunately shorts
 

657
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,150
are the areas where unfortunately shorts
can often come flying in a bit late. We

658
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,160
can often come flying in a bit late. We
 

659
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,310
can often come flying in a bit late. We
don't have prime position and so we have

660
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
don't have prime position and so we have
 

661
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,190
don't have prime position and so we have
to be a little bit careful

662
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
to be a little bit careful
 

663
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,830
to be a little bit careful
about how we operate in the open. Not a

664
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
about how we operate in the open. Not a
 

665
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,870
about how we operate in the open. Not a
bad day to just let it um figure out

666
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
bad day to just let it um figure out
 

667
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,510
bad day to just let it um figure out
what it is it wants to do

668
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
what it is it wants to do
 

669
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,950
what it is it wants to do
and go from there. I'm not going to get

sort of dense area, this gray box that
 

739
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,669
sort of dense area, this gray box that
we've uh

740
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
we've uh
 

741
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,990
we've uh
been trading in all night, right, this

742
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
been trading in all night, right, this
 

743
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,270
been trading in all night, right, this
is the thickest area that we've been

744
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
is the thickest area that we've been
 

745
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,549
is the thickest area that we've been

Let this develop for a second.

748
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440

 

749
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,590

Okay. So, up to the lower time frame al

750
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
Okay. So, up to the lower time frame al
 

751
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,909
Okay. So, up to the lower time frame al
goes

752
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
goes
 

753
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,230
goes
through our PDL. Is that right? I just

754
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
through our PDL. Is that right? I just
 

755
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,549
through our PDL. Is that right? I just
want to make sure that's correct.

756
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
want to make sure that's correct.
 

757
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,950
want to make sure that's correct.
Yes.

758
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
Yes.
 

759
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,110
Yes.

Long, long way away. It's crazy, isn't

768
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
Long, long way away. It's crazy, isn't
 

769
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,270
Long, long way away. It's crazy, isn't
it? Getting stuck here in this thick

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
it? Getting stuck here in this thick
 

771
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,669
it? Getting stuck here in this thick
volume already. It's pretty scary. And

772
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
volume already. It's pretty scary. And
 

773
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,750

So they're trying to get a bid on that
 

845
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,070
So they're trying to get a bid on that
600. That is the put wall that we talked

846
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
600. That is the put wall that we talked
 

847
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,310
600. That is the put wall that we talked
about. They came right into it at 600.

848
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
about. They came right into it at 600.
 

849

852
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
Wow. All right. So there's Mr. Put
 

853
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,990
Wow. All right. So there's Mr. Put
saying you're not going lower. This is

854
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
saying you're not going lower. This is
 

855
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,350
saying you're not going lower. This is
why we don't short the lows because

856
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
why we don't short the lows because
 

857
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,909
why we don't short the lows because
we've lost location. Straight up we go.

858
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
we've lost location. Straight up we go.
 

859
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,789
we've lost location. Straight up we go.

00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
That put wall huge. All right. And like
 

861
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,470
That put wall huge. All right. And like
I said, don't be surprised to see 100

862
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
I said, don't be surprised to see 100
 

863
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,390
I said, don't be surprised to see 100
plus point candles with this volatility.

864
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
plus point candles with this volatility.
 

865
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,909
plus point candles with this volatility.
And there you go. There's your 100 plus

866
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
And there you go. There's your 100 plus
 

867
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,669
And there you go. There's your 100 plus
point M1 candle that happened in a

868
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
point M1 candle that happened in a
 

869
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,549
point M1 candle that happened in a
matter of seconds. Okay, I know that

870
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
matter of seconds. Okay, I know that
 

871
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,390
matter of seconds. Okay, I know that
this is likely to happen because of the

872
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
this is likely to happen because of the
 

873
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,070
this is likely to happen because of the
VIX. This is why it's very, very

874
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
VIX. This is why it's very, very
 

875
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,830
VIX. This is why it's very, very
dangerous to be trading like this at the

876
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:31,840
dangerous to be trading like this at the
 

877
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,430
dangerous to be trading like this at the
moment. Let's just see. Let it settle

878
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
moment. Let's just see. Let it settle
 

879
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,269
moment. Let's just see. Let it settle
down.

880
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
down.
 

881
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,110
down.
So this put wall, this blue box is

882
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
So this put wall, this blue box is
 

883
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,070
So this put wall, this blue box is
basically your put wall on QQQ and we

884
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
basically your put wall on QQQ and we
 

885
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,669
basically your put wall on QQQ and we
just bid right off it. They are not

886
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
just bid right off it. They are not
 

887
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,269
just bid right off it. They are not
willing to let price come below that.

888
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
willing to let price come below that.
 

889
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,590
willing to let price come below that.
Remember, it's OPEX this week as well.

890
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
Remember, it's OPEX this week as well.
 

891
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,430
Remember, it's OPEX this week as well.
That is a big reaction off that put

892
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
That is a big reaction off that put
 

893
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,870
That is a big reaction off that put
wall. And it's also reclaiming previous

894
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
wall. And it's also reclaiming previous
 

895
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,950
wall. And it's also reclaiming previous
day low and it's also not allowing it.

896
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
day low and it's also not allowing it.
 

897
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,470
day low and it's also not allowing it.
I'm just going to double check this to

898
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
I'm just going to double check this to
 

899
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,230
I'm just going to double check this to
drift under. What was that low there?

900
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
drift under. What was that low there?
 

901
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,750
drift under. What was that low there?
75. What was our low on here? That's the

902
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
75. What was our low on here? That's the
 

903
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,590
75. What was our low on here? That's the
lower Ballinger band. All right. Put

904
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
lower Ballinger band. All right. Put
 

905
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,710
lower Ballinger band. All right. Put
also at that lower Ballinger band. Same

906
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
also at that lower Ballinger band. Same
 

907
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,029
also at that lower Ballinger band. Same
Peter just just sat sat waiting because

908
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
Peter just just sat sat waiting because
 

909
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,430
Peter just just sat sat waiting because
I know we've lost location. I know

910
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
I know we've lost location. I know
 

911
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,870
I know we've lost location. I know
higher time frame wants to move lower,

912
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
higher time frame wants to move lower,
 

913
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,630
higher time frame wants to move lower,
but I also know like we talked about in

914
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
but I also know like we talked about in
 

915
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,870
but I also know like we talked about in
the morning briefing, shorts often get

916
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
the morning briefing, shorts often get
 

917
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,470
the morning briefing, shorts often get
caught at the lows in these markets.

918
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
caught at the lows in these markets.
 

919
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,870
caught at the lows in these markets.
Which is why I don't know how long some

920
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
Which is why I don't know how long some
 

921
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,310
Which is why I don't know how long some
of you have been traded, but if any of

922
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
of you have been traded, but if any of
 

923
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,149
of you have been traded, but if any of
you have traded bare markets before, you

924
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:24,159
you have traded bare markets before, you
 

925
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,070
you have traded bare markets before, you
will know bare market rallies are some

926
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
will know bare market rallies are some
 

927
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,990
will know bare market rallies are some
of the most violent moves that you can

928
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,590
come and revisit this. If they fail
this, maybe they want to come down here.

1086
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,600
this, maybe they want to come down here.
 

1087
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,269
this, maybe they want to come down here.
This is what I'm seeing right now. But

1088
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
This is what I'm seeing right now. But
 

1089
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,029
This is what I'm seeing right now. But
the location is not ideal to look for

1090
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
the location is not ideal to look for
 

1091
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,110
the location is not ideal to look for
that kind of move lower. So, I'm just

1092
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
that kind of move lower. So, I'm just
 

1093
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,470
that kind of move lower. So, I'm just
going to let it develop. If they want to

1094
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
going to let it develop. If they want to
 

1095
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,070
going to let it develop. If they want to
squeeze out, they can squeeze out. Let

1096
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080
squeeze out, they can squeeze out. Let
 

1097
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,750
squeeze out, they can squeeze out. Let
them squeeze out. It's a bit like

1098
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
them squeeze out. It's a bit like
 

1099
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,110
them squeeze out. It's a bit like
yesterday. Those of you trading in the

1100
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
yesterday. Those of you trading in the
 

1101
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,350
yesterday. Those of you trading in the
afternoon, if you're patient enough to

1102
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
afternoon, if you're patient enough to
 

1103
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,710
afternoon, if you're patient enough to
let the squeeze out happen,

1104
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
let the squeeze out happen,
 

1105
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,870
let the squeeze out happen,
this little one here, once they got

1106
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
this little one here, once they got
 

1107
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,789
this little one here, once they got
exhausted, it offered a nice trade back

1108
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
exhausted, it offered a nice trade back
 

1109
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,149
exhausted, it offered a nice trade back
down. So, we can wait for something like

1110
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
down. So, we can wait for something like
 

1111
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,510
down. So, we can wait for something like
that so we can have a better location.

1112
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
that so we can have a better location.
 

1113
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,990
that so we can have a better location.
Let me just see. Not every day, perfect

1114
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
Let me just see. Not every day, perfect
 

1115
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,630
Let me just see. Not every day, perfect
trade day. You might see like huge

1116
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
trade day. You might see like huge
 

1117
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,830
trade day. You might see like huge
candles and think, I could have made

1118
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
candles and think, I could have made
 

1119
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,950
candles and think, I could have made
loads of money, but you got to ask

1120
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
loads of money, but you got to ask
 

1121
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,950
loads of money, but you got to ask
yourself, what's your entry? So far,

1122
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960
yourself, what's your entry? So far,
 

1123
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,190
yourself, what's your entry? So far,
we're protecting this blue box and we're

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,510
we're protecting this blue box and we're
reclaiming gray box. And if they can put

1126
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
reclaiming gray box. And if they can put
 

1127
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,870
reclaiming gray box. And if they can put
a squeeze on, they're going to come from

1128
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
a squeeze on, they're going to come from
 

1129
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,710
a squeeze on, they're going to come from

1133
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,909

you're going to play that, you're

1134
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
you're going to play that, you're
 

1135
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,510
you're going to play that, you're
playing counter trend to the higher time

1136
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
playing counter trend to the higher time
 

1137
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,669
playing counter trend to the higher time
frame, which is why I'm not going to

1138
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
frame, which is why I'm not going to
 

1139
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:43,830

play it.

1140

1141
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,190

Did any of you catch those shorts

1142
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
Did any of you catch those shorts
 

1143
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,870
Did any of you catch those shorts
yesterday for the continuation? I know

1144
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
yesterday for the continuation? I know
 

1145
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,549
yesterday for the continuation? I know
guys in the in my Discord did, but any

1146
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
guys in the in my Discord did, but any
 

1147
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,389
guys in the in my Discord did, but any
of you not in the Discord, did you did

1148
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
of you not in the Discord, did you did
 

1149
00:29:50,399 --> 00:30:01,269
of you not in the Discord, did you did
you get any of it?

1150

1151
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,549

Where's that yield

1152
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
Where's that yield
 

1153
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,149
Where's that yield
falling off a bit actually today?

1154
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:06,159
falling off a bit actually today?
 

1155
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,990
falling off a bit actually today?
Interesting.

1156
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,000

 

1157
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,630

Jack, you got it. Nice.

Nice Jack. Good work. [snorts]

1175
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,310

You're having a hard time g uh doing

1176
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,320
You're having a hard time g uh doing
 

1177
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,310
You're having a hard time g uh doing
what's very hard time gauging momentum

1178
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
what's very hard time gauging momentum
 

1179
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,990
what's very hard time gauging momentum
during GlobeEx. What do I recommend?

1180
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
during GlobeEx. What do I recommend?
 

1181
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,990
during GlobeEx. What do I recommend?
Higher time frame. zoom out and then

1182
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
Higher time frame. zoom out and then
 

1183
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,070
Higher time frame. zoom out and then
look at where the liquidity is. If there

1184
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
look at where the liquidity is. If there
 

1185
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,630
look at where the liquidity is. If there
is if there is no momentum, if it's in a

1186
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
is if there is no momentum, if it's in a
 

1187
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,470
is if there is no momentum, if it's in a
range, then that's probably why while

1188
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
range, then that's probably why while
 

1189
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,990
range, then that's probably why while
you're struggling. Last night, I would

1190
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
you're struggling. Last night, I would
 

1191
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,470
you're struggling. Last night, I would
say we're in downside pressure. The move

1192
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,480
say we're in downside pressure. The move
 

1193
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,630
say we're in downside pressure. The move
was to clean out previous week lows,

1194
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
was to clean out previous week lows,
 

1195
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,430
was to clean out previous week lows,
right? Because we left those on the ENQ

1196
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
right? Because we left those on the ENQ
 

1197
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,190
right? Because we left those on the ENQ
uh in yesterday's session and SPY took

1198
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
uh in yesterday's session and SPY took
 

1199
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,549
uh in yesterday's session and SPY took
them. That was the obvious draw in

1200
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
them. That was the obvious draw in
 

1201
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,070
them. That was the obvious draw in
liquidity. So, that's why we traded down

1202
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,080
liquidity. So, that's why we traded down
 

1203
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,750
liquidity. So, that's why we traded down
to that.

1204
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:39,760
to that.
 

1205
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,549
to that.
And if you watched, I talked about it

1206
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:42,559
And if you watched, I talked about it
 

1207
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,110
And if you watched, I talked about it
yesterday. the treasuries and bond

1208
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
yesterday. the treasuries and bond
 

1209
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,950
yesterday. the treasuries and bond
market in Japan is causing pressure on

1210
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960
market in Japan is causing pressure on
 

1211
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,630
market in Japan is causing pressure on
US equities. It happened again last

1212
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:48,640
US equities. It happened again last
 

1213
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,549
US equities. It happened again last
night. That's what caused once that got

1214
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
night. That's what caused once that got
 

1215
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,029
night. That's what caused once that got
released that caused that that uh

1216
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
released that caused that that uh
 

1217
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,509
released that caused that that uh
cascade, let's call it back down to this

1218
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:55,519
cascade, let's call it back down to this
 

1219
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,110
cascade, let's call it back down to this
New York open. I'd be watching this New

1220
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
New York open. I'd be watching this New
 

1221
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,190
New York open. I'd be watching this New
York open. So far, they're holding this

1222
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
York open. So far, they're holding this
 

1223
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,549
York open. So far, they're holding this
gray box. If they start letting go,

1224
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
gray box. If they start letting go,
 

1225
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,669
gray box. If they start letting go,
we're going to go all the way back down

1226
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
we're going to go all the way back down
 

1227
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,669
we're going to go all the way back down
to these lows. It's not very pretty, but

1228
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
to these lows. It's not very pretty, but
 

1229
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,070
to these lows. It's not very pretty, but
that's uh what's we're looking at. If

1230
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
that's uh what's we're looking at. If
 

1231
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,430
that's uh what's we're looking at. If
shorts get stuck here, trying to force

1232
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
shorts get stuck here, trying to force
 

1233
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,389
shorts get stuck here, trying to force
that, we're going to go right back to

1234
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:08,399
that, we're going to go right back to
 

1235
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,750
that, we're going to go right back to
the highs. It's just midpoint of the

1236
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
the highs. It's just midpoint of the
 

1237
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,630
the highs. It's just midpoint of the
range. And the range is big. 167 points.

1238
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:12,640
range. And the range is big. 167 points.
 

1239
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,870

Apple now the only one red. Only one

1246

Apple now the only one red. Only one
red, only one green. Everything else

red, only one green. Everything else
 

1249
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,830
red, only one green. Everything else
started to sell. So Google had that

1250
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
started to sell. So Google had that
 

1251
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,630
started to sell. So Google had that
morning pop and got sold off.

1252

1253
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,389

Dangerous. This is a very dangerous

00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:34,399
Dangerous. This is a very dangerous
 

1255
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,029
Dangerous. This is a very dangerous
looking market to me. I think both sides

1256
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:37,039
looking market to me. I think both sides
 

1257
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,470
looking market to me. I think both sides
probably trapped here at the moment.

1258
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480
probably trapped here at the moment.
 

1259
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,789
probably trapped here at the moment.
Dangerous looking market. Just let it

1260
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
Dangerous looking market. Just let it
 

1261
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,710
Dangerous looking market. Just let it
develop.

1262
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
develop.
 

1263
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,230

Yeah, that's just overnight. It's the

1264
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
Yeah, that's just overnight. It's the
 

1265
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,070
Yeah, that's just overnight. It's the
thickest level from overnight, that gray

1266
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
thickest level from overnight, that gray
 

1267
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,990
thickest level from overnight, that gray
box, Julian. So, it's where it's traded

1268
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
box, Julian. So, it's where it's traded
 

1269
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,509
box, Julian. So, it's where it's traded
under over basically point of control

1270
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
under over basically point of control
 

1271
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,750
under over basically point of control
from overnight. That's where we've

1272
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
from overnight. That's where we've
 

1273
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,389
from overnight. That's where we've
chopped around, which is also why you've

1274
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
chopped around, which is also why you've
 

1275
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,470
chopped around, which is also why you've
got both flow zones there. You've got

It's telling you, isn't it? We're

1296
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
It's telling you, isn't it? We're
 

1297
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,389
It's telling you, isn't it? We're
condensed in here. This is dangerous in

1298
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:16,399
condensed in here. This is dangerous in
 

1299
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,549
condensed in here. This is dangerous in
here. We need to outside of that range.

1300
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
here. We need to outside of that range.
 

1301
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,669
here. We need to outside of that range.
Otherwise, we're going to go back and

1302
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
Otherwise, we're going to go back and
 

1303
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,870
Otherwise, we're going to go back and
forth and back and forth and back and

forth and back and forth and back and
 

1305
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,190
forth and back and forth and back and

Okay, they're starting to try and take

1308
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:24,880
Okay, they're starting to try and take
 

1309
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,870
Okay, they're starting to try and take
over underneath New York open. Now,

1310
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:30,880

 

1311
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,549

if you start rejecting that box, you

1312
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
if you start rejecting that box, you
 

1313
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,750
if you start rejecting that box, you
might get a move back to the lows.

1314
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
might get a move back to the lows.
 

1315
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,909
might get a move back to the lows.
Remember off these lows we had like a

1316
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:35,919
Remember off these lows we had like a
 

1317
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,750
Remember off these lows we had like a
hund and something point candle. All

1318
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
hund and something point candle. All
 

1319
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,149
hund and something point candle. All
right. Off these lows we had a hund and

1320
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:40,159
right. Off these lows we had a hund and
 

1321
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,389
right. Off these lows we had a hund and
something point candle because this is

1322
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:42,399
something point candle because this is
 

1323
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,710
something point candle because this is
that big put wall that we saw on the

1324
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
that big put wall that we saw on the
 

1325
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,230
that big put wall that we saw on the
Q's.

1326
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
Q's.
 

1327
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,630
Q's.
We are under that level now on QQQ.

1328
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:48,640
We are under that level now on QQQ.
 

1329
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,149
We are under that level now on QQQ.
We're not under that level yet on the

1330
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,159
We're not under that level yet on the
 

1331
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,710
We're not under that level yet on the
spiders. Spiders need to get under 660.

1332
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
spiders. Spiders need to get under 660.
 

1333
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,269
spiders. Spiders need to get under 660.
They're currently trading at 662. Q's

1334
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:55,279
They're currently trading at 662. Q's
 

1335
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,950
They're currently trading at 662. Q's
need to be under uh 600 which they are.

1336
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:58,960
need to be under uh 600 which they are.
 

1337
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,149
need to be under uh 600 which they are.
So I'd be watching this for an

1338
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:00,159
So I'd be watching this for an
 

1339
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,470
So I'd be watching this for an
overunder. Now, just be aware that down

1340
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,480
overunder. Now, just be aware that down
 

1341
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,470
overunder. Now, just be aware that down
in this level is where all those shorts

1342
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
in this level is where all those shorts
 

1343
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,070
in this level is where all those shorts
last time we came down here, this is

1344
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
last time we came down here, this is
 

1345
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,310
last time we came down here, this is
where they all got um well, I don't know

1346
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
where they all got um well, I don't know
 

1347
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,629
where they all got um well, I don't know
what you want to call it. Face ripped.

1348
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
what you want to call it. Face ripped.
 

1349
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,230
what you want to call it. Face ripped.
Face ripped is probably a good word for

1350
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,240
Face ripped is probably a good word for
 

1351
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,030
Face ripped is probably a good word for
it. Back down into these levels.

1352
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,040
it. Back down into these levels.
 

1353
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,069
it. Back down into these levels.
Probably some covering at these lows.

1354
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:18,079
Probably some covering at these lows.
 

1355
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,069
Probably some covering at these lows.
Do they get a breakdown underneath is

1356
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,079
Do they get a breakdown underneath is
 

1357
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,550
Do they get a breakdown underneath is
what they will be looking for. But last

1358
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,560
what they will be looking for. But last
 

1359
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,829
what they will be looking for. But last
time we came down here, they got

1360
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:23,839
time we came down here, they got
 

1361
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,270
time we came down here, they got
nothing, did they?

1362
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,280
nothing, did they?
 

1363
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,310
nothing, did they?
Here

1364
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320

 

1365
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,669

we go. So, they're going to try because

1366
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
we go. So, they're going to try because
 

1367
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,109
we go. So, they're going to try because
we're under the put wall. So, they're

1368
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
we're under the put wall. So, they're
 

1369
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,629
we're under the put wall. So, they're
going to try for expansion. Here you go.

1370
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:34,639
going to try for expansion. Here you go.
 

1371
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,310
going to try for expansion. Here you go.
You're starting to see it now. Oof. Oof.

Oof.
So, GlobeEx down here if they can get it

1376
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079
So, GlobeEx down here if they can get it
 

1377
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,990
So, GlobeEx down here if they can get it
600s. Be very, if you're taking this

1378
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
600s. Be very, if you're taking this
 

1379
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,230
600s. Be very, if you're taking this
short, be very, very careful because

1380
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,240
short, be very, very careful because
 

1381
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,909
short, be very, very careful because
you're short low of day to try and get

1382
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
you're short low of day to try and get
 

1383
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,230
you're short low of day to try and get
down to 600, which is previous week low

1384
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
down to 600, which is previous week low
 

1385
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,829
down to 600, which is previous week low
625. So, all I'm saying is be careful.

1386
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
625. So, all I'm saying is be careful.

Bears are in control for sure. We're

1388
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:54,079
Bears are in control for sure. We're
 

1389
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,629
Bears are in control for sure. We're
underneath the key levels, but spiders

1390
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:56,639
underneath the key levels, but spiders
 

1391
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,310
underneath the key levels, but spiders

are holding up a little bit better than
tech today. So, we are short on the

00:34:59,829 --> 00:34:59,839
tech today. So, we are short on the
 

1395

bid twice last night. Just be aware of
 

1415
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,230
bid twice last night. Just be aware of
that. Twice last night. This is where we

1416
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,240
that. Twice last night. This is where we
 

1417
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,069
that. Twice last night. This is where we

found a bid and this morning around this
 

1419
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,990
found a bid and this morning around this
area. So, we know it's a big area. they

1420
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
area. So, we know it's a big area. they
 

1421
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,550
area. So, we know it's a big area. they
start breaking down under here,

1422
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
start breaking down under here,
 

1423
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,109
start breaking down under here,
then they can get more follow through.

1424
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:55,119
then they can get more follow through.
 

1425
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,430
then they can get more follow through.
But just be careful.

1426
00:35:59,430 --> 00:35:59,440

 

1427
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,630

You've got that previous week low at 25s

1428
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640
You've got that previous week low at 25s
 

1429
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,109
You've got that previous week low at 25s
and then overnight low at 600 and under

1430
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,119
and then overnight low at 600 and under
 

1431
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,950
and then overnight low at 600 and under
there, we're probably going 400s. If

1432
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
there, we're probably going 400s. If
 

1433
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,230
there, we're probably going 400s. If
they're really going to break down under

00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,240
they're really going to break down under
 

1435
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,150
they're really going to break down under
there, that would need an expansion

1436
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,160
there, that would need an expansion
 

1437
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,990
there, that would need an expansion
underneath the daily Ballinger band.

1438
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
underneath the daily Ballinger band.
 

1439

black swan event. It doesn't happen very
 

1443
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,030
black swan event. It doesn't happen very
often when you see that. This is again

00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,040
often when you see that. This is again
 

1445
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,710
often when you see that. This is again
very wiggly in this tape right now.

These moves are no joke. These are big
 

1523
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,710
These moves are no joke. These are big
old moves. What did we just move from

1524
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,720
old moves. What did we just move from
 

1525
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,310
old moves. What did we just move from
three? Another 100 point candle. I said

1526
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,320
three? Another 100 point candle. I said
 

1527
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,349
three? Another 100 point candle. I said
to you at the beginning of today, all

00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:09,359
to you at the beginning of today, all
 

1529
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,430
to you at the beginning of today, all
the time VIX is up here. I can imagine

1530
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,440
the time VIX is up here. I can imagine
 

1531
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,750
the time VIX is up here. I can imagine
100 point candles in M1 candles and we

1532
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
100 point candles in M1 candles and we
 

1533
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:23,030
100 point candles in M1 candles and we
are getting it. We are getting it today.

1534

1535
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,670

So back down to this low.

1536
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
So back down to this low.
 

1537
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,349
So back down to this low.
There is some excess sell on this low

1538
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
There is some excess sell on this low
 

1539
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,270
There is some excess sell on this low
but again this market is bearish

1540
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,280
but again this market is bearish
 

1541
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,950
but again this market is bearish
overall. So you just got to be careful

1542
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
overall. So you just got to be careful
 

1543
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,829
overall. So you just got to be careful
there. There was excess down here. There

1544
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:33,839
there. There was excess down here. There
 

1545
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,589
there. There was excess down here. There
were sellers stuck at these lows down

1546
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:35,599
were sellers stuck at these lows down
 

1547
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,950
were sellers stuck at these lows down
here. So I'd say underneath 57s

1548
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:38,960
here. So I'd say underneath 57s
 

1549
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,630
here. So I'd say underneath 57s
that's all the time we're holding sort

1550
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:40,640
that's all the time we're holding sort
 

1551

that's all the time we're holding sort
of 60s basically buyers are in control

1623
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,950

Okay, back up to edge of profile on the

1624
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
Okay, back up to edge of profile on the
 

1625
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,230
Okay, back up to edge of profile on the
day that we're developing.

1626
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240

 

1627
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,150

Sellers came last came in with size at

00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
Sellers came last came in with size at
 

1629
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,470
Sellers came last came in with size at
680. So 680 is your control level for

1630
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
680. So 680 is your control level for
 

1631
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,109
680. So 680 is your control level for
sellers. If they defend 680s, they're

1632
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
sellers. If they defend 680s, they're
 

1633
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,470
sellers. If they defend 680s, they're
going to look for lower. bull start

1634
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
going to look for lower. bull start
 

1635
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,550
going to look for lower. bull start
reclaiming 680s then a rotation back to

1636
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
reclaiming 680s then a rotation back to
 

1637
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,470
reclaiming 680s then a rotation back to
that New York open is possible. I'd say

1638
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,480
that New York open is possible. I'd say
 

1639
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,390

about being a buyer in this. I'd rather
 

1701
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,230
about being a buyer in this. I'd rather
let it squeeze out and sell it. Look at

1702
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240
let it squeeze out and sell it. Look at
 

1703
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,354
let it squeeze out and sell it. Look at
VIX approaching 2450s now.

Balls got stuck on that last push up

Balls got stuck on that last push up
 

1745
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,470
Balls got stuck on that last push up

00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,040
New lows coming here, folks. Again,
 

1755
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,349
New lows coming here, folks. Again,
so 600. I'd watch spy into this uh 660.

1756
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
so 600. I'd watch spy into this uh 660.
 

1757
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,270
so 600. I'd watch spy into this uh 660.
It's coming in there now. If SPY lets go

1758
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
It's coming in there now. If SPY lets go
 

1759
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,230
It's coming in there now. If SPY lets go
of 660, this market can get real heavy

1760
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,240
of 660, this market can get real heavy
 

1761
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,790
of 660, this market can get real heavy
real quick. And here it is. It's here

1762
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:36,800
real quick. And here it is. It's here
 

1763
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,589
real quick. And here it is. It's here
now. And if it lets go of this, it can

1764
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:39,599
now. And if it lets go of this, it can
 

1765
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,829
now. And if it lets go of this, it can
get real heavy real quick. If it holds

1766
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:41,839
get real heavy real quick. If it holds
 

1767
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,430
get real heavy real quick. If it holds
this, this is where you get those sort

1768
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,440
this, this is where you get those sort
 

1769
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,589
this, this is where you get those sort
of big 100 point squeezes out because

1770
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:45,599
of big 100 point squeezes out because
 

1771
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,270
of big 100 point squeezes out because
this is the put wall on spy and it's

1772
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280
this is the put wall on spy and it's
 

1773
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,589
this is the put wall on spy and it's
starting to let go. It is starting to

1774
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
starting to let go. It is starting to
 

1775
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,069
starting to let go. It is starting to
let go. So it means we've moved from a

1776
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
let go. So it means we've moved from a
 

1777
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,750
let go. So it means we've moved from a
put wall of 672 to 670 to 660. So this

1778
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:55,760
put wall of 672 to 670 to 660. So this
 

1779
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,109
put wall of 672 to 670 to 660. So this
is your overunder on the spiders.

1780
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119

 

1781
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,030

QQQ getting absolutely hammered here. If

1782
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
QQQ getting absolutely hammered here. If
 

1783
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,829
QQQ getting absolutely hammered here. If
I sw I would not be bullish today. I'll

1784
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
I sw I would not be bullish today. I'll
 

1785
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,230
I sw I would not be bullish today. I'll
be looking for bearish moves, but not

1786
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,240
be looking for bearish moves, but not
 

1787
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,829
be looking for bearish moves, but not
giving me something yet that I'm

1788
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:09,839
giving me something yet that I'm
 

1789
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,069
giving me something yet that I'm
interested in. Let's start getting rid

1790
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:12,079
interested in. Let's start getting rid
 

1791
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:19,349
interested in. Let's start getting rid
of this now.

1792
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359

 

1793
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,870

Just one of those I want to be swing

1794
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:20,880
Just one of those I want to be swing
 

1795
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,349
Just one of those I want to be swing
short from last Friday's close. Really,

1796
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
short from last Friday's close. Really,
 

1797
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,550
short from last Friday's close. Really,
that was the position to be short from.

1798
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,560

 

1799
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,190

Hey, Bella, how's it going?

1800
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200

 

1801
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,950

Okay, every pop still being sold into is

1802
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:34,960
Okay, every pop still being sold into is
 

1803
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,589
Okay, every pop still being sold into is
the retest of 600. Same on the spiders.

1804
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:37,599
the retest of 600. Same on the spiders.
 

1805
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,109
the retest of 600. Same on the spiders.
They're still selling every pop here.

1806
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
They're still selling every pop here.
 

1807
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,790
They're still selling every pop here.
This can move lower. Um, but again, you

1808
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:42,800
This can move lower. Um, but again, you
 

1809
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,550
This can move lower. Um, but again, you
want to be careful. Short squeezes can

1810
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:44,560
want to be careful. Short squeezes can
 

1811
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,510
want to be careful. Short squeezes can
push very, very quick in bare markets.

1812
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
push very, very quick in bare markets.
 

1813
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,190
push very, very quick in bare markets.
And then it depends if they get sold

1814
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,200
And then it depends if they get sold
 

1815
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,190
And then it depends if they get sold
into. But that 600 on spy is your

1816
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,200
into. But that 600 on spy is your
 

1817
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,550
into. But that 600 on spy is your
overunder right now. It's trying to

1818
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,560
overunder right now. It's trying to
 

1819
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,950
overunder right now. It's trying to
reclaim it. The 660 on spy is attempting

1820
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,960
reclaim it. The 660 on spy is attempting
 

1821
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,670
reclaim it. The 660 on spy is attempting
to reclaim it. You want to be careful

1822
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:57,680
to reclaim it. You want to be careful
 

1823
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,230
to reclaim it. You want to be careful
here. You want to be very careful here.

1824
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:04,240

 

1825
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,309

This options market taking over. I'm

1826
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:08,319
This options market taking over. I'm
 

1827
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:16,950
This options market taking over. I'm
too scary for me right now.

1828
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:16,960

 

1829
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,349

Big selling down here, folks.

1830
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359

 

1831
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,750

So, spy trying to reclaim that 660 or

1832
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:25,760
So, spy trying to reclaim that 660 or
 

1833
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,309
So, spy trying to reclaim that 660 or
attempting to. So once it breaks away

1834
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:28,319
attempting to. So once it breaks away
 

1835
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,510

from that violently um we go leg down

1836
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520
from that violently um we go leg down
 

1837
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,910
from that violently um we go leg down
basically

1838
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:33,920
basically
 

1839
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:42,309
basically
which might be right here right now.

1840
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,319

 

1841
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,870

660 660 under over under over under

1842
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880
660 660 under over under over under
 

1843
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,550
660 660 under over under over under

1844
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
over. That's what spy is doing. It's
 

1845
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,470

testing under testing over testing under
 

1847
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,349
testing under testing over testing under
testing over. This is the put.

1848
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:53,359

 

1849
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,270

So this is about option dealers at the

1850
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,280
So this is about option dealers at the
 

1851
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,630
So this is about option dealers at the
moment more than anything else. Okay,

1852
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
moment more than anything else. Okay,
 

1853
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,990
moment more than anything else. Okay,
reclaiming spiders 66030 now. So can

1854
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,000

here we go. Another breakdown. So that's

1884
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
here we go. Another breakdown. So that's
 

1885
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,829
here we go. Another breakdown. So that's
by losing that 660. So every pot being

1886
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:37,839
by losing that 660. So every pot being
 

1887
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,190
by losing that 660. So every pot being
sold now. That is clear into this yearly

1888
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
sold now. That is clear into this yearly
 

1889
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,270

level. So if you were short, this is a

1890
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,280
level. So if you were short, this is a
 

1891

my alerts. Nvidia starting to let go of
 

1911
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,109
my alerts. Nvidia starting to let go of
that 180 kind of level or coming into

Right. Nvidia trying to react off that

1966
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:38,079
Right. Nvidia trying to react off that
 

1967
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,950
Right. Nvidia trying to react off that
sort of 18060. It is finding a bit of a

1968
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:40,960
sort of 18060. It is finding a bit of a
 

1969
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,349
sort of 18060. It is finding a bit of a
bounce here after taking some liquidity.

1970
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
bounce here after taking some liquidity.
 

1971
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,190
bounce here after taking some liquidity.
And just be careful. Like I said, even

1972
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,200
And just be careful. Like I said, even
 

1973
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,510
And just be careful. Like I said, even
in bare markets, the bare rallies, the

1974
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:47,520
in bare markets, the bare rallies, the
 

1975
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,750
in bare markets, the bare rallies, the
uh short squeezes can be very, very,

1976
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:49,760
uh short squeezes can be very, very,
 

1977
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,510
uh short squeezes can be very, very,
very violent. I've made that very clear

1978
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:51,520
very violent. I've made that very clear
 

1979
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,750
very violent. I've made that very clear
today. I'm focused on the shorts until

1980
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:53,760
today. I'm focused on the shorts until
 

1981
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,230
today. I'm focused on the shorts until
we reclaim some big big key levels,

1982
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:56,240
we reclaim some big big key levels,
 

1983
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,470
we reclaim some big big key levels,
which I'm not seeing, but the rallies

1984
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
which I'm not seeing, but the rallies
 

1985
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:06,309
which I'm not seeing, but the rallies
can be aggressive.

1986
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319

 

1987
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,829

last chance saloon. And you see this
 

2007
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,829
last chance saloon. And you see this
little bump right here. This is it. They

2008
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
little bump right here. This is it. They
 

2009
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,990
little bump right here. This is it. They
don't hold this. Look how thin we are.

2010
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:36,000
don't hold this. Look how thin we are.
 

2011
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,270
don't hold this. Look how thin we are.
Right? So, they could do a look below

2012
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:37,280
Right? So, they could do a look below
 

2013
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,270
Right? So, they could do a look below
and fail, but if not, or we're coming

2014
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,280
and fail, but if not, or we're coming
 

2015
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,430
and fail, but if not, or we're coming
right down to 24,000, right? There's a

2016
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:41,440
right down to 24,000, right? There's a
 

2017
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,829
right down to 24,000, right? There's a
500 point thin liquidity in here. Right?

2018
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:45,839
500 point thin liquidity in here. Right?
 

2019
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,589
500 point thin liquidity in here. Right?
So, this is like sort of the last edge,

2020
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
So, this is like sort of the last edge,
 

2021
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:54,150
So, this is like sort of the last edge,
the green box that we had on our chart.

2023

It's the edge of volume. They don't hold

2024
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
It's the edge of volume. They don't hold
 

2025
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:07,784
It's the edge of volume. They don't hold
that. 24,000 is on deck.

2322
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:10,319
structure or anything like that yet. But
 

2323
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,870
structure or anything like that yet. But
into this blue box, there's an area of

2324
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:12,880
into this blue box, there's an area of
 

2325
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,390
into this blue box, there's an area of
interest. They might want to defend it.

2326
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:14,400
interest. They might want to defend it.
 

2327
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,870
interest. They might want to defend it.
Let's see what they do with this.

2328
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880
Let's see what they do with this.
 

2329
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,390
Let's see what they do with this.
Watching this 25 thou 25,000 24,500.

2330
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:22,400

 

2331
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,630

Can they squeeze right through that and

2332
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:24,640
Can they squeeze right through that and
 

2333
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,549
Can they squeeze right through that and
come back to some level of interest all

2334
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:26,559
come back to some level of interest all
 

2335
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,789
come back to some level of interest all
the way up here? Really

2336
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:28,799
the way up here? Really
 

2337
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,710
the way up here? Really
developing a bit. See, we're thin in

2338
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
developing a bit. See, we're thin in
 

2339
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,470
developing a bit. See, we're thin in
here. So if they get through this 40

2340
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,480
here. So if they get through this 40
 

2341
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,109
here. So if they get through this 40
540s is possible and above. Here you go.

2342
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:35,119
540s is possible and above. Here you go.
 

2343
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,230
540s is possible and above. Here you go.
So here's the start of the squeeze.

2344
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,240
So here's the start of the squeeze.
 

2345
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,589
So here's the start of the squeeze.
Those sellers got stuck like I just

2346
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
Those sellers got stuck like I just
 

2347
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,470
Those sellers got stuck like I just
talked about. So here's the 500. 40 is

2348
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
talked about. So here's the 500. 40 is
 

2349
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,510
talked about. So here's the 500. 40 is
possible. Through that we go reclaims.

2350
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,520
possible. Through that we go reclaims.
 

2351
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,150
possible. Through that we go reclaims.
So bears will want to defend between 40

2352
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:46,160
So bears will want to defend between 40
 

2353
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,150
So bears will want to defend between 40
and it's 60 point range. They'll want to

and it's 60 point range. They'll want to
 

2355
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,670
and it's 60 point range. They'll want to
defend this range up here. This gray

2356
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,680
defend this range up here. This gray
 

2357
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,190

can't get the uh numbers out cuz they're

2370
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:07,839
can't get the uh numbers out cuz they're
 

2371
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,150
can't get the uh numbers out cuz they're
so moving so quick. And then 40 would be

2372
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,160
so moving so quick. And then 40 would be
 

2373
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,990
so moving so quick. And then 40 would be
the retest and then through 40 to the

2374
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,000
the retest and then through 40 to the
 

2375
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,109
the retest and then through 40 to the
other side of that pocket. And uh you're

2376
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
other side of that pocket. And uh you're
 

2377
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,870

00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
some profits between now and 40s and
 

2385
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,430
some profits between now and 40s and
then just holding runners.

2386
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440

 

2387
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,309

The push towards 40s. This is a big
test. If they get through this, they can

2396
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:39,040
test. If they get through this, they can
 

2397
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,789
test. If they get through this, they can
squeeze to the other side of this box.

00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:03,920
this now? What's the other side of this
 

2417
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,230
this now? What's the other side of this
600?

2418
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,240

00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,480
up now. Locking more in here at 40.
 

2425
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,589
up now. Locking more in here at 40.
Starting to see some sellers try and

2426
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:13,599
Starting to see some sellers try and
 

2427
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,470
Starting to see some sellers try and
defend.

2428
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:16,480
defend.
 

2429
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,549
defend.
There we go. So, into 40s. This was the

2430
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:18,559
There we go. So, into 40s. This was the
 

2431
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,630
There we go. So, into 40s. This was the
trade. I know I said I wasn't going to

2432
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,640
trade. I know I said I wasn't going to
 

2433
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,710
trade. I know I said I wasn't going to
take it, but I did. Once we reclaim this

2434
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:22,720
take it, but I did. Once we reclaim this
 

2435
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,589
take it, but I did. Once we reclaim this
shelf, that's the move there. locked in

2436
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599
shelf, that's the move there. locked in
 

2437
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,630
shelf, that's the move there. locked in
$1,500 on that. Nice. And they're

2438
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:28,640
$1,500 on that. Nice. And they're
 

2439
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,309
$1,500 on that. Nice. And they're
defending the 40s. All right. So, if we

2440
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:30,319
defending the 40s. All right. So, if we
 

2441
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,390
defending the 40s. All right. So, if we
get through 40s, the rotation now can

2442
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,400
get through 40s, the rotation now can
 

2443
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,230
get through 40s, the rotation now can
happen. So, sellers will want to defend

2444
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:34,240
happen. So, sellers will want to defend
 

2445
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,470
happen. So, sellers will want to defend
this for this move back down to here. If

2446
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:36,480
this for this move back down to here. If
 

2447
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,710
this for this move back down to here. If
bulls get back through this, we develop.

2448
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:38,720
bulls get back through this, we develop.
 

2449
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,710
bulls get back through this, we develop.
Sellers need to defend this box. If not,

2450
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:40,720
Sellers need to defend this box. If not,
 

2451
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,069
Sellers need to defend this box. If not,
we're going to get a relief rally

2452
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:42,079
we're going to get a relief rally
 

2453
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,950
we're going to get a relief rally
upside. But sellers, your main trend is

2454
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:44,960
upside. But sellers, your main trend is
 

2455
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,870
upside. But sellers, your main trend is
down. Sellers will want to defend this

2456
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:46,880
down. Sellers will want to defend this
 

2457
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,109
down. Sellers will want to defend this
box, right? They will want to do this or

2458
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:49,119
box, right? They will want to do this or
 

2459
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,710
box, right? They will want to do this or
this. They will not want to see price

2460
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
this. They will not want to see price
 

2461
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,990
this. They will not want to see price
come back through there. That would be a

2462
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
come back through there. That would be a
 

2463
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,870
come back through there. That would be a
look below GlobeEx and a reclaim, which

2464
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:54,880
look below GlobeEx and a reclaim, which
 

2465
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:07,510
look below GlobeEx and a reclaim, which
is what you're starting to see now.

2466
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:07,520

 

2467
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,990

You can set price alerts again for SPY

2468
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:10,000
You can set price alerts again for SPY
 

2469
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,710
You can set price alerts again for SPY
660 because we traded under it. You can

2470
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
660 because we traded under it. You can
 

2471
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,030
660 because we traded under it. You can
set price alerts for that re reppush

2472
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:15,040
set price alerts for that re reppush
 

2473
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,109
set price alerts for that re reppush
into it. You're about a dollar away at

2474
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:17,119
into it. You're about a dollar away at
 

2475
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,750
into it. You're about a dollar away at
the moment, just over. So, as long as if

2476
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:19,760
the moment, just over. So, as long as if
 

2477
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,109
the moment, just over. So, as long as if
you took this long, I know I said I

2478
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:21,119
you took this long, I know I said I
 

2479
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,150
you took this long, I know I said I
wasn't going to, but it was just too

2480
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:22,160
wasn't going to, but it was just too
 

2481
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,549
wasn't going to, but it was just too
obvious. I had to take it. Blue box. And

2482
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559
obvious. I had to take it. Blue box. And
 

2483
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,750
obvious. I had to take it. Blue box. And
remember, this was all planned

2484
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,760
remember, this was all planned
 

2485
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,069
remember, this was all planned
pre-market. Back to here. Pay yourself.

2486
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:28,079
pre-market. Back to here. Pay yourself.
 

2487
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,510
pre-market. Back to here. Pay yourself.
Now, if you get very lucky, you squeeze

2488
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:29,520
Now, if you get very lucky, you squeeze
 

2489
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,510
Now, if you get very lucky, you squeeze
out, but your main trend is down, right?

2490
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:31,520
out, but your main trend is down, right?
 

2491
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,109
out, but your main trend is down, right?
Your main trend is down. You want to

2492
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:33,119
Your main trend is down. You want to
 

2493
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,789
Your main trend is down. You want to
really be focused on the shorts where

2494
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:34,799
really be focused on the shorts where
 

2495
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,710
really be focused on the shorts where
possible.

2496
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,720
possible.
 

2497
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,670
possible.
So, VIX trading back downside or pulling

2498
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:39,680
So, VIX trading back downside or pulling
 

2499
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:47,829
So, VIX trading back downside or pulling
back I should say off the high of 2571.

2500
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:47,839

 

2501
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,750

Okay. Bears currently defending this

2502
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:49,760
Okay. Bears currently defending this
 

2503
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,829
Okay. Bears currently defending this
gray box like we talked about. This is a

2504
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:51,839
gray box like we talked about. This is a
 

2505
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,390
gray box like we talked about. This is a
big volume shelf here.

2506
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
big volume shelf here.
 

2507
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,030
big volume shelf here.
I'll tell you where bears got stuck at

2508
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:57,040
I'll tell you where bears got stuck at
 

2509
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,870
I'll tell you where bears got stuck at
those lows.

2510
01:00:58,870 --> 01:00:58,880
those lows.
 

2511
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,349
those lows.
24460.

2512
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
24460.
 

2513
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,870
24460.
All right. And then at the very low

2514
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:02,880
All right. And then at the very low
 

2515
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,870
All right. And then at the very low
2436, but I'd say any hold of 24. So,

2516
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:06,880
2436, but I'd say any hold of 24. So,
 

2517
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,630
2436, but I'd say any hold of 24. So,
let's just call 480. Any any hold of 480

2518
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:10,640
let's just call 480. Any any hold of 480
 

2519
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,190
let's just call 480. Any any hold of 480
can be your first higher low. Bulls, if

2520
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:13,200
can be your first higher low. Bulls, if
 

2521
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,390
can be your first higher low. Bulls, if
they want a squeeze, they're going to

2522
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,400
they want a squeeze, they're going to
 

2523
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,950
they want a squeeze, they're going to
need to hold 480 or above. that that's

2524
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:16,960
need to hold 480 or above. that that's
 

2525
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,710
need to hold 480 or above. that that's
the level they have to hold 480 or

2526
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:18,720
the level they have to hold 480 or
 

2527
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,710
the level they have to hold 480 or
above. I'm doing that based on what I'm

2528
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:20,720
above. I'm doing that based on what I'm
 

2529
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,870
above. I'm doing that based on what I'm
seeing on the tape. Okay, 480 or above

2530
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:22,880
seeing on the tape. Okay, 480 or above
 

2531
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,150
seeing on the tape. Okay, 480 or above
if they're going to do a higher low. But

2532
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:24,160
if they're going to do a higher low. But
 

2533
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,910
if they're going to do a higher low. But
remember, the main trend is lower. The

2534
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
remember, the main trend is lower. The
 

2535
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,069
remember, the main trend is lower. The
easier moves overall are bearish in

2536
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:28,079
easier moves overall are bearish in
 

2537
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,150
easier moves overall are bearish in
these market. It is not the easier moves

2538
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
these market. It is not the easier moves
 

2539
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,150
these market. It is not the easier moves
are not bullish.

2540
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
are not bullish.
 

2541
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,390
are not bullish.
This is just a little covering rally, a

2542
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:34,400
This is just a little covering rally, a
 

2543
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,549
This is just a little covering rally, a
little squeeze out after quite a

2544
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:36,559
little squeeze out after quite a
 

2545
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,670
little squeeze out after quite a
significant dump. And uh what's the

2546
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:39,680
significant dump. And uh what's the
 

2547
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,630
significant dump. And uh what's the
range now on the day? Just a casual 402

2548
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:42,640
range now on the day? Just a casual 402
 

2549
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:53,670
range now on the day? Just a casual 402
points. Nothing to see here, folks.

2550
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,680

 

2551
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,990

Okay, ball's taking control, squeezing.

2552
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:56,000
Okay, ball's taking control, squeezing.
 

2553
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,150
Okay, ball's taking control, squeezing.
So, here's the gray box. I'd be watching

2554
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,160
So, here's the gray box. I'd be watching
 

2555
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,109
So, here's the gray box. I'd be watching
VWAP now. So, if you're still in this

2556
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:01,119
VWAP now. So, if you're still in this
 

2557
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,910
VWAP now. So, if you're still in this
long through the 40s, top of the gray

2558
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:03,920
long through the 40s, top of the gray
 

2559
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,390
long through the 40s, top of the gray
box, 600 and VWOP, that's your next TP.

2560
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
box, 600 and VWOP, that's your next TP.
 

2561
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,670
box, 600 and VWOP, that's your next TP.
And if you get really lucky, we go

2562
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,680
And if you get really lucky, we go
 

2563
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,950
And if you get really lucky, we go
further. But just remember, this is a

2564
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:08,960
further. But just remember, this is a
 

2565
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,109
further. But just remember, this is a
short squeeze. Nothing more than that is

2566
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:11,119
short squeeze. Nothing more than that is
 

2567
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,190
short squeeze. Nothing more than that is
a squeeze out after a big big big

2568
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,200
a squeeze out after a big big big
 

2569
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,069
a squeeze out after a big big big
sell-off. gray box is somewhere I'd

2570
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
sell-off. gray box is somewhere I'd
 

2571
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,510
sell-off. gray box is somewhere I'd
normally be interested in shorting. I

2572
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:17,520
normally be interested in shorting. I
 

2573
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,150
normally be interested in shorting. I
just want to like let it uh sort of

2574
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,160
just want to like let it uh sort of
 

2575
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,390
just want to like let it uh sort of
shake out for a minute.

2576
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:24,400

 

2577
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,789

And the bulls will want to def defend

2578
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:26,799
And the bulls will want to def defend
 

2579
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,069
And the bulls will want to def defend
480s. It will not want it below 480s.

2580
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:30,079
480s. It will not want it below 480s.
 

2581
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,990
480s. It will not want it below 480s.
Under 480s, we will probably make a new

2582
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
Under 480s, we will probably make a new
 

2583
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,470
Under 480s, we will probably make a new
low

2584
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
low
 

2585
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,309
low
is why you got to understand when you

2586
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:36,319
is why you got to understand when you
 

2587
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,950
is why you got to understand when you
take that long, it's just a counter

2588
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
take that long, it's just a counter
 

2589
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,950
take that long, it's just a counter
trend squeeze. That's all it is. And

2590
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
trend squeeze. That's all it is. And
 

2591
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,789
trend squeeze. That's all it is. And
that was a short trigger on the flow

2592
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:42,799
that was a short trigger on the flow
 

2593
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,670
that was a short trigger on the flow
zones. and point of control and the

2594
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
zones. and point of control and the
 

2595
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,510
zones. and point of control and the
volume shelf. Okay, here's a move back

2596
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:47,520
volume shelf. Okay, here's a move back
 

2597
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,230
volume shelf. Okay, here's a move back
down to 500. So 480 is the key level.

2598
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:50,240
down to 500. So 480 is the key level.
 

2599
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,750
down to 500. So 480 is the key level.
That's your over under. If bulls don't

2600
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:51,760
That's your over under. If bulls don't
 

2601
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,270
That's your over under. If bulls don't
defend that, it probably make a new low

2602
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:53,280
defend that, it probably make a new low
 

2603
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,670
defend that, it probably make a new low
there or thereabouts. You got to give it

2604
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:55,680
there or thereabouts. You got to give it
 

2605
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,510
there or thereabouts. You got to give it
some uh wiggle room in this market

2606
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520
some uh wiggle room in this market
 

2607
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,190
some uh wiggle room in this market
obviously because we're moving quick

2608
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:01,200
obviously because we're moving quick
 

2609
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,309
obviously because we're moving quick
500s here.

2610
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
500s here.
 

2611
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:07,750
500s here.
Here come the move back to 480 is 89s,

2612
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:07,760
Here come the move back to 480 is 89s,
 

2613
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,950
Here come the move back to 480 is 89s,
87s coming in 83s. This is the level now

2614
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:10,960
87s coming in 83s. This is the level now
 

2615
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,549
87s coming in 83s. This is the level now
they need to defend here. the bulls if

2616
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:12,559
they need to defend here. the bulls if
 

2617
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:13,670
they need to defend here. the bulls if
they're going to have a chance of any

2618
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:13,680
they're going to have a chance of any
 

2619
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,069
they're going to have a chance of any
more relief otherwise probably new lows.

2620
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
more relief otherwise probably new lows.
 

2621
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,069
more relief otherwise probably new lows.
Like I said, it's a short squeeze up and

2622
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:18,079
Like I said, it's a short squeeze up and
 

2623
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,510
Like I said, it's a short squeeze up and
if they can't defend here, they're going

2624
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:19,520
if they can't defend here, they're going
 

2625
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,309
if they can't defend here, they're going
to get themselves in big big trouble,

2626
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:22,319
to get themselves in big big trouble,
 

2627
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,829
to get themselves in big big trouble,
which is looks like they might well be

2628
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
which is looks like they might well be
 

2629
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,029
which is looks like they might well be
in

2630
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:27,039

 

2631
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,870

just a short squeeze up. Sold into at

2632
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
just a short squeeze up. Sold into at
 

2633
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,789
just a short squeeze up. Sold into at
that area back down to this level. This

2634
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:30,799
that area back down to this level. This
 

2635
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,309
that area back down to this level. This
is the level. They can't defend this.

2636
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:32,319
is the level. They can't defend this.
 

2637
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:37,270
is the level. They can't defend this.
They're in big old trouble.

2638
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:37,280

 

2639
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,789

They're attempting to

2640
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:42,799

 

2641
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,230

struggling. They are struggling. They're

2646
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:49,280

 

2647
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,029

Look, I'm flat right now, folks. I took

2648
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
Look, I'm flat right now, folks. I took
 

2649
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,470
Look, I'm flat right now, folks. I took
the squeeze out. I'm flat at the moment.

2650
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:54,480
the squeeze out. I'm flat at the moment.
 

2651
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,470
the squeeze out. I'm flat at the moment.
This is where sellers last came in right

2652
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:56,480
This is where sellers last came in right
 

2653
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,670
This is where sellers last came in right
here on this big candle down.

2654
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
here on this big candle down.

So, bulls basically now get got to get

2656
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
So, bulls basically now get got to get
 

2657
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,990
So, bulls basically now get got to get
above 95. They got to defend 18, get

2658
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:04,000
above 95. They got to defend 18, get
 

2659
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,910
above 95. They got to defend 18, get
above 95. And I'm not seeing that on the

2660
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:05,920
above 95. And I'm not seeing that on the
 

2661
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,470
above 95. And I'm not seeing that on the
tape. I'm not seeing that on the tape.

seen quite the opposite.

2664
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:12,559

 

2665
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,069

Hopefully that made sense to you all.

2666
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:14,079
Hopefully that made sense to you all.
 

2667
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,990

Squeeze out. They defended this.

2668
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,000
Squeeze out. They defended this.
 

2669
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,109
Squeeze out. They defended this.
Probably should have just flipped and

2670
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:17,119
Probably should have just flipped and
 

2671
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,549
Probably should have just flipped and
got This is what I struggle with once I

2672
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:18,559
got This is what I struggle with once I
 

2673
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,630
got This is what I struggle with once I
take this is just flip and go short back

2674
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:20,640
take this is just flip and go short back
 

2675
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,630
take this is just flip and go short back
down. What I should do because it's very

2676
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:22,640
down. What I should do because it's very
 

2677
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,710
down. What I should do because it's very
obvious. There's your main trend.

2678
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:24,720
obvious. There's your main trend.
 

2679
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,150
obvious. There's your main trend.
There's the flow zones. There's your

2680
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,160
There's the flow zones. There's your
 

2681
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,990
There's the flow zones. There's your
shelf. There's your point of control.

2682
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,000
shelf. There's your point of control.
 

2683
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,750
shelf. There's your point of control.
There's a retest of this. So that would

2684
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
There's a retest of this. So that would
 

2685
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,029
There's a retest of this. So that would
be TP1. And then TP2 is run us down

2686
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:33,039
be TP1. And then TP2 is run us down
 

2687
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,109
be TP1. And then TP2 is run us down
maybe to 24,000 if they really want to

2688
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,119
maybe to 24,000 if they really want to
 

2689
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,109
maybe to 24,000 if they really want to
be nasty.

2690
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:39,119

 

2691
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,309

So yeah, buyers have got to get back

2692
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:40,319
So yeah, buyers have got to get back
 

2693
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,549
So yeah, buyers have got to get back
above the 500s.

2694
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:42,559
above the 500s.
 

2695
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:43,910
above the 500s.
This level here that we just pushed

2696
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:43,920
This level here that we just pushed
 

2697
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,750
This level here that we just pushed
into, this is where all the sellers came

2698
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:45,760
into, this is where all the sellers came
 

2699
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,510
into, this is where all the sellers came
in.

2700
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:47,520
in.
 

2701
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,029
in.
The buyers have got to get back above

2702
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:49,039
The buyers have got to get back above
 

2703
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,069
The buyers have got to get back above
500s basically. There they go. Back

2704
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
500s basically. There they go. Back
 

2705
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,470
500s basically. There they go. Back
above the 500s.

2706
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
above the 500s.
 

2707
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,230
above the 500s.
Okay, can we squeeze now then for the

2708
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,240
Okay, can we squeeze now then for the
 

2709
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:03,270
Okay, can we squeeze now then for the
first higher low?

2710
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:03,280

 

2711
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,670

big shelf up here into 520 from those uh

2712
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
big shelf up here into 520 from those uh
 

2713
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,750
big shelf up here into 520 from those uh
sort of three candles up here. So 3500s

2714
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:07,760
sort of three candles up here. So 3500s
 

2715
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,430
sort of three candles up here. So 3500s
into 520s and through that probably take

2716
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:11,440
into 520s and through that probably take
 

2717
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,789
into 520s and through that probably take
out this pivot up here. Here we go.

2718
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
out this pivot up here. Here we go.
 

2719
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:20,390
out this pivot up here. Here we go.
Here's 20s. Big level up here, folks.

2720
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:20,400
Here's 20s. Big level up here, folks.
 

2721
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,710
Here's 20s. Big level up here, folks.
Big level up here. This is a huge battle

2722
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,720
Big level up here. This is a huge battle
 

2723
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,789
Big level up here. This is a huge battle
now. You're going to get whipsaw

2724
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
now. You're going to get whipsaw
 

2725
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,029
now. You're going to get whipsaw
reaction in this range while they battle

2726
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:27,039
reaction in this range while they battle
 

2727
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:34,309
reaction in this range while they battle
it out to decide what they do next.

2728
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319

 

2729
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,990

excess there. Balls failed to get

2730
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,000
excess there. Balls failed to get
 

2731
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,150
excess there. Balls failed to get
through with conviction yet, but it

2732
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
through with conviction yet, but it
 

2733
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,230
through with conviction yet, but it
might still come. Looks like the first

2734
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,240
might still come. Looks like the first
 

2735
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:51,589
might still come. Looks like the first
higher low is in. Here we go.

2736
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:51,599

 

2737
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,710

Come on.

2738
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:56,720

 

2739
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,750

Big level here.

2740
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
Big level here.
 

2741
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,270
Big level here.
Ball's failing here. They're trying.

2742
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:01,280
Ball's failing here. They're trying.
 

2743
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,990
Ball's failing here. They're trying.
They are trying.

2744
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,000

 

2745
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,750

That reclaim of uh 500 was was good, but

2746
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:09,760
That reclaim of uh 500 was was good, but
 

2747
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,349
That reclaim of uh 500 was was good, but
now we're into where we had excess in

2748
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:11,359
now we're into where we had excess in
 

2749
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,430
now we're into where we had excess in
this and this shelf here. If they

2750
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
this and this shelf here. If they
 

2751
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,789
this and this shelf here. If they
reclaim this, there's a bigger squeeze

2752
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
reclaim this, there's a bigger squeeze
 

2753
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,950
reclaim this, there's a bigger squeeze
out towards GlobeEx and VWOP and maybe

2754
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
out towards GlobeEx and VWOP and maybe
 

2755
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,309
out towards GlobeEx and VWOP and maybe
all the way up here if they're done with

2756
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:18,319
all the way up here if they're done with
 

2757
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:21,829
all the way up here if they're done with
it for a minute before they resell it.

2758
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
it for a minute before they resell it.
 

2759
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,670
it for a minute before they resell it.
And this can be a twoleg which is sold

2760
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
And this can be a twoleg which is sold
 

2761
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,270
And this can be a twoleg which is sold
into. It could be a fail two-leg which

2762
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,280
into. It could be a fail two-leg which
 

2763
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,789
into. It could be a fail two-leg which
is also sold into. I wouldn't want to be

2764
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:26,799
is also sold into. I wouldn't want to be
 

2765
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,710
is also sold into. I wouldn't want to be
long in this area here. If you're long,

2766
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:28,720
long in this area here. If you're long,
 

2767
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,309
long in this area here. If you're long,
it needs to be from down here. You need

2768
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
it needs to be from down here. You need
 

2769
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,870
it needs to be from down here. You need
to be selling into this area as they

2770
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:32,880
to be selling into this area as they
 

2771
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,309
to be selling into this area as they
build out liquidity down here. Remember,

2772
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:34,319
build out liquidity down here. Remember,
 

2773
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,270
build out liquidity down here. Remember,
they're going to build out lots of

2774
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:35,280
they're going to build out lots of
 

2775
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,950
they're going to build out lots of
liquidity here. This can be a big bare

2776
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:36,960
liquidity here. This can be a big bare
 

2777
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,029
liquidity here. This can be a big bare
flag, a two-leg which they sell down.

2778
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:39,039
flag, a two-leg which they sell down.
 

2779
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,870
flag, a two-leg which they sell down.
They can build a big bare flag, a two

2780
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:40,880
They can build a big bare flag, a two
 

2781
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,430
They can build a big bare flag, a two
leg, which they sell down. Any long

2782
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:43,440
leg, which they sell down. Any long
 

2783
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,589
leg, which they sell down. Any long
today is counter trend on every time

2784
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
today is counter trend on every time
 

2785
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:51,589
today is counter trend on every time
frame.

2786
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:51,599

 

2787
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,670

Back down to test those sort of 490s

2788
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:53,680
Back down to test those sort of 490s
 

2789
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,270
Back down to test those sort of 490s
areas. 480 490. It's where the sellers

2790
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:57,280
areas. 480 490. It's where the sellers
 

2791
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,190
areas. 480 490. It's where the sellers
last got stuck. So, this is this is the

2792
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,200
last got stuck. So, this is this is the
 

2793
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,109
last got stuck. So, this is this is the
rotation now. They're going to have to

2794
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:01,119
rotation now. They're going to have to
 

2795
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,109
rotation now. They're going to have to
make their mind up here. It's It might

2796
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
make their mind up here. It's It might
 

2797
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,190
make their mind up here. It's It might
look small. It's not. This is fast

2798
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,200
look small. It's not. This is fast
 

2799
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,829
look small. It's not. This is fast
moving and big big size being traded

2800
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:07,839
moving and big big size being traded
 

2801
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:15,190
moving and big big size being traded
through here. Both both sides.

2802
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,200

 

2803
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,630

80s again.

2804
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640

 

2805
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,990

Buyers need to hold this. They're

2806
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:22,000
Buyers need to hold this. They're
 

2807
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,589
Buyers need to hold this. They're
trying.

2808
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599

 

2809
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,589

I don't have much conviction here for

2810
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
I don't have much conviction here for
 

2811
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,270
I don't have much conviction here for
any more longs at the moment, but they

2812
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
any more longs at the moment, but they
 

2813
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,430
any more longs at the moment, but they
are attempting to do it. Like I said,

2814
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:31,440
are attempting to do it. Like I said,
 

2815
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,270
are attempting to do it. Like I said,
this can be a two-legg or a failed two

2816
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
this can be a two-legg or a failed two
 

2817
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,109
this can be a two-legg or a failed two
leg, which just pukes out and big old

2818
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:35,119
leg, which just pukes out and big old
 

2819
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,789
leg, which just pukes out and big old
bare flag down. Remember, easier move of

2820
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
bare flag down. Remember, easier move of
 

2821
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,870
bare flag down. Remember, easier move of
least resistance

2822
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
least resistance
 

2823
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,029
least resistance
down today. I'm going to get a new a new

2824
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
down today. I'm going to get a new a new
 

2825
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,870
down today. I'm going to get a new a new
coffee while I let this just uh do its

2826
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:44,880
coffee while I let this just uh do its
 

2827
01:07:44,880 --> 01:09:00,229
coffee while I let this just uh do its
thing. Be right back.

2828
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239

 

2829
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,470

Sorry folks, wife just woke up so I had

2830
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:02,480
Sorry folks, wife just woke up so I had
 

2831
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,030
Sorry folks, wife just woke up so I had
to make her a coffee as well. All right.

2832
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,040
to make her a coffee as well. All right.
 

2833
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,669
to make her a coffee as well. All right.
Okay. So, failed two leg then and

2834
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:07,679
Okay. So, failed two leg then and
 

2835
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,990
Okay. So, failed two leg then and
possibly uh breaking down here. So,

2836
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:10,000
possibly uh breaking down here. So,
 

2837
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,470
possibly uh breaking down here. So,
failed two leg, failed this PC, failed

2838
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
failed two leg, failed this PC, failed
 

2839
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,110
failed two leg, failed this PC, failed
that gray box. Like I said, any long

2840
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,120
that gray box. Like I said, any long
 

2841
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,189
that gray box. Like I said, any long
today is just a counter trend short

2842
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
today is just a counter trend short
 

2843
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,590
today is just a counter trend short
squeeze and that's been sold into now.

2844
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
squeeze and that's been sold into now.
 

2845
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,829
squeeze and that's been sold into now.
So, I think we probably make new lows

2846
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:21,839
So, I think we probably make new lows
 

2847
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,269
So, I think we probably make new lows
here, I would imagine. Let me just check

2848
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:23,279
here, I would imagine. Let me just check
 

2849
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:24,789
here, I would imagine. Let me just check
the excess on that last low. Yeah,

2850
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:24,799
the excess on that last low. Yeah,
 

2851
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:26,630
the excess on that last low. Yeah,
probably not enough. I mean, the excess

2852
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:26,640
probably not enough. I mean, the excess
 

2853
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,590
probably not enough. I mean, the excess
was at 34 and under.

2854
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:29,600
was at 34 and under.
 

2855
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,189
was at 34 and under.
Imagine they will probably trade through

2856
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:31,199
Imagine they will probably trade through
 

2857
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:34,390
Imagine they will probably trade through
it, but we will see.

2858
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
it, but we will see.
 

2859
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,590
it, but we will see.
We will see.

2860
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:37,600
We will see.
 

2861
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,349
We will see.

01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,120
playing longs today like I did, just be
 

2871
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,510
playing longs today like I did, just be
very, very careful. The main move,

2872
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:49,520
very, very careful. The main move,
 

2873
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,349
very, very careful. The main move,
remember, the main people in control

2874
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
remember, the main people in control
 

2875
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,829
remember, the main people in control

2927
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,070
monthly chart is the only chart
currently which you could say could

2928
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
currently which you could say could
 

2929
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,270
currently which you could say could
potentially be bullish

2930
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,280
potentially be bullish
 

2931
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,390
potentially be bullish
versus here 157. If we go to a weekly

2932
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:32,400
versus here 157. If we go to a weekly
 

2933
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,030
versus here 157. If we go to a weekly
chart, right, we're breaking weekly

2934
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,040
chart, right, we're breaking weekly
 

2935
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,310
chart, right, we're breaking weekly
lows, right? Broken this weekly low low,

2936
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:38,320
lows, right? Broken this weekly low low,
 

2937
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,149
lows, right? Broken this weekly low low,
broken this weekly low. These are the

2938
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
broken this weekly low. These are the
 

2939
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,030
broken this weekly low. These are the
next areas that we could come into if we

2940
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:43,040
next areas that we could come into if we
 

2941
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,030
next areas that we could come into if we
go to a daily chart. So weekly is in

2942
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:45,040
go to a daily chart. So weekly is in
 

2943
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,550
go to a daily chart. So weekly is in
breakout underneath here. If we go to a

2944
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:46,560
breakout underneath here. If we go to a
 

2945
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,630
breakout underneath here. If we go to a
daily chart, dailyy's in breakout.

2946
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
daily chart, dailyy's in breakout.
 

2947
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,149
daily chart, dailyy's in breakout.
Obviously, if daily is in breakout,

2948
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
Obviously, if daily is in breakout,
 

2949
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,510
Obviously, if daily is in breakout,
everything else is on breakout. Yeah.

2950
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:51,520
everything else is on breakout. Yeah.
 

2951
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,950
everything else is on breakout. Yeah.
Hourly's in breakout, 4 hours in

2952
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:52,960
Hourly's in breakout, 4 hours in
 

2953
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,430
Hourly's in breakout, 4 hours in
breakout, etc., etc. So, all I'm saying,

2954
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,440
breakout, etc., etc. So, all I'm saying,
 

2955
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,189
breakout, etc., etc. So, all I'm saying,
I'm not saying you can't take the

2956
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:57,199
I'm not saying you can't take the
 

2957
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,870
I'm not saying you can't take the
counter trend squeezes. All I'm saying

2958
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:58,880
counter trend squeezes. All I'm saying
 

2959
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,350
counter trend squeezes. All I'm saying
is it's the harder trade to take, right?

2960
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
is it's the harder trade to take, right?
 

2961
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,790
is it's the harder trade to take, right?
That's all I'm trying to say. It's the

2962
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:02,800
That's all I'm trying to say. It's the
 

2963
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,030
That's all I'm trying to say. It's the
harder trade to take is this move back

2964
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,040
harder trade to take is this move back
 

2965
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,950
harder trade to take is this move back
upside. At the moment, it's working for

2966
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:06,960
upside. At the moment, it's working for
 

2967
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,030
upside. At the moment, it's working for
you, but it's the harder trade to take.

2968
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:09,040
you, but it's the harder trade to take.
 

2969
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,470
you, but it's the harder trade to take.
We haven't got back over. for example,

2970
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:12,480
We haven't got back over. for example,
 

2971
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,550
We haven't got back over. for example,
POC's now flipped here. We're not back

2972
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:14,560
POC's now flipped here. We're not back
 

2973
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,390
POC's now flipped here. We're not back
over this. Once we get back over this,

2974
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:16,400
over this. Once we get back over this,
 

2975
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,750
over this. Once we get back over this,
maybe there's a relief to here. They

2976
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:17,760
maybe there's a relief to here. They
 

2977
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,550
maybe there's a relief to here. They
might well resell, right, a pop up into

2978
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:20,560
might well resell, right, a pop up into
 

2979
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,630
might well resell, right, a pop up into
here, for example. So, that's all I'm

2980
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:22,640
here, for example. So, that's all I'm
 

2981
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,149
here, for example. So, that's all I'm
saying, my friend. That's all I'm

2982
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:24,159
saying, my friend. That's all I'm
 

2983
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,070
saying, my friend. That's all I'm
saying. I'm not telling you not to do

2984
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
saying. I'm not telling you not to do
 

2985
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:34,310
saying. I'm not telling you not to do
it. I'm telling you, be careful.

2986
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320

 

2987
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,950

All right.

2988
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960

 

2989
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,390

Big old squeeze. There you go. Here's

2990
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,400
Big old squeeze. There you go. Here's
 

2991
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,990
Big old squeeze. There you go. Here's
VWAP.

2992
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,000
VWAP.
 

2993
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,550
VWAP.
Woof. Like I said, bare bare market

2994
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:44,560
Woof. Like I said, bare bare market
 

2995
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,550
Woof. Like I said, bare bare market
squee like the squeezes in bare markets

2996
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:46,560
squee like the squeezes in bare markets
 

2997
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,110
squee like the squeezes in bare markets
can be drastic. There you go. This for

2998
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,120
can be drastic. There you go. This for
 

2999
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,149
can be drastic. There you go. This for
me can still be very bearish, right? So,

3000
01:12:52,149 --> 01:12:52,159
me can still be very bearish, right? So,
 

3001
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,750
me can still be very bearish, right? So,
just be all I'm saying is be careful.

3002
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
just be all I'm saying is be careful.
 

3003
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,950
just be all I'm saying is be careful.
Make sure you're locking in. If you're

3004
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960
Make sure you're locking in. If you're
 

3005
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,229
Make sure you're locking in. If you're
playing counter trend, you've got to

3006
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
playing counter trend, you've got to
 

3007
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,310
playing counter trend, you've got to
lock some in. I'll be watching for a

3008
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:58,320
lock some in. I'll be watching for a
 

3009
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,709
lock some in. I'll be watching for a
hold over. So, this is sort of move now.

3010
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:00,719
hold over. So, this is sort of move now.
 

3011
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,350
hold over. So, this is sort of move now.
So, I'd be watching for a for a hold. If

3012
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
So, I'd be watching for a for a hold. If
 

3013
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,950
So, I'd be watching for a for a hold. If
this is going to be a W and a hold,

3014
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:04,960
this is going to be a W and a hold,
 

3015
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,630
this is going to be a W and a hold,
they've got to hold the top side of this

3016
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
they've got to hold the top side of this
 

3017
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,229
they've got to hold the top side of this
really for this move here if they're

3018
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:08,239
really for this move here if they're
 

3019
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:09,850
really for this move here if they're
going to do it.

3020
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:09,860
going to do it.
 

3021
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:26,229
going to do it.

charts. Okay, some bulls got trapped at

3026
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
charts. Okay, some bulls got trapped at
 

3027
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,590
charts. Okay, some bulls got trapped at
the top there. Big big buying at the top

3028
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:31,600
the top there. Big big buying at the top
 

3029
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,669
the top there. Big big buying at the top
there. Not what you want to see. And

3030
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:33,679
there. Not what you want to see. And
 

3031
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,350
there. Not what you want to see. And
there's probably a passive seller in

3032
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
there's probably a passive seller in
 

3033
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,270
there's probably a passive seller in
there moving it away. Let's see if they

3034
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
there moving it away. Let's see if they
 

3035
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,950
there moving it away. Let's see if they
actually hold a dip here or if we just

3036
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:38,960
actually hold a dip here or if we just
 

3037
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,550
actually hold a dip here or if we just
like wash all the way back through,

3038
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:42,560
like wash all the way back through,
 

3039
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,229
like wash all the way back through,
which would not surprise me either

3040
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:44,239
which would not surprise me either
 

3041
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,229
which would not surprise me either
because it's a short squeeze and we're

3042
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
because it's a short squeeze and we're
 

3043
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,390
because it's a short squeeze and we're
still under VWAP, etc., etc. So, what's

3044
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:48,400
still under VWAP, etc., etc. So, what's
 

3045
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,870
still under VWAP, etc., etc. So, what's
this level here of interest? So, 50s

3046
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:50,880
this level here of interest? So, 50s
 

3047
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,149
this level here of interest? So, 50s
down to 23s.

3048
01:13:54,149 --> 01:13:54,159
down to 23s.
 

3049
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:56,390
down to 23s.
If they hold that, bulls can have a

3050
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,400
If they hold that, bulls can have a
 

3051
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,310
If they hold that, bulls can have a
bigger squeeze out. If they don't hold

3052
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:58,320
bigger squeeze out. If they don't hold
 

3053
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,750
bigger squeeze out. If they don't hold
50s down to 20s and then they're

3054
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:01,760
50s down to 20s and then they're
 

3055
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,750
50s down to 20s and then they're
probably coming back to the lows, right,

3056
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
probably coming back to the lows, right,
 

3057
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,390
probably coming back to the lows, right,
we are under the VWAPS [snorts]

3058
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,400
we are under the VWAPS [snorts]
 

3059
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,990
we are under the VWAPS [snorts]
by not through 660 yet. So far, they

3060
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
by not through 660 yet. So far, they
 

3061
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,709
by not through 660 yet. So far, they
just hold that dip in 250s

3062
01:14:14,709 --> 01:14:14,719
just hold that dip in 250s
 

3063
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,470
just hold that dip in 250s
so far. I mean it was there for about a

3064
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
so far. I mean it was there for about a
 

3065
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:27,430
so far. I mean it was there for about a
nancond.

3066
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:27,440

 

3067
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,750

So 50s to 20s needs to hold for bulls.

3068
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:29,760
So 50s to 20s needs to hold for bulls.
 

3069
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,950
So 50s to 20s needs to hold for bulls.
If they get that there's a bigger

3070
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
If they get that there's a bigger
 

3071
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,750
If they get that there's a bigger
squeeze out here. Starting to see it try

3072
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:33,760
squeeze out here. Starting to see it try
 

3073
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,590
squeeze out here. Starting to see it try
and develop. This is a big area up here

3074
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
and develop. This is a big area up here
 

3075
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,110
and develop. This is a big area up here
because bulls got stuck. If we can break

3076
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,120
because bulls got stuck. If we can break
 

3077
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,310
because bulls got stuck. If we can break
this high is a bigger squeeze coming.

3078
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:40,320
this high is a bigger squeeze coming.
 

3079
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,149
this high is a bigger squeeze coming.
I am in this small size at the moment.

3080
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:42,159
I am in this small size at the moment.
 

3081
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,709
I am in this small size at the moment.
Just watching it. I'm taking profit as I

3082
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:44,719
Just watching it. I'm taking profit as I
 

3083
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,950
Just watching it. I'm taking profit as I
go because I know I'm counter trend. I

3084
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:46,960
go because I know I'm counter trend. I
 

3085
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,709
go because I know I'm counter trend. I
know saw that dip and we held that key

3086
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:48,719
know saw that dip and we held that key
 

3087
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,790
know saw that dip and we held that key
level. So watching VWAP and GlobeEx

3088
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:50,800
level. So watching VWAP and GlobeEx
 

3089
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,149
level. So watching VWAP and GlobeEx
here. I've already taken some money off

3090
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:52,159
here. I've already taken some money off
 

3091
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,310
here. I've already taken some money off
the table here folks. It's very very

3092
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:54,320
the table here folks. It's very very
 

3093
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,070
the table here folks. It's very very
dangerous trade. They can absolutely

3094
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:56,080
dangerous trade. They can absolutely
 

3095
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,750
dangerous trade. They can absolutely
slam this on the face if they want.

3096
01:14:59,750 --> 01:14:59,760
slam this on the face if they want.
 

3097
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,110
slam this on the face if they want.
Think we're going to move higher at this

3098
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:01,120
Think we're going to move higher at this
 

3099
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,390
Think we're going to move higher at this
point. 600 bid big overunder. Not seeing

3100
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
point. 600 bid big overunder. Not seeing
 

3101
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,830
point. 600 bid big overunder. Not seeing
too many transactions here. So I think

3102
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:05,840
too many transactions here. So I think
 

3103
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,870
too many transactions here. So I think
we're going to trade through it. There

3104
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:06,880
we're going to trade through it. There
 

3105
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,790
we're going to trade through it. There
we go. Beautiful. Okay. Here's VWAP.

3106
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:08,800
we go. Beautiful. Okay. Here's VWAP.
 

3107
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,790
we go. Beautiful. Okay. Here's VWAP.
Here's GlobeEx. We base above this now.

3108
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800
Here's GlobeEx. We base above this now.
 

3109
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,830
Here's GlobeEx. We base above this now.
We're watching for a move into 70s.

3110
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:13,840
We're watching for a move into 70s.
 

3111
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,510
We're watching for a move into 70s.
Remember, we're counter trend. So, we

3112
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:15,520
Remember, we're counter trend. So, we
 

3113
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,270
Remember, we're counter trend. So, we
expect shorts to come in. Do not be

3114
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,280
expect shorts to come in. Do not be
 

3115
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,430
expect shorts to come in. Do not be
adding late. We expect I cannot say

3116
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
adding late. We expect I cannot say
 

3117
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,030
adding late. We expect I cannot say
enough. We expect shorts to come back

3118
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:21,040
enough. We expect shorts to come back
 

3119
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,709
enough. We expect shorts to come back
into this market and cause pain.

3120
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:24,719
into this market and cause pain.
 

3121
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,110
into this market and cause pain.
So, 50s to 20s was the entry. I said if

3122
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:27,120
So, 50s to 20s was the entry. I said if
 

3123
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,709
So, 50s to 20s was the entry. I said if
we hold 50 to 20s. There we go. It's

3124
01:15:28,709 --> 01:15:28,719
we hold 50 to 20s. There we go. It's
 

3125
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,149
we hold 50 to 20s. There we go. It's
just very simple. You can make it a W,

3126
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:30,159
just very simple. You can make it a W,
 

3127
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,270
just very simple. You can make it a W,
can't you? D hold of this. That was a

3128
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
can't you? D hold of this. That was a
 

3129
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,950
can't you? D hold of this. That was a
awful drawing, Alex. D hold of this.

3130
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:36,960
awful drawing, Alex. D hold of this.
 

3131
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,790
awful drawing, Alex. D hold of this.
We're bullish to here. Take some profit

3132
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:38,800
We're bullish to here. Take some profit
 

3133
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,790
We're bullish to here. Take some profit
off into here. low volume node. If we

3134
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:40,800
off into here. low volume node. If we
 

3135
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,310
off into here. low volume node. If we
get through this, we're looking for 70s.

3136
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:42,320
get through this, we're looking for 70s.
 

3137
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,669
get through this, we're looking for 70s.
If we fail this, we're out on the

3138
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:43,679
If we fail this, we're out on the
 

3139
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,430
If we fail this, we're out on the
runners break even or in the money if

3140
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
runners break even or in the money if
 

3141
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,910
runners break even or in the money if
you want. [snorts]

3142
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:47,920
you want. [snorts]
 

3143
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,189
you want. [snorts]
Here we go. Back down towards that

3144
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:49,199
Here we go. Back down towards that
 

3145
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,030
Here we go. Back down towards that
level. So again, 50s to 20s have to

3146
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:51,040
level. So again, 50s to 20s have to
 

3147
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,070
level. So again, 50s to 20s have to
hold. Otherwise, we're going back

3148
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,080
hold. Otherwise, we're going back
 

3149
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,270
hold. Otherwise, we're going back
towards lows. My stop is now in the

3150
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:55,280
towards lows. My stop is now in the
 

3151
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,350
towards lows. My stop is now in the
money and about to get knocked out.

3152
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,360
money and about to get knocked out.
 

3153
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,910
money and about to get knocked out.
Knocked out here on the runner. Locked

3154
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
Knocked out here on the runner. Locked
 

3155
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,910
Knocked out here on the runner. Locked
in some more money. And this is why,

3156
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:01,920
in some more money. And this is why,
 

3157
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,709
in some more money. And this is why,
like I said, you have to expect bears to

3158
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
like I said, you have to expect bears to
 

3159
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,709
like I said, you have to expect bears to
come back in. This is now the twole that

3160
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
come back in. This is now the twole that
 

3161
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,790
come back in. This is now the twole that
we talked about. If they fail under

3162
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,800
we talked about. If they fail under
 

3163
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,070
we talked about. If they fail under
here, they're going to come right down

3164
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
here, they're going to come right down
 

3165
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,430
here, they're going to come right down
to here, and this would be strong

3166
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:11,440
to here, and this would be strong
 

3167
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,229
to here, and this would be strong
momentum, and that is a giant bare flag,

3168
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:14,239
momentum, and that is a giant bare flag,
 

3169
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,630
momentum, and that is a giant bare flag,
right? So, if they don't hold this, they

3170
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:16,640
right? So, if they don't hold this, they
 

3171
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,030
right? So, if they don't hold this, they
come back down lower. This is how we

3172
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,040
come back down lower. This is how we
 

3173
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,870
come back down lower. This is how we
build liquidity. This is literally how

3174
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
build liquidity. This is literally how
 

3175
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,510
build liquidity. This is literally how
we build liquidity. This is a liquidity

3176
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,520
we build liquidity. This is a liquidity
 

3177
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,070
we build liquidity. This is a liquidity
buildout. Bulls must defend this if

3178
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:26,080
buildout. Bulls must defend this if
 

3179
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,350
buildout. Bulls must defend this if
they're going to get a bigger squeeze.

3180
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
they're going to get a bigger squeeze.
 

3181
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,430
they're going to get a bigger squeeze.
Failing to defend this allows this

3182
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
Failing to defend this allows this
 

3183
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,229
Failing to defend this allows this
rotation for new lows.

3184
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:32,239
rotation for new lows.
 

3185
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,070
rotation for new lows.
50s to 20s is the level. We're still

3186
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
50s to 20s is the level. We're still
 

3187
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,310
50s to 20s is the level. We're still
actually holding at that gray box. Maybe

3188
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,320
actually holding at that gray box. Maybe
 

3189
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,630
actually holding at that gray box. Maybe
a bit premature there from me, but

3190
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:38,640
a bit premature there from me, but
 

3191
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,073
a bit premature there from me, but
wanted to lock in.

3192
01:16:42,073 --> 01:16:42,083
wanted to lock in.
 

3193
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:49,830
wanted to lock in.
[sighs]

3194
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840

 

3195
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,669

Just cal everyone in chat. Just calm

3196
01:16:51,669 --> 01:16:51,679
Just cal everyone in chat. Just calm
 

3197
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:52,709
Just cal everyone in chat. Just calm
down. I'm not sure what's happened

3198
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:52,719
down. I'm not sure what's happened
 

3199
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,189
down. I'm not sure what's happened
because I missed it, but calm heads,

3200
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:55,199
because I missed it, but calm heads,
 

3201
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:56,709
because I missed it, but calm heads,
guys. You need calm heads when you're

3202
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:56,719
guys. You need calm heads when you're
 

3203
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,149
guys. You need calm heads when you're
trading. You'll see me lose my head

3204
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:58,159
trading. You'll see me lose my head
 

3205
01:16:58,159 --> 01:16:59,669
trading. You'll see me lose my head
sometimes and it means I can't trade.

3206
01:16:59,669 --> 01:16:59,679
sometimes and it means I can't trade.
 

3207
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,350
sometimes and it means I can't trade.
Just calm heads. If you got something

3208
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
Just calm heads. If you got something
 

3209
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,229
Just calm heads. If you got something
wrong or whatever, just try and let it

3210
01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:04,239
wrong or whatever, just try and let it
 

3211
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:05,510
wrong or whatever, just try and let it
go. So, if you can't let it go, just

3212
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:05,520
go. So, if you can't let it go, just
 

3213
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,270
go. So, if you can't let it go, just
shut your screens down or go for a walk

3214
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:07,280
shut your screens down or go for a walk
 

3215
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,550
shut your screens down or go for a walk
or do whatever you've got to do. But

3216
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
or do whatever you've got to do. But
 

3217
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,709
or do whatever you've got to do. But
calm heads.

3218
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
calm heads.
 

3219
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,470
calm heads.
No blaming anyone else for anything.

3220
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
No blaming anyone else for anything.
 

3221
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,070
No blaming anyone else for anything.
You're in charge of your own decisions,

3222
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:14,080
You're in charge of your own decisions,
 

3223
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,630
You're in charge of your own decisions,
your own trades and chat, okay? There's

3224
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:16,640
your own trades and chat, okay? There's
 

3225
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,390
your own trades and chat, okay? There's
always two two trades to be have.

3226
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:18,400
always two two trades to be have.
 

3227
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,070
always two two trades to be have.
There's both sides. You can both make

3228
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
There's both sides. You can both make
 

3229
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,510
There's both sides. You can both make
money. You can both trade both sides.

3230
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
money. You can both trade both sides.
 

3231
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,709
money. You can both trade both sides.
Like you said, you would have seen me

3232
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
Like you said, you would have seen me
 

3233
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,310
Like you said, you would have seen me
today saying, "I'm focused on the

3234
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
today saying, "I'm focused on the
 

3235
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,669
today saying, "I'm focused on the
shorts, but I've ended up trading the

3236
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
shorts, but I've ended up trading the
 

3237
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,110
shorts, but I've ended up trading the
longs because the shorts haven't set up

3238
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
longs because the shorts haven't set up
 

3239
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,149
longs because the shorts haven't set up
for me." So, um, you know, it's a

3240
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:30,159
for me." So, um, you know, it's a
 

3241
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,709
for me." So, um, you know, it's a
two-sided tape. It's you versus you.

3242
01:17:32,709 --> 01:17:32,719
two-sided tape. It's you versus you.
 

3243
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,550
two-sided tape. It's you versus you.
It's not you versus someone else. We're

3244
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:34,560
It's not you versus someone else. We're
 

3245
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,149
It's not you versus someone else. We're
here to support and help each other. I

3246
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:36,159
here to support and help each other. I
 

3247
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,830
here to support and help each other. I
will give you a readout the best I can

3248
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:37,840
will give you a readout the best I can
 

3249
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,630
will give you a readout the best I can
on how the market's moving. But calm

3250
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:40,640
on how the market's moving. But calm
 

3251
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,630
on how the market's moving. But calm
heads, folks.

3252
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:42,640
heads, folks.
 

3253
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,110
heads, folks.
Bulls. Still holding this gray box and

3254
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
Bulls. Still holding this gray box and
 

3255
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,510
Bulls. Still holding this gray box and
in control here. VWAP is massive though.

3256
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
in control here. VWAP is massive though.
 

3257
01:17:47,520 --> 01:18:02,630
in control here. VWAP is massive though.
VWAP and GlobeEx is massive.

3258
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640

 

3259
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,709

What's nice is I took a two and a half

3260
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:04,719
What's nice is I took a two and a half
 

3261
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,630
What's nice is I took a two and a half
grand payout

3262
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:06,640
grand payout
 

3263
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,110
grand payout
last night on the funded next and I

3264
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:09,120
last night on the funded next and I
 

3265
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,110
last night on the funded next and I
basically replenished that already which

3266
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
basically replenished that already which
 

3267
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,910
basically replenished that already which
is awesome.

3268
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:13,920
is awesome.
 

3269
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,830
is awesome.
Always nice when that happens. Okay,

3270
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
Always nice when that happens. Okay,
 

3271
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,070
Always nice when that happens. Okay,
VWAP here. Edge here. You can see this

3272
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:18,080
VWAP here. Edge here. You can see this
 

3273
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,430
VWAP here. Edge here. You can see this
edge here. Maybe I need to do one of

3274
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
edge here. Maybe I need to do one of
 

3275
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:24,310
edge here. Maybe I need to do one of
these for you so you can see it. Um,

3276
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:24,320
these for you so you can see it. Um,
 

3277
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,550
these for you so you can see it. Um,
this edge here thin above this, right?

3278
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:26,560
this edge here thin above this, right?
 

3279
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,470
this edge here thin above this, right?
Thin above this. This level is massive

3280
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:28,480
Thin above this. This level is massive
 

3281
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,830
Thin above this. This level is massive
up here for the market to make a

3282
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:29,840
up here for the market to make a
 

3283
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,870
up here for the market to make a
decision. It's GlobeEx and VWAP. If we

3284
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880
decision. It's GlobeEx and VWAP. If we
 

3285
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,310
decision. It's GlobeEx and VWAP. If we
get back through this, it's basically

3286
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
get back through this, it's basically
 

3287
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,910
get back through this, it's basically
like a failed auction under GlobeEx and

3288
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:35,920
like a failed auction under GlobeEx and
 

3289
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,310
like a failed auction under GlobeEx and
we could trade back upside. I expect

3290
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,320
we could trade back upside. I expect
 

3291
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:49,430
we could trade back upside. I expect
this to be a highly contested area.

3292
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440

 

3293
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,270

First win on the channel. Took the long

3294
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:51,280
First win on the channel. Took the long
 

3295
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,110
First win on the channel. Took the long
for 15 points. No worries. What's

3296
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:53,120
for 15 points. No worries. What's
 

3297
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,709
for 15 points. No worries. What's
GlobeEx? Just overnight overnight

3298
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:54,719
GlobeEx? Just overnight overnight
 

3299
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,430
GlobeEx? Just overnight overnight
session. So, London, London and Asia.

3300
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:57,440
session. So, London, London and Asia.
 

3301
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,709
session. So, London, London and Asia.
So, we're basically, if you look in the

3302
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
So, we're basically, if you look in the
 

3303
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,790
So, we're basically, if you look in the
look at the double bottom that we made

3304
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:00,800
look at the double bottom that we made
 

3305
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,350
look at the double bottom that we made
at like, you know, 11:00 and 2:00 a.m.,

3306
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:03,360
at like, you know, 11:00 and 2:00 a.m.,
 

3307
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,189
at like, you know, 11:00 and 2:00 a.m.,
that's what this orange line is. It's

3308
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,199
that's what this orange line is. It's
 

3309
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,950
that's what this orange line is. It's
that double bottom. So, back towards

3310
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:06,960
that double bottom. So, back towards
 

3311
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:12,310
that double bottom. So, back towards
that double bottom. Now,

3312
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:12,320

 

3313
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,550

spy back through the 660 at the moment.

3314
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
spy back through the 660 at the moment.
 

3315
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,390
spy back through the 660 at the moment.
A bigger squeeze can happen here if they

3316
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:16,400
A bigger squeeze can happen here if they
 

3317
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,630
A bigger squeeze can happen here if they
can hold over this. If they fail this,

3318
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:18,640
can hold over this. If they fail this,
 

3319
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,390
can hold over this. If they fail this,
you know, the rotation back downside.

3320
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,400
you know, the rotation back downside.
 

3321
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,750
you know, the rotation back downside.
All right, so bigger squeeze can happen.

3322
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
All right, so bigger squeeze can happen.
 

3323
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,910
All right, so bigger squeeze can happen.
If they go over this, maybe we get up

3324
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:23,920
If they go over this, maybe we get up
 

3325
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,750
If they go over this, maybe we get up
into here for some relief. But this gray

3326
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:25,760
into here for some relief. But this gray
 

3327
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,390
into here for some relief. But this gray
box, massive level, massive, massive,

3328
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
box, massive level, massive, massive,
 

3329
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:35,750
box, massive level, massive, massive,
massive level.

3330
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:35,760

 

3331
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,270

So far they are defending it.

3332
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:41,280

 

3333
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,149

Overall trend remember is down. Overall

3334
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:44,159
Overall trend remember is down. Overall
 

3335
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:48,790
Overall trend remember is down. Overall
trend is down.

3336
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:48,800

 

3337
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,350

Balls so far have got stuck up above 600

3338
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:51,360
Balls so far have got stuck up above 600
 

3339
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,350
Balls so far have got stuck up above 600
on the last well or both attempts

3340
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,360
on the last well or both attempts
 

3341
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,990
on the last well or both attempts
basically up there. So that attempt at

3342
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,000
basically up there. So that attempt at
 

3343
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,070
basically up there. So that attempt at
uh

3344
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,080
uh
 

3345
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,110
uh
1024 and that attempt at 1028 both times

3346
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
1024 and that attempt at 1028 both times
 

3347
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,870
1024 and that attempt at 1028 both times
up there they got stuck. So back down

3348
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:02,880
up there they got stuck. So back down
 

3349
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,750
up there they got stuck. So back down
towards these 50s and 20s and bulls will

3350
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
towards these 50s and 20s and bulls will
 

3351
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,590
towards these 50s and 20s and bulls will
need to defend this point control.

3352
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
need to defend this point control.
 

3353
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,110
need to defend this point control.
Failing this will probably go low of

3354
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:09,120
Failing this will probably go low of
 

3355
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,270
Failing this will probably go low of
day. So these are the rotations now

3356
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280
day. So these are the rotations now
 

3357
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,790
day. So these are the rotations now
though they have to make their mind up

3358
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:12,800
though they have to make their mind up
 

3359
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,550
though they have to make their mind up
or

3360
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:14,560
or
 

3361
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,350
or
or it's trouble or it is big trouble. So

3362
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:17,360
or it's trouble or it is big trouble. So
 

3363
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,350
or it's trouble or it is big trouble. So
back down to these lows and uh we will

3364
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:21,360
back down to these lows and uh we will
 

3365
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,830
back down to these lows and uh we will
see decisions to be made here by the

3366
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:23,840
see decisions to be made here by the
 

3367
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,870
see decisions to be made here by the
bulls basically or and by the bears.

3368
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:26,880
bulls basically or and by the bears.
 

3369
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:43,750
bulls basically or and by the bears.
It's by both

3370
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760

 

3371
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,310

thinking nasty moves coming. Either way,

3372
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:46,320
thinking nasty moves coming. Either way,
 

3373
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,669
thinking nasty moves coming. Either way,
they're going to get themselves caught

3374
01:20:47,669 --> 01:20:47,679
they're going to get themselves caught
 

3375
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:56,390
they're going to get themselves caught
in these levels as we rotate.

3376
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:56,400

 

3377
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,310

Spy still not back through that 660. I

3378
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320
Spy still not back through that 660. I
 

3379
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,430
Spy still not back through that 660. I
think it just might have just had an

3380
01:20:59,430 --> 01:20:59,440
think it just might have just had an
 

3381
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,510
think it just might have just had an
attempt and failed up there. That's the

3382
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:01,520
attempt and failed up there. That's the
 

3383
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,420
attempt and failed up there. That's the
big level is the put wall.

3384
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:03,430
big level is the put wall.

and sort of VWAP are very very key. So

3390
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
and sort of VWAP are very very key. So
 

3391
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,590
and sort of VWAP are very very key. So
rotate between these fail this probably

3392
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:13,600
rotate between these fail this probably
 

3393
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,990
rotate between these fail this probably

That would be a two-legg which has been

That would be a two-legg which has been
 

3397

That would be a two-legg which has been
sold into to come lower. We're thin in

01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
here, there's a move up to 70s like we
 

3425
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,229
here, there's a move up to 70s like we
talked about. This this is major

we go. Can they get this squeeze? Can

3430
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
we go. Can they get this squeeze? Can
 

3431
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,070
we go. Can they get this squeeze? Can

they get through GlobeEx is the
 

3433
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,830
they get through GlobeEx is the
question. Every attempt up there,

3434
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:15,840
question. Every attempt up there,
 

3435
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,709
question. Every attempt up there,
they've been sold into so far. So, every

3436
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:18,719
they've been sold into so far. So, every
 

3437
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,350
they've been sold into so far. So, every
pop up towards 600 has been sold into so

01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:21,360
pop up towards 600 has been sold into so

Still can't believe Apple's green. The
 

3471
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,110
Still can't believe Apple's green. The
strength in that is maddening to me.

3472
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,120
strength in that is maddening to me.
 

3473
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,709
strength in that is maddening to me.
Like I'm happy because I'm long Apple,

Like I'm happy because I'm long Apple,
 

3475
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,990
Like I'm happy because I'm long Apple,
but it's crazy how strong that is. Like

but it's crazy how strong that is. Like

sign. Okay, into this bottom of this

3486
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:50,880
sign. Okay, into this bottom of this
 

3487
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,350
sign. Okay, into this bottom of this
gray box. So bear's got the force down

3488
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:53,360
gray box. So bear's got the force down
 

3489
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,110
gray box. So bear's got the force down
to there, but Bulls still trying to

3490
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,120
to there, but Bulls still trying to
 

3491
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,629
to there, but Bulls still trying to
defend the edge of this gray box in the

3492
01:23:56,629 --> 01:23:56,639
defend the edge of this gray box in the
 

3493
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,470
defend the edge of this gray box in the
thin liquidity, and they're trying to

3494
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
thin liquidity, and they're trying to
 

3495
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,669
thin liquidity, and they're trying to
soak straight back up. So, the rotation

3496
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
soak straight back up. So, the rotation
 

3497
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,629
soak straight back up. So, the rotation
still continuing. It is a battleground,

3498
01:24:04,629 --> 01:24:04,639
still continuing. It is a battleground,
 

3499
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,149
still continuing. It is a battleground,
folks. Bulls look like they might have

3500
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
folks. Bulls look like they might have
 

3501
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,990
folks. Bulls look like they might have
just caught some bears down there on

3502
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,000
just caught some bears down there on
 

3503
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,870
just caught some bears down there on
that last move. Uh, a hold of 36 here is

3504
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:10,880
that last move. Uh, a hold of 36 here is
 

3505
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,430
that last move. Uh, a hold of 36 here is
very, very bullish. So, watching GlobeEx

3506
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:13,440
very, very bullish. So, watching GlobeEx
 

3507
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,950
very, very bullish. So, watching GlobeEx
now. If they squeeze through here, there

3508
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:14,960
now. If they squeeze through here, there
 

3509
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,470
now. If they squeeze through here, there
could be a bigger move because they just

3510
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:16,480
could be a bigger move because they just
 

3511
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:22,870
could be a bigger move because they just
trapped bears at 36 or below 36.

3512
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880

 

3513
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,629

Balls got trapped up here the last three

3514
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:24,639
Balls got trapped up here the last three
 

3515
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,390
Balls got trapped up here the last three
attempts to get through 600. So, that's

3516
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
attempts to get through 600. So, that's
 

3517
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,629
attempts to get through 600. So, that's
your level basically.

3518
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:30,639

 

3519
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,390

And again, getting sold into. Every push

3520
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:32,400
And again, getting sold into. Every push
 

3521
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,229
And again, getting sold into. Every push
up here in front of 600 is getting sold

3522
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:34,239
up here in front of 600 is getting sold
 

3523
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,229
up here in front of 600 is getting sold
into. Someone's going to get hurt soon.

3524
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:36,239
into. Someone's going to get hurt soon.
 

3525
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,669
into. Someone's going to get hurt soon.
There's a lot of liquidity been built

3526
01:24:37,669 --> 01:24:37,679
There's a lot of liquidity been built
 

3527
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,430
There's a lot of liquidity been built
out in between these two gray boxes now.

3528
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:39,440
out in between these two gray boxes now.
 

3529
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,229
out in between these two gray boxes now.
Huge amount of liquidity.

3530
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
Huge amount of liquidity.
 

3531
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:53,750
Huge amount of liquidity.
Big battle. Big big battle.

3532
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:53,760

 

3533
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,510

Takes moving quick. The amount of

3534
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:55,520
Takes moving quick. The amount of
 

3535
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,270
Takes moving quick. The amount of
borders going through is mental.

3536
01:24:59,270 --> 01:24:59,280
borders going through is mental.
 

3537
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,430
borders going through is mental.
Tape is moving quick.

3538
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440

 

3539

The rotation gray box to gray box. Gray

box to gray box. And then someone will
 

3547
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:37,590

lose outside of these gray boxes.

3549
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,910

I cannot say that enough for all of you
 

3557
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:48,550
I cannot say that enough for all of you
looking for the longs. The overall trend

3558
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
looking for the longs. The overall trend

if they sell through this, new lows are
 

3567

Are they adding liquidity lower? Yes,

Are they adding liquidity lower? Yes,

they are.

01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,669
they are.
There's so much panic in this market at

There's so much panic in this market at
 

3619
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,830
There's so much panic in this market at
the moment. I'm just watching them dump

3620
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:19,840
the moment. I'm just watching them dump
 

3621
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,270
the moment. I'm just watching them dump
inventory on the tape at the moment.

Back down towards these lows. It's game

3624
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,120
Back down towards these lows. It's game
 

3625
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,550
Back down towards these lows. It's game
over here, I would say.

3626
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:28,560
over here, I would say.

Initial balance low there.

we are into a little node but I find it

we are into a little node but I find it
 

3635
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,110
we are into a little node but I find it
somewhat unlikely that bulls are able to

3636
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:49,120
somewhat unlikely that bulls are able to
 

3637
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,950
somewhat unlikely that bulls are able to
defend this given the momentum. It would

3638
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:50,960
defend this given the momentum. It would
 

3639
01:27:50,960 --> 01:28:06,229
defend this given the momentum. It would
be a very very impressive hold.

they're going to get caught and the

01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,350
they're going to get caught and the

01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,470
low of day breakdown here. They might
well get it. That's what they're looking

well get it. That's what they're looking
for. But

for. But
is a such a big battle and the speed of

3666
01:28:37,669 --> 01:28:37,679
is a such a big battle and the speed of
 

3667
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:41,750
is a such a big battle and the speed of
the tape is something else. It is

01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:41,760
the tape is something else. It is
 

3669
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,990
the tape is something else. It is
something else.

3670
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000

Here's the squeeze right back up back to

Here's the squeeze right back up back to
 

3673
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,709
Here's the squeeze right back up back to
this gray box. Probably bears will need

3674
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:48,719
this gray box. Probably bears will need
 

3675
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:50,310
this gray box. Probably bears will need
to defend that gray box in that thin

3676
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:50,320
to defend that gray box in that thin
 

3677
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,870
to defend that gray box in that thin
area. Failing to defend that would

3678
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:52,880
area. Failing to defend that would
 

3679
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,310
area. Failing to defend that would
probably go straight back to the upside

3680
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,320
probably go straight back to the upside
 

3681
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,950
probably go straight back to the upside
and retest the VW. And the rotation will

just keep continuing, continuing,

just keep continuing, continuing,
 

3685
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,390
just keep continuing, continuing,
continuing until they've caught enough

current IB low here.

3700
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:19,040
current IB low here.
 

3701
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,990
current IB low here.
They're attempting

3702
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:22,000
They're attempting
 

3703
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,709
They're attempting
into that old imbalance.

3704
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:24,719
into that old imbalance.
 

3705
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,390
into that old imbalance.
They've got control here if they want to

3706
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:26,400
They've got control here if they want to
 

3707
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,830
They've got control here if they want to
do it. It's just uh I don't know if

3708
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
do it. It's just uh I don't know if
 

3709
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,870
do it. It's just uh I don't know if
they've got the juice in them

3710
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:30,880
they've got the juice in them
 

3711
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,310
they've got the juice in them
because they keep forcing the lows and

3712
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:32,320
because they keep forcing the lows and
 

3713
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,790
because they keep forcing the lows and
they're not moving lower. But if the

3714
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,800
they're not moving lower. But if the
 

3715
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:41,830
they're not moving lower. But if the
bulls give up, it will snap.

3716
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:41,840

 

3717
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,430

Just the speed, the speed and size going

small cats.
 

3727
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,990
small cats.

The speed and size going through this

3733
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,189

Squeeze straight back up here. They're

Squeeze straight back up here. They're
 

3735
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:04,629
Squeeze straight back up here. They're
going to test this gray box up here.

They need to defend it, the bears,

They need to defend it, the bears,

fail breakdown. If they can't break

3744
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,320
fail breakdown. If they can't break
 

3745
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,470
fail breakdown. If they can't break
under these bears, they came flying in

3746
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:14,480
under these bears, they came flying in
 

3747
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,229
under these bears, they came flying in
at those lows and didn't get the move

3748
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:16,239
at those lows and didn't get the move
 

3749
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:20,470
at those lows and didn't get the move
that they wanted.

3751
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,910

I mean, I don't know what's considered

I mean, I don't know what's considered
 

3753
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,669
I mean, I don't know what's considered
big size now because I'm not seeing any

orders go in under hundreds and hundreds

3759
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,790

Here they go. One more attempt then to

3760
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:36,800
Here they go. One more attempt then to
 

3761
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,430
Here they go. One more attempt then to
go lower by the looks of it.

3762

Now or never for these bears, I would

3764
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:41,040
Now or never for these bears, I would
 

3765
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,950
Now or never for these bears, I would
say for last attempt to get down

3766
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:42,960
say for last attempt to get down
 

3767
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,790
say for last attempt to get down
underneath IB and then maybe down to

3768
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:44,800
underneath IB and then maybe down to
 

3769
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,550
underneath IB and then maybe down to
24,000. What's the next level? 24,200 if

3770
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:48,560
24,000. What's the next level? 24,200 if
 

3771
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,229
24,000. What's the next level? 24,200 if
they can get that snap below IB. There

3772
01:30:50,229 --> 01:30:50,239
they can get that snap below IB. There
 

3773
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:52,790
they can get that snap below IB. There
is a 200 point move under here back down

3774
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
is a 200 point move under here back down
 

3775
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,350
is a 200 point move under here back down
into this level next.

3776
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:55,360
into this level next.

01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,110
into this level next.
If it's a big if right now because

3778
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:57,120
If it's a big if right now because
 

3779
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,709
If it's a big if right now because
they're coming piling in and we're not

3780
01:30:58,709 --> 01:30:58,719
they're coming piling in and we're not
 

3781
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:00,310
they're coming piling in and we're not
moving lower. So there's absorption

3782
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,320
moving lower. So there's absorption
 

3783
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:07,590
moving lower. So there's absorption
happening on the tape here.

3784

3785
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,470

Just means you got a size down bar.

3786
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:10,480
Just means you got a size down bar.
 

3787

01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:12,159
Just means you got to size right down,
 

3789
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:15,189
Just means you got to size right down,
doesn't it?

3790
01:31:15,189 --> 01:31:15,199
doesn't it?
 

3791
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,709
doesn't it?
or you can leave it alone. If you're if

3792
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:16,719
or you can leave it alone. If you're if
 

3793
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:17,990
or you can leave it alone. If you're if
you're uncomfortable, it's also fine.

3794
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,000
you're uncomfortable, it's also fine.

both sides here at the moment. This just
 

3809

both sides here at the moment. This just
feels like a nasty two-way tape.

Get underneath initial balance and then
 

3831
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,870
Get underneath initial balance and then
there's a 200 break. If they can't do

3832
01:31:58,870 --> 01:31:58,880
there's a 200 break. If they can't do
 

3833
01:31:58,880 --> 01:31:59,990
there's a 200 break. If they can't do
that, they're going to get themselves

that, they're going to get themselves
 

3835
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,229
that, they're going to get themselves
caught. This is what fourth or fifth

3836
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:02,239
caught. This is what fourth or fifth
 

3837
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:05,110
caught. This is what fourth or fifth
attempt down here now. And they're not

01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:08,080
moving under. So there is someone here
 

3841
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,910

01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:41,040

 

3857
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,189

Yes, they're it's not just that they're

3858

Yes, they're it's not just that they're
 

3859
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:46,149
Yes, they're it's not just that they're
building liquidity. It's the amount of

3860
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:46,159
building liquidity. It's the amount of
 

3861
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,669
building liquidity. It's the amount of
size

3862
01:32:47,669 --> 01:32:47,679
size
 

3863
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,750
size
here is huge. This is not a joke. What's

3864
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:51,760
here is huge. This is not a joke. What's
 

3865
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,669
here is huge. This is not a joke. What's
happening in here is massive. These

3866
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:53,679
happening in here is massive. These
 

3867
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:57,590
happening in here is massive. These
orders are [\h__\h] huge, mate.

3868
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
orders are [\h__\h] huge, mate.
 

3869
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,030
orders are [\h__\h] huge, mate.
There you go. Told you you can't add

3870
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,040
There you go. Told you you can't add
 

3871
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,950
There you go. Told you you can't add
that much size down there and not see a

3872
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:02,960
that much size down there and not see a
 

3873
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,229
that much size down there and not see a
breakdown and get away with it.

3874
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:06,239
breakdown and get away with it.
 

3875
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:09,030
breakdown and get away with it.
Straight back to the gray box. They go.

3876
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:09,040
Straight back to the gray box. They go.
 

3877
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,189
Straight back to the gray box. They go.
And if bears don't defend this gray box,

3878
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,199
And if bears don't defend this gray box,
 

3879
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,110
And if bears don't defend this gray box,
we go on a [\h__\h] giant squeeze now

3880
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:13,120
we go on a [\h__\h] giant squeeze now
 

3881
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,790
we go on a [\h__\h] giant squeeze now
because they've all just got caught down

3882
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:14,800
because they've all just got caught down
 

3883
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,390
because they've all just got caught down
here.

3884
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:16,400
here.
 

3885
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,030
here.
So bears must defend this gray box. If

3886
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:19,040
So bears must defend this gray box. If
 

3887
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,590
So bears must defend this gray box. If
they don't defend this gray box, well, I

3888
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:21,600
they don't defend this gray box, well, I
 

3889
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,709
they don't defend this gray box, well, I
don't really know what to say. They're

3890
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:22,719
don't really know what to say. They're
 

3891
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:27,110
don't really know what to say. They're
going to get absolutely buttth hurt.

3892
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:27,120
going to get absolutely buttth hurt.
 

3893
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,790
going to get absolutely buttth hurt.
They're going to be absolutely butt hurt

3894
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
They're going to be absolutely butt hurt
 

3895
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,669
They're going to be absolutely butt hurt
if they don't defend this gray box.

3896
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
if they don't defend this gray box.
 

3897
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:36,390
if they don't defend this gray box.
So huge, huge rotation, huge rotation is

3898
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
So huge, huge rotation, huge rotation is
 

3899
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,950
So huge, huge rotation, huge rotation is
available. Both sides of this. I

3900
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:38,960
available. Both sides of this. I
 

3901
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,470
available. Both sides of this. I
wouldn't I wouldn't want to be bearish

3902
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
wouldn't I wouldn't want to be bearish
 

3903
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,310
wouldn't I wouldn't want to be bearish
at those lows, which is what they've all

3904
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:42,320
at those lows, which is what they've all
 

3905
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,229
at those lows, which is what they've all
tried to do. They've just got absolutely

3906
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:44,239
tried to do. They've just got absolutely
 

3907
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,709
tried to do. They've just got absolutely
wrecked. Oh, you think this doesn't look

3908
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:46,719
wrecked. Oh, you think this doesn't look
 

3909
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:48,950
wrecked. Oh, you think this doesn't look
big? That's a 100 points and they've got

3910
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:48,960
big? That's a 100 points and they've got
 

3911
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,189
big? That's a 100 points and they've got
thousands of orders down there.

3912
01:33:51,189 --> 01:33:51,199
thousands of orders down there.
 

3913
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:53,030
thousands of orders down there.
Thousands. Which is why I'm saying the

3914
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,040
Thousands. Which is why I'm saying the
 

3915
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:59,830
Thousands. Which is why I'm saying the
tape is insane.

3916
01:33:59,830 --> 01:33:59,840

 

3917
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,910

Absolutely insane what I'm witnessing

3918
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:01,920
Absolutely insane what I'm witnessing
 

3919
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,750
Absolutely insane what I'm witnessing
here. I don't remember seeing a tape

3920
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
here. I don't remember seeing a tape
 

3921
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:09,830
here. I don't remember seeing a tape
move like this.

3922
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:09,840

 

3923
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:18,709

Whoa.

3924
01:34:18,709 --> 01:34:18,719

 

3925
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:21,510

Gray box defended. Back to this gray

3926
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
Gray box defended. Back to this gray
 

3927
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,629
Gray box defended. Back to this gray

we're going to get until someone wins
 

3935
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:32,950
we're going to get until someone wins
this game. And these are 100 point M1

3936
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:32,960
this game. And these are 100 point M1
 

3937

01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,550
What are you looking at? I'm looking at
bookmat and the footprint. Looking at

3948
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:56,560
bookmat and the footprint. Looking at
 

3949
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:04,310

Bears have the chance here. I don't not

3958
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:34,960
Bears have the chance here. I don't not
 

3959

Bears have the chance here. I don't not
I'm not convinced yet. They have the

I'm not convinced yet. They have the
 

3961
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,550
I'm not convinced yet. They have the

chance. They've got They've got to break
 

3963
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,709
chance. They've got They've got to break
down here aggressively. They've come in

3964
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:40,719
down here aggressively. They've come in
 

3965
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:43,350
down here aggressively. They've come in
at this level we're at uh numerous times

3966
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:43,360
at this level we're at uh numerous times
 

3967

at this level we're at uh numerous times
without any success.

without any success.
 

3969
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,910
without any success.
They've got to break down aggressively

3970
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:47,920
They've got to break down aggressively
 

3971
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,510
They've got to break down aggressively
here. They've piled in again here. And

There you go. They got caught again,
 

3979
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,430
There you go. They got caught again,
guys. This is absolutely insane. Just a

01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
guys. This is absolutely insane. Just a
 

3981
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,189
guys. This is absolutely insane. Just a
casual 480 lots there by side. Just

01:36:05,189 --> 01:36:05,199
casual 480 lots there by side. Just
 

3983
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:08,070
casual 480 lots there by side. Just
squeezing straight out.

3984
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:08,080
squeezing straight out.
 

3985
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:13,189
squeezing straight out.
Absolutely insane.

3986
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199

 

3987
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,350

Absolutely insane. There's no way I'm

Absolutely insane. There's no way I'm
 

3989
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,669
Absolutely insane. There's no way I'm
touching this at this point. This is

3990
01:36:17,669 --> 01:36:17,679
touching this at this point. This is
 

3991
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:21,669
touching this at this point. This is
This is mental.

3992
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:21,679

 

3993
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,189

These are hedge funds like betting

3994
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:23,199
These are hedge funds like betting
 

3995
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:24,709
These are hedge funds like betting
against each other. So, I'm not touching

3996
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:24,719
against each other. So, I'm not touching
 

3997
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:27,510
against each other. So, I'm not touching
this until someone's clearly won. This

3998
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:27,520
this until someone's clearly won. This
 

3999
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,470
this until someone's clearly won. This
is crazy. These two gray boxes, the size

4000
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:30,480
is crazy. These two gray boxes, the size
 

4001
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,830
is crazy. These two gray boxes, the size
being traded between these is crazy.

4002
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:33,840
being traded between these is crazy.
 

4003
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,750
being traded between these is crazy.
Absolutely crazy. Once you get a

4004
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:35,760
Absolutely crazy. Once you get a
 

4005
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,390
Absolutely crazy. Once you get a
breakout from here, it's I can't

4006
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:38,400
breakout from here, it's I can't
 

4007
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,229
breakout from here, it's I can't
explain. Once you have this much size in

4008
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
explain. Once you have this much size in
 

4009
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,470
explain. Once you have this much size in
a very condensed area, a breakout from

4010
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:42,480
a very condensed area, a breakout from
 

4011
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,350
a very condensed area, a breakout from
this area can be violent. like numerous

4012
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,360
this area can be violent. like numerous
 

4013
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:50,070

Back down to this same level that bears
 

4017
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,390
Back down to this same level that bears

Back to this 480 level again as in where
 

4021
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:03,030
Back to this 480 level again as in where
that 480 lot came in. So 500.

4022
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:03,040

 

4023
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:17,189

Wow.

4024
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:17,199

 

4025
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,350

Bears have the edge, but there is a

4026
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
Bears have the edge, but there is a
 

4027
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,590
Bears have the edge, but there is a
soaking going on here. Basically, bears

4028
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
soaking going on here. Basically, bears
 

4029
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,590
soaking going on here. Basically, bears
have the edge, but they they must see a

4030
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:23,600
have the edge, but they they must see a
 

4031
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,750
have the edge, but they they must see a
breakdown sub60. Basically, they've got

4032
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:25,760
breakdown sub60. Basically, they've got
 

4033
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,750
breakdown sub60. Basically, they've got
to get sub 60 and then they get IB and

4034
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:27,760
to get sub 60 and then they get IB and
 

4035
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,669
to get sub 60 and then they get IB and
then they get a a nasty wash, I would

4036
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679
then they get a a nasty wash, I would
 

4037
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:32,070
then they get a a nasty wash, I would
expect. But at the moment they're not

4038
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
expect. But at the moment they're not
 

4039
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,629
expect. But at the moment they're not
getting that sub60 move. They're being

4040
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:34,639
getting that sub60 move. They're being
 

4041
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,790
getting that sub60 move. They're being
absorbed into 70s. Every attempt being

4042
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:36,800
absorbed into 70s. Every attempt being
 

4043
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,390
absorbed into 70s. Every attempt being
absorbed and absorbed and absorbed and

4044
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:38,400
absorbed and absorbed and absorbed and
 

4045
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,990
absorbed and absorbed and absorbed and
absorbed and back to 500s we're going to

4046
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:40,000
absorbed and back to 500s we're going to
 

4047
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,510
absorbed and back to 500s we're going to
go. And if they squeeze through here

4048
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:41,520
go. And if they squeeze through here
 

4049
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,830
go. And if they squeeze through here
then back to 40s we go very quickly. And

4050
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:43,840
then back to 40s we go very quickly. And
 

4051
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,430
then back to 40s we go very quickly. And
if they squeeze through there then all

4052
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:45,440
if they squeeze through there then all
 

4053
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,109
if they squeeze through there then all
the way back to 600s we go. And that

4054
01:37:47,109 --> 01:37:47,119
the way back to 600s we go. And that
 

4055
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,390
the way back to 600s we go. And that
might sound like nothing but we're

4056
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,400
might sound like nothing but we're
 

4057
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,870
might sound like nothing but we're
currently trading at 470. So that's 130

4058
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:50,880
currently trading at 470. So that's 130
 

4059
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,990
currently trading at 470. So that's 130
points like that can happen like that.

4060
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,000
points like that can happen like that.
 

4061
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,790
points like that can happen like that.

01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:50,800
Oh my gosh. He spent that whole time
 

4173
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,750
Oh my gosh. He spent that whole time
soaking this level here and here. Okay,

4174
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
soaking this level here and here. Okay,
 

4175
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,870
soaking this level here and here. Okay,
so if they crash IBL then I think a

4176
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:56,880
so if they crash IBL then I think a
 

4177
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,870
so if they crash IBL then I think a
bigger rotation. This huge puke is

4178
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,880
bigger rotation. This huge puke is
 

4179
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,070
bigger rotation. This huge puke is
available.

4180
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,080

 

4181
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,470

Absolutely insane the amount of volume

4182
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:04,480
Absolutely insane the amount of volume
 

4183
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:09,590
Absolutely insane the amount of volume
traded there. Absolutely insane.

4184
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600

 

4185
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,669

This is way beyond what I'm willing to

4186
01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:11,679
This is way beyond what I'm willing to
 

4187
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:13,510
This is way beyond what I'm willing to
do right now. When when I see players

4188
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:13,520
do right now. When when I see players
 

4189
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,990
do right now. When when I see players
this big fighting, it's very, very

4190
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:16,000
this big fighting, it's very, very
 

4191
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,669
this big fighting, it's very, very
scary. Once one gets out the way, which

4192
01:42:17,669 --> 01:42:17,679
scary. Once one gets out the way, which
 

4193
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:19,510
scary. Once one gets out the way, which
we're starting to see now, IBL, we can

4194
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:19,520
we're starting to see now, IBL, we can
 

4195
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,830
we're starting to see now, IBL, we can
we can expect expansion. Again, the

4196
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:21,840
we can expect expansion. Again, the
 

4197
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,149
we can expect expansion. Again, the
problem now is you're trading. Yes,

4198
01:42:24,149 --> 01:42:24,159
problem now is you're trading. Yes,
 

4199
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,550
problem now is you're trading. Yes,
we're trading a downtrend, but we're way

4200
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:26,560
we're trading a downtrend, but we're way
 

4201
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,229
we're trading a downtrend, but we're way
way way outside of reasonable areas. If

4202
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:30,239
way way outside of reasonable areas. If
 

4203
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:33,270
way way outside of reasonable areas. If
we think about dailies,

4204
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280
we think about dailies,
 

4205
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,109
we think about dailies,
right

4206
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:37,119

 

4207
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:40,310

here is your bowl. Here's the shelf.

01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:40,320
here is your bowl. Here's the shelf.
 

4209
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,590
here is your bowl. Here's the shelf.
They've let go of the shelf. The

4210
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:41,600
They've let go of the shelf. The
 

4211
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,229
They've let go of the shelf. The
rotation is available,

4212
01:42:44,229 --> 01:42:44,239
rotation is available,
 

4213
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,149
rotation is available,
but really, we need the bowl to be

4214
01:42:46,149 --> 01:42:46,159
but really, we need the bowl to be
 

4215
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:47,510
but really, we need the bowl to be
catching up, and we're not going to see

4216
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:47,520
catching up, and we're not going to see
 

4217
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,550
catching up, and we're not going to see
that for a day or two.

4218
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:50,560
that for a day or two.
 

4219
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,310
that for a day or two.

shorting
 

4237
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,910
shorting
down here is very risky but we have got

4238
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:15,920
down here is very risky but we have got
 

4239
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,750
down here is very risky but we have got
this GlobeEx shelf which is holding

4240
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:17,760
this GlobeEx shelf which is holding
 

4241
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,830
this GlobeEx shelf which is holding
currently but this just seems uh it's a

4242
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:21,840
currently but this just seems uh it's a
 

4243
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,629
currently but this just seems uh it's a
very very risky Risky day to be trading

4244
01:43:24,629 --> 01:43:24,639
very very risky Risky day to be trading
 

4245
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,030
very very risky Risky day to be trading
trying to short the lows now. And it's a

trying to short the lows now. And it's a
 

4247

very risky day to be trying to buy.
 

4249
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:32,629
very risky day to be trying to buy.
We're going back to this guy's level.

4250
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:32,639
We're going back to this guy's level.
 

4251
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:38,550
We're going back to this guy's level.
Did he just save it? [laughter]

4252
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:38,560

 

4253
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:42,629

Where was his big order before? 270 90

4254
01:43:42,629 --> 01:43:42,639
Where was his big order before? 270 90
 

4255
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:44,229
Where was his big order before? 270 90
again.

4256
01:43:44,229 --> 01:43:44,239
again.
 

4257
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:47,590
again.
Flipping heck.

4258
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:47,600
Flipping heck.
 

4259
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,590
Flipping heck.
Yeah, just a 400 point initial balance

4260
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:49,600
Yeah, just a 400 point initial balance
 

4261
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,510
Yeah, just a 400 point initial balance
range. I know. I know.

4262
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:53,520
range. I know. I know.
 

4263
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,950
range. I know. I know.
Well, look at this reaction of five

4264
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:54,960
Well, look at this reaction of five
 

4265
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,270
Well, look at this reaction of five
below.

4266
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:57,280
below.
 

4267
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,990
below.
That's just under 100 points there. That

4268
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:00,000
That's just under 100 points there. That
 

4269
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,629
That's just under 100 points there. That
straight that straight slingshot.

4270
01:44:02,629 --> 01:44:02,639
straight that straight slingshot.
 

4271
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:10,070
straight that straight slingshot.
It's mental, isn't it? Back towards PC.

4272
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:10,080

 

4273
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,430

I don't know what to say here, folks.

4274
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
I don't know what to say here, folks.
 

4275
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,510
I don't know what to say here, folks.
This is

4276
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:13,520
This is
 

4277
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,430
This is
It's very rare I see a market moving

4278
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:15,440
It's very rare I see a market moving
 

4279
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,030
It's very rare I see a market moving
this much size this quickly, but that's

4280
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:17,040
this much size this quickly, but that's
 

4281
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,830
this much size this quickly, but that's
what I'm watching at the moment.

4282
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:19,840
what I'm watching at the moment.
 

4283
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,910
what I'm watching at the moment.
Both sides getting hurt at the moment. I

4284
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:21,920
Both sides getting hurt at the moment. I
 

4285
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,830
Both sides getting hurt at the moment. I
would say bears have got the edge.

4286
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:23,840
would say bears have got the edge.
 

4287
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,430
would say bears have got the edge.
They've got the higher time frame edge.

4288
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:25,440
They've got the higher time frame edge.
 

4289
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,950
They've got the higher time frame edge.
We haven't got an edge as a bear

4290
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:26,960
We haven't got an edge as a bear
 

4291
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,870
We haven't got an edge as a bear
necessarily, lower time frame because

4292
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:28,880
necessarily, lower time frame because
 

4293
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,030
necessarily, lower time frame because
we've lost location, but bears have got

4294
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:31,040
we've lost location, but bears have got
 

4295
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,470
we've lost location, but bears have got
their edge higher time frame. And if

4296
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:32,480
their edge higher time frame. And if
 

4297
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:38,950
their edge higher time frame. And if
they want to get a breakdown, they will.

4298
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:38,960

 

4299
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,830

This 500's big level.

4300
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:41,840
This 500's big level.
 

4301
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,390
This 500's big level.
This is where that guy basically soaked

4302
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:44,400
This is where that guy basically soaked
 

4303
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,109
This is where that guy basically soaked
there to 70 there to 500 to 70. that

there to 70 there to 500 to 70. that
kind of area for a long time in this

4306
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:48,880
kind of area for a long time in this
 

4307
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,950
kind of area for a long time in this
gray box. If bulls reclaim this, then

4308
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:50,960
gray box. If bulls reclaim this, then
 

4309
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,790
gray box. If bulls reclaim this, then
they're going to try and hit this as a

01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:52,800
they're going to try and hit this as a
 

4311
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,229
they're going to try and hit this as a
rotation. If they reclaim that next

4312
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:54,239
rotation. If they reclaim that next
 

4313
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:57,189
rotation. If they reclaim that next
level as rotation, remember bears are in

4314
01:44:57,189 --> 01:44:57,199
level as rotation, remember bears are in
 

4315
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:59,109
level as rotation, remember bears are in
control of this market on the higher

control of this market on the higher
 

4317
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:00,870

4319
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,350

kind of moment in this market. They are

4320
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
kind of moment in this market. They are
 

4321
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,270
kind of moment in this market. They are
adding liquidity lower now all the way

4322
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280
adding liquidity lower now all the way
 

4323
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:08,149
adding liquidity lower now all the way
down to 400s.

4324
01:45:08,149 --> 01:45:08,159
down to 400s.
 

4325
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:09,350
down to 400s.
First time I've seen them sort of come

4326
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:09,360
First time I've seen them sort of come
 

4327
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,870
First time I've seen them sort of come
in the book more aggressively down

4328
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:10,880

a short down here. Just cannot. And I

seeing. Not in a two-way tape. The bears

4464
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:52,560
seeing. Not in a two-way tape. The bears
 

4465
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:56,070

might get a big panic flush today, but I

We would have needed to be short on pops

4468

We would have needed to be short on pops
 

4469
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,669
We would have needed to be short on pops
and drive out this morning which we

4470
01:49:59,669 --> 01:49:59,679
and drive out this morning which we
 

4471
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,510
and drive out this morning which we
didn't see this. This was it. I wanted

4472
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:01,520
didn't see this. This was it. I wanted
 

4473
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,510
didn't see this. This was it. I wanted
to get short up here. It's very much

4474
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:03,520
to get short up here. It's very much
 

4475
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,189
to get short up here. It's very much
like the last two days. There's just not

4476
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:05,199
like the last two days. There's just not
 

4477
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:07,109
like the last two days. There's just not
been a enough strength at the market

4478
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:07,119
been a enough strength at the market
 

4479
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:09,510
been a enough strength at the market
open to give us prime location. It's

4480
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:09,520
open to give us prime location. It's
 

4481
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,950
open to give us prime location. It's
just unfortunate. So, we have to stick

4482
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:10,960
just unfortunate. So, we have to stick
 

4483
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:17,910
just unfortunate. So, we have to stick

01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,149
Strong selling on the tape here. They
are piling into this. Bulls are all

4598
01:53:24,149 --> 01:53:24,159
are piling into this. Bulls are all
 

4599
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:25,430

This thing can really start

4604
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:31,040
This thing can really start
 

4605
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,109
This thing can really start
getting very, very, very panicky. If it

4606
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:33,119
getting very, very, very panicky. If it
 

4607
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:35,030
getting very, very, very panicky. If it
fails to reclaim any levels, this can

4608
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:35,040
fails to reclaim any levels, this can
 

4609
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,189
fails to reclaim any levels, this can
get very, very panicky. Think how many

4610
01:53:37,189 --> 01:53:37,199
get very, very panicky. Think how many
 

4611
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:39,109
get very, very panicky. Think how many
people have been trying to soak this or

4612
01:53:39,109 --> 01:53:39,119
people have been trying to soak this or
 

4613
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:40,390
people have been trying to soak this or
think about that player been trying to

4614
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,400
think about that player been trying to
 

4615
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:43,189
think about that player been trying to
soak it that whole time. If he doesn't

4616
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:43,199
soak it that whole time. If he doesn't
 

4617
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:45,430
soak it that whole time. If he doesn't
if he can't get a reclaim here, right?

4618
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:45,440
if he can't get a reclaim here, right?
 

4619
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:55,669
if he can't get a reclaim here, right?
He's stuck, isn't he?

4620
01:53:55,669 --> 01:53:55,679

 

4621
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:57,430

4627
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:03,750
37s to 40s, that kind of level. That's
where sellers will want to protect.

01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:24,800

 

4645
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:32,870

But we've let go of everything.

4646
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:32,880

 

4647
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:36,709

More selling coming in here at the lows.

4648
01:54:36,709 --> 01:54:36,719
More selling coming in here at the lows.
 

4649
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:38,310
More selling coming in here at the lows.
We're running out of things to look for.

4650
01:54:38,310 --> 01:54:38,320
We're running out of things to look for.
 

4651
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:42,550
We're running out of things to look for.
I mean, I would say

4652
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:42,560

 

4653
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:48,070

sort of 150s, 160s we have is not out of

4654
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:48,080
sort of 150s, 160s we have is not out of
 

4655
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:54,709
sort of 150s, 160s we have is not out of
the question right now.

4656
01:54:54,709 --> 01:54:54,719

 

4657
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:56,470

Is not out of the question right now.

4658
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:56,480
Is not out of the question right now.
 

4659
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,470
Is not out of the question right now.
150s down here is not out of the

4660
01:54:58,470 --> 01:54:58,480
150s down here is not out of the
 

4661
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:03,910
150s down here is not out of the
question. Not at all.

4662
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:03,920

 

4663
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,830

you would if Kevin what I'd say is if

4664
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:05,840
you would if Kevin what I'd say is if
 

4665
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,510
you would if Kevin what I'd say is if
you're going to look for a buy at least

4666
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:07,520
you're going to look for a buy at least
 

4667
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:10,229
you're going to look for a buy at least
let it reclaim a level at least let it

4668
01:55:10,229 --> 01:55:10,239
let it reclaim a level at least let it
 

4669
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:11,830
let it reclaim a level at least let it
show you something would be what I'd say

4670
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:11,840
show you something would be what I'd say
 

4671
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,070
show you something would be what I'd say
or at least let it trap someone or do

4672
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:14,080
or at least let it trap someone or do
 

4673
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:16,229
or at least let it trap someone or do
something because otherwise it's going

4674
01:55:16,229 --> 01:55:16,239
something because otherwise it's going
 

4675
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:17,990
something because otherwise it's going
to be very easy to get caught like if

4676
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:18,000
to be very easy to get caught like if
 

4677
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,229
to be very easy to get caught like if
you start reclaiming IB sure like by all

4678
01:55:22,229 --> 01:55:22,239
you start reclaiming IB sure like by all
 

4679
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,830
you start reclaiming IB sure like by all
means it makes sense right that's all

4680
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:23,840
means it makes sense right that's all
 

4681
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,709
means it makes sense right that's all
I'm saying to you but if you're bidding

4682
01:55:26,709 --> 01:55:26,719
I'm saying to you but if you're bidding
 

4683
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:29,270
I'm saying to you but if you're bidding
here okay you might have got lucky right

4684
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:29,280
here okay you might have got lucky right
 

4685
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,030
here okay you might have got lucky right
now but they can wash this down lower if

4686
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:31,040
now but they can wash this down lower if
 

4687
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:42,790
now but they can wash this down lower if
they want.

4688
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:42,800

 

4689
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:45,910

Fix new high day there. Just broke out a

4690
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:45,920
Fix new high day there. Just broke out a
 

4691
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:47,830
Fix new high day there. Just broke out a
new high day there. Fix. Can it hold its

4692
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:47,840
new high day there. Fix. Can it hold its
 

4693
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:55,830
new high day there. Fix. Can it hold its
gains?

4694
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:55,840

 

4695
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,149

400 over under here. Big battle around

4696
01:55:58,149 --> 01:55:58,159
400 over under here. Big battle around
 

4697
01:55:58,159 --> 01:56:01,030
400 over under here. Big battle around
this 400 level. Remember, there's not

4698
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,040
this 400 level. Remember, there's not
 

4699
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,709
this 400 level. Remember, there's not
much here until we get way down here.

4700
01:56:02,709 --> 01:56:02,719
much here until we get way down here.
 

4701
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:05,030
much here until we get way down here.
Now, I can't really see much. Let me

4702
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,040
Now, I can't really see much. Let me
 

4703
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,470
Now, I can't really see much. Let me
just check the volume profile. Yeah,

4704
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:06,480
just check the volume profile. Yeah,
 

4705
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:07,990
just check the volume profile. Yeah,
we're very thin here. I'd say the next

4706
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:08,000
we're very thin here. I'd say the next
 

4707
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,790
we're very thin here. I'd say the next
little bump in the road is sort of 300

4708
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
little bump in the road is sort of 300
 

4709
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,910
little bump in the road is sort of 300
300 to 240 based on the yearly profile

4710
01:56:13,910 --> 01:56:13,920
300 to 240 based on the yearly profile
 

4711
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,750
300 to 240 based on the yearly profile
and then uh 150. So, 300 to 240. We can

4712
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:17,760
and then uh 150. So, 300 to 240. We can
 

4713
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:21,510
and then uh 150. So, 300 to 240. We can
just pop a little box in. 300

4714
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:21,520
just pop a little box in. 300
 

4715
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:24,310
just pop a little box in. 300
if Trading View wants to let me. 300 to

4716
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:24,320
if Trading View wants to let me. 300 to
 

4717
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:27,109
if Trading View wants to let me. 300 to
240.

4718
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:27,119
240.
 

4719
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:28,629
240.
Okay, that's just based on the yearly

4720
01:56:28,629 --> 01:56:28,639
Okay, that's just based on the yearly
 

4721
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:30,149
Okay, that's just based on the yearly
profile. There's a little little bump in

4722
01:56:30,149 --> 01:56:30,159
profile. There's a little little bump in
 

4723
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:31,589
profile. There's a little little bump in
the road there. Right, here's your IB

4724
01:56:31,589 --> 01:56:31,599
the road there. Right, here's your IB
 

4725
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:33,510
the road there. Right, here's your IB
retest.

4726
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:33,520
retest.
 

4727
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,589
retest.
This is

4728
01:56:35,589 --> 01:56:35,599
This is
 

4729
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:37,990
This is
key. Now on to what happens next. So

4730
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:38,000
key. Now on to what happens next. So
 

4731
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,990
key. Now on to what happens next. So
far, bears are defending that IB retest,

4732
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:40,000
far, bears are defending that IB retest,
 

4733
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,350
far, bears are defending that IB retest,
aren't they? And the big level is really

4734
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:41,360
aren't they? And the big level is really
 

4735
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:45,350
aren't they? And the big level is really
up there 60s.

4736
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:45,360

 

4737
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,589

So potential trend day if they defend

4738
01:56:47,589 --> 01:56:47,599
So potential trend day if they defend
 

4739
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:51,830
So potential trend day if they defend
that IB.

4740
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:51,840

 

4741
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,830

If we go get back through the initial

4742
01:56:53,830 --> 01:56:53,840
If we go get back through the initial
 

4743
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,550
If we go get back through the initial
balance, potential squeeze for a test up

4744
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:56,560
balance, potential squeeze for a test up
 

4745
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:15,589
balance, potential squeeze for a test up
to 460 is possible.

4746
01:57:15,589 --> 01:57:15,599

 

4747
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:31,350

Not seeing too much excess anywhere yet.

4748
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:31,360

 

4749
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:39,030

Not seeing too much excess yet.

4750
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,040

 

4751
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,950

Here's IB.

4752
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:40,960
Here's IB.
 

4753
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,750
Here's IB.
Test of IB again.

4754
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:43,760
Test of IB again.
 

4755
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,550
Test of IB again.
No drive through it. It's a big level.

4756
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:46,560
No drive through it. It's a big level.
 

4757
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,790
No drive through it. It's a big level.
It is a big level. That initial balance.

4758
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:50,800

 

4759
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:53,669

It's not Apex, Dean. It's not Apex. All

4760
01:57:53,669 --> 01:57:53,679
It's not Apex, Dean. It's not Apex. All
 

4761
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:55,669
It's not Apex, Dean. It's not Apex. All
right. There's a Cloudflare issue. It's

4762
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:55,679
right. There's a Cloudflare issue. It's
 

4763
01:57:55,679 --> 01:58:00,550
right. There's a Cloudflare issue. It's
not Apex. It's TPT as well. It's most

4764
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:00,560
not Apex. It's TPT as well. It's most
 

4765
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,950
not Apex. It's TPT as well. It's most
websites currently, 20% of all websites

you look at currently are not working.

4768
01:58:05,109 --> 01:58:05,119

4769
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:07,109
you look at currently are not working.
No different to when AWS went down a few

4770
01:58:07,109 --> 01:58:07,119
No different to when AWS went down a few
 

4771
01:58:07,119 --> 01:58:13,510
No different to when AWS went down a few
weeks ago.

4772
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:13,520

 

4773
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,189

Uh yeah. Oh, definitely if if you get

4774
01:58:15,189 --> 01:58:15,199
Uh yeah. Oh, definitely if if you get
 

4775
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:17,510
Uh yeah. Oh, definitely if if you get
above here, Kevin. Yeah. If you do one

4776
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:17,520
above here, Kevin. Yeah. If you do one
 

4777
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,669
above here, Kevin. Yeah. If you do one
of these, that's probably a buy. Yes.

4778
01:58:19,669 --> 01:58:19,679
of these, that's probably a buy. Yes.
 

4779
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:21,830
of these, that's probably a buy. Yes.
But remember, it's counter trend, right?

4780
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:21,840
But remember, it's counter trend, right?
 

4781
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,310
But remember, it's counter trend, right?
Main look is down. So, anything you take

4782
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:24,320
Main look is down. So, anything you take
 

4783
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,149
Main look is down. So, anything you take
long today is a squeeze. It's nothing

4784
01:58:26,149 --> 01:58:26,159
long today is a squeeze. It's nothing
 

4785
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:27,990
long today is a squeeze. It's nothing
more than a squeeze. That's all I'm

4786
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,000
more than a squeeze. That's all I'm
 

4787
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,310
more than a squeeze. That's all I'm
trying to say to you. You're playing the

4788
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:30,320
trying to say to you. You're playing the
 

4789
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:31,750
trying to say to you. You're playing the
hardest trade in the book. Here's your

4790
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:31,760
hardest trade in the book. Here's your
 

4791
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:38,790
hardest trade in the book. Here's your
initial balance

4792
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:38,800

 

4793
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,790

through here. We can really get going up

4794
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:40,800
through here. We can really get going up
 

4795
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,550
through here. We can really get going up
to that PC. And then how we at there

4796
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:42,560
to that PC. And then how we at there
 

4797
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:45,270
to that PC. And then how we at there
becomes key. Here's PC. So, squeeze

4798
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:45,280
becomes key. Here's PC. So, squeeze
 

4799
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,750
becomes key. Here's PC. So, squeeze
through IB. I'm in this longed out up to

4800
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:47,760
through IB. I'm in this longed out up to
 

4801
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:54,390
through IB. I'm in this longed out up to
PC almost there. 70s partial here.

4802
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:54,400
PC almost there. 70s partial here.
 

4803
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,149
PC almost there. 70s partial here.
All right, I let it reclaim and then I

4804
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159
All right, I let it reclaim and then I
 

4805
01:58:56,159 --> 01:59:01,589
All right, I let it reclaim and then I
got long.

4806
01:59:01,589 --> 01:59:01,599

 

4807
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:04,229

Really nice. So into PC

4808
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:04,239
Really nice. So into PC
 

4809
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:06,070
Really nice. So into PC
taking partial here. Let's see if we can

4810
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:06,080
taking partial here. Let's see if we can
 

4811
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,990
taking partial here. Let's see if we can
get going. If we get lucky, let's

4812
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:08,000
get going. If we get lucky, let's
 

4813
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,070
get going. If we get lucky, let's
counter trend. So I took after we

4814
01:59:10,070 --> 01:59:10,080
counter trend. So I took after we
 

4815
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,830
counter trend. So I took after we
reclaimed. If we get very lucky, we go

4816
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:11,840
reclaimed. If we get very lucky, we go
 

4817
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,550
reclaimed. If we get very lucky, we go
VWAP. We'd have to be very lucky. We are

4818
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:14,560
VWAP. We'd have to be very lucky. We are
 

4819
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,310
VWAP. We'd have to be very lucky. We are
starting to see that on the tape. Only

4820
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:16,320
starting to see that on the tape. Only
 

4821
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,830
starting to see that on the tape. Only
worries me is there not not that much

4822
01:59:17,830 --> 01:59:17,840
worries me is there not not that much
 

4823
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:20,709
worries me is there not not that much
excess at the lows right now. Here's PC.

4824
01:59:20,709 --> 01:59:20,719
excess at the lows right now. Here's PC.
 

4825
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:21,910
excess at the lows right now. Here's PC.
So, battle here. So, you'd want a

4826
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:21,920
So, battle here. So, you'd want a
 

4827
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:23,910
So, battle here. So, you'd want a
pullback to hold initial balance. Now,

4828
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:23,920
pullback to hold initial balance. Now,
 

4829
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:25,189
pullback to hold initial balance. Now,
if we're actually going to set something

4830
01:59:25,189 --> 01:59:25,199
if we're actually going to set something
 

4831
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:26,709
if we're actually going to set something
more, but again, this is just a counter

4832
01:59:26,709 --> 01:59:26,719
more, but again, this is just a counter
 

4833
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:28,870
more, but again, this is just a counter
trend squeeze. They can absolutely shut

4834
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:28,880
trend squeeze. They can absolutely shut
 

4835
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,870
trend squeeze. They can absolutely shut
this door and come back down to lows.

4836
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:30,880
this door and come back down to lows.
 

4837
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:36,229
this door and come back down to lows.
They can do that. No problem at all.

4838
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:36,239

 

4839
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:38,790

Beautiful. If we get really lucky, we're

4840
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:38,800
Beautiful. If we get really lucky, we're
 

4841
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:41,830
Beautiful. If we get really lucky, we're
going to get up here. Five. Where's this

4842
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:41,840
going to get up here. Five. Where's this
 

4843
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,070
going to get up here. Five. Where's this
edge? 520s. 540s 570s.

4844
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:46,080
edge? 520s. 540s 570s.
 

4845
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,229
edge? 520s. 540s 570s.
I'm down to tiny size now. So, as long

4846
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:48,239
I'm down to tiny size now. So, as long
 

4847
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:51,270
I'm down to tiny size now. So, as long
on the breakthrough IB,

4848
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:51,280
on the breakthrough IB,
 

4849
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,870
on the breakthrough IB,
I want to see it hold this. Failing to

4850
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:52,880
I want to see it hold this. Failing to
 

4851
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:55,109
I want to see it hold this. Failing to
hold this, I will cut under 70s. Here we

4852
01:59:55,109 --> 01:59:55,119
hold this, I will cut under 70s. Here we
 

4853
01:59:55,119 --> 01:59:56,709
hold this, I will cut under 70s. Here we
go. If we can get this, we get really

4854
01:59:56,709 --> 01:59:56,719
go. If we can get this, we get really
 

4855
01:59:56,719 --> 01:59:59,990
go. If we can get this, we get really
lucky. This be the IB rotation.

4856
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:00,000
lucky. This be the IB rotation.
 

4857
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,950
lucky. This be the IB rotation.
Look below and fail.

4858
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:04,960

 

4859
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:06,390

Hardest trade in the book here, guys,

4860
02:00:06,390 --> 02:00:06,400
Hardest trade in the book here, guys,
 

4861
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,109
Hardest trade in the book here, guys,
because a counter trend. It's annoying.

4862
02:00:09,109 --> 02:00:09,119
because a counter trend. It's annoying.
 

4863
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,310
because a counter trend. It's annoying.
I've had three trades today and they've

4864
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:10,320
I've had three trades today and they've
 

4865
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:11,589
I've had three trades today and they've
all been counter trend, but it is what

4866
02:00:11,589 --> 02:00:11,599
all been counter trend, but it is what
 

4867
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:15,669
all been counter trend, but it is what
it is.

4868
02:00:15,669 --> 02:00:15,679

 

4869
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:23,830

So into this psychological level 500.

4870
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:23,840

 

4871
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:28,310

Come on. Bit of selling here.

4872
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:28,320
Come on. Bit of selling here.
 

4873
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,830
Come on. Bit of selling here.
It's a big squeeze. We can drop right

4874
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:29,840
It's a big squeeze. We can drop right
 

4875
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,229
It's a big squeeze. We can drop right
back down. So I'm down to tiny tiny tiny

4876
02:00:32,229 --> 02:00:32,239
back down. So I'm down to tiny tiny tiny
 

4877
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:34,070
back down. So I'm down to tiny tiny tiny
tiny size. It's either gives me

4878
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:34,080
tiny size. It's either gives me
 

4879
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:36,070
tiny size. It's either gives me
something else or it doesn't. It's a

4880
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:36,080
something else or it doesn't. It's a
 

4881
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:40,950
something else or it doesn't. It's a
nice trade either way.

4882
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:40,960

 

4883
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,790

Okay, back into this pocket. It needs to

4884
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:42,800
Okay, back into this pocket. It needs to
 

4885
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,470
Okay, back into this pocket. It needs to
find a base here. If it's going to do

4886
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:44,480
find a base here. If it's going to do
 

4887
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,390
find a base here. If it's going to do
any more damage upside, it's got to find

4888
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:46,400
any more damage upside, it's got to find
 

4889
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,870
any more damage upside, it's got to find
a base between here. You don't really

4890
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:48,880
a base between here. You don't really
 

4891
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,709
a base between here. You don't really
want it to come back to IB. You'd want

4892
02:00:50,709 --> 02:00:50,719
want it to come back to IB. You'd want
 

4893
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:52,390
want it to come back to IB. You'd want
it to protect this level. If we're going

4894
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:52,400
it to protect this level. If we're going
 

4895
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,870
it to protect this level. If we're going
to move any further upside, you'd want

4896
02:00:54,870 --> 02:00:54,880
to move any further upside, you'd want
 

4897
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:57,430
to move any further upside, you'd want
to see it protect this level. And what

4898
02:00:57,430 --> 02:00:57,440
to see it protect this level. And what
 

4899
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,750
to see it protect this level. And what
we would be targeting is the VWAP

4900
02:00:59,750 --> 02:00:59,760
we would be targeting is the VWAP
 

4901
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,669
we would be targeting is the VWAP
because it's the initial balance trade.

4902
02:01:01,669 --> 02:01:01,679
because it's the initial balance trade.
 

4903
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:04,149
because it's the initial balance trade.
All right. So far, protecting nicely.

4904
02:01:04,149 --> 02:01:04,159
All right. So far, protecting nicely.
 

4905
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:06,629
All right. So far, protecting nicely.
Psychological number number 500. If we

4906
02:01:06,629 --> 02:01:06,639
Psychological number number 500. If we
 

4907
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:08,070
Psychological number number 500. If we
break through that, there's a potential

4908
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:08,080
break through that, there's a potential
 

4909
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:10,790
break through that, there's a potential
bigger move here. Here we go. Come on

4910
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:10,800
bigger move here. Here we go. Come on
 

4911
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:15,589
bigger move here. Here we go. Come on
then, baby.

4913
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:18,790

Be careful how much I make here.

4914
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:18,800
Be careful how much I make here.
 

4915
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,950
Be careful how much I make here.

02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:00,149
There's a big battle going on here.
There's excess at this high. Can we

4952
02:02:00,149 --> 02:02:00,159
There's excess at this high. Can we
 

4953
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:03,430
There's excess at this high. Can we
break these 40s and get up to VWAP?

4954
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:03,440
break these 40s and get up to VWAP?
 

4955
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:06,070
break these 40s and get up to VWAP?
I'll move my stop up here. Let me move

4956
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:06,080
I'll move my stop up here. Let me move
 

4957
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:10,790
I'll move my stop up here. Let me move
my stop. There we go.

4958
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800

 

4959
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,750

So, we need to soak this

4960
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:13,760
So, we need to soak this
 

4961
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:17,589
So, we need to soak this
otherwise I'm out.

4962
02:02:17,589 --> 02:02:17,599

 

4963
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:20,229

Let it develop for a second.

4964
02:02:20,229 --> 02:02:20,239
Let it develop for a second.
 

4965
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:21,830
Let it develop for a second.
Yeah, patient pays. That's it. We just

4966
02:02:21,830 --> 02:02:21,840
Yeah, patient pays. That's it. We just
 

4967
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,669
Yeah, patient pays. That's it. We just
trade when the momentum is there, not

4968
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:23,679
trade when the momentum is there, not
 

4969
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:25,270
trade when the momentum is there, not
when it's not there. We don't guess and

4970
02:02:25,270 --> 02:02:25,280
when it's not there. We don't guess and
 

4971
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:26,790
when it's not there. We don't guess and
go against it. We trade it when it's

4972
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:26,800
go against it. We trade it when it's
 

4973
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:29,270
go against it. We trade it when it's
there. And we pay ourselves, especially

4974
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,280
there. And we pay ourselves, especially
 

4975
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,189
there. And we pay ourselves, especially
when we're counter trend. You have to

4976
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:31,199
when we're counter trend. You have to
 

4977
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:34,709
when we're counter trend. You have to
pay yourself. 20s here.

4978
02:02:34,709 --> 02:02:34,719
pay yourself. 20s here.
 

4979
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:36,629
pay yourself. 20s here.
If we can get through this and 40s, then

4980
02:02:36,629 --> 02:02:36,639
If we can get through this and 40s, then
 

4981
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:39,430
If we can get through this and 40s, then
I think we can go up to the 870s. VW

4982
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:39,440
I think we can go up to the 870s. VW
 

4983
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:42,550
I think we can go up to the 870s. VW
would be my target here.

4984
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:42,560
would be my target here.
 

4985
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,870
would be my target here.
We can soak that gray box. I'm I'm in

4986
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:44,880
We can soak that gray box. I'm I'm in
 

4987
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,550
We can soak that gray box. I'm I'm in

4988
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:46,560

4989
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,629

Basically, fail point control. I'm out
 

4991

aggressive buying here on the tape. If
 

5021
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:20,870
aggressive buying here on the tape. If
we don't move higher, it means there's a

5022
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:20,880
we don't move higher, it means there's a
 

5023
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,070
we don't move higher, it means there's a
passive seller sat in this old

02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:22,080
passive seller sat in this old
 

5025

started covering. I started watching it
on the tape. So, I'm long here for that

5104
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:53,440
on the tape. So, I'm long here for that
 

5105
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:55,189
on the tape. So, I'm long here for that
move. I really wanted to get VWOP

5106
02:04:55,189 --> 02:04:55,199
move. I really wanted to get VWOP
 

5107
02:04:55,199 --> 02:04:57,189
move. I really wanted to get VWOP
because the traditional trade is a look

5108
02:04:57,189 --> 02:04:57,199
because the traditional trade is a look
 

5109
02:04:57,199 --> 02:04:58,629
because the traditional trade is a look
below initial balance and a trade back

5110
02:04:58,629 --> 02:04:58,639
below initial balance and a trade back
 

5111
02:04:58,639 --> 02:05:01,109
below initial balance and a trade back
to VWOP. It might still happen, right?

5112
02:05:01,109 --> 02:05:01,119
to VWOP. It might still happen, right?
 

5113
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:03,189
to VWOP. It might still happen, right?
So, I had lots of reasons. Look below

5114
02:05:03,189 --> 02:05:03,199
So, I had lots of reasons. Look below
 

5115
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:06,550
So, I had lots of reasons. Look below
and fail. Reclaim of IB held this even

5116
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:06,560
and fail. Reclaim of IB held this even
 

5117
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:09,510
and fail. Reclaim of IB held this even
better. And the sellers were from 440 to

5118
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:09,520
better. And the sellers were from 440 to
 

5119
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,510
better. And the sellers were from 440 to
400. I could see it on the book. I can

5120
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:11,520
400. I could see it on the book. I can
 

5121
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:13,189
400. I could see it on the book. I can
try and

5122
02:05:13,189 --> 02:05:13,199
try and
 

5123
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:15,189
try and
show you here.

5124
02:05:15,189 --> 02:05:15,199
show you here.
 

5125
02:05:15,199 --> 02:05:17,830
show you here.
All right. This here

5126
02:05:17,830 --> 02:05:17,840
All right. This here
 

5127
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:20,629
All right. This here
was the strong selling. All right.

5128
02:05:20,629 --> 02:05:20,639
was the strong selling. All right.
 

5129
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:22,470
was the strong selling. All right.
Buyers got stuck. Buyers got stuck.

5130
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:22,480
Buyers got stuck. Buyers got stuck.
 

5131
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,149
Buyers got stuck. Buyers got stuck.
Buyers got stuck. Buyers got stuck.

5132
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:24,159
Buyers got stuck. Buyers got stuck.
 

5133
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:25,669
Buyers got stuck. Buyers got stuck.
Buyers got stuck. So, I was waiting,

5134
02:05:25,669 --> 02:05:25,679
Buyers got stuck. So, I was waiting,
 

5135
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:26,870
Buyers got stuck. So, I was waiting,
waiting, waiting, waiting because I

5136
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:26,880
waiting, waiting, waiting because I
 

5137
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,149
waiting, waiting, waiting because I
didn't know if they'd flush this back

5138
02:05:28,149 --> 02:05:28,159
didn't know if they'd flush this back
 

5139
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:30,310
didn't know if they'd flush this back
down. But once we traded here, look what

5140
02:05:30,310 --> 02:05:30,320
down. But once we traded here, look what
 

5141
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:32,310
down. But once we traded here, look what
happened. These sellers stopped out.

5142
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:32,320
happened. These sellers stopped out.
 

5143
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:34,550
happened. These sellers stopped out.
Boom. It's their pain. I'm always using

5144
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:34,560
Boom. It's their pain. I'm always using
 

5145
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,270
Boom. It's their pain. I'm always using
someone's pain. Always, always, always

5146
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:37,280
someone's pain. Always, always, always
 

5147
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:42,950
someone's pain. Always, always, always
using someone's pain for my move.

5148
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:42,960

 

5149
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,470

There you go. VWAP tag. So, if I was a

5150
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:44,480
There you go. VWAP tag. So, if I was a
 

5151
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,910
There you go. VWAP tag. So, if I was a
bit more patient, would have got it. But

5152
02:05:45,910 --> 02:05:45,920
bit more patient, would have got it. But
 

5153
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:47,109
bit more patient, would have got it. But
like I said, don't want to be a dick for

5154
02:05:47,109 --> 02:05:47,119
like I said, don't want to be a dick for
 

5155
02:05:47,119 --> 02:05:49,430
like I said, don't want to be a dick for
a tick. So, that IB to VWAP trade played

5156
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:49,440
a tick. So, that IB to VWAP trade played
 

5157
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,990
a tick. So, that IB to VWAP trade played
out.

5158
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:52,000

 

5159
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,149

Alex, how do I know the most of the

5160
02:05:54,149 --> 02:05:54,159
Alex, how do I know the most of the
 

5161
02:05:54,159 --> 02:05:56,149
Alex, how do I know the most of the
selling was done? Uh, it's it's just

5162
02:05:56,149 --> 02:05:56,159
selling was done? Uh, it's it's just
 

5163
02:05:56,159 --> 02:06:00,229
selling was done? Uh, it's it's just
from looking inside the candles or you

5164
02:06:00,229 --> 02:06:00,239
from looking inside the candles or you
 

5165
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:05,270
from looking inside the candles or you
can use bookmap. Either or.

5166
02:06:05,270 --> 02:06:05,280

 

5167
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:08,310

Like even if we come here again, it will

5168
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:08,320
Like even if we come here again, it will
 

5169
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,070
Like even if we come here again, it will
all be in the new course. But even in

5170
02:06:10,070 --> 02:06:10,080
all be in the new course. But even in
 

5171
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:12,629
all be in the new course. But even in
bookmap,

5172
02:06:12,629 --> 02:06:12,639
bookmap,
 

5173
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:15,270
bookmap,
okay, 440 to 400, right? Was that what

5174
02:06:15,270 --> 02:06:15,280
okay, 440 to 400, right? Was that what
 

5175
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:18,070
okay, 440 to 400, right? Was that what
what I said? What was the time there?

5176
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:18,080
what I said? What was the time there?
 

5177
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:23,030
what I said? What was the time there?
just before 11:00 a.m. here. Okay,

5178
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:23,040
just before 11:00 a.m. here. Okay,
 

5179
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,830
just before 11:00 a.m. here. Okay,
look at this guy here. 400 lot average

5180
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:25,840
look at this guy here. 400 lot average
 

5181
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:31,350
look at this guy here. 400 lot average
price 430 or 4 429. Okay, 400 lot,

5182
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:31,360
price 430 or 4 429. Okay, 400 lot,
 

5183
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,109
price 430 or 4 429. Okay, 400 lot,
right? And look at all the selling which

5184
02:06:33,109 --> 02:06:33,119
right? And look at all the selling which
 

5185
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:35,350
right? And look at all the selling which
follows. They all follow him in. So if

5186
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:35,360
follows. They all follow him in. So if
 

5187
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:37,669
follows. They all follow him in. So if
we think about this guy here, that 400

5188
02:06:37,669 --> 02:06:37,679
we think about this guy here, that 400
 

5189
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:40,390
we think about this guy here, that 400
lot, he's massive size, isn't he? So we

5190
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:40,400
lot, he's massive size, isn't he? So we
 

5191
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:42,870
lot, he's massive size, isn't he? So we
think about all this strong selling,

5192
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:42,880
think about all this strong selling,
 

5193
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:45,430
think about all this strong selling,
right? Look at all this selling. There's

5194
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:45,440
right? Look at all this selling. There's
 

5195
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,109
right? Look at all this selling. There's
your low. That's the end of the auction.

5196
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:47,119
your low. That's the end of the auction.
 

5197
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:48,629
your low. That's the end of the auction.
And that's the last seller. No one's

5198
02:06:48,629 --> 02:06:48,639
And that's the last seller. No one's
 

5199
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:50,709
And that's the last seller. No one's
selling under here. Higher low, higher

5200
02:06:50,709 --> 02:06:50,719
selling under here. Higher low, higher
 

5201
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:52,629
selling under here. Higher low, higher
low, higher low, higher low. You're not

5202
02:06:52,629 --> 02:06:52,639
low, higher low, higher low. You're not
 

5203
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:54,709
low, higher low, higher low. You're not
going to see that necessarily on a

5204
02:06:54,709 --> 02:06:54,719
going to see that necessarily on a
 

5205
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,790
going to see that necessarily on a
candle structure. And then this is this

5206
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:56,800
candle structure. And then this is this
 

5207
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:59,030
candle structure. And then this is this
guy stopping out. All right. So this 400

5208
02:06:59,030 --> 02:06:59,040
guy stopping out. All right. So this 400
 

5209
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:02,229
guy stopping out. All right. So this 400
lot right here starts stopping out into

5210
02:07:02,229 --> 02:07:02,239
lot right here starts stopping out into
 

5211
02:07:02,239 --> 02:07:03,990
lot right here starts stopping out into
the initial balance. And there we go.

5212
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:04,000
the initial balance. And there we go.
 

5213
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,069
the initial balance. And there we go.
Squeeze. All right. So everyone who is a

5214
02:07:06,069 --> 02:07:06,079
Squeeze. All right. So everyone who is a
 

5215
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:10,310
Squeeze. All right. So everyone who is a
seller under IB got squeezed out. Okay.

5216
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:10,320
seller under IB got squeezed out. Okay.
 

5217
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:13,189
seller under IB got squeezed out. Okay.
And the reason I sold early, what did I

5218
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:13,199
And the reason I sold early, what did I
 

5219
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:17,750
And the reason I sold early, what did I
sell? Where did I sell? 1111 was right

5220
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:17,760
sell? Where did I sell? 1111 was right
 

5221
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:20,390
sell? Where did I sell? 1111 was right
up here. So this strong buying buy by by

5222
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:20,400
up here. So this strong buying buy by by
 

5223
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,990
up here. So this strong buying buy by by
and we didn't move higher off it. We

5224
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:22,000
and we didn't move higher off it. We
 

5225
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,350
and we didn't move higher off it. We
started to pull back. So the moment I

5226
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:23,360
started to pull back. So the moment I
 

5227
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:25,430
started to pull back. So the moment I
saw that transaction, I'm done with

5228
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:25,440
saw that transaction, I'm done with
 

5229
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,990
saw that transaction, I'm done with
this. I didn't want to sit through a big

5230
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,000
this. I didn't want to sit through a big
 

5231
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,589
this. I didn't want to sit through a big
old pullback there. A 50 point pullback

5232
02:07:29,589 --> 02:07:29,599
old pullback there. A 50 point pullback
 

5233
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:37,683
old pullback there. A 50 point pullback
there.

5234
02:07:37,683 --> 02:07:37,693

[snorts]

5236
02:07:48,950 --> 02:07:48,960

 

5237
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,550

Okay, probably done. Probably done with

Okay, probably done. Probably done with

minutes. I don't know. We're starting to
 

5243
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,430
minutes. I don't know. We're starting to
see a range develop here.

5244
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:57,440
see a range develop here.
 

5245
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:59,030
see a range develop here.

02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:10,320
range. If they hold this, bulls will try
 

5255
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:15,750
range. If they hold this, bulls will try
and look for this. We're not technically

5256
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:15,760

 

5257
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:18,310

above here for this squeeze out. But if

5258
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:18,320
above here for this squeeze out. But if
 

5259
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:21,430
above here for this squeeze out. But if
bulls be hold this, they look for that

5260
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:21,440
bulls be hold this, they look for that
 

5261
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:24,310
bulls be hold this, they look for that
move or at least to here. We're still

5262
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:24,320
move or at least to here. We're still
 

5263
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,390
move or at least to here. We're still
below VWAP, which is trending down.

5264
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:26,400
below VWAP, which is trending down.
 

5265
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:27,669
below VWAP, which is trending down.
Everything is still trending down. I

5266
02:08:27,669 --> 02:08:27,679
Everything is still trending down. I
 

5267
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:29,510
Everything is still trending down. I
cannot point that enough. This is a

5268
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:29,520
cannot point that enough. This is a
 

5269
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:31,189
cannot point that enough. This is a
liquidity building phase. I just don't

5270
02:08:31,189 --> 02:08:31,199
liquidity building phase. I just don't
 

5271
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:32,629
liquidity building phase. I just don't
want to be short at the lows. Where

5272
02:08:32,629 --> 02:08:32,639
want to be short at the lows. Where
 

5273
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:34,470
want to be short at the lows. Where
would I want to be short? I want to be

5274
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:34,480
would I want to be short? I want to be
 

5275
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:35,750
would I want to be short? I want to be
short way up here, and it's not going to

5276
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:35,760
short way up here, and it's not going to
 

5277
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:37,669
short way up here, and it's not going to
let me do that. So, fortunately, this is

5278
02:08:37,669 --> 02:08:37,679
let me do that. So, fortunately, this is
 

5279
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:39,750
let me do that. So, fortunately, this is
why I played counter trend today. It is

5280
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:39,760
why I played counter trend today. It is
 

5281
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:41,510
why I played counter trend today. It is
what it is. It's just it is what it is.

5282
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:41,520
what it is. It's just it is what it is.
 

5283
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:45,270
what it is. It's just it is what it is.
I can only trade what's in front of me.

5284
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:45,280
I can only trade what's in front of me.
 

5285
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:47,270
I can only trade what's in front of me.
Uh yeah, Kevin, I mean, you I don't know

5286
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:47,280
Uh yeah, Kevin, I mean, you I don't know

um here,
 

5299
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,350
um here,
right? Go to your candle type, which is

5300
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:05,360
right? Go to your candle type, which is
 

5301
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:06,390

here.
 

5303
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,310
here.
No, it's not there. Where is it? This

5304
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:08,320
No, it's not there. Where is it? This
 

5305
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:12,069
No, it's not there. Where is it? This
one. Data series chart indicators.

5306
02:09:12,069 --> 02:09:12,079
one. Data series chart indicators.
 

5307
02:09:12,079 --> 02:09:14,550
one. Data series chart indicators.
Where's my candle? Maybe it's here. Data

5308
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:14,560
Where's my candle? Maybe it's here. Data
 

5309
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,750
Where's my candle? Maybe it's here. Data
series. Yes. You want to change this to

5310
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:17,760
series. Yes. You want to change this to
 

5311
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:20,390
series. Yes. You want to change this to
volutric,

5312
02:09:20,390 --> 02:09:20,400
volutric,
 

5313
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:22,310
volutric,
right? Volutric instead of like a one

5314
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:22,320
right? Volutric instead of like a one
 

5315
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:24,149
right? Volutric instead of like a one
minute volutric. Normally you'd have

5316
02:09:24,149 --> 02:09:24,159
minute volutric. Normally you'd have
 

5317
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:28,790
minute volutric. Normally you'd have
candle and then that will give you

5318
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:28,800

 

5319
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:34,929

right this

5320
02:09:34,929 --> 02:09:34,939

 

5321
02:09:34,939 --> 02:09:36,950

[snorts]

5322
02:09:36,950 --> 02:09:36,960
[snorts]
 

5323
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:39,910

uh hopefully before Christmas.

5324
02:09:39,910 --> 02:09:39,920
uh hopefully before Christmas.
 

5325
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:41,270
uh hopefully before Christmas.
I haven't got too much more to do. I'll

5326
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:41,280
I haven't got too much more to do. I'll
 

5327
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:52,470
I haven't got too much more to do. I'll
do I'll do some more of it today.

5328
02:09:52,470 --> 02:09:52,480

 

5329
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,790

B's still got a chance here, but it's

5330
02:09:54,790 --> 02:09:54,800
B's still got a chance here, but it's
 

5331
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:57,030
B's still got a chance here, but it's
just development of range now. So, I

5332
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:57,040
just development of range now. So, I
 

5333
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:00,069
just development of range now. So, I
would imagine we see more rotation.

5334
02:10:00,069 --> 02:10:00,079
would imagine we see more rotation.
 

5335
02:10:00,079 --> 02:10:02,069
would imagine we see more rotation.
This will be the rotation in here for a

5336
02:10:02,069 --> 02:10:02,079
This will be the rotation in here for a
 

5337
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:04,709
This will be the rotation in here for a
while. Major squeeze relief will be

5338
02:10:04,709 --> 02:10:04,719
while. Major squeeze relief will be
 

5339
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:07,350
while. Major squeeze relief will be
above here, but this will also be where

5340
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:07,360
above here, but this will also be where
 

5341
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,350
above here, but this will also be where
bull traps live in this zone. So, you

5342
02:10:09,350 --> 02:10:09,360
bull traps live in this zone. So, you
 

5343
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:11,750
bull traps live in this zone. So, you
want to be careful. So, you see bulls,

5344
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:11,760
want to be careful. So, you see bulls,
 

5345
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:14,310
want to be careful. So, you see bulls,
they just held this part of the shelf.

5346
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:14,320
they just held this part of the shelf.
 

5347
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,550
they just held this part of the shelf.
See, we made a new node there. Bulls are

5348
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:16,560
See, we made a new node there. Bulls are
 

5349
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,910
See, we made a new node there. Bulls are
defending this. They're trying to force

5350
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:17,920
defending this. They're trying to force
 

5351
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:19,589
defending this. They're trying to force
this up. This would be a two-leg. If

5352
02:10:19,589 --> 02:10:19,599
this up. This would be a two-leg. If
 

5353
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:21,030
this up. This would be a two-leg. If
you're still long in this, you've got to

5354
02:10:21,030 --> 02:10:21,040
you're still long in this, you've got to
 

5355
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:22,790
you're still long in this, you've got to
be selling if you haven't sold something

5356
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:22,800
be selling if you haven't sold something
 

5357
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,229
be selling if you haven't sold something
to be up. Definitely to the top of this

5358
02:10:24,229 --> 02:10:24,239
to be up. Definitely to the top of this
 

5359
02:10:24,239 --> 02:10:25,910
to be up. Definitely to the top of this
above that, maybe you get a bigger

5360
02:10:25,910 --> 02:10:25,920
above that, maybe you get a bigger
 

5361
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,350
above that, maybe you get a bigger
squeeze out. I don't know. But you want

5362
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:27,360
squeeze out. I don't know. But you want
 

5363
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,109
squeeze out. I don't know. But you want
to be careful. You cannot guarantee that

5364
02:10:29,109 --> 02:10:29,119
to be careful. You cannot guarantee that
 

5365
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:32,790
to be careful. You cannot guarantee that
that's what you're going to get today.

5366
02:10:32,790 --> 02:10:32,800
that's what you're going to get today.
 

5367
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:35,030
that's what you're going to get today.
We're in range rotation and the overall

5368
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:35,040
We're in range rotation and the overall
 

5369
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:55,990
We're in range rotation and the overall
sentiment is lower

5370
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:56,000

 

5371
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,430

battleground here. They're developing

5372
02:10:57,430 --> 02:10:57,440
battleground here. They're developing
 

5373
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:01,109
battleground here. They're developing
another node here. It's 540 550.

5374
02:11:01,109 --> 02:11:01,119
another node here. It's 540 550.
 

5375
02:11:01,119 --> 02:11:03,270
another node here. It's 540 550.
We do have excess above that. So buyers

5376
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:03,280
We do have excess above that. So buyers
 

5377
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:06,709
We do have excess above that. So buyers
so far got trapped 560 to 570. That's

5378
02:11:06,709 --> 02:11:06,719
so far got trapped 560 to 570. That's
 

5379
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:08,550
so far got trapped 560 to 570. That's
where they've been trapped so far today.

5380
02:11:08,550 --> 02:11:08,560
where they've been trapped so far today.
 

5381
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:10,550
where they've been trapped so far today.
Every move into that has been sold into.

5382
02:11:10,550 --> 02:11:10,560
Every move into that has been sold into.
 

5383
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:11,910
Every move into that has been sold into.
Doesn't mean it has to continue to be

5384
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:11,920
Doesn't mean it has to continue to be
 

5385
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:13,750
Doesn't mean it has to continue to be
sold into. But on that first push today,

5386
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:13,760
sold into. But on that first push today,
 

5387
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:15,750
sold into. But on that first push today,
that's what we saw. So they're retesting

5388
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:15,760
that's what we saw. So they're retesting
 

5389
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:18,069
that's what we saw. So they're retesting
that same level again. There's been a

5390
02:11:18,069 --> 02:11:18,079
that same level again. There's been a
 

5391
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:19,589
that same level again. There's been a
passive seller up here so far this

5392
02:11:19,589 --> 02:11:19,599
passive seller up here so far this
 

5393
02:11:19,599 --> 02:11:20,790
passive seller up here so far this
morning. If they can squeeze through

5394
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:20,800
morning. If they can squeeze through
 

5395
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,069
morning. If they can squeeze through
this, you might get your move to the

5396
02:11:22,069 --> 02:11:22,079
this, you might get your move to the
 

5397
02:11:22,079 --> 02:11:24,870
this, you might get your move to the
gray box above. So VW up here. If they

5398
02:11:24,870 --> 02:11:24,880
gray box above. So VW up here. If they
 

5399
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:27,030
gray box above. So VW up here. If they
can, it's a big if if you're still long,

5400
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:27,040
can, it's a big if if you're still long,
 

5401
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,270
can, it's a big if if you're still long,
but if they can squeeze through this,

5402
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:29,280
but if they can squeeze through this,
 

5403
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:32,870
but if they can squeeze through this,
you might get the top of the gray box.

5404
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:32,880
you might get the top of the gray box.
 

5405
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:34,390
you might get the top of the gray box.
But again, you're just in range

5406
02:11:34,390 --> 02:11:34,400
But again, you're just in range
 

5407
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,149
But again, you're just in range
rotation. VIX is coming back down to the

5408
02:11:36,149 --> 02:11:36,159
rotation. VIX is coming back down to the
 

5409
02:11:36,159 --> 02:11:37,350
rotation. VIX is coming back down to the
bottom side of its range. So

5410
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:37,360
bottom side of its range. So
 

5411
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:40,629
bottom side of its range. So
everything's matching up. [snorts]

5412
02:11:40,629 --> 02:11:40,639
everything's matching up. [snorts]
 

5413
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:42,310
everything's matching up. [snorts]
If you get lucky, you get that move all

5414
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:42,320
If you get lucky, you get that move all
 

5415
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:46,149
If you get lucky, you get that move all
the way up into this.

5416
02:11:46,149 --> 02:11:46,159
the way up into this.
 

5417
02:11:46,159 --> 02:12:11,270
the way up into this.
And above that, um, well, who knows?

5418
02:12:11,270 --> 02:12:11,280

 

5419
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:13,990

I blew my Apex EVA. I was long 10 micros

5420
02:12:13,990 --> 02:12:14,000
I blew my Apex EVA. I was long 10 micros
 

5421
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,990
I blew my Apex EVA. I was long 10 micros
at the 1040 chop. I mean, that's quite a

5422
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:16,000
at the 1040 chop. I mean, that's quite a
 

5423
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,189
at the 1040 chop. I mean, that's quite a
lot of size. 10 micros for range this

5424
02:12:19,189 --> 02:12:19,199
lot of size. 10 micros for range this
 

5425
02:12:19,199 --> 02:12:21,109
lot of size. 10 micros for range this
big. Here you go. So, top of the gray

5426
02:12:21,109 --> 02:12:21,119
big. Here you go. So, top of the gray
 

5427
02:12:21,119 --> 02:12:23,669
big. Here you go. So, top of the gray
box probably coming up here, folks. Or

5428
02:12:23,669 --> 02:12:23,679
box probably coming up here, folks. Or
 

5429
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:25,589
box probably coming up here, folks. Or
top of the gray box. Gray box probably

5430
02:12:25,589 --> 02:12:25,599
top of the gray box. Gray box probably
 

5431
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:27,750
top of the gray box. Gray box probably
coming up. If you get above this, this

5432
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:27,760
coming up. If you get above this, this
 

5433
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:29,750
coming up. If you get above this, this
is GlobeEx. All right. Then it this

5434
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:29,760
is GlobeEx. All right. Then it this
 

5435
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:31,430
is GlobeEx. All right. Then it this
whole thing can be a look below and fail

5436
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:31,440
whole thing can be a look below and fail
 

5437
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,589
whole thing can be a look below and fail
if they start holding and basing above

5438
02:12:33,589 --> 02:12:33,599
if they start holding and basing above
 

5439
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:50,470
if they start holding and basing above

5440
02:12:50,470 --> 02:12:50,480

 

5441
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:53,350

Lots of rotation. Again, fast tape

5442
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:53,360
Lots of rotation. Again, fast tape
 

5443
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:56,629
Lots of rotation. Again, fast tape
today, guys. It's a really fast tape.

5444
02:12:56,629 --> 02:12:56,639
today, guys. It's a really fast tape.
 

5445
02:12:56,639 --> 02:12:59,990
today, guys. It's a really fast tape.
that your sizing is so key. Like what's

5446
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:00,000
that your sizing is so key. Like what's
 

5447
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,709
that your sizing is so key. Like what's
the ATR? ATR has remained around 40

5448
02:13:04,709 --> 02:13:04,719
the ATR? ATR has remained around 40
 

5449
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:07,750
the ATR? ATR has remained around 40
really since the open. It's remained

5450
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:07,760
really since the open. It's remained
 

5451
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,750
really since the open. It's remained
around 40 as an average since the open.

5452
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:09,760
around 40 as an average since the open.
 

5453
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,550
around 40 as an average since the open.
It's a big ATR. So if you're using 10

5454
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:12,560
It's a big ATR. So if you're using 10
 

5455
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:16,470
It's a big ATR. So if you're using 10
micros, you're risking what? 8 $800 per

5456
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:16,480
micros, you're risking what? 8 $800 per
 

5457
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:20,310
micros, you're risking what? 8 $800 per
one minute candle. No matter what,

5458
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:20,320
one minute candle. No matter what,
 

5459
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:23,189
one minute candle. No matter what,
you only need one or two micros in this.

5460
02:13:23,189 --> 02:13:23,199
you only need one or two micros in this.
 

5461
02:13:23,199 --> 02:13:25,669
you only need one or two micros in this.
One or two micros are all you ever need.

5462
02:13:25,669 --> 02:13:25,679
One or two micros are all you ever need.
 

5463
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:29,270
One or two micros are all you ever need.
I mean, if you got long here,

5464
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:29,280
I mean, if you got long here,
 

5465
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:31,669
I mean, if you got long here,
that's 100 points. That's $200 off one

5466
02:13:31,669 --> 02:13:31,679
that's 100 points. That's $200 off one
 

5467
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:33,510
that's 100 points. That's $200 off one
micro, right? So, if you're in 10,

5468
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:33,520
micro, right? So, if you're in 10,
 

5469
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:35,109
micro, right? So, if you're in 10,
that's $2,000. If you're on the wrong

5470
02:13:35,109 --> 02:13:35,119
that's $2,000. If you're on the wrong
 

5471
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:37,189
that's $2,000. If you're on the wrong
side of that, though, it's $2,000 loss,

5472
02:13:37,189 --> 02:13:37,199
side of that, though, it's $2,000 loss,
 

5473
02:13:37,199 --> 02:13:39,910
side of that, though, it's $2,000 loss,
and you're probably done. So you have to

5474
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:39,920
and you're probably done. So you have to
 

5475
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:41,990
and you're probably done. So you have to
understand what the potential move is in

5476
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:42,000
understand what the potential move is in
 

5477
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,350
understand what the potential move is in
front of you, what size account you're

5478
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:43,360
front of you, what size account you're
 

5479
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:55,270
front of you, what size account you're
playing, how accurate you are.

5480
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:55,280

 

5481
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:58,149

Exactly, Mr. Slim. 10 points is $200 and

5482
02:13:58,149 --> 02:13:58,159
Exactly, Mr. Slim. 10 points is $200 and
 

5483
02:13:58,159 --> 02:13:59,669
Exactly, Mr. Slim. 10 points is $200 and
we're making 100 plus point moves.

5484
02:13:59,669 --> 02:13:59,679
we're making 100 plus point moves.
 

5485
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:01,589
we're making 100 plus point moves.
Exactly. Still think they want to test

5486
02:14:01,589 --> 02:14:01,599
Exactly. Still think they want to test
 

5487
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:10,629
Exactly. Still think they want to test
this GlobeEx up here.

5488
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:10,639

 

5489
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:13,270

Starting to see some relief. Apple green

5490
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:13,280
Starting to see some relief. Apple green
 

5491
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,430
Starting to see some relief. Apple green
just insane. Don't get me wrong, I'm

5492
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:15,440
just insane. Don't get me wrong, I'm
 

5493
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:18,470
just insane. Don't get me wrong, I'm
super happy. I'm still long Apple from

5494
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:18,480
super happy. I'm still long Apple from
 

5495
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:22,229
super happy. I'm still long Apple from
202s. I'm very impressed. Very impressed

5496
02:14:22,229 --> 02:14:22,239
202s. I'm very impressed. Very impressed
 

5497
02:14:22,239 --> 02:14:24,390
202s. I'm very impressed. Very impressed
with it.

5498
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:24,400
with it.
 

5499
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:27,589
with it.
And we got left here 40 minutes or so. I

5500
02:14:27,589 --> 02:14:27,599
And we got left here 40 minutes or so. I
 

5501
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:31,510
And we got left here 40 minutes or so. I
think you're into a big range here.

5502
02:14:31,510 --> 02:14:31,520
think you're into a big range here.
 

5503
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:34,550
think you're into a big range here.
This is your range.

5504
02:14:34,550 --> 02:14:34,560
This is your range.
 

5505
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:35,990
This is your range.
You want to be careful here that these

5506
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:36,000
You want to be careful here that these
 

5507
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,709
You want to be careful here that these
can be bull trap areas. Look above and

5508
02:14:38,709 --> 02:14:38,719
can be bull trap areas. Look above and
 

5509
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:41,430
can be bull trap areas. Look above and
failed. This is a look below and fail.

5510
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:41,440
failed. This is a look below and fail.
 

5511
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:43,910
failed. This is a look below and fail.
If they base here though, you have the

5512
02:14:43,910 --> 02:14:43,920
If they base here though, you have the
 

5513
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:45,510
If they base here though, you have the
ability to come back up and test this

5514
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:45,520
ability to come back up and test this
 

5515
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:48,229
ability to come back up and test this
New York open. Can cannot bet against

5516
02:14:48,229 --> 02:14:48,239
New York open. Can cannot bet against
 

5517
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:49,669
New York open. Can cannot bet against
that. Like if they're going to keep

5518
02:14:49,669 --> 02:14:49,679
that. Like if they're going to keep
 

5519
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:51,910
that. Like if they're going to keep
doing this, you don't want to get caught

5520
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:51,920
doing this, you don't want to get caught
 

5521
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:53,750
doing this, you don't want to get caught
trying to short against it. But if they

5522
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:53,760
trying to short against it. But if they
 

5523
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,310
trying to short against it. But if they
look above and fail back under,

5524
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:56,320
look above and fail back under,
 

5525
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:57,430
look above and fail back under,
especially if they build out

5526
02:14:57,430 --> 02:14:57,440
especially if they build out
 

5527
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:58,870
especially if they build out
considerable amount of volume here and

5528
02:14:58,870 --> 02:14:58,880
considerable amount of volume here and
 

5529
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:00,390
considerable amount of volume here and
then fail under it, you might get that

5530
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:00,400
then fail under it, you might get that
 

5531
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:01,910
then fail under it, you might get that
move back down to there again later in

5532
02:15:01,910 --> 02:15:01,920
move back down to there again later in
 

5533
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:03,589
move back down to there again later in
the day. You just have to see the range

5534
02:15:03,589 --> 02:15:03,599
the day. You just have to see the range
 

5535
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:06,950
the day. You just have to see the range
is very very big. All right. 400 points

5536
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:06,960
is very very big. All right. 400 points
 

5537
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:08,470
is very very big. All right. 400 points
initial balance. How far out of that did

02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:08,480
initial balance. How far out of that did
 

5539
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:10,870
initial balance. How far out of that did
we trade? We about 450 point range

5540
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:10,880
we trade? We about 450 point range
 

5541
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:20,790
we trade? We about 450 point range
today.

5542
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:20,800

 

5543
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:23,030

5579
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:11,430
get a squeeze back to previous week low,
which is the green line just above it.

5580
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:11,440

 

5581
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:14,310

Looks really good here, folks. This is a

02:16:14,310 --> 02:16:14,320
Looks really good here, folks. This is a
 

5583
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:16,790
Looks really good here, folks. This is a

5585
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,870
big level. Look left.
Huge level, right? This is a resistance

5586
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:18,880
Huge level, right? This is a resistance
 

5587
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,950
Huge level, right? This is a resistance
zone. If we reclaim this, we're going to

5588
02:16:20,950 --> 02:16:20,960
zone. If we reclaim this, we're going to
 

5589
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,629
zone. If we reclaim this, we're going to
try and drift all the way up here. But I

5590
02:16:22,629 --> 02:16:22,639
try and drift all the way up here. But I
 

5591
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:24,629
try and drift all the way up here. But I
wouldn't be long a new money long here

5592
02:16:24,629 --> 02:16:24,639
wouldn't be long a new money long here
 

5593
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:26,390
wouldn't be long a new money long here
now. You haven't reclaimed it and based

5594
02:16:26,390 --> 02:16:26,400
now. You haven't reclaimed it and based
 

5595
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:28,950
now. You haven't reclaimed it and based
above. So, you're long from down here or

5596
02:16:28,950 --> 02:16:28,960
above. So, you're long from down here or
 

5597
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:31,430
above. So, you're long from down here or
from here. You're not long up here. Not

02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:31,440
from here. You're not long up here. Not
 

5599
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:33,509
from here. You're not long up here. Not
a new position. You're managing a

5600
02:16:33,509 --> 02:16:33,519
a new position. You're managing a
 

5601
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:42,070

Would sales on the inside bar on H1 be

level. Uh, I wouldn't necessarily sell
 

5631
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:17,830
level. Uh, I wouldn't necessarily sell
it straight away, but if we can trade up

5632
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:17,840
it straight away, but if we can trade up
 

5633
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:19,509
it straight away, but if we can trade up
towards it, yes. I mean, there's volume

5634
02:17:19,509 --> 02:17:19,519
towards it, yes. I mean, there's volume
 

5635
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:21,750

point, the squeeze will end, the auction

5700
02:19:59,429 --> 02:19:59,439
point, the squeeze will end, the auction
 

5701
02:19:59,439 --> 02:20:01,110
point, the squeeze will end, the auction
will end, and we will start trading back

5709
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:09,590

5867
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:55,750
reasonable. If they want to flush this,
they absolutely can. It's a giant short

5868
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:55,760
they absolutely can. It's a giant short
 

5869
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,670
they absolutely can. It's a giant short
squeeze this.

5870
02:23:57,670 --> 02:23:57,680
squeeze this.
 

5871
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:59,670
squeeze this.
So the squeeze started initiating at

5872
02:23:59,670 --> 02:23:59,680
So the squeeze started initiating at
 

5873
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:03,510
So the squeeze started initiating at
420s and then they rewent from 530s and

5874
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:03,520
420s and then they rewent from 530s and
 

5875
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:07,110
420s and then they rewent from 530s and
580s. So your 200 250 point short

5876
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:07,120
580s. So your 200 250 point short
 

5877
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:15,830
580s. So your 200 250 point short
squeeze out here.

5878
02:24:15,830 --> 02:24:15,840

 

5879
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:18,870

This is a good area where they can trap

5880
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:18,880
This is a good area where they can trap
 

5881
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:21,830
This is a good area where they can trap
balls honestly into these kind of areas.

5882
02:24:21,830 --> 02:24:21,840
balls honestly into these kind of areas.
 

5883
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:23,349
balls honestly into these kind of areas.
It's a good area where they can trap

5884
02:24:23,349 --> 02:24:23,359
It's a good area where they can trap
 

5885
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:25,429
It's a good area where they can trap
balls because we're above this pivot.

5886
02:24:25,429 --> 02:24:25,439
balls because we're above this pivot.
 

5887
02:24:25,439 --> 02:24:27,030
balls because we're above this pivot.
So, lots of breakout balls have come in

5888
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:27,040
So, lots of breakout balls have come in
 

5889
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:29,349
So, lots of breakout balls have come in
back in here. If they slam this door,

5890
02:24:29,349 --> 02:24:29,359
back in here. If they slam this door,
 

5891
02:24:29,359 --> 02:24:31,670
back in here. If they slam this door,
like I said, if they slam this door,

5892
02:24:31,670 --> 02:24:31,680
like I said, if they slam this door,
 

5893
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:34,790
like I said, if they slam this door,
this trade becomes available.

5894
02:24:34,790 --> 02:24:34,800
this trade becomes available.
 

5895
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:35,910
this trade becomes available.
Don't think I'm going to trade it. I

5896
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:35,920
Don't think I'm going to trade it. I
 

5897
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:37,349
Don't think I'm going to trade it. I
think I'm done. I've got to be happy

5898
02:24:37,349 --> 02:24:37,359
think I'm done. I've got to be happy
 

5899
02:24:37,359 --> 02:24:41,429
think I'm done. I've got to be happy
with [snorts] I've made money today. But

5900
02:24:41,429 --> 02:24:41,439
with [snorts] I've made money today. But
 

5901
02:24:41,439 --> 02:24:48,230
with [snorts] I've made money today. But
just be aware. That's all I'm saying.

5902
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:48,240

 

5903
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:51,110

Nice Prrisca.

5904
02:24:51,110 --> 02:24:51,120
Nice Prrisca.
 

5905
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:53,590
Nice Prrisca.
Nice Wrath. Great work.

5906
02:24:53,590 --> 02:24:53,600
Nice Wrath. Great work.
 

5907
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:55,349
Nice Wrath. Great work.
Still, they're still soaking VW up. They

5908
02:24:55,349 --> 02:24:55,359
Still, they're still soaking VW up. They
 

5909
02:24:55,359 --> 02:24:58,630
Still, they're still soaking VW up. They
want that New York open and previous day

5910
02:24:58,630 --> 02:24:58,640
want that New York open and previous day
 

5911
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:00,469
want that New York open and previous day
low by the looks of it. They want to get

5912
02:25:00,469 --> 02:25:00,479
low by the looks of it. They want to get
 

5913
02:25:00,479 --> 02:25:01,910
low by the looks of it. They want to get
back into this gray box. But like I

5914
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:01,920
back into this gray box. But like I
 

5915
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,870
back into this gray box. But like I
said, this is a good area. This area is

5916
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:04,880
said, this is a good area. This area is
 

5917
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:06,469
said, this is a good area. This area is
an area where they track can track

5918
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:06,479
an area where they track can track
 

5919
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:08,550
an area where they track can track
balls. The bulls from down here will be

5920
02:25:08,550 --> 02:25:08,560
balls. The bulls from down here will be
 

5921
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:10,309
balls. The bulls from down here will be
looking to complete the rotation to

5922
02:25:10,309 --> 02:25:10,319
looking to complete the rotation to
 

5923
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:12,309
looking to complete the rotation to
here. If they get very lucky up here,

5924
02:25:12,309 --> 02:25:12,319
here. If they get very lucky up here,
 

5925
02:25:12,319 --> 02:25:15,429
here. If they get very lucky up here,
bears will want this area here to do

5926
02:25:15,429 --> 02:25:15,439
bears will want this area here to do
 

5927
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:17,750
bears will want this area here to do
this rotation back down to trap bulls

5928
02:25:17,750 --> 02:25:17,760
this rotation back down to trap bulls
 

5929
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:20,150
this rotation back down to trap bulls
above this. Right? If they're looking

5930
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:20,160
above this. Right? If they're looking
 

5931
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:22,309
above this. Right? If they're looking
for this, they would want that. That's

5932
02:25:22,309 --> 02:25:22,319
for this, they would want that. That's
 

5933
02:25:22,319 --> 02:25:25,110
for this, they would want that. That's
the battle right now. I wouldn't be uh

5934
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:25,120
the battle right now. I wouldn't be uh
 

5935
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:27,590
the battle right now. I wouldn't be uh
new positioning a thing right now. Just

5936
02:25:27,590 --> 02:25:27,600
new positioning a thing right now. Just
 

5937
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:29,910
new positioning a thing right now. Just
let this do what it wants. You got 25

5938
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:29,920
let this do what it wants. You got 25
 

5939
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:32,309
let this do what it wants. You got 25
minutes left. Most of you were long off

5940
02:25:32,309 --> 02:25:32,319
minutes left. Most of you were long off
 

5941
02:25:32,319 --> 02:25:35,750
minutes left. Most of you were long off
the IB. I think

5942
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:35,760
the IB. I think
 

5943
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:46,469
the IB. I think
you look good.

5944
02:25:46,469 --> 02:25:46,479

 

5945
02:25:46,479 --> 02:25:48,150

We're in Golden Zone. Yeah, I'm sure we

5946
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:48,160
We're in Golden Zone. Yeah, I'm sure we
 

5947
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:50,710
We're in Golden Zone. Yeah, I'm sure we
are. It's a big It's a big old push, but

5948
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:50,720
are. It's a big It's a big old push, but
 

5949
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:52,469
are. It's a big It's a big old push, but
there's still targets both above and

5950
02:25:52,469 --> 02:25:52,479
there's still targets both above and
 

5951
02:25:52,479 --> 02:25:55,349
there's still targets both above and
below. I just let this sort of do

5952
02:25:55,349 --> 02:25:55,359
below. I just let this sort of do
 

5953
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:59,110
below. I just let this sort of do
whatever it is it's got to do

5954
02:25:59,110 --> 02:25:59,120
whatever it is it's got to do
 

5955
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:01,910
whatever it is it's got to do
cuz it's uh a very fast moving market

5956
02:26:01,910 --> 02:26:01,920
cuz it's uh a very fast moving market
 

5957
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:06,630
cuz it's uh a very fast moving market
like we've discussed.

5958
02:26:06,630 --> 02:26:06,640

 

5959
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:22,070

Just close this door a second.

5960
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:22,080

 

5961
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:24,389

Back to the VWAP.

5962
02:26:24,389 --> 02:26:24,399
Back to the VWAP.
 

5963
02:26:24,399 --> 02:26:26,150
Back to the VWAP.
Like I said, this can be a bull trap

5964
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:26,160
Like I said, this can be a bull trap
 

5965
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:28,469
Like I said, this can be a bull trap
area up here. It wouldn't surprise me

5966
02:26:28,469 --> 02:26:28,479
area up here. It wouldn't surprise me
 

5967
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:31,510
area up here. It wouldn't surprise me
because we're in breakout.

5968
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:31,520
because we're in breakout.
 

5969
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,990
because we're in breakout.
So, how they act under this gray box

5970
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:34,000
So, how they act under this gray box
 

5971
02:26:34,000 --> 02:27:05,510
So, how they act under this gray box
becomes important. This shelf here

5972
02:27:05,510 --> 02:27:05,520

 

5973
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:08,070

Still trying to absorb.

5974
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:08,080
Still trying to absorb.
 

5975
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:11,030
Still trying to absorb.
We can do another gray box. Now

5976
02:27:11,030 --> 02:27:11,040
We can do another gray box. Now
 

5977
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,910
We can do another gray box. Now
build one here.

5978
02:27:13,910 --> 02:27:13,920
build one here.
 

5979
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:15,270
build one here.
Shelf in here. You can see it

5980
02:27:15,270 --> 02:27:15,280
Shelf in here. You can see it
 

5981
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:35,110
Shelf in here. You can see it
developing.

5982
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:35,120

 

5983
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:37,030

trying to get another squeeze. They're

5984
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,040
trying to get another squeeze. They're
 

5985
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:43,030
trying to get another squeeze. They're
trying to get up to that open.

5986
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:43,040

 

5987
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:44,469

They want to get up into here if they

5988
02:27:44,469 --> 02:27:44,479
They want to get up into here if they
 

5989
02:27:44,479 --> 02:27:54,309
They want to get up into here if they
can.

5990
02:27:54,309 --> 02:27:54,319

 

5991
02:27:54,319 --> 02:27:57,670

Big Delta 55s or 50s.

5992
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:57,680
Big Delta 55s or 50s.
 

5993
02:27:57,680 --> 02:28:00,230
Big Delta 55s or 50s.
Where's he gone?

5994
02:28:00,230 --> 02:28:00,240
Where's he gone?
 

5995
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:02,550
Where's he gone?
Mo so quick. Yeah, some offside delta at

5996
02:28:02,550 --> 02:28:02,560
Mo so quick. Yeah, some offside delta at
 

5997
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:24,950
Mo so quick. Yeah, some offside delta at
55.

5998
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:24,960

 

5999
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:27,990

Is X working again now? Oh, it is. Looks

6000
02:28:27,990 --> 02:28:28,000
Is X working again now? Oh, it is. Looks
 

6001
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:43,270
Is X working again now? Oh, it is. Looks
like it is. Fantastic.

6002
02:28:43,270 --> 02:28:43,280

 

6003
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,870

They're trying to complete it. They're

6004
02:28:44,870 --> 02:28:44,880
They're trying to complete it. They're
 

6005
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:46,710
They're trying to complete it. They're
trying to complete that rotation opening

6006
02:28:46,710 --> 02:28:46,720
trying to complete that rotation opening
 

6007
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:49,030
trying to complete that rotation opening
range

6008
02:28:49,030 --> 02:28:49,040
range
 

6009
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:50,630
range
back into the opening range. Back into

6010
02:28:50,630 --> 02:28:50,640
back into the opening range. Back into
 

6011
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:52,389
back into the opening range. Back into
the New York open print. This would be

6012
02:28:52,389 --> 02:28:52,399
the New York open print. This would be
 

6013
02:28:52,399 --> 02:28:55,830
the New York open print. This would be
if we get back above [laughter] this.

6014
02:28:55,830 --> 02:28:55,840
if we get back above [laughter] this.
 

6015
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:57,590
if we get back above [laughter] this.
It would be a look below New York and

6016
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:57,600
It would be a look below New York and
 

6017
02:28:57,600 --> 02:28:59,830
It would be a look below New York and
fail. So, so far we're looking below

6018
02:28:59,830 --> 02:28:59,840
fail. So, so far we're looking below
 

6019
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:02,070
fail. So, so far we're looking below
GlobeEx and failing. There's your big W.

6020
02:29:02,070 --> 02:29:02,080
GlobeEx and failing. There's your big W.
 

6021
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,590
GlobeEx and failing. There's your big W.
Any hold of this? They're looking for a

6022
02:29:03,590 --> 02:29:03,600
Any hold of this? They're looking for a
 

6023
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:06,469
Any hold of this? They're looking for a

6336
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:42,880
looking at, what I'm seeing on the tape.
 

6337
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:45,270
looking at, what I'm seeing on the tape.
It's the same as you get here, but

6338
02:37:45,270 --> 02:37:45,280
It's the same as you get here, but
 

6339
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:47,190
It's the same as you get here, but
normally not necessarily on mic because

6340
02:37:47,190 --> 02:37:47,200
normally not necessarily on mic because
 

6341
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:57,670
normally not necessarily on mic because
often I'm on the move.

6342
02:37:57,670 --> 02:37:57,680

 

6343
02:37:57,680 --> 02:38:05,190

Big battle here in this gray box.

6344
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:05,200

 

6345
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:08,230

I do I chart on a time frame. Yeah, M1

6346
02:38:08,230 --> 02:38:08,240
I do I chart on a time frame. Yeah, M1
 

6347
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:11,030
I do I chart on a time frame. Yeah, M1
for me.

6348
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,040
for me.
 

6349
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:12,790
for me.
I wouldn't advise you start with M1

6350
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:12,800
I wouldn't advise you start with M1
 

6351
02:38:12,800 --> 02:38:14,870
I wouldn't advise you start with M1
though again I'll go through all of this

6352
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:14,880
though again I'll go through all of this
 

6353
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:18,070
though again I'll go through all of this
stuff in the course but

6354
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:18,080
stuff in the course but
 

6355
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:19,510
stuff in the course but
I've been training a long long time

6356
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:19,520
I've been training a long long time
 

6357
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:22,870
I've been training a long long time
folks so I can read tape pretty

6358
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:22,880
folks so I can read tape pretty
 

6359
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:25,030
folks so I can read tape pretty
efficiently but takes time to train your

6360
02:38:25,030 --> 02:38:25,040
efficiently but takes time to train your
 

6361
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:38,389
efficiently but takes time to train your
eyes and your brain what you're seeing

6362
02:38:38,389 --> 02:38:38,399

 

6363
02:38:38,399 --> 02:38:45,510

exhausted

6364
02:38:45,510 --> 02:38:45,520

 

6365
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:50,630

It's trying to base out here.

6366
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:50,640

 

6367
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,469

We're just hanging out in this gray box

6368
02:38:52,469 --> 02:38:52,479
We're just hanging out in this gray box
 

6369
02:38:52,479 --> 02:38:54,870
We're just hanging out in this gray box
at the moment.

6370
02:38:54,870 --> 02:38:54,880
at the moment.
 

6371
02:38:54,880 --> 02:38:58,950
at the moment.
Mr. Gray box. We're just hanging out in

6372
02:38:58,950 --> 02:38:58,960
Mr. Gray box. We're just hanging out in
 

6373
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:00,630
Mr. Gray box. We're just hanging out in
above previous week low. That green

6374
02:39:00,630 --> 02:39:00,640
above previous week low. That green
 

6375
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:02,710
above previous week low. That green
line. VWOP is the do. This is your

6376
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:02,720
line. VWOP is the do. This is your
 

6377
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:04,630
line. VWOP is the do. This is your
previous week low. This is your VWAP.

6378
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:04,640
previous week low. This is your VWAP.
 

6379
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:06,950
previous week low. This is your VWAP.
This is lower time frame algo. This is

6380
02:39:06,950 --> 02:39:06,960
This is lower time frame algo. This is
 

6381
02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:09,990
This is lower time frame algo. This is
previous day low. This is New York open.

6382
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:10,000
previous day low. This is New York open.
 

6383
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,150
previous day low. This is New York open.
If we start leaving this liquidity, you

6384
02:39:12,150 --> 02:39:12,160
If we start leaving this liquidity, you
 

6385
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:13,590
If we start leaving this liquidity, you
might get more of a drastic move. But

6386
02:39:13,590 --> 02:39:13,600
might get more of a drastic move. But
 

6387
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:15,030
might get more of a drastic move. But
every time we've moved down, they've

6388
02:39:15,030 --> 02:39:15,040
every time we've moved down, they've
 

6389
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:20,389
every time we've moved down, they've
saved previous week low. So far,

6390
02:39:20,389 --> 02:39:20,399

 

6391
02:39:20,399 --> 02:39:22,309

we are starting to leave or attempt to

6392
02:39:22,309 --> 02:39:22,319
we are starting to leave or attempt to
 

6393
02:39:22,319 --> 02:39:24,070
we are starting to leave or attempt to
leave some of that volume above. But

6394
02:39:24,070 --> 02:39:24,080
leave some of that volume above. But
 

6395
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:25,510
leave some of that volume above. But
again, it's previous week low here,

6396
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:25,520
again, it's previous week low here,
 

6397
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:27,590
again, it's previous week low here,
GlobeEx below. Those can still be saved.

6398
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:27,600
GlobeEx below. Those can still be saved.
 

6399
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,349
GlobeEx below. Those can still be saved.
This green box, the rotation can happen

6400
02:39:29,349 --> 02:39:29,359
This green box, the rotation can happen
 

6401
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:36,389
This green box, the rotation can happen
between these two boxes here.

6402
02:39:36,389 --> 02:39:36,399

 

6403
02:39:36,399 --> 02:39:37,990

can be like a pullback that holds this.

6404
02:39:37,990 --> 02:39:38,000
can be like a pullback that holds this.
 

6405
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,750
can be like a pullback that holds this.
Bulls can defend this and try and go

6406
02:39:39,750 --> 02:39:39,760
Bulls can defend this and try and go
 

6407
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:41,990
Bulls can defend this and try and go
higher. So, this can be one of these

6408
02:39:41,990 --> 02:39:42,000
higher. So, this can be one of these
 

6409
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,990
higher. So, this can be one of these
into here and then they can try and

6410
02:39:43,990 --> 02:39:44,000
into here and then they can try and
 

6411
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,670
into here and then they can try and
reclaim this to go higher. If bears

6412
02:39:45,670 --> 02:39:45,680
reclaim this to go higher. If bears
 

6413
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:47,750
reclaim this to go higher. If bears
defend this, the rotation happens here.

6414
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:47,760
defend this, the rotation happens here.
 

6415
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:49,750
defend this, the rotation happens here.
If bears defend this, there's a bigger

6416
02:39:49,750 --> 02:39:49,760
If bears defend this, there's a bigger
 

6417
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:52,950
If bears defend this, there's a bigger
rotation in my mind. So, it's why I

6418
02:39:52,950 --> 02:39:52,960
rotation in my mind. So, it's why I
 

6419
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:54,389
rotation in my mind. So, it's why I
think the GlobeEx level and that other

6420
02:39:54,389 --> 02:39:54,399
think the GlobeEx level and that other
 

6421
02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:56,950
think the GlobeEx level and that other
gray box is a little bit more important

6422
02:39:56,950 --> 02:39:56,960
gray box is a little bit more important
 

6423
02:39:56,960 --> 02:39:58,550
gray box is a little bit more important
uh for bears if they're going to take

6424
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:58,560
uh for bears if they're going to take
 

6425
02:39:58,560 --> 02:39:59,990
uh for bears if they're going to take
control otherwise. I think it's still

6426
02:39:59,990 --> 02:40:00,000
control otherwise. I think it's still
 

6427
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,510
control otherwise. I think it's still
available for a higher squeeze at the

6428
02:40:01,510 --> 02:40:01,520
available for a higher squeeze at the
 

6429
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:05,590
available for a higher squeeze at the
moment. There you go. like that [snorts]

6430
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:05,600
moment. There you go. like that [snorts]
 

6431
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:06,950
moment. There you go. like that [snorts]
because they're defending the previous

6432
02:40:06,950 --> 02:40:06,960
because they're defending the previous
 

6433
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:09,110
because they're defending the previous
week. So, at the moment, I'd say weekly

6434
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:09,120
week. So, at the moment, I'd say weekly
 

6435
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:10,950
week. So, at the moment, I'd say weekly
traders are telling us we don't want to

6436
02:40:10,950 --> 02:40:10,960
traders are telling us we don't want to
 

6437
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:13,349
traders are telling us we don't want to
move. We want to defend. Bulls are

6438
02:40:13,349 --> 02:40:13,359
move. We want to defend. Bulls are
 

6439
02:40:13,359 --> 02:40:15,429
move. We want to defend. Bulls are
saying we want to defend the weekly

6440
02:40:15,429 --> 02:40:15,439
saying we want to defend the weekly
 

6441
02:40:15,439 --> 02:40:17,190
saying we want to defend the weekly
level. This level right here. We're not

6443
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:18,870

looking to move underneath this level

6444
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:18,880
looking to move underneath this level
 

6445
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:21,349
looking to move underneath this level
right here. This level right here. We do

6446
02:40:21,349 --> 02:40:21,359
right here. This level right here. We do
 

6447
02:40:21,359 --> 02:40:23,110
right here. This level right here. We do
not want to move underneath this level

6448
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:23,120
not want to move underneath this level
 

6449
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:24,950
not want to move underneath this level
right here. Didn't know you could do

6450
02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:24,960
right here. Didn't know you could do
 

6451
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:33,830
right here. Didn't know you could do
that. That's pretty cool. [snorts]

6452

6453
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,990

Did you put a buy order on the IB recap?

Did you put a buy order on the IB recap?
No, I just I joined as soon as I saw it,

actually had to mark it in. It left so

6460
02:40:42,630 --> 02:40:42,640
actually had to mark it in. It left so
 

6461
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:44,309
actually had to mark it in. It left so
quickly.

talk about until they've got one side
 

6495
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:27,750
talk about until they've got one side
stuck.

6496
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:27,760
stuck.
 

6497

stuck.
I don't think there's edge at the moment

6498
02:41:29,110 --> 02:41:29,120
I don't think there's edge at the moment
 

6499
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:31,830
I don't think there's edge at the moment
in this market.

6500
02:41:31,830 --> 02:41:31,840
in this market.
 

6501
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:34,389
in this market.
Don't think there's not edge yet. It

6502
02:41:34,389 --> 02:41:34,399
Don't think there's not edge yet. It
 

6503
02:41:34,399 --> 02:41:36,790
Don't think there's not edge yet. It
will develop. Uh maybe in lunch, maybe

6504
02:41:36,790 --> 02:41:36,800
will develop. Uh maybe in lunch, maybe
 

6505
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:39,030
will develop. Uh maybe in lunch, maybe
after lunch.

6506
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:39,040
after lunch.
 

6507
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:41,590

What I'd say at the moment,

6508
02:41:41,590 --> 02:41:41,600
What I'd say at the moment,
 

6509
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:43,510
What I'd say at the moment,
there is significant buyer trapped in

6510
02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:43,520
there is significant buyer trapped in
 

6511
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:49,670
there is significant buyer trapped in
this wick up here with size.

6513
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:51,990

Yeah, twice. So, there's about two to

6514
02:41:51,990 --> 02:41:52,000
Yeah, twice. So, there's about two to
 

6515
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,710
Yeah, twice. So, there's about two to
300 lots caught up there so far. At the

6516
02:41:54,710 --> 02:41:54,720
300 lots caught up there so far. At the
 

6517
02:41:54,720 --> 02:41:57,110
300 lots caught up there so far. At the
lows,

6518
02:41:57,110 --> 02:41:57,120
lows,
 

6519
02:41:57,120 --> 02:41:58,710
lows,
we have seen some selling into the lows

6520
02:41:58,710 --> 02:41:58,720
we have seen some selling into the lows
 

6521
02:41:58,720 --> 02:42:00,230
we have seen some selling into the lows
and not moved lower. So, it's just a

6522
02:42:00,230 --> 02:42:00,240
and not moved lower. So, it's just a
 

6523
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:01,990
and not moved lower. So, it's just a
range.

6524
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:02,000
range.
 

6525
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:03,670
range.
Buyers caught the highs, sellers caught

6526
02:42:03,670 --> 02:42:03,680
Buyers caught the highs, sellers caught
 

6527
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:06,630
Buyers caught the highs, sellers caught
the lows. So far, back to this previous

6528
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:06,640
the lows. So far, back to this previous
 

6529
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:09,190
the lows. So far, back to this previous
week low again. This is where they

02:42:09,190 --> 02:42:09,200
week low again. This is where they
 

6531
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:11,110
week low again. This is where they
defended the last few times and we've

defended the last few times and we've
 

6533
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:20,630
defended the last few times and we've
squeezed off it.

be honest, I think this can keep

just takes time.

02:46:18,070 --> 02:46:18,080
No one's got the money to [\h__\h] build
 

6653
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:29,190
No one's got the money to [\h__\h] build
them anymore.

6654
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:29,200

 

6655
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:30,550

All right, they're trying to force this

6656
02:46:30,550 --> 02:46:30,560
All right, they're trying to force this
 

6657
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:32,309
All right, they're trying to force this
squeeze. Bulls just defended that

6658
02:46:32,309 --> 02:46:32,319
squeeze. Bulls just defended that
 

6659
02:46:32,319 --> 02:46:34,150
squeeze. Bulls just defended that
previous week low, that horizontal line.

6660
02:46:34,150 --> 02:46:34,160
previous week low, that horizontal line.
 

6661
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:35,990
previous week low, that horizontal line.
So weekly, bulls are trying to defend

6662
02:46:35,990 --> 02:46:36,000
So weekly, bulls are trying to defend
 

6663
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:37,349
So weekly, bulls are trying to defend
this horizontal line. They're trying to

6664
02:46:37,349 --> 02:46:37,359
this horizontal line. They're trying to
 

6665
02:46:37,359 --> 02:46:38,950
this horizontal line. They're trying to
get a squeeze out to this New York high

6666
02:46:38,950 --> 02:46:38,960
get a squeeze out to this New York high
 

6667
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:40,870
get a squeeze out to this New York high
and previous day low and this gray box

6668
02:46:40,870 --> 02:46:40,880
and previous day low and this gray box
 

6669
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:43,670
and previous day low and this gray box
through that. Can't rule out a gap fill.

6670
02:46:43,670 --> 02:46:43,680
through that. Can't rule out a gap fill.
 

6671
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:45,510
through that. Can't rule out a gap fill.
It's absolute madness, I know, but

6672
02:46:45,510 --> 02:46:45,520
It's absolute madness, I know, but
 

6673
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:46,790
It's absolute madness, I know, but
that's the kind of day we're in. You

6674
02:46:46,790 --> 02:46:46,800
that's the kind of day we're in. You
 

6675
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:50,470
that's the kind of day we're in. You
cannot rule out a gap fill.

6676
02:46:50,470 --> 02:46:50,480
cannot rule out a gap fill.
 

6677
02:46:50,480 --> 02:46:55,349
cannot rule out a gap fill.

6678
02:46:55,349 --> 02:46:55,359

 

6679
02:46:55,359 --> 02:46:58,630

>> caught short off 89. I mean, uh, you

6680
02:46:58,630 --> 02:46:58,640
>> caught short off 89. I mean, uh, you
 

6681
02:46:58,640 --> 02:47:01,670
>> caught short off 89. I mean, uh, you
were in here. I mean, I think I think

6682
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:01,680
were in here. I mean, I think I think
 

6683
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:03,030
were in here. I mean, I think I think
bulls are starting to take control of

6684
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:03,040
bulls are starting to take control of
 

6685
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:04,630
bulls are starting to take control of
the market right now. So, I think you

6686
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:04,640
the market right now. So, I think you
 

6687
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:07,750
the market right now. So, I think you
could be in trouble. That's my thought.

6688
02:47:07,750 --> 02:47:07,760
could be in trouble. That's my thought.
 

6689
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:10,230
could be in trouble. That's my thought.
They would have to defend 700. You have

6690
02:47:10,230 --> 02:47:10,240
They would have to defend 700. You have
 

6691
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:13,030
They would have to defend 700. You have
bulls are def are stuck above 86 on that

6692
02:47:13,030 --> 02:47:13,040
bulls are def are stuck above 86 on that
 

6693
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:15,429
bulls are def are stuck above 86 on that
wick, right? We do have excess there,

6694
02:47:15,429 --> 02:47:15,439
wick, right? We do have excess there,
 

6695
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:16,870
wick, right? We do have excess there,
but the moment you break that, you're

6696
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:16,880
but the moment you break that, you're
 

6697
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:25,990
but the moment you break that, you're
going to get a short covering rally.

6698
02:47:25,990 --> 02:47:26,000

 

6699
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,910

Yeah, if you were down that much and

Friday, Monday, Tuesday sat on my hands

Friday, Monday, Tuesday sat on my hands
for explosive moves only to get wicked

6723
02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:49,830
that, buddy. Yeah, it's it's tough
sometimes. Sometimes it can be tough. I

6724
02:47:49,830 --> 02:47:49,840
sometimes. Sometimes it can be tough. I
 

6725
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:51,990
sometimes. Sometimes it can be tough. I
really wanted to short. You know that

6726
02:47:51,990 --> 02:47:52,000
really wanted to short. You know that
 

6727
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,429
really wanted to short. You know that
this is the thing for me. I really

6728
02:47:53,429 --> 02:47:53,439
this is the thing for me. I really
 

6729
02:47:53,439 --> 02:47:55,269
this is the thing for me. I really
wanted to short. I didn't this wasn't

6730
02:47:55,269 --> 02:47:55,279
wanted to short. I didn't this wasn't
 

6731
02:47:55,279 --> 02:47:57,190
wanted to short. I didn't this wasn't
enough for me. This hunt above here. I

6732
02:47:57,190 --> 02:47:57,200
enough for me. This hunt above here. I
 

6733
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:59,750
enough for me. This hunt above here. I
wanted to get above these players here

6734
02:47:59,750 --> 02:47:59,760
wanted to get above these players here
 

6735
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:01,030
wanted to get above these players here
and then I would have been interested.

6736
02:48:01,030 --> 02:48:01,040
and then I would have been interested.
 

6737
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:02,469
and then I would have been interested.
Like a little gap fill reversal would

6738
02:48:02,469 --> 02:48:02,479
Like a little gap fill reversal would
 

6739
02:48:02,479 --> 02:48:04,950
Like a little gap fill reversal would
have been amazing this morning. But uh

6740
02:48:04,950 --> 02:48:04,960
have been amazing this morning. But uh
 

6741
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:06,469
have been amazing this morning. But uh
you know if we could have done this or

6742
02:48:06,469 --> 02:48:06,479
you know if we could have done this or
 

6743
02:48:06,479 --> 02:48:08,710
you know if we could have done this or
even into value, defended value,

6744
02:48:08,710 --> 02:48:08,720
even into value, defended value,
 

6745
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:10,389
even into value, defended value,
defended this, I would have loved that

6746
02:48:10,389 --> 02:48:10,399
defended this, I would have loved that
 

6747
02:48:10,399 --> 02:48:13,110
defended this, I would have loved that
short. All right, that's an A+ setup for

6748
02:48:13,110 --> 02:48:13,120
short. All right, that's an A+ setup for
 

6749
02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:15,110
short. All right, that's an A+ setup for
me. But unfortunately they they didn't

6750
02:48:15,110 --> 02:48:15,120
me. But unfortunately they they didn't
 

6751
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:17,990
me. But unfortunately they they didn't
bring it. More balls got caught up in

6752
02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:18,000
bring it. More balls got caught up in
 

6753
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,110
bring it. More balls got caught up in
there again. I don't know who was just

6754
02:48:19,110 --> 02:48:19,120
there again. I don't know who was just
 

6755
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:21,670
there again. I don't know who was just
asking about that, but uh all the time

6756
02:48:21,670 --> 02:48:21,680
asking about that, but uh all the time
 

6757
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:24,070
asking about that, but uh all the time
they're protecting Where's this player

6758
02:48:24,070 --> 02:48:24,080
they're protecting Where's this player
 

6759
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:26,150
they're protecting Where's this player
on the tape? All the time they're

6760
02:48:26,150 --> 02:48:26,160
on the tape? All the time they're
 

6761
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:27,670
on the tape? All the time they're
protecting

6762
02:48:27,670 --> 02:48:27,680
protecting
 

6763
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:30,630
protecting
85, you look okay. But uh the moment

6764
02:48:30,630 --> 02:48:30,640
85, you look okay. But uh the moment
 

6765
02:48:30,640 --> 02:48:32,630
85, you look okay. But uh the moment
they reclaim 85, I'd be very concerned

6766
02:48:32,630 --> 02:48:32,640
they reclaim 85, I'd be very concerned
 

6767
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:36,630
they reclaim 85, I'd be very concerned
for you guys who are short.

6768
02:48:36,630 --> 02:48:36,640
for you guys who are short.
 

6769
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:38,389
for you guys who are short.
It's just a rotation at the moment. But

6770
02:48:38,389 --> 02:48:38,399
It's just a rotation at the moment. But
 

6771
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:41,190
It's just a rotation at the moment. But
85 is your level. This looks more

6772
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:41,200
85 is your level. This looks more
 

6773
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:43,110
85 is your level. This looks more
bullish to me. I'm going to be honest.

6774
02:48:43,110 --> 02:48:43,120
bullish to me. I'm going to be honest.
 

6775
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:44,950
bullish to me. I'm going to be honest.
It is an area where they can trap balls,

6776
02:48:44,950 --> 02:48:44,960
It is an area where they can trap balls,
 

6777
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:47,750
It is an area where they can trap balls,
but that 85, they've caught them twice,

6778
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:47,760
but that 85, they've caught them twice,
 

6779
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:49,429
but that 85, they've caught them twice,
but

6780
02:48:49,429 --> 02:48:49,439
but
 

6781
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:51,429
but
you're coming into lunch. I don't know.

6782
02:48:51,429 --> 02:48:51,439
you're coming into lunch. I don't know.
 

6783
02:48:51,439 --> 02:48:53,830
you're coming into lunch. I don't know.
Who knows, folks? Like, I can only tell

6784
02:48:53,830 --> 02:48:53,840
Who knows, folks? Like, I can only tell
 

6785
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:55,269
Who knows, folks? Like, I can only tell
you what I see. I'm not going to sit

6786
02:48:55,269 --> 02:48:55,279
you what I see. I'm not going to sit
 

6787
02:48:55,279 --> 02:48:56,150
you what I see. I'm not going to sit
here and tell you what's going to

6788
02:48:56,150 --> 02:48:56,160
here and tell you what's going to
 

6789
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:59,269
here and tell you what's going to
happen. I have no idea.

6790
02:48:59,269 --> 02:48:59,279
happen. I have no idea.
 

6791
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:01,349
happen. I have no idea.
CBD is going up, but no follow through.

6792
02:49:01,349 --> 02:49:01,359
CBD is going up, but no follow through.
 

6793
02:49:01,359 --> 02:49:02,469
CBD is going up, but no follow through.
Yeah, but it's been going up since

6794
02:49:02,469 --> 02:49:02,479
Yeah, but it's been going up since
 

6795
02:49:02,479 --> 02:49:04,230
Yeah, but it's been going up since
10:00. I mean, you had divergence from

6796
02:49:04,230 --> 02:49:04,240
10:00. I mean, you had divergence from
 

6797
02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:06,070
10:00. I mean, you had divergence from
10 to 11, right? And then, and then we

6798
02:49:06,070 --> 02:49:06,080
10 to 11, right? And then, and then we
 

6799
02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:08,469
10 to 11, right? And then, and then we
put in the pivot. I mean, this is why I

6800
02:49:08,469 --> 02:49:08,479
put in the pivot. I mean, this is why I
 

6801
02:49:08,479 --> 02:49:10,790
put in the pivot. I mean, this is why I
don't pay too much attention to CBD. I

6802
02:49:10,790 --> 02:49:10,800

this buyer here. He's stuck above 85. I
 

6845
02:50:38,479 --> 02:50:41,110
this buyer here. He's stuck above 85. I
can see him stuck above 85. They've

6846
02:50:41,110 --> 02:50:41,120
can see him stuck above 85. They've
 

6847
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:43,349
can see him stuck above 85. They've
defended it a few times. The moment that

6848
02:50:43,349 --> 02:50:43,359
defended it a few times. The moment that
 

6849
02:50:43,359 --> 02:50:44,630
defended it a few times. The moment that
breaks though, I think you get a squeeze

6850
02:50:44,630 --> 02:50:44,640
breaks though, I think you get a squeeze
 

6851
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:46,469
breaks though, I think you get a squeeze
out. So, just be aware. I know some of

6852
02:50:46,469 --> 02:50:46,479
out. So, just be aware. I know some of
 

6853
02:50:46,479 --> 02:50:47,910
out. So, just be aware. I know some of
you are short right now. I'm obviously

6854
02:50:47,910 --> 02:50:47,920
you are short right now. I'm obviously
 

6855
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:49,830
you are short right now. I'm obviously
I'm not in a position on cash right now.

6856
02:50:49,830 --> 02:50:49,840
I'm not in a position on cash right now.

6861
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,309
So, I don't think I don't think I'm take
another trade today. I think the A+ is

6862
02:50:56,309 --> 02:50:56,319
another trade today. I think the A+ is
 

6863
02:50:56,319 --> 02:50:59,190
another trade today. I think the A+ is
probably gone.

6864
02:50:59,190 --> 02:50:59,200
probably gone.
 

6865
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:00,870

probably see a PC flip. Let's have a

6960
02:53:00,389 --> 02:53:00,399
probably see a PC flip. Let's have a
 

6961
02:53:00,399 --> 02:53:03,269
probably see a PC flip. Let's have a
look. It's getting close. It's getting

6962
02:53:03,269 --> 02:53:03,279
look. It's getting close. It's getting
 

6963
02:53:03,279 --> 02:53:04,950
look. It's getting close. It's getting
close to flipping point of control up

6964
02:53:04,950 --> 02:53:04,960
close to flipping point of control up
 

6965
02:53:04,960 --> 02:53:10,070
close to flipping point of control up
here. Getting close. [snorts]

6966
02:53:10,070 --> 02:53:10,080

 

6967
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:12,070

Being on quantile, do I lose some of the

6968
02:53:12,070 --> 02:53:12,080
Being on quantile, do I lose some of the
 

6969
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:14,790
Being on quantile, do I lose some of the
content or can I apply most of them or

6970
02:53:14,790 --> 02:53:14,800
content or can I apply most of them or
 

6971
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:17,030
content or can I apply most of them or
twist? Yeah, you can. You can apply most

6972
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:17,040
twist? Yeah, you can. You can apply most
 

6973
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:20,630
twist? Yeah, you can. You can apply most
of them on Quantau, mate.

6974
02:53:20,630 --> 02:53:20,640
of them on Quantau, mate.
 

6975
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:23,429
of them on Quantau, mate.
I don't have a script for Quantau, but

6976
02:53:23,429 --> 02:53:23,439
I don't have a script for Quantau, but
 

6977
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:25,510
I don't have a script for Quantau, but
you can apply all the same thesis onto

6978
02:53:25,510 --> 02:53:25,520
you can apply all the same thesis onto
 

6979
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:28,389
you can apply all the same thesis onto
there and I can look to build you one if

6980
02:53:28,389 --> 02:53:28,399
there and I can look to build you one if
 

6981
02:53:28,399 --> 02:53:30,679
there and I can look to build you one if
it's if it's helpful for you. Okay,

6982
02:53:30,679 --> 02:53:30,689
it's if it's helpful for you. Okay,
 

6983
02:53:30,689 --> 02:53:31,990
it's if it's helpful for you. Okay,
[snorts] back towards this. Remember

6984
02:53:31,990 --> 02:53:32,000
[snorts] back towards this. Remember
 

6985
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,710
[snorts] back towards this. Remember
85s. If you reclaim 85s here, anyone

6986
02:53:34,710 --> 02:53:34,720
85s. If you reclaim 85s here, anyone
 

6987
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:35,990
85s. If you reclaim 85s here, anyone
who's short, I think you will get

6988
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:36,000
who's short, I think you will get
 

6989
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,870
who's short, I think you will get
squeezed out. 85 is the level that is

6990
02:53:38,870 --> 02:53:38,880
squeezed out. 85 is the level that is
 

6991
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:41,030
squeezed out. 85 is the level that is
their pain point for the buyers above.

6992
02:53:41,030 --> 02:53:41,040
their pain point for the buyers above.
 

6993
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:44,630
their pain point for the buyers above.
If they if shorts cannot defend 85, I

6994
02:53:44,630 --> 02:53:44,640
If they if shorts cannot defend 85, I
 

6995
02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:45,990
If they if shorts cannot defend 85, I
think you will see a squeeze out here.

6996
02:53:45,990 --> 02:53:46,000
think you will see a squeeze out here.
 

6997
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:53,830
think you will see a squeeze out here.
So, I'm just trying to make you aware.

6998
02:53:53,830 --> 02:53:53,840

 

6999
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:55,429

Be very careful. This is your shelf

7000
02:53:55,429 --> 02:53:55,439
Be very careful. This is your shelf
 

7001
02:53:55,439 --> 02:54:01,465
Be very careful. This is your shelf
here.

7002
02:54:01,465 --> 02:54:01,475

 

7003
02:54:01,475 --> 02:54:04,070

[snorts] The squeeze out from here can

7004
02:54:04,070 --> 02:54:04,080
[snorts] The squeeze out from here can
 

7005
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:05,830
[snorts] The squeeze out from here can
be nasty because you've been here a

7006
02:54:05,830 --> 02:54:05,840
be nasty because you've been here a
 

7007
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:07,429
be nasty because you've been here a
considerable amount of time. Same as the

7008
02:54:07,429 --> 02:54:07,439
considerable amount of time. Same as the
 

7009
02:54:07,439 --> 02:54:09,670
considerable amount of time. Same as the
drop. If you get the drop, but once we

7010
02:54:09,670 --> 02:54:09,680
drop. If you get the drop, but once we
 

7011
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:11,190
drop. If you get the drop, but once we
built this much liquidity, remember

7012
02:54:11,190 --> 02:54:11,200
built this much liquidity, remember
 

7013
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:14,870
built this much liquidity, remember
we've been here from 11 over 30 minutes,

7014
02:54:14,870 --> 02:54:14,880
we've been here from 11 over 30 minutes,
 

7015
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:17,510
we've been here from 11 over 30 minutes,
40 minutes, this can get real nasty

7016
02:54:17,510 --> 02:54:17,520
40 minutes, this can get real nasty
 

7017
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:20,070
40 minutes, this can get real nasty
either way. There's 385. You're going to

7018
02:54:20,070 --> 02:54:20,080
either way. There's 385. You're going to
 

7019
02:54:20,080 --> 02:54:22,230
either way. There's 385. You're going to
see the squeeze now, folks. I If you

7020
02:54:22,230 --> 02:54:22,240
see the squeeze now, folks. I If you
 

7021
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:24,150
see the squeeze now, folks. I If you
were short, you you want to cut this. I

7022
02:54:24,150 --> 02:54:24,160
were short, you you want to cut this. I
 

7023
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:25,990
were short, you you want to cut this. I
would not even risk this high because if

7024
02:54:25,990 --> 02:54:26,000
would not even risk this high because if
 

7025
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,710
would not even risk this high because if
that gets done, you're toast. It goes

7026
02:54:28,710 --> 02:54:28,720
that gets done, you're toast. It goes
 

7027
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:32,630
that gets done, you're toast. It goes
very very quick.

7028
02:54:32,630 --> 02:54:32,640

 

7029
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:35,269

massive battle. But I I personally would

7030
02:54:35,269 --> 02:54:35,279
massive battle. But I I personally would
 

7031
02:54:35,279 --> 02:54:36,550
massive battle. But I I personally would
be done with this if you were looking

7032
02:54:36,550 --> 02:54:36,560
be done with this if you were looking
 

7033
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:38,230
be done with this if you were looking
for that short rotation back down. You

7034
02:54:38,230 --> 02:54:38,240
for that short rotation back down. You
 

7035
02:54:38,240 --> 02:54:39,750
for that short rotation back down. You
can always add back in. If you stopped

7036
02:54:39,750 --> 02:54:39,760
can always add back in. If you stopped
 

7037
02:54:39,760 --> 02:54:40,950
can always add back in. If you stopped
out there, you can always add back in

7038
02:54:40,950 --> 02:54:40,960
out there, you can always add back in
 

7039
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:43,349
out there, you can always add back in
when you see what you want. But this is

7040
02:54:43,349 --> 02:54:43,359
when you see what you want. But this is
 

7041
02:54:43,359 --> 02:54:45,510
when you see what you want. But this is
just a nasty rotation and people are

7042
02:54:45,510 --> 02:54:45,520
just a nasty rotation and people are
 

7043
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:51,510
just a nasty rotation and people are
going to get hurt

7044
02:54:51,510 --> 02:54:51,520

 

7045
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:54,790

if it crosses 685. Yeah. I mean, very

7046
02:54:54,790 --> 02:54:54,800
if it crosses 685. Yeah. I mean, very
 

7047
02:54:54,800 --> 02:54:56,469
if it crosses 685. Yeah. I mean, very
potentially comes up to New York open,

7048
02:54:56,469 --> 02:54:56,479
potentially comes up to New York open,
 

7049
02:54:56,479 --> 02:54:58,550
potentially comes up to New York open,
right?

7050
02:54:58,550 --> 02:54:58,560
right?
 

7051
02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:01,349
right?
very potentially comes up to here if

7052
02:55:01,349 --> 02:55:01,359
very potentially comes up to here if
 

7053
02:55:01,359 --> 02:55:03,349
very potentially comes up to here if
they if they've just popped that and

7054
02:55:03,349 --> 02:55:03,359
they if they've just popped that and
 

7055
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:06,150
they if they've just popped that and
failed it underneath here. Really got to

7056
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:06,160
failed it underneath here. Really got to
 

7057
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:07,750
failed it underneath here. Really got to
watch this previous week low. But this

7058
02:55:07,750 --> 02:55:07,760
watch this previous week low. But this
 

7059
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:09,349
watch this previous week low. But this
level here, bears take more control

7060
02:55:09,349 --> 02:55:09,359
level here, bears take more control
 

7061
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:13,190
level here, bears take more control
under this box.

7062
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:13,200

 

7063
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:18,870

I think bulls have

7064
02:55:18,870 --> 02:55:18,880

 

7065
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:19,990

I don't know. I don't know what to say.

7066
02:55:19,990 --> 02:55:20,000
I don't know. I don't know what to say.
 

7067
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:20,950
I don't know. I don't know what to say.
I don't think there's a lot of edge

7068
02:55:20,950 --> 02:55:20,960
I don't think there's a lot of edge
 

7069
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:22,710
I don't think there's a lot of edge
here, but I think bulls have the ability

7070
02:55:22,710 --> 02:55:22,720
here, but I think bulls have the ability
 

7071
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:25,349
here, but I think bulls have the ability
to squeeze out here into lunch. That's

7072
02:55:25,349 --> 02:55:25,359
to squeeze out here into lunch. That's
 

7073
02:55:25,359 --> 02:55:27,910
to squeeze out here into lunch. That's
what I'd be very concerned about. I in

7074
02:55:27,910 --> 02:55:27,920
what I'd be very concerned about. I in
 

7075
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:30,550
what I'd be very concerned about. I in
here. I haven't seen us leave this,

7076
02:55:30,550 --> 02:55:30,560
here. I haven't seen us leave this,
 

7077
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:32,469
here. I haven't seen us leave this,
reject this, leave this, reject this.

7078
02:55:32,469 --> 02:55:32,479
reject this, leave this, reject this.
 

7079
02:55:32,479 --> 02:55:34,309
reject this, leave this, reject this.
Looking for that short. That's where I'd

7080
02:55:34,309 --> 02:55:34,319
Looking for that short. That's where I'd
 

7081
02:55:34,319 --> 02:55:36,469
Looking for that short. That's where I'd
be interested in the short. If it leaves

7082
02:55:36,469 --> 02:55:36,479
be interested in the short. If it leaves
 

7083
02:55:36,479 --> 02:55:38,950
be interested in the short. If it leaves
aggressively this volume and does this,

7084
02:55:38,950 --> 02:55:38,960
aggressively this volume and does this,
 

7085
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:41,990
aggressively this volume and does this,
I'm not into like picking tops, right?

7086
02:55:41,990 --> 02:55:42,000
I'm not into like picking tops, right?
 

7087
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,670
I'm not into like picking tops, right?
We're in a short squeeze. Flow zones are

7088
02:55:43,670 --> 02:55:43,680
We're in a short squeeze. Flow zones are
 

7089
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:45,269
We're in a short squeeze. Flow zones are
trading upside. We're building volume.

7090
02:55:45,269 --> 02:55:45,279
trading upside. We're building volume.
 

7091
02:55:45,279 --> 02:55:47,830
trading upside. We're building volume.
We have liquidity above it can aim for.

7092
02:55:47,830 --> 02:55:47,840
We have liquidity above it can aim for.
 

7093
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:49,910
We have liquidity above it can aim for.
I'm not into trying to trade the top of

7094
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:49,920
I'm not into trying to trade the top of
 

7095
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:51,429
I'm not into trying to trade the top of
this range. That's way too risky. I

7096
02:55:51,429 --> 02:55:51,439
this range. That's way too risky. I
 

7097
02:55:51,439 --> 02:55:54,469
this range. That's way too risky. I
haven't seen us leave this range. So,

7098
02:55:54,469 --> 02:55:54,479
haven't seen us leave this range. So,
 

7099
02:55:54,479 --> 02:55:56,389
haven't seen us leave this range. So,
for me, it's not a short. It might

7100
02:55:56,389 --> 02:55:56,399
for me, it's not a short. It might
 

7101
02:55:56,399 --> 02:55:58,070
for me, it's not a short. It might
develop into a short, but for me at the

7102
02:55:58,070 --> 02:55:58,080
develop into a short, but for me at the
 

7103
02:55:58,080 --> 02:55:59,750
develop into a short, but for me at the
moment, it's not a short. It's also not

7104
02:55:59,750 --> 02:55:59,760
moment, it's not a short. It's also not
 

7105
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:04,230
moment, it's not a short. It's also not
a long I take. It's a nothing.

7106
02:56:04,230 --> 02:56:04,240
a long I take. It's a nothing.
 

7107
02:56:04,240 --> 02:56:09,030
a long I take. It's a nothing.
It's a nothing.

7108
02:56:09,030 --> 02:56:09,040

 

7109
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:11,349

I mean,

7110
02:56:11,349 --> 02:56:11,359
I mean,
 

7111
02:56:11,359 --> 02:56:12,710
I mean,
bulls really should have squeezed

7112
02:56:12,710 --> 02:56:12,720
bulls really should have squeezed
 

7113
02:56:12,720 --> 02:56:16,790
bulls really should have squeezed
through 85 there and they didn't.

7114
02:56:16,790 --> 02:56:16,800
through 85 there and they didn't.
 

7115
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:19,110
through 85 there and they didn't.
It's looking kind of gross. How long

7116
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:19,120
It's looking kind of gross. How long
 

7117
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:20,630
It's looking kind of gross. How long
have we got till lunch? Oh, we're into

7118
02:56:20,630 --> 02:56:20,640
have we got till lunch? Oh, we're into
 

7119
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:22,309
have we got till lunch? Oh, we're into
lunch. I didn't even realize. Well, that

7120
02:56:22,309 --> 02:56:22,319
lunch. I didn't even realize. Well, that
 

7121
02:56:22,319 --> 02:56:24,389
lunch. I didn't even realize. Well, that
explains a few things.

7122
02:56:24,389 --> 02:56:24,399
explains a few things.
 

7123
02:56:24,399 --> 02:56:27,110
explains a few things.
Yeah, it's it's done. Volume will

7124
02:56:27,110 --> 02:56:27,120
Yeah, it's it's done. Volume will
 

7125
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:28,550
Yeah, it's it's done. Volume will
dissipate now. As you can see, look,

7126
02:56:28,550 --> 02:56:28,560
dissipate now. As you can see, look,
 

7127
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:30,070
dissipate now. As you can see, look,
volume's dissipating. Unless you get a

7128
02:56:30,070 --> 02:56:30,080
volume's dissipating. Unless you get a
 

7129
02:56:30,080 --> 02:56:31,990
volume's dissipating. Unless you get a
breakout, the volume's done. We're done.

7130
02:56:31,990 --> 02:56:32,000
breakout, the volume's done. We're done.
 

7131
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,590
breakout, the volume's done. We're done.
I didn't even realize we're into lunch

7132
02:56:33,590 --> 02:56:33,600
I didn't even realize we're into lunch
 

7133
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:35,110
I didn't even realize we're into lunch
already. My bad.

7134
02:56:35,110 --> 02:56:35,120
already. My bad.
 

7135
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:37,190
already. My bad.
>> I had no idea.

7136
02:56:37,190 --> 02:56:37,200
>> I had no idea.
 

7137
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:38,469
>> I had no idea.
I had no idea. All right, I'm getting

7138
02:56:38,469 --> 02:56:38,479
I had no idea. All right, I'm getting
 

7139
02:56:38,479 --> 02:56:40,309
I had no idea. All right, I'm getting
out of here. Time to eat some food. Go

7140
02:56:40,309 --> 02:56:40,319
out of here. Time to eat some food. Go
 

7141
02:56:40,319 --> 02:56:42,469
out of here. Time to eat some food. Go
for a walk. Get off the screens. Uh, be

7142
02:56:42,469 --> 02:56:42,479
for a walk. Get off the screens. Uh, be
 

7143
02:56:42,479 --> 02:56:44,389

careful rest of the day. Be very, very
careful. This is a

7146
02:56:46,710 --> 02:56:46,720
careful. This is a
 

7147
02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:48,710
careful. This is a
nasty, nasty, nasty market. All right,

7148
02:56:48,710 --> 02:56:48,720
nasty, nasty, nasty market. All right,
 

7149
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:50,710
nasty, nasty, nasty market. All right,
this is what I'm seeing right now. This

7150
02:56:50,710 --> 02:56:50,720
this is what I'm seeing right now. This
 

7151
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:52,870
this is what I'm seeing right now. This
is your protrend. This is the breakdown.

7152
02:56:52,870 --> 02:56:52,880
is your protrend. This is the breakdown.
 

7153
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:54,950
is your protrend. This is the breakdown.
We have not retested these areas up here

7154
02:56:54,950 --> 02:56:54,960
We have not retested these areas up here
 

7155
02:56:54,960 --> 02:56:56,309
We have not retested these areas up here
which were locations I'd want to be

7156
02:56:56,309 --> 02:56:56,319
which were locations I'd want to be
 

7157
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:57,750
which were locations I'd want to be
short. Think about the main trend. This

7158
02:56:57,750 --> 02:56:57,760
short. Think about the main trend. This
 

7159
02:56:57,760 --> 02:57:01,990
short. Think about the main trend. This
is the main trend. Okay. If a very very

7160
02:57:01,990 --> 02:57:02,000
is the main trend. Okay. If a very very
 

7161
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,710
is the main trend. Okay. If a very very
big if if bulls are able to defend this

7162
02:57:04,710 --> 02:57:04,720
big if if bulls are able to defend this
 

7163
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:06,790
big if if bulls are able to defend this
maybe they can come and run some of

7164
02:57:06,790 --> 02:57:06,800
maybe they can come and run some of
 

7165
02:57:06,800 --> 02:57:08,150
maybe they can come and run some of
this. I mean it would be really nasty.

7166
02:57:08,150 --> 02:57:08,160
this. I mean it would be really nasty.
 

7167
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:10,150
this. I mean it would be really nasty.
But if there was a short covering rally

7168
02:57:10,150 --> 02:57:10,160
But if there was a short covering rally
 

7169
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:13,030
But if there was a short covering rally
you would see that if bull if bears can

7170
02:57:13,030 --> 02:57:13,040
you would see that if bull if bears can
 

7171
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:14,710
you would see that if bull if bears can
defend this edge here. You can see this

7172
02:57:14,710 --> 02:57:14,720
defend this edge here. You can see this
 

7173
02:57:14,720 --> 02:57:17,590
defend this edge here. You can see this
rotation back into here and this can

7174
02:57:17,590 --> 02:57:17,600
rotation back into here and this can
 

7175
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:18,870
rotation back into here and this can
build out here. And if you build

7176
02:57:18,870 --> 02:57:18,880
build out here. And if you build
 

7177
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:20,950
build out here. And if you build
liquidity here there's still room to

7178
02:57:20,950 --> 02:57:20,960
liquidity here there's still room to
 

7179
02:57:20,960 --> 02:57:22,630
liquidity here there's still room to
come lower. But we have excess down

7180
02:57:22,630 --> 02:57:22,640
come lower. But we have excess down
 

7181
02:57:22,640 --> 02:57:25,190
come lower. But we have excess down
there. So you're in a rotational market.

7182
02:57:25,190 --> 02:57:25,200
there. So you're in a rotational market.
 

7183
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:27,190
there. So you're in a rotational market.
There's your IB high. There's your IB

7184
02:57:27,190 --> 02:57:27,200
There's your IB high. There's your IB
 

7185
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:29,750
There's your IB high. There's your IB
low. You are in a rotational market. You

7186
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:29,760
low. You are in a rotational market. You
 

7187
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:32,550
low. You are in a rotational market. You
are not in a trending market in terms of

7188
02:57:32,550 --> 02:57:32,560
are not in a trending market in terms of
 

7189
02:57:32,560 --> 02:57:34,309
are not in a trending market in terms of
intraday. All right. You are in a

7190
02:57:34,309 --> 02:57:34,319
intraday. All right. You are in a
 

7191
02:57:34,319 --> 02:57:37,110
intraday. All right. You are in a
rotational market between IB high and IB

7192
02:57:37,110 --> 02:57:37,120
rotational market between IB high and IB
 

7193
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:40,630
rotational market between IB high and IB
low. And it's violent.

7194
02:57:40,630 --> 02:57:40,640
low. And it's violent.
 

7195
02:57:40,640 --> 02:57:43,269
low. And it's violent.
All right. You're 402

7196
02:57:43,269 --> 02:57:43,279
All right. You're 402
 

7197
02:57:43,279 --> 02:57:45,429
All right. You're 402
uh points for your IB. Remember a normal

7198
02:57:45,429 --> 02:57:45,439
uh points for your IB. Remember a normal
 

7199
02:57:45,439 --> 02:57:48,389
uh points for your IB. Remember a normal
IB is about 120 points or something. So

7200
02:57:48,389 --> 02:57:48,399
IB is about 120 points or something. So
 

7201
02:57:48,399 --> 02:57:51,510
IB is about 120 points or something. So
you're 402 points. and VIX is starting

7202
02:57:51,510 --> 02:57:51,520
you're 402 points. and VIX is starting
 

7203
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:53,750
you're 402 points. and VIX is starting
to try and push back upside here. So,

7204
02:57:53,750 --> 02:57:53,760
to try and push back upside here. So,
 

7205
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:55,510
to try and push back upside here. So,
just be careful if you're going to hang

7206
02:57:55,510 --> 02:57:55,520
just be careful if you're going to hang
