113
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,949
most of that rotation is happening from
550 to 750 and we can have a look at

114
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
550 to 750 and we can have a look at
 

115
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,110
550 to 750 and we can have a look at
that on the hourly charts. Just remember

116
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
that on the hourly charts. Just remember

reclaimed previous week high up into
 

157
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,310
reclaimed previous week high up into
that sort of 820s 825ish. All right,

158
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
that sort of 820s 825ish. All right,
 

159
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,790
that sort of 820s 825ish. All right,
that's your value area. All right,

160
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
that's your value area. All right,
 

161
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,670
that's your value area. All right,
that's the rotation from last week. Here

162
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
that's the rotation from last week. Here
 

163
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,590
that's the rotation from last week. Here
is the shelf and guess what? We're

164
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
is the shelf and guess what? We're
 

165
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,509
is the shelf and guess what? We're
trading just above point of control

166
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
trading just above point of control
 

167
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,269
trading just above point of control
right now into the edge of the next

168
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
right now into the edge of the next
 

169
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,509
right now into the edge of the next
shelf. If we find acceptance over this

170
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
shelf. If we find acceptance over this
 

171
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,949
shelf. If we find acceptance over this
this morning over 7:30, over 750

172
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
this morning over 7:30, over 750
 

173
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,630
this morning over 7:30, over 750
potential for a drive up to come and

174
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640

175
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,670
potential for a drive up to come and
retest these sort of 825s. All right, so

176
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
retest these sort of 825s. All right, so
 

177
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,069
retest these sort of 825s. All right, so
that was the rotation. This guy here is

178
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
that was the rotation. This guy here is
 

179
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,069
that was the rotation. This guy here is
going to be important. You can see

180
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
going to be important. You can see
 

181
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,470
going to be important. You can see
overnight he's already become important.

182
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
overnight he's already become important.
 

183
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,990
overnight he's already become important.
This is where most of the range has been

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
This is where most of the range has been
 

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,550
This is where most of the range has been

All right. Acceptance above. Maybe we

196
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
All right. Acceptance above. Maybe we
 

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,590
All right. Acceptance above. Maybe we
come and take this out. Acceptance

201
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,350

So, just take it easy this morning. If

204
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
So, just take it easy this morning. If
 

205
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,790
So, just take it easy this morning. If
we're in there, if we go and have a look

206
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
we're in there, if we go and have a look
 

207
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,949
we're in there, if we go and have a look
at what happened overnight, this is

208
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
at what happened overnight, this is
 

209
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,470
at what happened overnight, this is
overnight's value. I just put this on

210
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
overnight's value. I just put this on
 

211
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,310
overnight's value. I just put this on
because the range was pretty big, right?

212
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
because the range was pretty big, right?
 

213
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,910
because the range was pretty big, right?
You can see that we cannot find

214
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
You can see that we cannot find
 

215
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,670
You can see that we cannot find
acceptance underneath this this big

216
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
acceptance underneath this this big
 

217
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,110

227
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,509

550, and there is a node developing here

228
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
550, and there is a node developing here
 

229
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,670
550, and there is a node developing here
into 650. So, you've basically got 100

230
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
into 650. So, you've basically got 100
 

231
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,389
into 650. So, you've basically got 100

232
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
points and 100 points. That's it. All
 

233
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,910
points and 100 points. That's it. All
right, that's pretty much it until we

234
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
right, that's pretty much it until we
 

235
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,110
right, that's pretty much it until we
find acceptance. So, what are we looking

236
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
find acceptance. So, what are we looking
 

237
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,310
find acceptance. So, what are we looking
for? Well, if we're going to find

238
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
for? Well, if we're going to find
 

239
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,910
for? Well, if we're going to find
acceptance above 750 and we can base and

240
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
acceptance above 750 and we can base and
 

241
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,750
acceptance above 750 and we can base and
hold, there's potential to come back up

242
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
hold, there's potential to come back up
 

243
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,670
hold, there's potential to come back up
and test last week's weekly range and

244
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
and test last week's weekly range and
 

245
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,069
and test last week's weekly range and
daily range up towards the 850s. If this

246
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
daily range up towards the 850s. If this
 

247
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,750
daily range up towards the 850s. If this
is a little look above and fail, you

248
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
is a little look above and fail, you
 

249
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,350
is a little look above and fail, you
want to be very careful about that

250
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
want to be very careful about that
 

251
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,350
want to be very careful about that
rotating. Remember, this is your

252
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
rotating. Remember, this is your
 

253
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,949
rotating. Remember, this is your
chopfest. All right, that is your

254
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
chopfest. All right, that is your
 

255
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,829
chopfest. All right, that is your
chopfest in here. If we find acceptance

256
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
chopfest in here. If we find acceptance
 

257
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,949
chopfest in here. If we find acceptance
below 550 underneath the fire day, maybe

258
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
below 550 underneath the fire day, maybe
 

259
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,269
below 550 underneath the fire day, maybe
we come back and retest four and maybe

260
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
we come back and retest four and maybe
 

261
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,670
we come back and retest four and maybe
even threes. All right, but again just

262
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
even threes. All right, but again just
 

263
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,110
even threes. All right, but again just
like the top side, you need to be

264
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
like the top side, you need to be
 

265
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,509
like the top side, you need to be
careful of a look below and fail and

266
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
careful of a look below and fail and
 

267
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,269
careful of a look below and fail and
reclaim because this is what we are

268
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
reclaim because this is what we are
 

269
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,230
reclaim because this is what we are
likely to see on edges until it proves

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
likely to see on edges until it proves
 

271
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,629

290
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
below trading inside GlobeEx. Question
 

291
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,710
below trading inside GlobeEx. Question
is right now can we do this or this? All

292
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
is right now can we do this or this? All
 

293
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:07,590
is right now can we do this or this? All
right moving through to ES then

294
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600

 

295
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,269

same kind of story. You can see this is

296
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
same kind of story. You can see this is
 

297
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,030
same kind of story. You can see this is
the big trigger. This is why we've got a

298
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
the big trigger. This is why we've got a
 

299
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,269
the big trigger. This is why we've got a
uh notification up here. I think that is

300
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
uh notification up here. I think that is
 

301
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,949
uh notification up here. I think that is
gap fill. Is it? Yes. Still haven't

302
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
gap fill. Is it? Yes. Still haven't
 

303
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,430
gap fill. Is it? Yes. Still haven't
quite filled that gap. So ES might want

304
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
quite filled that gap. So ES might want
 

305
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,790
quite filled that gap. So ES might want
to be efficient and try and get up to

306
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
to be efficient and try and get up to
 

307
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,350
to be efficient and try and get up to
975. So that's obviously what it's

308
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
975. So that's obviously what it's
 

309
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,870
975. So that's obviously what it's
trying right now. We filled this old

310
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
trying right now. We filled this old
 

311
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,430
trying right now. We filled this old
imbalance down here which we swept into

312
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
imbalance down here which we swept into
 

313
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,350
imbalance down here which we swept into
from Wednesday overnight. There's the

314
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
from Wednesday overnight. There's the
 

315
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,750
from Wednesday overnight. There's the
flush. Run out all the buyers and bid

316
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
flush. Run out all the buyers and bid
 

317
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,910
flush. Run out all the buyers and bid
back up. And this is the target up here

318
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
back up. And this is the target up here
 

319
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,150
back up. And this is the target up here
into 75 right now. So that's what ES is

320
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
into 75 right now. So that's what ES is
 

321
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,910
into 75 right now. So that's what ES is
trying to do. Same kind of story. Can it

322
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
trying to do. Same kind of story. Can it
 

323
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,189
trying to do. Same kind of story. Can it
base over 40s to get to 75 is the big

324
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
base over 40s to get to 75 is the big
 

325
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,189
base over 40s to get to 75 is the big
question. If we look at the ETFs, they

326
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
question. If we look at the ETFs, they
 

327
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,470
question. If we look at the ETFs, they
should be nicely in line. So spy, same

328
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,480
should be nicely in line. So spy, same
 

329
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,750
should be nicely in line. So spy, same
kind of thing. Trying to get this is the

330
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
kind of thing. Trying to get this is the
 

331
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,910
kind of thing. Trying to get this is the
equivalent of 975 on the ES, right? It's

332
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
equivalent of 975 on the ES, right? It's
 

333
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,710
equivalent of 975 on the ES, right? It's
trying to get to gap fill up here into

334
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
trying to get to gap fill up here into
 

335
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,670
trying to get to gap fill up here into
sort of 92s. Let's call it again. This

336
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
sort of 92s. Let's call it again. This
 

337
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,430
sort of 92s. Let's call it again. This
is death chop, isn't it? Look at this.

338
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
is death chop, isn't it? Look at this.
 

339
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,069
is death chop, isn't it? Look at this.
How many sessions have we been here?

340
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,670
death chop. Can it base and go? Big
question mark.

360
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
question mark.
 

361
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,710
question mark.
All right, I'm going to have a very

362
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
All right, I'm going to have a very
 

363
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,069
All right, I'm going to have a very
quick look at metals because I know some

364
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
quick look at metals because I know some
 

365
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,350
quick look at metals because I know some
of you, I'm sure, will be trading these.

366
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
of you, I'm sure, will be trading these.
 

367
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,030
of you, I'm sure, will be trading these.
I'm not trading these. We are parabolic.

368
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
I'm not trading these. We are parabolic.
 

369
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,389
I'm not trading these. We are parabolic.
All right, there's no way of talking

370
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
All right, there's no way of talking
 

371
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,550
All right, there's no way of talking
about it. This is a parabolic squeeze

372
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
about it. This is a parabolic squeeze
 

373
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,110
about it. This is a parabolic squeeze
move. Right. I would expect some mean

374
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
move. Right. I would expect some mean
 

375
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,110
move. Right. I would expect some mean
reversion at some point. It really

376
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
reversion at some point. It really
 

377
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,790
reversion at some point. It really
depends. Macro says we can keep going

378
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
depends. Macro says we can keep going
 

379
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,550
depends. Macro says we can keep going
higher but I mean it's becoming starting

380
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
higher but I mean it's becoming starting
 

381
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,310
higher but I mean it's becoming starting
to become a little bit unreasonable at

382
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
to become a little bit unreasonable at
 

383
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,110
to become a little bit unreasonable at
this point and we are probably there or

384
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
this point and we are probably there or
 

385
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,189
this point and we are probably there or
thereabouts. So I think we will go

386
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
thereabouts. So I think we will go
 

387
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,470
thereabouts. So I think we will go
higher essentially uh longterm but it is

388
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
higher essentially uh longterm but it is
 

389
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,590
higher essentially uh longterm but it is
due a mean reversion. This is a colossal

390
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
due a mean reversion. This is a colossal
 

391
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,590
due a mean reversion. This is a colossal
move right if we think from this

392
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
move right if we think from this
 

393
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,150
move right if we think from this
breakout right here

394
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160

395
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,870

403

to it, but it will come. You know, if

404
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
to it, but it will come. You know, if
 

405
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,949

All right, we are past three sigas. It

408
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
All right, we are past three sigas. It
 

409
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,509
All right, we are past three sigas. It
will come. It will definitely come. It's

410
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
will come. It will definitely come. It's
 

411
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,030
will come. It will definitely come. It's
just a question of when. Don't get

412
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
just a question of when. Don't get
 

413
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,310
just a question of when. Don't get
caught the wrong side of it if you're

414
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
caught the wrong side of it if you're
 

415
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,749
caught the wrong side of it if you're
desperate for that trade. I'm certainly

416
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
desperate for that trade. I'm certainly
 

417
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,310
desperate for that trade. I'm certainly
not. Dixie, all right, continues to be

418
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
not. Dixie, all right, continues to be
 

419
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,590
not. Dixie, all right, continues to be
sold off like we talked about. All

420
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
sold off like we talked about. All
 

421
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,269
sold off like we talked about. All
right, so this is why we're seeing the

422
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
right, so this is why we're seeing the
 

423
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,350
right, so this is why we're seeing the
rotation out of the dollar into metals.

424
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
rotation out of the dollar into metals.
 

425
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,990
rotation out of the dollar into metals.
out of the dollar into metals mainly

426
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
out of the dollar into metals mainly
 

427
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,230
out of the dollar into metals mainly
being driven by the Asian markets. It's

428
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
being driven by the Asian markets. It's
 

429
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,670
being driven by the Asian markets. It's
been going on for two years now, but

430
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
been going on for two years now, but
 

431
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,749
been going on for two years now, but
it's starting to get very, very

432
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,759
it's starting to get very, very
 

433
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,749
it's starting to get very, very
aggressive.

434
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
aggressive.
 

435
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,150
aggressive.
And the VIX, all right, VIX driving back

436
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
And the VIX, all right, VIX driving back
 

437
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,910
And the VIX, all right, VIX driving back
up to some key levels this morning,

438
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
up to some key levels this morning,
 

439
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,590
up to some key levels this morning,
right on the daily, you can see this.

440
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
right on the daily, you can see this.
 

441
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,829
right on the daily, you can see this.
It's the same channel we've had on since

442
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
It's the same channel we've had on since
 

443
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,550
It's the same channel we've had on since
early or mid December. Still in this

444
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
early or mid December. Still in this
 

445
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,069
early or mid December. Still in this
channel, we can't really find acceptance

446
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
channel, we can't really find acceptance
 

447
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,710
channel, we can't really find acceptance
above. If we move down the time frames,

448
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
above. If we move down the time frames,
 

449
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,350
above. If we move down the time frames,
right, you can see that we are trying to

450
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
right, you can see that we are trying to
 

451
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,629
right, you can see that we are trying to
find a bid above 1650s and we have some

452
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
find a bid above 1650s and we have some
 

453
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,430
find a bid above 1650s and we have some
resistance up here that we created on

454
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
resistance up here that we created on
 

455
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,949
resistance up here that we created on
Wednesday which we just had a little

456
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
Wednesday which we just had a little
 

457
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,590
Wednesday which we just had a little
push into right here coming back down

458
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
push into right here coming back down
 

459
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,510
push into right here coming back down
potentially for gap fill. Does it rebid

460
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
potentially for gap fill. Does it rebid
 

461
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,750
potentially for gap fill. Does it rebid
back up off trend? We don't know. We're

462
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
back up off trend? We don't know. We're
 

463
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,590
back up off trend? We don't know. We're
going to have to see. Again, most the

464
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
going to have to see. Again, most the
 

465
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,270
going to have to see. Again, most the
volatility I would imagine will come

466
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
volatility I would imagine will come
 

467
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,189
volatility I would imagine will come
later in the week. Right, let's go

468
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
later in the week. Right, let's go
 

469
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,069
later in the week. Right, let's go
through the mag.

470
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079

 

471
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,110

Good gap up there for Apple. That is a

472
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
Good gap up there for Apple. That is a
 

473
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,189
Good gap up there for Apple. That is a
strong gap. Where are my flow zones?

474
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
strong gap. Where are my flow zones?
 

475
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,189
strong gap. Where are my flow zones?
Hello. Can we have these on, please?

476
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
Hello. Can we have these on, please?
 

477
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,350
Hello. Can we have these on, please?
There we go. And you?

478
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
There we go. And you?
 

479
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,590
There we go. And you?
Okay, so nice gap up on Apple

480
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
Okay, so nice gap up on Apple
 

481
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,990
Okay, so nice gap up on Apple
about three B three buck gap up. Uh

482
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
about three B three buck gap up. Uh
 

483
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,750
about three B three buck gap up. Uh
question is can it go over this high

484
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
question is can it go over this high
 

485
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,230
question is can it go over this high
from Wednesday? So if we can find

486
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
from Wednesday? So if we can find
 

487
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,150
from Wednesday? So if we can find
acceptance over this high, it's got a

488
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
acceptance over this high, it's got a
 

489
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,310
acceptance over this high, it's got a
gap fill up here. And this is remember

490
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
gap fill up here. And this is remember
 

491
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,990
gap fill up here. And this is remember
where the trap volume is that we've been

492
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
where the trap volume is that we've been
 

493
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,230
where the trap volume is that we've been
talking about, you know, all this trap

494
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
talking about, you know, all this trap
 

495
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,750
talking about, you know, all this trap
volume on buyers. So it's got to get

496
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
volume on buyers. So it's got to get
 

497
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,110
volume on buyers. So it's got to get
back through that to be if we start

498
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
back through that to be if we start
 

499
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,310
back through that to be if we start
getting acceptance through that on

500
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
getting acceptance through that on
 

501
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,110
getting acceptance through that on
Apple, then you know, there is a chance,

502
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
Apple, then you know, there is a chance,
 

503
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,470
Apple, then you know, there is a chance,
right, that they're coming back in from

504
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
right, that they're coming back in from
 

505
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,390
right, that they're coming back in from
the bid. So I wouldn't be surprised to

506
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
the bid. So I wouldn't be surprised to
 

507
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,549
the bid. So I wouldn't be surprised to
see this before earnings to see us into

508
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
see this before earnings to see us into
 

509
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,990
see this before earnings to see us into
there and then it make its decision of

510
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
there and then it make its decision of
 

511
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,310
there and then it make its decision of
what it wants to do. But strong gap up

512
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
what it wants to do. But strong gap up
 

513
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,230
what it wants to do. But strong gap up
off the lows on Apple. Double bottom

514
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
off the lows on Apple. Double bottom
 

515
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,310
off the lows on Apple. Double bottom
there and we'll see if it can get going.

516
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
there and we'll see if it can get going.
 

517
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,909
there and we'll see if it can get going.
Same thing on Amazon. Nice drive up here

518
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
Same thing on Amazon. Nice drive up here
 

519
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,990
Same thing on Amazon. Nice drive up here
into Friday last week, right? Holding

520
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
into Friday last week, right? Holding
 

521
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,230
into Friday last week, right? Holding
its gains so far. Can we get a breakout

522
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
its gains so far. Can we get a breakout
 

523
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,669
its gains so far. Can we get a breakout
over sort of 40s? Yeah, 40s 41s for

524
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
over sort of 40s? Yeah, 40s 41s for
 

525
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,430
over sort of 40s? Yeah, 40s 41s for
acceptance into that old range. So, a

526
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
acceptance into that old range. So, a
 

527
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,270
acceptance into that old range. So, a
bit like Apple, but it's uh about a

528
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
bit like Apple, but it's uh about a
 

529
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,510
bit like Apple, but it's uh about a
session or two ahead right now. Google

530
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
session or two ahead right now. Google
 

531
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,990
session or two ahead right now. Google
had a had a big end of week, but we're a

532
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
had a had a big end of week, but we're a
 

533
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,669
had a had a big end of week, but we're a
little bit weaker today. All right. So,

534
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
little bit weaker today. All right. So,
 

535
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,990
little bit weaker today. All right. So,
pivots down here on Google. You can see

536
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
pivots down here on Google. You can see
 

537
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,110
pivots down here on Google. You can see
down here, not that first one, down here

538
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
down here, not that first one, down here
 

539
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,430
down here, not that first one, down here
on Google. Can it find acceptance over

540
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
on Google. Can it find acceptance over
 

541
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,830
on Google. Can it find acceptance over
here? All right. So, is this failure to

542
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
here? All right. So, is this failure to
 

543
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,950
here? All right. So, is this failure to
break lower and a breakout? Time will

544
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
break lower and a breakout? Time will
 

545
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,710
break lower and a breakout? Time will
tell,

546
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
tell,
 

547
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,110
tell,
but not the strongest today so far.

548
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
but not the strongest today so far.
 

549
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,270
but not the strongest today so far.
Meta, beautiful. Remember, still long

550
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
Meta, beautiful. Remember, still long
 

551
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,870
Meta, beautiful. Remember, still long
meta. We're looking pretty good here,

552
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
meta. We're looking pretty good here,
 

553
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,870
meta. We're looking pretty good here,
right? We've been long meta since down

554
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
right? We've been long meta since down
 

555
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,549
right? We've been long meta since down
here. I bought down here, held on that

556
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
here. I bought down here, held on that
 

557
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,630
here. I bought down here, held on that
pullback. So, we're looking good from

558
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
pullback. So, we're looking good from
 

559
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,350
pullback. So, we're looking good from
the 80s. We're almost uh almost 100

560
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
the 80s. We're almost uh almost 100
 

561
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,430
the 80s. We're almost uh almost 100
bucks up now on that swing, which is

562
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
bucks up now on that swing, which is
 

563
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,190
bucks up now on that swing, which is
pretty good. So, let's see if we can get

564
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
pretty good. So, let's see if we can get
 

565
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,909
pretty good. So, let's see if we can get
a gap fill up into 750s for earnings,

566
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
a gap fill up into 750s for earnings,
 

567
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,990
a gap fill up into 750s for earnings,
but we will see. Coming into a pretty

568
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
but we will see. Coming into a pretty
 

569
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,990
but we will see. Coming into a pretty
critical level right now on Meta. That's

570
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
critical level right now on Meta. That's
 

571
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,230
critical level right now on Meta. That's
a big old squeeze out. I would not be

572
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
a big old squeeze out. I would not be
 

573
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,150
a big old squeeze out. I would not be
surprised if they need to retest down

574
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
surprised if they need to retest down
 

575
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,669
surprised if they need to retest down
here. All right, we tried to do that

576
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
here. All right, we tried to do that
 

577
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,750
here. All right, we tried to do that
move pre-market Friday. Haven't done it.

578
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
move pre-market Friday. Haven't done it.
 

579
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,350
move pre-market Friday. Haven't done it.
It's very possible they come for a back

580
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
It's very possible they come for a back
 

581
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,470
It's very possible they come for a back
check of that, but so far looking good.

582
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
check of that, but so far looking good.
 

583
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,870
check of that, but so far looking good.
Microsoft that is off to the races on

584
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
Microsoft that is off to the races on
 

585
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,549
Microsoft that is off to the races on
Friday as well. Well, this one's got

586
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
Friday as well. Well, this one's got
 

587
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,470
Friday as well. Well, this one's got
room. This one's got room. All right,

588
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
room. This one's got room. All right,
 

589
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,630
room. This one's got room. All right,
he's trying to find a bid out of here.

590
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
he's trying to find a bid out of here.
 

591
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,750
he's trying to find a bid out of here.
All right, remember that's the old

592
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
All right, remember that's the old
 

593
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,669
All right, remember that's the old
flush. There is a old gap down here from

594
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
flush. There is a old gap down here from
 

595
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,230
flush. There is a old gap down here from
that gap up, but it's got room to run.

596
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
that gap up, but it's got room to run.
 

597
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,669
that gap up, but it's got room to run.
If they're going to bid on earnings,

598
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
If they're going to bid on earnings,
 

599
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,669
If they're going to bid on earnings,
it's a big if, but if they are, you

600
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
it's a big if, but if they are, you
 

601
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,750
it's a big if, but if they are, you
know, that's like a 50% pullback. It's

602
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
know, that's like a 50% pullback. It's
 

603
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,230
know, that's like a 50% pullback. It's
possible. It's catching my eye for a

604
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
possible. It's catching my eye for a
 

605
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,990
possible. It's catching my eye for a
potential swing. We're just going to

606
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
potential swing. We're just going to
 

607
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,549
potential swing. We're just going to
have to see how we go. I'd like a

608
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
have to see how we go. I'd like a
 

609
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,390
have to see how we go. I'd like a
pullback to really start to hold for me

610
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
pullback to really start to hold for me
 

611
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,950
pullback to really start to hold for me
to get into that.

612
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
to get into that.
 

613
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,789
to get into that.
Nvidia, same story. It's still got gap

775
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,149

We're very neutral right now. We're

776
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
We're very neutral right now. We're
 

777
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,310
We're very neutral right now. We're
opening up right where we closed on

Friday and last week. All right, we're
 

781
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,830
Friday and last week. All right, we're
neutral. We might want might want a bit

782
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
neutral. We might want might want a bit
 

783
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,990
neutral. We might want might want a bit
more upside, but we're definitely at the

784
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
more upside, but we're definitely at the
 

785
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,990
more upside, but we're definitely at the
open. We're literally opening up right

786
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
open. We're literally opening up right
 

787
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,590

789
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,110
where we closed Friday. All right,
nothing's changed.

790
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120

 

791
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,870

Right, let's see. It's possible if we

792
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:52,880
Right, let's see. It's possible if we
 

793
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,390
Right, let's see. It's possible if we
find acceptance over this red box, they

794
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
find acceptance over this red box, they
 

795
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,789
find acceptance over this red box, they
come for the squeeze up here. I just

796
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
come for the squeeze up here. I just
 

797
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,230
come for the squeeze up here. I just
want to see how we open what the mag

798
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,240
want to see how we open what the mag
 

799
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,029
want to see how we open what the mag
looks like. So, coming up here in five

800
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
looks like. So, coming up here in five
 

801
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,549
looks like. So, coming up here in five
seconds, folks.

802
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559

 

803
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,789

See how we go.

804
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799

 

805
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,710

Okay, mixed bag in the mag on the open.

806
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
Okay, mixed bag in the mag on the open.
 

807
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,990
Okay, mixed bag in the mag on the open.

Google is pretty much flat trying to go

812
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
Google is pretty much flat trying to go
 

813
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,590
Google is pretty much flat trying to go
red to green. So MAG looks okay. The

814
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
red to green. So MAG looks okay. The
 

815
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,630
red to green. So MAG looks okay. The
weak one there is Tesla.

816
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640

 

817
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,710

Strength in the RTY again today on the

818
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
Strength in the RTY again today on the
 

819
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,390
Strength in the RTY again today on the
open third of percent up. So sweeping

820
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400
open third of percent up. So sweeping
 

821
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,990
open third of percent up. So sweeping
out this liquidity. This was the failed

822
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,000
out this liquidity. This was the failed
 

823
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,669
out this liquidity. This was the failed
breakout level we talked about. It's

824
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:35,679
breakout level we talked about. It's
 

825
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,190
breakout level we talked about. It's
possible if they come back down they're

826
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
possible if they come back down they're
 

827
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,549
possible if they come back down they're
going to look to hold some of these kind

828
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
going to look to hold some of these kind
 

829
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,710
going to look to hold some of these kind
of areas. Then we see how we go after

830
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
of areas. Then we see how we go after
 

831
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,390
of areas. Then we see how we go after
that. Let me get volume on here nice and

832
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
that. Let me get volume on here nice and
 

833
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,029
that. Let me get volume on here nice and
early before I forget.

834
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039

 

835
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,870

Where are you? Right here.

836
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
Where are you? Right here.
 

837
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,230
Where are you? Right here.
Just one minute. See?

838
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
Just one minute. See?
 

839
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,430
Just one minute. See?
Okay. So, the same level 750s

840
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
Okay. So, the same level 750s
 

841
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,909
Okay. So, the same level 750s
been the same level

842
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:03,919

 

843
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,470

and see if we hold previous week point

844
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
and see if we hold previous week point
 

845
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,470
and see if we hold previous week point
of control, previous day value area low

846
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
of control, previous day value area low
 

847
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,470
of control, previous day value area low
for a drive back up. And if not, we've

848
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
for a drive back up. And if not, we've
 

849
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,310
for a drive back up. And if not, we've
got this pivot at 650. And if they lose

850
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
got this pivot at 650. And if they lose
 

851
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,029
got this pivot at 650. And if they lose
650, we'll probably go 550.

852
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
650, we'll probably go 550.
 

853
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,789
650, we'll probably go 550.
So, just waiting to see. So far they're

854
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
So, just waiting to see. So far they're
 

855
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,870
So, just waiting to see. So far they're
trying to find a bid here. ES is trying

856
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
trying to find a bid here. ES is trying
 

857
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,950
trying to find a bid here. ES is trying
to go.

858
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
to go.
 

859
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,549
to go.
What's this level on? ES is this

860
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
What's this level on? ES is this
 

861
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,470
What's this level on? ES is this
previous week high

862
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480

 

863
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,630

week. Previous day. Previous day high

864
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
week. Previous day. Previous day high
 

865
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,230
week. Previous day. Previous day high
coming up. Previous week high above that

866
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
coming up. Previous week high above that
 

867
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,470
coming up. Previous week high above that
gap feel still there. It's still bidding

868
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
gap feel still there. It's still bidding
 

869
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,590
gap feel still there. It's still bidding
on ES. So let's see if the market is

870
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
on ES. So let's see if the market is
 

871
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,230
on ES. So let's see if the market is
willing to get going here this morning

872
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,240
willing to get going here this morning
 

873
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,070
willing to get going here this morning
through this red box. If we can base

874
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
through this red box. If we can base
 

875
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,149
through this red box. If we can base
over this, I'll consider a long. If we

876
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
over this, I'll consider a long. If we
 

877
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,630
over this, I'll consider a long. If we
can base, not if we just drive. If we

878
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
can base, not if we just drive. If we
 

879
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,710
can base, not if we just drive. If we
base over this, I'll consider this move

880
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
base over this, I'll consider this move
 

881
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,870
base over this, I'll consider this move
here. If we keep failing here, if

882
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
here. If we keep failing here, if
 

883
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,310
here. If we keep failing here, if
there's a look above and fail again,

884
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
there's a look above and fail again,
 

885
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,510
there's a look above and fail again,
this move here will be the first

886
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
this move here will be the first
 

887
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,669
this move here will be the first
rotation. If they bid this back up, back

888
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
rotation. If they bid this back up, back
 

889
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,230
rotation. If they bid this back up, back
up. If they lose this, 650. So, watching

890
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,240
up. If they lose this, 650. So, watching
 

891
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,630
up. If they lose this, 650. So, watching
here for a trigger long on this squeeze.

892
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
here for a trigger long on this squeeze.
 

893
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,750
here for a trigger long on this squeeze.
Here we go. Some guys coming in at the

894
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
Here we go. Some guys coming in at the
 

895
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,830
Here we go. Some guys coming in at the
high of day here. Some buyers. So, in

896
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
high of day here. Some buyers. So, in
 

897
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,830
high of day here. Some buyers. So, in
this to see if we can trigger through or

898
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
this to see if we can trigger through or
 

899
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,110
this to see if we can trigger through or
not. And going to need to hold this dip

900
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
not. And going to need to hold this dip
 

901
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,909
not. And going to need to hold this dip
onto 750s, which they're trying to hold

902
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
onto 750s, which they're trying to hold
 

903
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,789
onto 750s, which they're trying to hold
so far. ES taking out previous day. So

904
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:14,799
so far. ES taking out previous day. So
 

905
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,230
so far. ES taking out previous day. So
just a little scalp there for me to

906
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,240
just a little scalp there for me to
 

907
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,350
just a little scalp there for me to
start the day

908
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
start the day
 

909
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,430
start the day
and can ES get up to what's that is that

910
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,440
and can ES get up to what's that is that
 

911
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,830
and can ES get up to what's that is that
previous week above. So next stop for ES

912
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
previous week above. So next stop for ES
 

913
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,870
previous week above. So next stop for ES
would be 69 and then there's 75s for the

914
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
would be 69 and then there's 75s for the
 

915
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,549
would be 69 and then there's 75s for the
gap fill.

916
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559

 

917
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,990

So buyers keep coming in here at the

918
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
So buyers keep coming in here at the
 

919
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,390
So buyers keep coming in here at the
highs. Be careful. Yes, taking the

920
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
highs. Be careful. Yes, taking the
 

921
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,390
highs. Be careful. Yes, taking the
liquidity already. We're trying to see

922
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
liquidity already. We're trying to see
 

923
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,710
liquidity already. We're trying to see
if we can turn this now into a blue box

924
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
if we can turn this now into a blue box
 

925
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,630
if we can turn this now into a blue box
for acceptance higher. This is the

926
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
for acceptance higher. This is the
 

927
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,630
for acceptance higher. This is the
question at the moment. The moment is

928
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
question at the moment. The moment is
 

929
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,909
question at the moment. The moment is
looking okay. There are some sellers

930
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
looking okay. There are some sellers
 

931
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,430
looking okay. There are some sellers
caught with these lows, but they keep

932
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,440
caught with these lows, but they keep
 

933
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,990
caught with these lows, but they keep
buying the 57s and 60s here without a

934
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
buying the 57s and 60s here without a
 

935
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,310
buying the 57s and 60s here without a
drive higher. So, just be careful. I'm

936
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
drive higher. So, just be careful. I'm
 

937
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,669
drive higher. So, just be careful. I'm
trying to see if we can find acceptance.

938
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
trying to see if we can find acceptance.
 

939
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,310
trying to see if we can find acceptance.
Here we go. Lovely. Right, let's trade

940
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
Here we go. Lovely. Right, let's trade
 

941
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,549
Here we go. Lovely. Right, let's trade
through this then. Be careful because

942
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
through this then. Be careful because
 

943
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,669
through this then. Be careful because
it's the start of the day. I'm not

944
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
it's the start of the day. I'm not
 

945
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,870
it's the start of the day. I'm not
willing to hold too much. I'm just

946
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
willing to hold too much. I'm just
 

947
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,310
willing to hold too much. I'm just
scalping my way through this at the

948
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
scalping my way through this at the
 

949
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,830
scalping my way through this at the
early point of the day, seeing if we can

950
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
early point of the day, seeing if we can
 

951
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,310
early point of the day, seeing if we can
get up into these 800s. That'd be lovely

952
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
get up into these 800s. That'd be lovely
 

953
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,510
get up into these 800s. That'd be lovely
if we could.

954
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520

 

955
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,269

down to these 750s again. They've got to

956
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
down to these 750s again. They've got to
 

957
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,950
down to these 750s again. They've got to
keep absorbing these 750s for me to

958
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
keep absorbing these 750s for me to
 

959
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,029
keep absorbing these 750s for me to
hold. I won't hold underneath. Certainly

960
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:17,039
hold. I won't hold underneath. Certainly
 

961
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:28,710
hold. I won't hold underneath. Certainly
won't be holding under 740s.

962
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720

 

963
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,430

Might lose my runners here. His 50s, his

964
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
Might lose my runners here. His 50s, his
 

965
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,750
Might lose my runners here. His 50s, his
40s. No. Out.

966
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760
40s. No. Out.
 

967
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,110
40s. No. Out.
Out on the runners.

968
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
Out on the runners.
 

969
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,630
Out on the runners.
So, locking in just a couple hundred

970
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
So, locking in just a couple hundred
 

971
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,630
So, locking in just a couple hundred
bucks there, which is fine. Back to this

972
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
bucks there, which is fine. Back to this
 

973
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,950
bucks there, which is fine. Back to this
view up. Remember, if we lose this, we

974
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
view up. Remember, if we lose this, we
 

975
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,310
view up. Remember, if we lose this, we
can come. This can be a failed look

976
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
can come. This can be a failed look
 

977
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,070
can come. This can be a failed look
above. Look above and fail. And if they

978
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
above. Look above and fail. And if they
 

979
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,590
above. Look above and fail. And if they
lose this, they can rotate all the way

980
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:47,600
lose this, they can rotate all the way
 

981
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,870
lose this, they can rotate all the way
back down to here. Remember, we're at

982
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:48,880
back down to here. Remember, we're at
 

983
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,070
back down to here. Remember, we're at
the top of the range. We're just trying

984
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
the top of the range. We're just trying
 

985
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,390
the top of the range. We're just trying
to see if they want to hold that as a

986
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:52,400
to see if they want to hold that as a
 

987
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,029
to see if they want to hold that as a
support system. Might just knock me out

988
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
support system. Might just knock me out
 

989
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,430
support system. Might just knock me out
to go again. Certainly looks that way at

990
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
to go again. Certainly looks that way at
 

991
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,830
to go again. Certainly looks that way at
the moment.

992
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840

 

993
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,549

Yep.

994
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559

 

995
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,149

Ah, it's like last week on repeat.

996
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:10,159
Ah, it's like last week on repeat.
 

997
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,470
Ah, it's like last week on repeat.
Last week on repeat.

998
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
Last week on repeat.
 

999
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,389
Last week on repeat.
All right. Can they find acceptance

1000
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
All right. Can they find acceptance
 

1001
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,549
All right. Can they find acceptance
higher here? The next target is 800 if

1002
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
higher here? The next target is 800 if
 

1003
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,269
higher here? The next target is 800 if
they can go.

1004
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
they can go.
 

1005
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,070
they can go.
Here we go. Lots of buyers keep getting

1006
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
Here we go. Lots of buyers keep getting
 

1007
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,549
Here we go. Lots of buyers keep getting
caught up here into 770s.

1008
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559

 

1009
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,909

They get through here. We should go

1010
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
They get through here. We should go
 

1011
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,990
They get through here. We should go
800s. There's 780 on the book and then

1012
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
800s. There's 780 on the book and then
 

1013
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,950
800s. There's 780 on the book and then
800s. Here we go.

1014
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960

 

1015
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,310

want to add and then want to hold in

1016
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
want to add and then want to hold in
 

1017
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,230
want to add and then want to hold in
this low ball mode. But there we go.

1018
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
this low ball mode. But there we go.
 

1019
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,630
this low ball mode. But there we go.
Wicked out into that 800's next stop.

1020
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,640
Wicked out into that 800's next stop.
 

1021
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,710
Wicked out into that 800's next stop.
There they go. So, here come the 80s

1022
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
There they go. So, here come the 80s
 

1023
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,830
There they go. So, here come the 80s
through here. We have a little old

1024
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
through here. We have a little old
 

1025
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,190
through here. We have a little old
imbalance here. There's a big seller

1026
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
imbalance here. There's a big seller
 

1027
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,389
imbalance here. There's a big seller
trying to protect these 80s through

1028
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,399
trying to protect these 80s through
 

1029
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,389
trying to protect these 80s through
here. We should go 800s. Watch ES into

1030
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
here. We should go 800s. Watch ES into
 

1031
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,310
here. We should go 800s. Watch ES into
previous week high. All right. Be

1032
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
previous week high. All right. Be
 

1033
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:05,350
previous week high. All right. Be
careful of a fail breakout here.

1034
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,360

 

1035
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,590

Yes, almost there.

1036
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
Yes, almost there.
 

1037
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,510
Yes, almost there.
And then you got gap fill above on ES

1038
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
And then you got gap fill above on ES
 

1039
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,950
And then you got gap fill above on ES
into those 975s.

1040
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
into those 975s.
 

1041
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,710
into those 975s.
So, it's got room on ES previous week

1042
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
So, it's got room on ES previous week
 

1043
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,990
So, it's got room on ES previous week
high coming up on ES. Just be careful.

1044
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
high coming up on ES. Just be careful.
 

1045
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,070
high coming up on ES. Just be careful.
And then you've got gap fill above into

1046
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
And then you've got gap fill above into
 

1047
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,389
And then you've got gap fill above into
975s.

1048
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
975s.
 

1049
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,230
975s.
Looks really good here, folks. Those of

1050
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
Looks really good here, folks. Those of
 

1051
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,669
Looks really good here, folks. Those of
you who managed to hold this long,

1052
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
you who managed to hold this long,
 

1053
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,430
you who managed to hold this long,
that's a really nice move. I got wicked

1054
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
that's a really nice move. I got wicked
 

1055
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,070
that's a really nice move. I got wicked
out of the 40s. So, made some money,

1056
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,080
out of the 40s. So, made some money,
 

1057
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,990
out of the 40s. So, made some money,
wicked out, and then it went again. I

1058
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,000
wicked out, and then it went again. I
 

1059
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,149
wicked out, and then it went again. I
should have given it more room. But

1060
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
should have given it more room. But
 

1061
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,350
should have given it more room. But
there we go. That's what happens when

1062
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
there we go. That's what happens when
 

1063
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,950
there we go. That's what happens when
it's the opening drive. All right, 20

1064
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:36,960
it's the opening drive. All right, 20
 

1065
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,310
it's the opening drive. All right, 20
more points. Make sure you're paying

1066
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
more points. Make sure you're paying
 

1067
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,070
more points. Make sure you're paying
yourself into these 80s, but you should

1068
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
yourself into these 80s, but you should
 

1069
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,230
yourself into these 80s, but you should
get higher here.

1070
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
get higher here.
 

1071
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,669
get higher here.
Tes are still very weak. Rest of the

1072
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:43,679
Tes are still very weak. Rest of the
 

1073
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,669
Tes are still very weak. Rest of the
market, but it's okay.

1074
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679

 

1075
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,070

There we go. Coming for that previous

1076
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,080
There we go. Coming for that previous
 

1077
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,830
There we go. Coming for that previous
day value very high. if you get through

1078
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,840
day value very high. if you get through
 

1079
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,870
day value very high. if you get through
these. So 800s, then 830 and then 845s.

1080
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:56,880
these. So 800s, then 830 and then 845s.
 

1081
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,389
these. So 800s, then 830 and then 845s.
Oh, your targets. I'm out of this folks.

1085
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,870

1087
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:08,789
guys are long, that's where you're
looking for

1088
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799

 

1089
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,630

the whip. My my whip was an entry. Yeah,

1090
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
the whip. My my whip was an entry. Yeah,
 

1091
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,389
the whip. My my whip was an entry. Yeah,
it was. I mean, I was already long and I

1092
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
it was. I mean, I was already long and I
 

1093
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,549
it was. I mean, I was already long and I
was already taking some, but I didn't

1094
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:14,559
was already taking some, but I didn't
 

1095
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,310
was already taking some, but I didn't
like that we came through this shelf.

1096
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320
like that we came through this shelf.
 

1097
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,149
like that we came through this shelf.
All right. So, but previous day point of

1098
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,159
All right. So, but previous day point of
 

1099
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,950
All right. So, but previous day point of
control did hold. It's just it is what

1100
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:20,960
control did hold. It's just it is what
 

1101
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,750
control did hold. It's just it is what
it is. It is what it is.

1102
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
it is. It is what it is.
 

1103
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,389
it is. It is what it is.
If we'd held that, maybe I could have

1104
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
If we'd held that, maybe I could have
 

1105
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,070
If we'd held that, maybe I could have
given it a couple more points, but it's

1106
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
given it a couple more points, but it's
 

1107
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,470
given it a couple more points, but it's
fine. All right. Big seller just came in

1108
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
fine. All right. Big seller just came in
 

1109
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,230
fine. All right. Big seller just came in
here. 265 lot. He's now stuck underneath

1110
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
here. 265 lot. He's now stuck underneath
 

1111
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,669
here. 265 lot. He's now stuck underneath
us at 83s and we are using his pain now

1112
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:37,679
us at 83s and we are using his pain now
 

1113
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,830
us at 83s and we are using his pain now
to go higher. Here we go. So, point of

1114
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
to go higher. Here we go. So, point of
 

1115
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,269
to go higher. Here we go. So, point of
control moved up because that big seller

1116
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
control moved up because that big seller
 

1117
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,710
control moved up because that big seller
came in there. We absorbed it. Here you

1118
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
came in there. We absorbed it. Here you
 

1119
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,470
came in there. We absorbed it. Here you
go. Here's your 800s coming up. So pay

1120
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
go. Here's your 800s coming up. So pay
 

1121
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,549
go. Here's your 800s coming up. So pay
yourself into this and then a squeeze

1122
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
yourself into this and then a squeeze
 

1123
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,190
yourself into this and then a squeeze
above into 830s and 845s.

1124
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,200
above into 830s and 845s.
 

1125
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,269
above into 830s and 845s.
Nice work team. ES has already almost

1126
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
Nice work team. ES has already almost
 

1127
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,430
Nice work team. ES has already almost
completed that gap fill into 75s we

1128
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
completed that gap fill into 75s we
 

1129
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,350
completed that gap fill into 75s we
talked about. So everything we wanted to

1130
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
talked about. So everything we wanted to
 

1131
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,269
talked about. So everything we wanted to
see this morning. We talked about this

1132
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
see this morning. We talked about this
 

1133
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,110
see this morning. We talked about this
red box becoming blue. That's what we've

1134
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
red box becoming blue. That's what we've
 

1135
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,630
red box becoming blue. That's what we've
seen. And there's your drive out. And

1136
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,640
seen. And there's your drive out. And
 

1137
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,470
seen. And there's your drive out. And
you might get almost 100 points here.

1138
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
you might get almost 100 points here.
 

1139
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,110
you might get almost 100 points here.
You certainly got 50 plus to start the

1140
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
You certainly got 50 plus to start the
 

1141
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:15,350
You certainly got 50 plus to start the
day.

1142
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360

 

1143
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:39,029

into that psychological level.

1144
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039

 

1145
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,029

Right. same level as your overunder down

1146
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
Right. same level as your overunder down
 

1147
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,950
Right. same level as your overunder down
here.

1148
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:42,960
here.
 

1149
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,630
here.
They just got a little bit stuck into

1150
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,640
They just got a little bit stuck into
 

1151
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,990
They just got a little bit stuck into
previous days uh value area high. So,

1152
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000
previous days uh value area high. So,
 

1153
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,430
previous days uh value area high. So,
people front running that like we talked

1154
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
people front running that like we talked
 

1155
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,789
people front running that like we talked
about. This is why I said make sure you

1156
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:50,799
about. This is why I said make sure you
 

1157
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,630
about. This is why I said make sure you
pay yourself into that.

1158
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
pay yourself into that.
 

1159
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,669
pay yourself into that.
SPY still going. Still got gap fill. SPY

1160
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:57,679
SPY still going. Still got gap fill. SPY
 

1161
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,389
SPY still going. Still got gap fill. SPY
still got gap fill potential. It's

1162
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,399
still got gap fill potential. It's
 

1163
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,110
still got gap fill potential. It's
trying to get there. Remember that big

1164
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
trying to get there. Remember that big
 

1165
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,190
trying to get there. Remember that big
seller came in at 82. It's right here.

1166
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
seller came in at 82. It's right here.
 

1167
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,029
seller came in at 82. It's right here.
This huge line that's mainly a seller

1168
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
This huge line that's mainly a seller
 

1169
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,870
This huge line that's mainly a seller
and he's being absorbed right now. So,

1170
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
and he's being absorbed right now. So,
 

1171
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,470
and he's being absorbed right now. So,
they've got one more squeeze up in them

1172
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
they've got one more squeeze up in them
 

1173
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,190
they've got one more squeeze up in them
here. Seeing if we can get a bit through

1174
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
here. Seeing if we can get a bit through
 

1175
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,110
here. Seeing if we can get a bit through
95s and through the 800s. That's where

1176
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
95s and through the 800s. That's where
 

1177
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:23,750
95s and through the 800s. That's where
it really get going.

1178
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:23,760

 

1179
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,149

Very close there on the ES gap filling

1180
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:26,159
Very close there on the ES gap filling
 

1181
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,630
Very close there on the ES gap filling
to 75. Very, very, very, very close.

1182
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
to 75. Very, very, very, very close.
 

1183
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,830
to 75. Very, very, very, very close.
You're a couple points away. You're

1184
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:29,840
You're a couple points away. You're
 

1185
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,590
You're a couple points away. You're
almost there. Which means I think we

1186
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:31,600
almost there. Which means I think we
 

1187
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,509
almost there. Which means I think we
will lift this. I think we will lift

1188
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519
will lift this. I think we will lift
 

1189
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,190
will lift this. I think we will lift
this and squeeze through up into this

1190
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,200
this and squeeze through up into this
 

1191
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,430
this and squeeze through up into this
soon. And you must take profit on that

1192
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:37,440
soon. And you must take profit on that
 

1193
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,029
soon. And you must take profit on that
move.

1194
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039

 

1195
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,950

Spy into those 92s. ES into 90 into 75s.

1196
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:46,960
Spy into those 92s. ES into 90 into 75s.
 

1197
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,830
Spy into those 92s. ES into 90 into 75s.
That's the level. The spy into 92s. ES

1198
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,840
That's the level. The spy into 92s. ES
 

1199
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,750
That's the level. The spy into 92s. ES
into 75. There must be a level here at

1200
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
into 75. There must be a level here at
 

1201
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,110
into 75. There must be a level here at
92s. We've got right stuck into it.

1202
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
92s. We've got right stuck into it.
 

1203
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,630
92s. We've got right stuck into it.
SPY's actually crossed that gap and uh

1204
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:58,640
SPY's actually crossed that gap and uh
 

1205
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,470
SPY's actually crossed that gap and uh
ES is uh lagging behind. So, slight

1206
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:00,480
ES is uh lagging behind. So, slight
 

1207
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,710
ES is uh lagging behind. So, slight
divergence between the ETFs and the

1208
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
divergence between the ETFs and the
 

1209
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,590
divergence between the ETFs and the
futures here.

1210
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:05,600
futures here.
 

1211
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,070
futures here.
VIX coming into that gap as well. So

1212
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080
VIX coming into that gap as well. So
 

1213
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,590
VIX coming into that gap as well. So
almost closed that gap on VIX which

1214
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,600
almost closed that gap on VIX which
 

1215
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,590
almost closed that gap on VIX which
basically down into 16. It's just above

1216
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
basically down into 16. It's just above
 

1217
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:31,350
basically down into 16. It's just above
16.68 is the gap built on ES.

1218
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,360

 

1219
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,149

Still got room here. See if they rebid

1220
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:34,159
Still got room here. See if they rebid
 

1221
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,070
Still got room here. See if they rebid
ES into a previous week or previous day

1222
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,080
ES into a previous week or previous day
 

1223
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,750
ES into a previous week or previous day
high. Still got room for higher if they

1224
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
high. Still got room for higher if they
 

1225
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:47,110
high. Still got room for higher if they
can. If they can keep going,

1226
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,120

 

1227
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,950

starting to get a little bit stuck here

1228
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
starting to get a little bit stuck here
 

1229
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,470
starting to get a little bit stuck here
though. You don't want them to lose

1230
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
though. You don't want them to lose
 

1231
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,149
though. You don't want them to lose
these uh this big level here where that

1232
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:52,159
these uh this big level here where that
 

1233
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,430
these uh this big level here where that
big seller came in because there'd be a

1234
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
big seller came in because there'd be a
 

1235
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,190
big seller came in because there'd be a
flush all the way back down to 55s.

1236
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
flush all the way back down to 55s.
 

1237
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,350
flush all the way back down to 55s.
Right. We haven't really retested this

1238
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
Right. We haven't really retested this
 

1239
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,350
Right. We haven't really retested this
since we broke out. We built liquidity,

1240
00:33:59,350 --> 00:33:59,360
since we broke out. We built liquidity,
 

1241
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,990
since we broke out. We built liquidity,
but if they lose this, they can retest

1242
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
but if they lose this, they can retest
 

1243
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,909
but if they lose this, they can retest
this. So, I'd be very careful here. Make

1244
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:03,919
this. So, I'd be very careful here. Make
 

1245
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,870
this. So, I'd be very careful here. Make
sure you've locked something in.

1246
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
sure you've locked something in.
 

1247
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,630
sure you've locked something in.
Remember, we're long from here to here.

1248
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:06,640
Remember, we're long from here to here.
 

1249
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,230
Remember, we're long from here to here.
Hopefully, they rebuild this to go for

1250
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,240
Hopefully, they rebuild this to go for
 

1251
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,470
Hopefully, they rebuild this to go for
you. But do not let yourself get flushed

1252
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
you. But do not let yourself get flushed
 

1253
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,149
you. But do not let yourself get flushed
out and give the whole move back. That's

1254
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:12,159
out and give the whole move back. That's
 

1255
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,470
out and give the whole move back. That's
all I'm saying here.

1256
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,480
all I'm saying here.
 

1257
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,990
all I'm saying here.
Don't let yourself get completely

1258
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't let yourself get completely
 

1259
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,190
Don't let yourself get completely
flushed out and get the whole thing

1260
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,200
flushed out and get the whole thing
 

1261
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:25,750
flushed out and get the whole thing
back.

1262
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760

 

1263
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,669

Alex on the spy chart is like a 30

1264
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
Alex on the spy chart is like a 30
 

1265
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,909
Alex on the spy chart is like a 30
minute chart. Is it bull flag? 30

1266
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:31,919
minute chart. Is it bull flag? 30

minute.
Yeah, potentially. Potentially. It's You

00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:36,879
Yeah, potentially. Potentially. It's You
 

1271
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,669
Yeah, potentially. Potentially. It's You
just got to watch that previous week. Uh

1272
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:39,679
just got to watch that previous week. Uh
 

1273
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,270
just got to watch that previous week. Uh
where's that close from? From the

1274
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,280
where's that close from? From the
 

1275
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,829
where's that close from? From the
previous previous week from Friday the

1276
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:43,839
previous previous week from Friday the
 

1277
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,909
previous previous week from Friday the
16th. All right. You got to watch that

1278
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
16th. All right. You got to watch that
 

1279
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,869
16th. All right. You got to watch that
close at sort of 9164s.

1280
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
close at sort of 9164s.
 

1281
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,790
close at sort of 9164s.
We've traded through it. If we find

1282
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:50,800
We've traded through it. If we find
 

1283
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,710
We've traded through it. If we find
acceptance through that on SPY and we

1284
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:52,720
acceptance through that on SPY and we
 

1285
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,869
acceptance through that on SPY and we
base there, right? If we can base at 92s

1286
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
base there, right? If we can base at 92s
 

1287
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,550
base there, right? If we can base at 92s
and above, then there's arguments to

1288
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
and above, then there's arguments to
 

1289
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,510
and above, then there's arguments to
move to 95s, 96s on the spy, right?

1290
00:34:59,510 --> 00:34:59,520
move to 95s, 96s on the spy, right?
 

1291
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,550
move to 95s, 96s on the spy, right?
That's what we're trying to do.

1292
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
That's what we're trying to do.

1317
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,790
we get up to here into 30s? So your next
TP is 32 and then 45s and then if we get

1318

TP is 32 and then 45s and then if we get
 

1319
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,390
TP is 32 and then 45s and then if we get
really lucky we get into this block all

and then up into this
 

1333
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,470
and then up into this
block here which takes us back to the

1334
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,480
block here which takes us back to the
 

1335
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,870
block here which takes us back to the
point of control from the week starting

1336
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
point of control from the week starting
 

1337
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,829
point of control from the week starting
Jan 12th. ES now filled that gap as well

1338
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:55,839
Jan 12th. ES now filled that gap as well
 

1339
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,310
Jan 12th. ES now filled that gap as well
folks. Right. ES has done its job into

1340
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:58,320
folks. Right. ES has done its job into
 

1341
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,630
folks. Right. ES has done its job into
75s that we talked about. So, we have an

1342
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,640
75s that we talked about. So, we have an
 

1343
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,310
75s that we talked about. So, we have an
efficient market here, which is great

1344
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
efficient market here, which is great
 

1345
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,630
efficient market here, which is great
and we might be done with this once we

1346
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:06,640
and we might be done with this once we
 

1347
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,190
and we might be done with this once we
hit targets.

1348
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200

 

1349
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,829

So, they use this shelf here

1350
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
So, they use this shelf here
 

1351
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,750
So, they use this shelf here
to trap these shorts and we come

1352
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
to trap these shorts and we come
 

1353
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,270
to trap these shorts and we come
straight back down. They're red dipping

1354
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
straight back down. They're red dipping
 

1355
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,950
straight back down. They're red dipping
into this. I'm not adding anymore. Now,

1356
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
into this. I'm not adding anymore. Now,
 

1357
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,790
into this. I'm not adding anymore. Now,
if we get here, here, and here, great.

1358
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
if we get here, here, and here, great.
 

1359
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,950
if we get here, here, and here, great.

But otherwise, not going to add. So long
 

1361
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,190
But otherwise, not going to add. So long
after that dip and rip. All right,

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,200
after that dip and rip. All right,
 

1363
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,270
after that dip and rip. All right,
selling some into these pushes. If we

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,280
selling some into these pushes. If we
 

1365
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,950
selling some into these pushes. If we
get up here, fantastic. If we get under

1366
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:30,960
get up here, fantastic. If we get under
 

1367
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,550
get up here, fantastic. If we get under
here, I'm out cuz that will be a

1368
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:32,560
here, I'm out cuz that will be a
 

1369
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,430
here, I'm out cuz that will be a
rotation.

1370
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440

 

1371
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,990

I should also note

1372
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000

 

1373
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,550

10:30 we have a manufacturing index, not

you explain my indicators? On the right
 

1387

you explain my indicators? On the right
hand side is anchored volume and this

1388
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
hand side is anchored volume and this
 

1389
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,950
hand side is anchored volume and this
right here are my flow zones. They're

1390
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:10,960
right here are my flow zones. They're
 

1391
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,990
right here are my flow zones. They're
based on rolling Fibonacci.

1392
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000

 

1393
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,990

Okay, back down into this P. Again,

1410
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
Okay, back down into this P. Again,
 

1411
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,310
Okay, back down into this P. Again,
it's very possible if they trade under

1412
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,320
it's very possible if they trade under
 

1413
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,150
it's very possible if they trade under
this, there's very possible a rotation

1414
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,160
this, there's very possible a rotation
 

1415
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,630
this, there's very possible a rotation
back down to uh to 750 is where we broke

1416
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
back down to uh to 750 is where we broke
 

1417
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,069
back down to uh to 750 is where we broke
out from. So, make sure you're paying

1418
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:58,079
out from. So, make sure you're paying
 

1419
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,150
out from. So, make sure you're paying
yourself. I've locked in my money. I'm

1420
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,160
yourself. I've locked in my money. I'm
 

1421
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,630
yourself. I've locked in my money. I'm
good. And uh I don't need to force

1422
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,640
good. And uh I don't need to force
 

1423
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,470
good. And uh I don't need to force
anything else for the day now, right?

1424
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,480
anything else for the day now, right?
 

1425
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,230
anything else for the day now, right?
So, we've got the trade that we want. If

1426
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,240
So, we've got the trade that we want. If
 

1427
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,630
So, we've got the trade that we want. If
it keeps going higher, great. If not, we

1428
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
it keeps going higher, great. If not, we
 

1429
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,750
it keeps going higher, great. If not, we
get stopped out. We're going to have to

1430
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
get stopped out. We're going to have to
 

1431
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,670
get stopped out. We're going to have to
have two goes a day, unfortunately. So I

1432
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:11,680
have two goes a day, unfortunately. So I
 

1433
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,470
have two goes a day, unfortunately. So I
was long here partial stop out and then

1434
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,480
was long here partial stop out and then
 

1435
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,589
was long here partial stop out and then
long after we reclaimed partial and then

1436
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
long after we reclaimed partial and then
 

1437
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,589
long after we reclaimed partial and then
we see right break even right now on the

1438
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:21,599
we see right break even right now on the
 

1439
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,430
we see right break even right now on the
runner and let's see if we can get up

1440
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440
runner and let's see if we can get up
 

1441
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,230
runner and let's see if we can get up
into here.

1442
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,240

 

1443
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,310

So far so good. Starting to try and base

1444
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:30,320
So far so good. Starting to try and base
 

1445
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,910
So far so good. Starting to try and base
above previous days value area higher.

1446
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:31,920
above previous days value area higher.
 

1447
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,589
above previous days value area higher.
Remember if we get get acceptance above

1448
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
Remember if we get get acceptance above
 

1449
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,829
Remember if we get get acceptance above
previous day above previous week means

1450
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
previous day above previous week means
 

1451
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,030
previous day above previous week means
we are going to try and move value

1452
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,040
we are going to try and move value
 

1453
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,589
we are going to try and move value
higher. Need to be very careful of this

1454
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:39,599
higher. Need to be very careful of this
 

1455
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,109
higher. Need to be very careful of this
kind of move here though. All right.

1456
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:41,119
kind of move here though. All right.
 

1457
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,630
kind of move here though. All right.
Anywhere around here.

1458

above this, a big old squeeze is
 

1539
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,630
above this, a big old squeeze is
possible. We're coming into the edge of

1540
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,640
possible. We're coming into the edge of
 

1541
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,470
possible. We're coming into the edge of
range here. All right, we're coming into

1542
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
range here. All right, we're coming into
 

1543
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,270
range here. All right, we're coming into
the edge. We know a massive massive

1544
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,280
the edge. We know a massive massive
 

1545
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,790
the edge. We know a massive massive
massive level that we were trying to

1546
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
massive level that we were trying to
 

1547
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,430
massive level that we were trying to
trade into last week is into these 890s,

1548
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,440
trade into last week is into these 890s,
 

1549
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,349
trade into last week is into these 890s,
isn't it? This is the old naked point of

1550
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:41,359
isn't it? This is the old naked point of
 

1551
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,990
isn't it? This is the old naked point of
control from the week dating back to

1552
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,000
control from the week dating back to
 

1553
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,910
control from the week dating back to
Monday the 12th. So the weekly point of

1554
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:45,920
Monday the 12th. So the weekly point of
 

1555
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,349
Monday the 12th. So the weekly point of
control is right in here. This is the

1556
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
control is right in here. This is the
 

1557
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,349
control is right in here. This is the
same target as we had on Friday. Anyone

1558
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:49,359
same target as we had on Friday. Anyone
 

1559
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,270
same target as we had on Friday. Anyone
that traded with me Friday, we were long

1560
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
that traded with me Friday, we were long
 

1561
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,950
that traded with me Friday, we were long
trying to get into this block up here.

1562
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:52,960
trying to get into this block up here.

into the edge of that block. Um it has
 

1567
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,630
into the edge of that block. Um it has
kind of started now. We have like 850

about as well. So, we've got a nice
 

1633
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,470
about as well. So, we've got a nice
efficient hit market here to start the

1634
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
efficient hit market here to start the
 

1635
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,710
efficient hit market here to start the

uh naked PC.
 

1643
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,670
uh naked PC.
It's the only thing left. So if I take

1644
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,680
It's the only thing left. So if I take

1652
00:42:59,829 --> 00:42:59,839
tried on Friday. If you remember Friday,
 

1653
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,710
tried on Friday. If you remember Friday,
we were long from here for this. Today

1654
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,720
we were long from here for this. Today
 

1655
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,870
we were long from here for this. Today
we were long from here for this. All

1656
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:04,880
we were long from here for this. All
 

1657
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,470
we were long from here for this. All
right, if we get acceptance over that,

1658
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480
right, if we get acceptance over that,
 

1659
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,390
right, if we get acceptance over that,
we have a resqueeze. But here is a big

1660
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,400
we have a resqueeze. But here is a big
 

1661
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,470
we have a resqueeze. But here is a big
block. This is our it's naked. It's our

1662
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,480
block. This is our it's naked. It's our
 

1663
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,309
block. This is our it's naked. It's our
first time visiting it. We don't expect

1664
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
first time visiting it. We don't expect
 

1665
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,349
first time visiting it. We don't expect
to just fly through it.

1666
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:15,359
to just fly through it.
 

1667
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,190
to just fly through it.
Okay, so really nice trade. I think this

1668
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,200
Okay, so really nice trade. I think this
 

1669
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,790
Okay, so really nice trade. I think this
is the first one that we put in Discord

1670
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:18,800
is the first one that we put in Discord
 

1671
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,309
is the first one that we put in Discord
this morning as well. Was this the first

1672
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:20,319
this morning as well. Was this the first
 

1673
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,470
this morning as well. Was this the first
thing?

1674
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480
thing?
 

1675
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,430
thing?
Try and remember. Yes. So, we're almost

1676
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
Try and remember. Yes. So, we're almost
 

1677
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,510
Try and remember. Yes. So, we're almost
there.

1678
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:29,520

 

1679
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,309

All right. Basing above through the 800s

1680
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:32,319
All right. Basing above through the 800s
 

1681
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,990
All right. Basing above through the 800s
into this level here, this naked point

1682
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,000
into this level here, this naked point
 

1683
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,870
into this level here, this naked point
of control. All right. So, push, pull

1684
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:36,880
of control. All right. So, push, pull
 

1685
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,550
of control. All right. So, push, pull
back, go. It's exactly what we've done

1686
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:38,560
back, go. It's exactly what we've done
 

1687
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,470
back, go. It's exactly what we've done
this morning.

1688
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:44,480

 

1689
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,069

So if we start losing previous days

1690
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
So if we start losing previous days
 

1691
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,630
So if we start losing previous days
value area highs, potential for a retest

1692
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:48,640
value area highs, potential for a retest
 

1693
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,550
value area highs, potential for a retest
down here into 80s and if we lose that

1694
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:50,560
down here into 80s and if we lose that
 

1695
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,550
down here into 80s and if we lose that
potential for a wash down into 750

1696
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
potential for a wash down into 750
 

1697
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,430
potential for a wash down into 750
still. So you should be small size now

1698
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:55,440
still. So you should be small size now
 

1699
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,710
still. So you should be small size now
managing your position.

1700
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720

 

1701
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,510

Done for the day. Yeah, I mean I might

1702
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:03,520
Done for the day. Yeah, I mean I might
 

1703
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,750
Done for the day. Yeah, I mean I might
well be the same to be honest. If we if

1704
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
well be the same to be honest. If we if
 

1705
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,069
well be the same to be honest. If we if
we fail up here in previous week's value

1706
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
we fail up here in previous week's value
 

1707
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,150
we fail up here in previous week's value
area high, right, then it's possible to

1708
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,160
area high, right, then it's possible to
 

1709
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,670
area high, right, then it's possible to
rotate down, isn't it? So if we start

1710
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
rotate down, isn't it? So if we start
 

1711
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,109
rotate down, isn't it? So if we start
losing previous day and point of

1712
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
losing previous day and point of
 

1713
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,030
losing previous day and point of
control, you got to remember remember

1714
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,040
control, you got to remember remember
 

1715
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,950
control, you got to remember remember
that previous days value area low. So

1716
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:16,960
that previous days value area low. So
 

1717
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,589
that previous days value area low. So
we've if we lose this and lose this then

1718
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
we've if we lose this and lose this then
 

1719
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,430
we've if we lose this and lose this then
this is possible. These are the the

1720
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
this is possible. These are the the
 

1721
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,589
this is possible. These are the the
downside moves, right? We're bullish

1722
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:25,599
downside moves, right? We're bullish
 

1723
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,349
downside moves, right? We're bullish
though trying to get into here. But if

1724
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
though trying to get into here. But if
 

1725
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,349
though trying to get into here. But if
they start doing a rotation, if they do

1726
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
they start doing a rotation, if they do
 

1727
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,030
they start doing a rotation, if they do
a full weekly rotation, which I don't

1728
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,040
a full weekly rotation, which I don't
 

1729
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,470
a full weekly rotation, which I don't
think they will, it would be all the way

1730
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:32,480
think they will, it would be all the way
 

1731
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,870
think they will, it would be all the way
down here.

1732
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
down here.
 

1733
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,630
down here.
So far, we're bullish. It's got targets

1734
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,640
So far, we're bullish. It's got targets
 

1735
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,710
So far, we're bullish. It's got targets
above it's trying to get to. It's just

1736
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720
above it's trying to get to. It's just
 

1737
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,710
above it's trying to get to. It's just
we don't want to be buying in premium of

1738
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:40,720
we don't want to be buying in premium of
 

1739
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,230
we don't want to be buying in premium of
last week, do we? We don't want to be

1740
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,240
last week, do we? We don't want to be
 

1741
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,150
last week, do we? We don't want to be
buying previous week value area high in

1742
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:44,160
buying previous week value area high in
 

1743
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:51,990
buying previous week value area high in
front of it.

1744
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,000

 

1745
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,589

Got super late. Was planning to get in

1746
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:53,599
Got super late. Was planning to get in
 

1747
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,950
Got super late. Was planning to get in
at 7:45. Got a 785.

1748
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:56,960
at 7:45. Got a 785.
 

1749
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,790
at 7:45. Got a 785.
Only holding two MRS for that naked

1750
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:58,800
Only holding two MRS for that naked
 

1751
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,950
Only holding two MRS for that naked
point control. Yeah, same exactly the

1752
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
point control. Yeah, same exactly the
 

1753
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,150
point control. Yeah, same exactly the
same trade as we looked at Friday,

1754
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,160
same trade as we looked at Friday,
 

1755
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,309
same trade as we looked at Friday,
wasn't it, bud?

1756
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
wasn't it, bud?
 

1757
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,510
wasn't it, bud?
Let's see if they can do it. See if

1758
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
Let's see if they can do it. See if
 

1759
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,910
Let's see if they can do it. See if
they've got the juice.

1760
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
they've got the juice.
 

1761
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,069
they've got the juice.
They can afford to pull back into 750s

1762
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:10,079
They can afford to pull back into 750s
 

1763
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,910
They can afford to pull back into 750s
though. Looking at that sort of 15

1764
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
though. Looking at that sort of 15
 

1765
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,309
though. Looking at that sort of 15
minute and hourly. They can afford to

1766
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:14,319
minute and hourly. They can afford to
 

1767
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,829
minute and hourly. They can afford to
pull back into 750s. That's the only

1768
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
pull back into 750s. That's the only
 

1769
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,109
pull back into 750s. That's the only
thing. So it just depends if they can

1770
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:17,119
thing. So it just depends if they can
 

1771
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,430
thing. So it just depends if they can
resqueeze above previous day value area

1772
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:19,440
resqueeze above previous day value area
 

1773
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,790
resqueeze above previous day value area
high and previous week for that squeeze

1774
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:20,800
high and previous week for that squeeze
 

1775
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,510
high and previous week for that squeeze
up. Otherwise if they need to rebid, all

1776
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
up. Otherwise if they need to rebid, all
 

1777
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,950
up. Otherwise if they need to rebid, all
right, the only thing I'd be careful of

1778
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:24,960
right, the only thing I'd be careful of
 

1779
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,710
right, the only thing I'd be careful of
is if they need to rebid, which is where

1780
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:26,720
is if they need to rebid, which is where
 

1781
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,710
is if they need to rebid, which is where
you're long from, they'll come back for

1782
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
you're long from, they'll come back for
 

1783
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,270
you're long from, they'll come back for
here and then rebid it.

1784
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
here and then rebid it.
 

1785
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,190
here and then rebid it.
And under here we get weak. But I would

1786
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
And under here we get weak. But I would
 

1787
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,950
And under here we get weak. But I would
imagine bulls will want to either do

1788
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
imagine bulls will want to either do
 

1789
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,829
imagine bulls will want to either do
this or you know it might be like this

1790
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:37,839
this or you know it might be like this
 

1791
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:51,589
this or you know it might be like this
today. And this is the target.

1792
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599

 

1793
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,950

Yeah. The end of the course. Green

1794
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:52,960
Yeah. The end of the course. Green
 

1795
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,790
Yeah. The end of the course. Green

1798
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400

 

1799
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:14,069

All right, folks.

1800
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:14,079

 

1801
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,510

I didn't think we'd have it out the gate

1802
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:15,520
I didn't think we'd have it out the gate
 

1803
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,069
I didn't think we'd have it out the gate
today. I'll be honest with you. I

1804
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
today. I'll be honest with you. I
 

1805
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,470
today. I'll be honest with you. I
thought that maybe they'd uh flush it

1806
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:20,480
thought that maybe they'd uh flush it
 

1807
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,150
thought that maybe they'd uh flush it
down and retest this before they bid

1808
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,160
down and retest this before they bid
 

1809
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,270
down and retest this before they bid
back up after this sort of grind up.

1810
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
back up after this sort of grind up.
 

1811
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,790
back up after this sort of grind up.
Thought maybe we'd flush down and rebid.

1812
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:28,800
Thought maybe we'd flush down and rebid.
 

1813
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,349
Thought maybe we'd flush down and rebid.
A strong market to do what it's doing.

1814
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:31,359
A strong market to do what it's doing.
 

1815
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,950
A strong market to do what it's doing.
Still holding flow zones, everything

1816
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
Still holding flow zones, everything
 

1817
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,430
Still holding flow zones, everything
bullish right now, but we are into the

1818
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:35,440
bullish right now, but we are into the
 

1819
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,270
bullish right now, but we are into the
top of previous week's value. All right.

1820
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:37,280
top of previous week's value. All right.
 

1821
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,270
top of previous week's value. All right.
So, this is your resistance, resistance,

1822
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280
So, this is your resistance, resistance,
 

1823
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,430
So, this is your resistance, resistance,
and resistance up here. So, we're long

1824
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,440
and resistance up here. So, we're long
 

1825
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,750
and resistance up here. So, we're long
from here or long from here, selling

1826
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
from here or long from here, selling
 

1827
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,309
from here or long from here, selling
into these pushes. If it can't do this,

1828
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
into these pushes. If it can't do this,
 

1829
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,990
into these pushes. If it can't do this,
you need to be really careful. The way

1830
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
you need to be really careful. The way
 

1831
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,750
you need to be really careful. The way
they're setting this up is a little bit

1832
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
they're setting this up is a little bit
 

1833
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,190
they're setting this up is a little bit
awkward building a shelf here. think

1834
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
awkward building a shelf here. think
 

1835
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,510
awkward building a shelf here. think
they need to complete this, but if they

1836
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,520
they need to complete this, but if they
 

1837
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,270
they need to complete this, but if they
lose it, just don't hold on to it. All

1838
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
lose it, just don't hold on to it. All
 

1839
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,710
lose it, just don't hold on to it. All
right, you do not want to get caught in

1840
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:56,720
right, you do not want to get caught in
 

1841
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,950
right, you do not want to get caught in
a flush that back down to 750. So, as

1842
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:58,960
a flush that back down to 750. So, as
 

1843
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,950
a flush that back down to 750. So, as
long as they keep bidding this and

1844
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:00,960
long as they keep bidding this and
 

1845
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,550
long as they keep bidding this and
potentially this, as long as you sell on

1846

potentially this, as long as you sell on
 

1847
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,750
potentially this, as long as you sell on
the pushes into this, you can always

1848
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:03,760
the pushes into this, you can always
 

1849
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,270
the pushes into this, you can always
hold a runner in case we go mental

1850
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,280
hold a runner in case we go mental
 

1851
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,309
hold a runner in case we go mental
today, but I don't think we're uh likely

1852
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:08,319
today, but I don't think we're uh likely
 

1853
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,190
today, but I don't think we're uh likely
to push through 900, but you just don't

1854
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
to push through 900, but you just don't
 

1855
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,349
to push through 900, but you just don't
know if they turn the uh balgo on to

1856
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:15,359
know if they turn the uh balgo on to
 

1857
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,510
know if they turn the uh balgo on to
position themselves long back into tech

1858
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:17,520
position themselves long back into tech
 

1859
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:27,270
position themselves long back into tech
for the earnings early. It's possible.

1883
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,910
Here we go. All right, so let's see if
we hit final targets here. So, watching

1884
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:57,920
we hit final targets here. So, watching
 

1885
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,510
we hit final targets here. So, watching
845s

1886
00:47:59,510 --> 00:47:59,520
845s
 

1887
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,589
845s
and then 890s. 845s and 890s,

1888
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:03,599
and then 890s. 845s and 890s,
 

1889

the final targets here.
 

1891
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,030
the final targets here.
Can we get 845s and 890s? That's what

1892
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,040
Can we get 845s and 890s? That's what
 

1893
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,030
Can we get 845s and 890s? That's what
we're looking for if they're willing to

1894
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
we're looking for if they're willing to
 

1895
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:20,390
we're looking for if they're willing to
hold it.

1896
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400

 

1897
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,230

back to previous week value area high.

1898
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:22,240
back to previous week value area high.
 

1899
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,069
back to previous week value area high.
Do they rebid this to go 845s, 890s?

1900
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:28,079

 

1901
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,430

They don't rebid this. Then we're going

1902
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
They don't rebid this. Then we're going
 

1903
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,670
They don't rebid this. Then we're going
to go back to previous day value area

1904
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:31,680
to go back to previous day value area
 

1905
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,190
to go back to previous day value area
high. Sorry, from previous week to

1906
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,200
high. Sorry, from previous week to
 

1907
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,390
high. Sorry, from previous week to
previous day. There is a little shelf

1908
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:34,400
previous day. There is a little shelf
 

1909
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,069
previous day. There is a little shelf
being developed at 820s at the moment,

1910
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:36,079
being developed at 820s at the moment,
 

1911
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,910
being developed at 820s at the moment,
which I'm watching carefully. So sellers

1912
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:37,920
which I'm watching carefully. So sellers
 

1913
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,030
which I'm watching carefully. So sellers
currently are stuck under 8:16s on the

1914
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
currently are stuck under 8:16s on the
 

1915
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,190
currently are stuck under 8:16s on the
day. So we might come and test this

1916
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:43,200
day. So we might come and test this
 

1917
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,790
day. So we might come and test this
shelf. You need them to rebid the shelf

1918
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:44,800
shelf. You need them to rebid the shelf
 

1919
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,910
shelf. You need them to rebid the shelf
if we're going to drive higher.

1920
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:45,920
if we're going to drive higher.
 

1921
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,829
if we're going to drive higher.
Otherwise, don't really like it. So,

1922
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:47,839
Otherwise, don't really like it. So,
 

1923
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,470
Otherwise, don't really like it. So,
here's the 820 test.

1924
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480

 

1925
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,309

We need to rebid this shelf really

1926
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
We need to rebid this shelf really
 

1927
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,030
We need to rebid this shelf really
otherwise I think we get a little bit

1928
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
otherwise I think we get a little bit
 

1929
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,030
otherwise I think we get a little bit
risky here holding too much longer

1930
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:01,040
risky here holding too much longer
 

1931
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,950
risky here holding too much longer
because we've just taken out previous

1932
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
because we've just taken out previous
 

1933
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,990
because we've just taken out previous
week a value area high. Only thing left

1934
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:06,000
week a value area high. Only thing left
 

1935
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,549
week a value area high. Only thing left
is previous week high. They're trying to

1936
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
is previous week high. They're trying to
 

1937
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,630
is previous week high. They're trying to
hold these 820s

1938
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:10,640
hold these 820s
 

1939
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,549
hold these 820s
literally like we just talked about. Can

1940
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:12,559
literally like we just talked about. Can
 

1941
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,790
literally like we just talked about. Can
they find acceptance now back above

1942
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:14,800
they find acceptance now back above
 

1943
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,510
they find acceptance now back above
previous week value area high? So,

1944
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:17,520
previous week value area high? So,
 

1945
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,030
previous week value area high? So,
watching this shelf to see if they find

1946
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,040
watching this shelf to see if they find
 

1947
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,470
watching this shelf to see if they find
acceptance back above here for a

1948
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:20,480
acceptance back above here for a
 

1949
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,430
acceptance back above here for a
squeeze.

1950
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440
squeeze.
 

1951
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,109
squeeze.
Be careful. Just managing my position

1952
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:25,119
Be careful. Just managing my position
 

1953
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,270
Be careful. Just managing my position
here. Do not want to get caught in a

1954
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:27,280
here. Do not want to get caught in a
 

1955
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,750
here. Do not want to get caught in a
horrible flash. I know we're at the top

1956
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,760
horrible flash. I know we're at the top
 

1957
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,270
horrible flash. I know we're at the top
side of the previous week range right

1958
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:31,280
side of the previous week range right
 

1959
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,710
side of the previous week range right
now. I think we've still got targets

1960
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
now. I think we've still got targets
 

1961
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,870
now. I think we've still got targets
above. We can go for nice hold of that

1962
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:34,880
above. We can go for nice hold of that
 

1963
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,589
above. We can go for nice hold of that
shelf. So, still holding this. Can we

1964
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:37,599
shelf. So, still holding this. Can we
 

1965
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,150
shelf. So, still holding this. Can we
get acceptance higher here?

1966
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:42,160

 

1967
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,829

Lovely. Come on. Let's go for that

1968
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:43,839
Lovely. Come on. Let's go for that
 

1969
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,349
Lovely. Come on. Let's go for that
previous week high and then squeeze

1970
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:45,359
previous week high and then squeeze
 

1971
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,910
previous week high and then squeeze
above 845 to 890s. It would be so nice

1972
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:47,920
above 845 to 890s. It would be so nice
 

1973
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,270
above 845 to 890s. It would be so nice
if we just do it. We definitely have a

1974
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
if we just do it. We definitely have a
 

1975
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,750
if we just do it. We definitely have a
buyer stuck at 840 right now. Actually,

1976
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760
buyer stuck at 840 right now. Actually,
 

1977
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,390
buyer stuck at 840 right now. Actually,
technically 839

1978
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,400

 

1979
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,630

developing holding this. This here is

1980
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
developing holding this. This here is
 

1981
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,870
developing holding this. This here is
starting to become pretty key. We can

1982
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
starting to become pretty key. We can
 

1983
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,470
starting to become pretty key. We can
draw this in this point of control. This

1984
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:02,480
draw this in this point of control. This
 

1985
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,870
draw this in this point of control. This
level here, they've got to hold this

1986
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:04,880
level here, they've got to hold this

00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:38,960
39. If we can get through him, there's
 

2001
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,870
39. If we can get through him, there's
an old imbalance here. If we can get

2002
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:40,880
an old imbalance here. If we can get
 

2003
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,190
an old imbalance here. If we can get
through him, then we should get that 45s

2004
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,200
through him, then we should get that 45s
 

2005
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,950
through him, then we should get that 45s
and then 890s if we get lucky.

2006
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960

 

2007
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,109

Come on.

2008
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119

 

2009

Red line, next target, and then up here

2010
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
Red line, next target, and then up here
 

2011
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,549
Red line, next target, and then up here
into 890s. I can put a horizontal line

2012
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
into 890s. I can put a horizontal line
 

2013
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,630
into 890s. I can put a horizontal line
on so we can see exactly where that PC

2014
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,640
on so we can see exactly where that PC
 

2015
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,030
on so we can see exactly where that PC
is right here. Right. This is the old

2016
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,040

2017
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:14,309

naked PC.

2049
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,510
the book. Once we get through there, we
should get up into the seller at 900.

2050
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:15,520
should get up into the seller at 900.

along from this blue box, I got knocked

2068
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:34,720
along from this blue box, I got knocked
 

2069
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,910
along from this blue box, I got knocked
out, so I had to join a little bit

2070
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
out, so I had to join a little bit
 

2071
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:51,030
out, so I had to join a little bit
later.

2072
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,040

 

2073
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,549

So now it shouldn't come back down into

2074
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
So now it shouldn't come back down into
 

2075
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,549
So now it shouldn't come back down into
the previous range. Um, it's a bit

2076
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
the previous range. Um, it's a bit
 

2077
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,990
the previous range. Um, it's a bit
early. We've only just broken through

2078
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:56,000
early. We've only just broken through
 

2079
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,750
early. We've only just broken through
it, right? We can still look we can

2080
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:57,760
it, right? We can still look we can
 

2081
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,510
it, right? We can still look we can
still look above. Remember previous week

2082
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,520
still look above. Remember previous week
 

2083
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,349
still look above. Remember previous week
value here. We can look above and get

2084
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:01,359
value here. We can look above and get
 

2085
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:02,790
value here. We can look above and get
stuck here and come right back down.

2086
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:02,800
stuck here and come right back down.
 

2087
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,589
stuck here and come right back down.
This is still the previous day range is

2088
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
This is still the previous day range is
 

2089
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,829
This is still the previous day range is
here. All right. That's previous day and

2090
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:09,839
here. All right. That's previous day and
 

2091
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,510
here. All right. That's previous day and
previous week is

00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,109
previous week is
here.

2094
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:15,119
here.
 

2095
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,870
here.
Right. All we've done is poke through so

2096
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:16,880
Right. All we've done is poke through so
 

2097
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,870
Right. All we've done is poke through so
far. Right. I don't think we haven't

2098
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
far. Right. I don't think we haven't
 

2099
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,630
far. Right. I don't think we haven't
like based out yet, have we? We've just

2100
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
like based out yet, have we? We've just
 

2101
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,470
like based out yet, have we? We've just
poked through. We haven't based out. We

2102
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:22,480
poked through. We haven't based out. We
 

2103
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,710
poked through. We haven't based out. We
haven't dropped, reclaimed, and gone.

2104
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
haven't dropped, reclaimed, and gone.
 

2105
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,309
haven't dropped, reclaimed, and gone.
So, we're long for the first move, but I

2106
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
So, we're long for the first move, but I
 

2107
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,069
So, we're long for the first move, but I
think it' be it's Monday morning. It's

2108
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
think it' be it's Monday morning. It's
 

2109
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,349
think it' be it's Monday morning. It's
far too early to say we're not going to

2110
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:29,359
far too early to say we're not going to
 

2111
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:30,790
far too early to say we're not going to
come into the previous week's range.

2112
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:30,800
come into the previous week's range.
 

2113
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,390
come into the previous week's range.
It's far too early to say that. It's

2114
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,400
It's far too early to say that. It's
 

2115
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,910
It's far too early to say that. It's
only a Monday morning. We got a whole

2116
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:33,920
only a Monday morning. We got a whole
 

2117
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,710
only a Monday morning. We got a whole
week ahead.

2118
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:36,720
week ahead.
 

2119
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,870
week ahead.
This is definitely the target now.

2120
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
This is definitely the target now.
 

2121
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,549
This is definitely the target now.

Right. So, here comes the retest of

2130
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,000
Right. So, here comes the retest of
 

2131
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,670
Right. So, here comes the retest of
these sort of 820s where we built out

2132
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
these sort of 820s where we built out
 

2133
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,270
these sort of 820s where we built out
this shelf. Be careful if they start

2134
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,280
this shelf. Be careful if they start
 

2135
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,750
this shelf. Be careful if they start
losing 820s and 800s. Certainly a

2136
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:55,760
losing 820s and 800s. Certainly a
 

2137
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,829
losing 820s and 800s. Certainly a
rotation down to 780s and very very

2138
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
rotation down to 780s and very very
 

2139
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,589
rotation down to 780s and very very
possible all the way down to 750s. We

2140
00:53:59,589 --> 00:53:59,599
possible all the way down to 750s. We
 

2141
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,910
possible all the way down to 750s. We
still this is a squeeze up. We have not

2142
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
still this is a squeeze up. We have not
 

2143
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,670
still this is a squeeze up. We have not
retested this. We are still bullish. I'm

2144
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:03,680
retested this. We are still bullish. I'm
 

2145
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,589

You are still bullish. I'm just letting
 

2149
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,990
You are still bullish. I'm just letting
you know that if we start to lose these

to drive? If they do, we're going to see
 

2307
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,670
to drive? If they do, we're going to see
some weakness come into the market.

2308
00:58:59,670 --> 00:58:59,680
some weakness come into the market.
 

2309
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,430
some weakness come into the market.
If they can sell through the gap, then

2310
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:01,440
If they can sell through the gap, then
 

2311
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:19,270
If they can sell through the gap, then
we might get that resqueeze.

2312
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:19,280

 

2313
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:26,150

What's up, Tyson?

2314
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160

 

2315
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,430

They still got a target up here. It's

2316
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440
They still got a target up here. It's
 

2317
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,950
They still got a target up here. It's
just where they need to flush it first

2318
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:28,960
just where they need to flush it first
 

2319
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,750
just where they need to flush it first
before rebid.

2320
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:31,760
before rebid.
 

2321
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,710
before rebid.
We will see. What's up, Gary?

2322
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,720

 

2323
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,549

We will see if we hit final targets

2324
00:59:38,549 --> 00:59:38,559
We will see if we hit final targets
 

2325
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:49,349
We will see if we hit final targets
here.

2326
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:49,359

2341
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,789

Is the VIX a tradeable asset? Yes, it

2342

It's very tradable. You see, most
 

2347
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,750
It's very tradable. You see, most
people, smart people, when we see drives

2348
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:23,760

over 20s and above,
 

2351
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,190
over 20s and above,
they will just sell the sell the VIX

2352
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
they will just sell the sell the VIX
 

2353
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,710
they will just sell the sell the VIX
longterm because they know it'll come

2357
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:42,549

They use it as a hedge most of the time.

2358
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:42,559

 

2359
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,470

Now sell. There's no reason to sell

right now.
Zero reason to sell,

2364
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,000
Zero reason to sell,
 

2365
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,510
Zero reason to sell,
right? We're getting stuck at this edge,

2366
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:51,520
right? We're getting stuck at this edge,
 

2367
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,950
right? We're getting stuck at this edge,
but like you've got no confirmation.

2368
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
but like you've got no confirmation.

We're not under any key levels yet. I

2370
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:54,720
We're not under any key levels yet. I
 

2371
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,510
We're not under any key levels yet. I
mean, look, you you do you. But for me,

2372
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:57,520
mean, look, you you do you. But for me,
 

2373
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,109
mean, look, you you do you. But for me,
all right, yes, we might come down here,

2374
01:00:59,109 --> 01:00:59,119
all right, yes, we might come down here,
 

2375
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:00,870
all right, yes, we might come down here,
but I'm more interested in selling if we

2376
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:00,880
but I'm more interested in selling if we
 

2377
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,789
but I'm more interested in selling if we
start losing volume. At the moment,

2378
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:02,799
start losing volume. At the moment,
 

2379
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:09,670
start losing volume. At the moment,
we're building volume.

2380
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,680

 

2381
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,910

above the key level, above previous day

2382
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:11,920
above the key level, above previous day
 

2383
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,829
above the key level, above previous day
value area high, above or at previous

week value area height with a clear
 

2387
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,990
week value area height with a clear
target up here. Right? The short for me

2388
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
target up here. Right? The short for me
 

2389
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,950
target up here. Right? The short for me
would have to be here on a rejection,

2390
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:20,960
would have to be here on a rejection,
 

2391
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,710
would have to be here on a rejection,
right? I'd have to know that we're

2392
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:22,720
right? I'd have to know that we're
 

2393
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,829
right? I'd have to know that we're
starting to reject this. We're not we're

2394
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
starting to reject this. We're not we're
 

2395
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,829
starting to reject this. We're not we're
not doing that right now. So, there's no

2396
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:27,839
not doing that right now. So, there's no
 

2397
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,109
not doing that right now. So, there's no
short for me. I'm not going to scout

2398
01:01:29,109 --> 01:01:29,119
short for me. I'm not going to scout
 

2399
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,270
short for me. I'm not going to scout
this short side. Yes, we're at premium.

2400
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:31,280
this short side. Yes, we're at premium.
 

2401
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,510
this short side. Yes, we're at premium.
Yes, it might come down to here, but for

2402
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,520
Yes, it might come down to here, but for
 

2403
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,910
Yes, it might come down to here, but for
a bigger uh fade move, I'd have to see

2404
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:35,920
a bigger uh fade move, I'd have to see
 

2405
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,750
a bigger uh fade move, I'd have to see
it really let go of volume. And I'm not

2406
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
it really let go of volume. And I'm not
 

2407
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,870
it really let go of volume. And I'm not
seeing that right now. I'm seeing quite

2408
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:38,880
seeing that right now. I'm seeing quite
 

2409
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,390
seeing that right now. I'm seeing quite
the opposite.

2410
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:44,400

 

2411
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,870

Uh the orb is 15 minutes. This this

2412
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:46,880
Uh the orb is 15 minutes. This this
 

2413
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,710
Uh the orb is 15 minutes. This this
white line is 15minute orb that's set,

2414
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:48,720
white line is 15minute orb that's set,
 

2415
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,150
white line is 15minute orb that's set,
but you can change it with the indicator

2416
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:50,160
but you can change it with the indicator
 

2417
01:01:50,160 --> 01:02:22,710
but you can change it with the indicator
to whatever you want.

2418
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720

 

2419
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,309

Yeah, agree, Peter. Just sideways

2420
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:24,319
Yeah, agree, Peter. Just sideways
 

2421
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:25,670
Yeah, agree, Peter. Just sideways
building out this volume at the moment.

2422
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:25,680
building out this volume at the moment.
 

2423
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,030
building out this volume at the moment.
It's all we're doing. Building out the

2424
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,040
It's all we're doing. Building out the
 

2425
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,309
It's all we're doing. Building out the
volume. It wants to move higher. It's

2426
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:30,319
volume. It wants to move higher. It's
 

2427
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:31,910
volume. It wants to move higher. It's
just whether it needs to trap first

2428
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:31,920
just whether it needs to trap first
 

2429
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:42,390
just whether it needs to trap first
before we do it.

2430
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400

 

2431
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,910

Very, very possible we come and retest

2432
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:43,920
Very, very possible we come and retest
 

2433
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,510
Very, very possible we come and retest
some of this before we do it. It's very

2434
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,520
some of this before we do it. It's very
 

2435
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,430
some of this before we do it. It's very
possible they do something down into

2436
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
possible they do something down into
 

2437
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,510
possible they do something down into
this low volume node like very very

2438
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
this low volume node like very very
 

2439
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,589
this low volume node like very very
possible we do some sort of dunk into

2440
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:51,599
possible we do some sort of dunk into
 

2441
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,910
possible we do some sort of dunk into
here, save it, reclaim and then finish

2442
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
here, save it, reclaim and then finish
 

2443
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,750
here, save it, reclaim and then finish
the move. Same move we were looking for

2444
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:55,760
the move. Same move we were looking for
 

2445
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,670
the move. Same move we were looking for
Friday. Even this will be the same as

2446
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:57,680
Friday. Even this will be the same as
 

2447
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,109
Friday. Even this will be the same as
what we were looking for Friday and it

2448
01:02:59,109 --> 01:02:59,119
what we were looking for Friday and it
 

2449
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,190
what we were looking for Friday and it
it didn't happen Friday. We sold on our

2450
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:01,200
it didn't happen Friday. We sold on our
 

2451
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,870
it didn't happen Friday. We sold on our
push if we remember those who traded

2452
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880
push if we remember those who traded
 

2453
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,990
push if we remember those who traded
with me Friday was exactly the same

2454
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,000
with me Friday was exactly the same
 

2455
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,829
with me Friday was exactly the same
move. Here was the move Friday. We

2456
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:07,839
move. Here was the move Friday. We
 

2457
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,750
move. Here was the move Friday. We
caught it

2458
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:09,760
caught it
 

2459
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,309
caught it
I think it was here, wasn't it? here and

2460
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
I think it was here, wasn't it? here and
 

2461
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,950
I think it was here, wasn't it? here and
an add and we sold into this and then I

2462
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
an add and we sold into this and then I
 

2463
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,309
an add and we sold into this and then I
was saying I would like to see it do

2464
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:16,319
was saying I would like to see it do
 

2465
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:17,750
was saying I would like to see it do
something like this to complete the move

2466
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:17,760
something like this to complete the move
 

2467
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,230
something like this to complete the move
or this and all we did was go sideways

2468
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:20,240
or this and all we did was go sideways
 

2469
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,470
or this and all we did was go sideways
Friday sell back off into range so we're

2470
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480
Friday sell back off into range so we're
 

2471
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,069
Friday sell back off into range so we're
exactly the same level if we look at

2472
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:24,079
exactly the same level if we look at
 

2473
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,470
exactly the same level if we look at
where we're trying to trade into exactly

2474
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
where we're trying to trade into exactly
 

2475
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,230
where we're trying to trade into exactly
the same level this is identical to

2476
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
the same level this is identical to
 

2477
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,549
the same level this is identical to
Friday it's just can we base above come

2478
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
Friday it's just can we base above come
 

2479
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,549
Friday it's just can we base above come
up to here can we do the move I was

2480
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:32,559
up to here can we do the move I was
 

2481
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,390
up to here can we do the move I was
looking for Friday which we never

2482
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
looking for Friday which we never
 

2483
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,630
looking for Friday which we never
completed is the question right now or

2484
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:36,640
completed is the question right now or
 

2485
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,390
completed is the question right now or
are they just going to trade the edge

2486
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
are they just going to trade the edge
 

2487
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,549
are they just going to trade the edge
and go back into the dance hopefully not

2488
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
and go back into the dance hopefully not
 

2489
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,069
and go back into the dance hopefully not
it would be Nice if we moved out of

2490
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
it would be Nice if we moved out of
 

2491
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:54,230
it would be Nice if we moved out of
range.

2492
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,240

 

2493
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,910

But yes, maybe coming back down for

But yes, maybe coming back down for

But yes, maybe coming back down for

SPY can afford a previous day high ret

2500
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:03,280
SPY can afford a previous day high ret
 

2501
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,069
SPY can afford a previous day high ret
back into sort of 90s 91s

2502
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079

 

2503
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,470

and we can afford to come back down into

2504
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:10,480
and we can afford to come back down into
 

2505
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,150
and we can afford to come back down into
these 800s. It can afford to come down

2506
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160
these 800s. It can afford to come down
 

2507
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,230
these 800s. It can afford to come down
to 780. You can see the shelf here where

2508
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:14,240
to 780. You can see the shelf here where
 

2509
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,910
to 780. You can see the shelf here where
that seller got trapped if it really

2510
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
that seller got trapped if it really
 

2511
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,549
that seller got trapped if it really
wants to. This blue box here may very

2512
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:18,559
wants to. This blue box here may very
 

2513
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,549
wants to. This blue box here may very
well be defended.

2514
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:20,559
well be defended.
 

2515
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:27,589
well be defended.
We will see. I'm willing to play a trap

2516
01:04:27,589 --> 01:04:27,599

 

2517
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,349

to get long if it's willing to do it.

2518
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359
to get long if it's willing to do it.
 

2519
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:32,789
to get long if it's willing to do it.
There's the flush right back down. So

2520
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:32,799
There's the flush right back down. So
 

2521
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,789
There's the flush right back down. So
this just like Friday watching this into

2522
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
this just like Friday watching this into
 

2523
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,470
this just like Friday watching this into
previous day value area high and VWAP

2524
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
previous day value area high and VWAP
 

2525
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,029
previous day value area high and VWAP
and the big big pivot here is 780. So

2526
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
and the big big pivot here is 780. So
 

2527
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,309
and the big big pivot here is 780. So
that's where that seller came in. So

2528
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:42,319
that's where that seller came in. So
 

2529
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,069
that's where that seller came in. So
they're rebidding previous day value

2530
01:04:44,069 --> 01:04:44,079
they're rebidding previous day value
 

2531
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,309
they're rebidding previous day value
area high for now. They are stacking

2532
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:46,319
area high for now. They are stacking
 

2533
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:47,910
area high for now. They are stacking
underneath. It might very well lose this

2534
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:47,920
underneath. It might very well lose this
 

2535
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,589
underneath. It might very well lose this
bid and come for a flush and then we'll

2536
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:49,599
bid and come for a flush and then we'll
 

2537
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,109
bid and come for a flush and then we'll
see if they want to trap or not into

2538
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
see if they want to trap or not into
 

2539
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,270
see if they want to trap or not into
this low volume node which we literally

2540
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:53,280
this low volume node which we literally
 

2541
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,990
this low volume node which we literally
just talked about. So we will see. Time

2542
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,000
just talked about. So we will see. Time
 

2543
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,750
just talked about. So we will see. Time
will tell what they want to do. Here's

2544
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:57,760
will tell what they want to do. Here's
 

2545
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:04,470
will tell what they want to do. Here's
previous day value very high.

2546
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480

 

2547
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,230

So far bidding in front of that

2548
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:08,240
So far bidding in front of that
 

2549
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,190
So far bidding in front of that
stacked up under 800 so far. Seller

2550
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
stacked up under 800 so far. Seller
 

2551
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,589
stacked up under 800 so far. Seller
coming in here at 15. So far he's got

2552
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
coming in here at 15. So far he's got
 

2553
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:19,829
coming in here at 15. So far he's got
himself a little bit caught offside.

2554
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:19,839

 

2555
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,910

We still got more to fill into 800s and

2556
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:21,920
We still got more to fill into 800s and
 

2557
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,750
We still got more to fill into 800s and
95s, but we'll see.

2558
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:27,760

 

2559
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,589

I'm interested in the trap if they can

2560
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:29,599
I'm interested in the trap if they can
 

2561
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,750
I'm interested in the trap if they can
allow it

2562
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:31,760
allow it
 

2563
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:40,630
allow it
somewhere down here and then a reclaim.

2564
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:40,640

 

2565
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,349

Big buyer coming in here. They're trying

2566
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:43,359
Big buyer coming in here. They're trying
 

2567
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:46,309
Big buyer coming in here. They're trying
to resell 40s right now. So, here's the

2568
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:46,319
to resell 40s right now. So, here's the
 

2569
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,069
to resell 40s right now. So, here's the
potential trap if they can squeeze back

2570
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:48,079
potential trap if they can squeeze back
 

2571
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:49,829
potential trap if they can squeeze back
over previous week value area high. But

2572
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:49,839
over previous week value area high. But
 

2573
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,029
over previous week value area high. But
this where they're going to try and sell

2574
01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:51,039
this where they're going to try and sell
 

2575
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,710
this where they're going to try and sell
30s and 40s right now. It's where they

2576
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:52,720
30s and 40s right now. It's where they
 

2577
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,870
30s and 40s right now. It's where they
resold the first breakdown.

2578
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:54,880
resold the first breakdown.
 

2579
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,470
resold the first breakdown.
I really want to see this flush under

2580
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:56,480
I really want to see this flush under
 

2581
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,549
I really want to see this flush under
800 before a reclaim would be the most

2582
01:05:58,549 --> 01:05:58,559
800 before a reclaim would be the most
 

2583
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,309
800 before a reclaim would be the most
ideal scenario here.

2584
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:02,319
ideal scenario here.
 

2585
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,510
ideal scenario here.
I'd say as long as they protect uh 90s

2586
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:05,520
I'd say as long as they protect uh 90s
 

2587
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,990
I'd say as long as they protect uh 90s
to 82s the buyers then they will remain

2588
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:08,000
to 82s the buyers then they will remain
 

2589
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,349
to 82s the buyers then they will remain
in control and this will be a pullback

2590
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:09,359
in control and this will be a pullback
 

2591
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,309
in control and this will be a pullback
which can still be ripped higher and if

2592
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:12,319
which can still be ripped higher and if
 

2593
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,309
which can still be ripped higher and if
they start losing all this certainly if

2594
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:14,319
they start losing all this certainly if
 

2595
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,150
they start losing all this certainly if
they lose this the move back down to

2596
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:16,160
they lose this the move back down to
 

2597
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,990
they lose this the move back down to
750s is possible. We haven't rechecked

2598
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:18,000
750s is possible. We haven't rechecked
 

2599
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,630
750s is possible. We haven't rechecked
that since we bid off it. So so we break

2600
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
that since we bid off it. So so we break
 

2601
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,390
that since we bid off it. So so we break
out we haven't actually rechecked it.

2602
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:22,400
out we haven't actually rechecked it.
 

2603
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,910
out we haven't actually rechecked it.
It's possible they go for the recheck,

2604
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:23,920
It's possible they go for the recheck,
 

2605
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,270
It's possible they go for the recheck,
but if buyers want to really hold

2606
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,280
but if buyers want to really hold
 

2607
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,750
but if buyers want to really hold
momentum, they're going to want to bid

2608
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
momentum, they're going to want to bid
 

2609
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,230
momentum, they're going to want to bid
somewhere in here, all right, for a kind

2610
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,240
somewhere in here, all right, for a kind
 

2611
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,230
somewhere in here, all right, for a kind
of trap play like this to move back up.

2612
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,240
of trap play like this to move back up.
 

2613
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,309
of trap play like this to move back up.
If they lose this, the rotation to 50s

2614
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:34,319
If they lose this, the rotation to 50s
 

2615
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,750
If they lose this, the rotation to 50s

2778
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360

 

2779
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,750

I'm going to cut this on the runner. Out

2780
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:13,760
I'm going to cut this on the runner. Out
 

2781
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,630

01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:19,280
something nasty when we're in premium.
 

2787
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,790
something nasty when we're in premium.
But either way, made some nice smile.

Soon as I said that, the 25 bid stepped
 

2793
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:34,070
Soon as I said that, the 25 bid stepped
into 30 as soon as I cut it. Oh, you got

2803
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,750

This is like every day at the moment. To

2804
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
This is like every day at the moment. To
 

2805
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:59,669
This is like every day at the moment. To
the tick. It's knocking me to the tick.

2806
01:10:59,669 --> 01:10:59,679

 

2807
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:03,189

Oh, it's funny. It's funny.

Oh, it's funny. It's funny.
 

2809
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,270
Oh, it's funny. It's funny.
I'd be looking for 900s now. Basically

2810
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:05,280
I'd be looking for 900s now. Basically
 

2811
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,910
I'd be looking for 900s now. Basically
890 900s. I'm out of this now. It's just

2812
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:07,920
890 900s. I'm out of this now. It's just
 

2813
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,229
890 900s. I'm out of this now. It's just
[\h__\h] done me again. But I think

2814
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:10,239
[\h__\h] done me again. But I think
 

2815
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:15,990
[\h__\h] done me again. But I think
you'll get 890s 900s now.

2816
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000

 

2817
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:27,910

Oh, folks.

2818

Oh, yeah. I mean, it's fine. Like, I

2820
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:30,400
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's fine. Like, I
 

2821
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,390
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's fine. Like, I
made money. It's just annoying.

2822
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:34,400
made money. It's just annoying.
 

2823
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,830
made money. It's just annoying.
Here you go, folks. It's doing exactly

2824
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:35,840
Here you go, folks. It's doing exactly
 

2825
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,910
Here you go, folks. It's doing exactly
what exactly what I wanted. I'm not

2826
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:37,920
what exactly what I wanted. I'm not
 

2827
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,430
what exactly what I wanted. I'm not
patient enough. Not patient enough. Not

01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:41,440
patient enough. Not patient enough. Not
 

2829
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,950
patient enough. Not patient enough. Not
giving it enough room. All right.

2830
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:42,960
giving it enough room. All right.
 

2831
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,470
giving it enough room. All right.
Remember, stops are at high day. Once

2832
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:44,480
Remember, stops are at high day. Once
 

2833
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,910
Remember, stops are at high day. Once
you poke through here, we should come

2834
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:45,920
you poke through here, we should come
 

2835
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,430
you poke through here, we should come
ripping up into here. Now, this is

2836
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
ripping up into here. Now, this is
 

2837
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,910
ripping up into here. Now, this is
exactly what we did. You can rewind when

2838
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
exactly what we did. You can rewind when
 

2839
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,590
exactly what we did. You can rewind when
when we were here. We talked about this

2840
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:51,600
when we were here. We talked about this
 

2841
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,790
when we were here. We talked about this
move down into here, setting the trap.

2842
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:54,800
move down into here, setting the trap.
 

2843
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,430
move down into here, setting the trap.

can probably show you it here. If we go

2848
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
can probably show you it here. If we go
 

2849
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,870
can probably show you it here. If we go
to a one minute,

2850
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
to a one minute,
 

2851
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,149
to a one minute,
right, sellers got caught under 17s

2852

right, sellers got caught under 17s
 

2853
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,470

All right, sellers got caught here
 

2857
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,510
All right, sellers got caught here
and especially here. And once we

2858
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
and especially here. And once we
 

2859
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,669
and especially here. And once we
reclaimed that, I should have just moved

2860
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
reclaimed that, I should have just moved
 

2861
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,310
reclaimed that, I should have just moved
my stop into this imbalance.

2862
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:18,320
my stop into this imbalance.
 

2863
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,550
my stop into this imbalance.
Anyway, here we go, folks. You're almost

2864
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:20,560
Anyway, here we go, folks. You're almost
 

2865
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,030
Anyway, here we go, folks. You're almost
there. 8.90 is your stop is your stop is

2866
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,040
there. 8.90 is your stop is your stop is
 

2867
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:30,870
there. 8.90 is your stop is your stop is
your target now.

2868
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880

 

2869
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,950

It feels personal. Yeah, it does. It

2870
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:32,960
It feels personal. Yeah, it does. It
 

2871
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,510
It feels personal. Yeah, it does. It
does. To be honest, it's just poor

2872
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,520
does. To be honest, it's just poor
 

2873
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,070
does. To be honest, it's just poor
trading for me if I'm honest. I probably

2874
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:38,080
trading for me if I'm honest. I probably
 

2875
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,430
trading for me if I'm honest. I probably
just should have given that a bit more

2876
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
just should have given that a bit more
 

2877
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,669
just should have given that a bit more
room. Uh I just didn't want to get

2878
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:41,679
room. Uh I just didn't want to get
 

2879
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,750
room. Uh I just didn't want to get
caught cuz they failed there three

2880
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:43,760
caught cuz they failed there three
 

2881
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,470
caught cuz they failed there three
times. I wanted them to hold value here

2882
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:48,480
times. I wanted them to hold value here
 

2883
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,229
times. I wanted them to hold value here
uh for that rotation. I didn't want to

2884
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:50,239
uh for that rotation. I didn't want to
 

2885
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,830
uh for that rotation. I didn't want to
get caught if they flushed back down

2886
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
get caught if they flushed back down
 

2887
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,470
get caught if they flushed back down
here in a horrible stop run. But um

2888
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
here in a horrible stop run. But um
 

2889
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,350
here in a horrible stop run. But um
anyway, whatever. It's fine. Hopefully

2890
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
anyway, whatever. It's fine. Hopefully
 

2891
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,630
anyway, whatever. It's fine. Hopefully
you guys are all in it. As long as you

2892
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:58,640
you guys are all in it. As long as you
 

2893
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,910
you guys are all in it. As long as you
guys make money, that's all that

2894
01:12:59,910 --> 01:12:59,920
guys make money, that's all that
 

2895
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,870
guys make money, that's all that
matters.

2896
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
matters.
 

2897
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,430
matters.
So 890s is is the target for you guys.

2898
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:05,440
So 890s is is the target for you guys.
 

2899
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,910
So 890s is is the target for you guys.
All right, 890s. 890 is 900. We've got

2900
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:07,920
All right, 890s. 890 is 900. We've got
 

2901
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,430
All right, 890s. 890 is 900. We've got
liquidity up there. There was a guy at

2902
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:09,440
liquidity up there. There was a guy at
 

2903
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,950
liquidity up there. There was a guy at
900. Let's have a look if he's still

2904
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:10,960
900. Let's have a look if he's still
 

2905
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,110
900. Let's have a look if he's still
there. He is still there. 100 lot just

2906
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,120
there. He is still there. 100 lot just
 

2907
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,550
there. He is still there. 100 lot just
sat there all day. In fact, he's added

2908
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
sat there all day. In fact, he's added
 

2909
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,430
sat there all day. In fact, he's added
some size on in the last minute. So you

2910
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:17,440
some size on in the last minute. So you
 

2911
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,270
some size on in the last minute. So you
can look for that this move. Red box is

2912
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
can look for that this move. Red box is
 

2913
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,709
can look for that this move. Red box is
the start of where we thicken up.

2914
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:20,719
the start of where we thicken up.
 

2915
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,470
the start of where we thicken up.
Remember this dates back. This is the

2916
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:22,480
Remember this dates back. This is the
 

2917
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,189
Remember this dates back. This is the
naked point of control dating back to

2918
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:25,199
naked point of control dating back to
 

2919
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,590
naked point of control dating back to
the week of Monday the 12th of Jan. All

2920
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:27,600

2921
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,030

2925
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,189
We've never tagged it before. Right into
the red line will be that weekly PC.

01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:33,199
the red line will be that weekly PC.
 

2927
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,390

This is where we're trying to get, but

but I think you will get it. You must
take some profit into this, right?

rather than just saying I'm long here
 

3017
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,950
rather than just saying I'm long here
because it's a flag or some [\h__\h]

because it's a flag or some [\h__\h]

because it's a flag or some [\h__\h]
like that. All right, not that flags

don't work. They do, but you got to

3022
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
don't work. They do, but you got to
 

3023
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,709
don't work. They do, but you got to
understand premise of why, right? what

01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719
understand premise of why, right? what
 

3025
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,910

we're trying to do.

3026
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:17,920
we're trying to do.
 

3027
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,510
we're trying to do.
Here we go. Beautiful, beautiful,

3028
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:19,520
Here we go. Beautiful, beautiful,
 

3029
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,990
Here we go. Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful moves.

3030
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:22,000
beautiful moves.
 

3031
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,510
beautiful moves.
So, there you go. Getting stuck right

3032
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:23,520
So, there you go. Getting stuck right
 

3033
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,870
So, there you go. Getting stuck right
into that level, aren't we? Right into

3034
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
into that level, aren't we? Right into
 

3035
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,790
into that level, aren't we? Right into
the naked point of control. So, you

3036
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
the naked point of control. So, you
 

3037
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,229
the naked point of control. So, you
should have taken some profit into this

3038
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:28,239
should have taken some profit into this
 

3039
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,750
should have taken some profit into this
red line. There's a reason there's a red

3040
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:29,760
red line. There's a reason there's a red
 

3041
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,430
red line. There's a reason there's a red
line there. It's not just random on the

3042
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:31,440
line there. It's not just random on the
 

3043
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,910
line there. It's not just random on the
chart. All right? It is a very, very

3044
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:33,920
chart. All right? It is a very, very
 

3045
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,189
chart. All right? It is a very, very
thick area. And if we lift through this

3046
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:37,199
thick area. And if we lift through this
 

3047
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,030
thick area. And if we lift through this
red box now, I will tell you if we lift

3048
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
red box now, I will tell you if we lift
 

3049
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,350
red box now, I will tell you if we lift
through this and we base above, then we

3050
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:41,360
through this and we base above, then we
 

3051
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,430
through this and we base above, then we
can look for these targets here. I'll

3052
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:43,440
can look for these targets here. I'll
 

3053
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,950
can look for these targets here. I'll
thicken this up a little bit and make

3054
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:44,960
thicken this up a little bit and make
 

3055
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,350
thicken this up a little bit and make
sure we've got it

3056
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,360
sure we've got it
 

3057
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,030
sure we've got it
right. Where are all the stops? These

3058
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:49,040
right. Where are all the stops? These
 

3059
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,430
right. Where are all the stops? These
are the next lot of stops up into here

3060
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:51,440
are the next lot of stops up into here
 

3061
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,270
are the next lot of stops up into here
into this gray box. So, if we lift

3062
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
into this gray box. So, if we lift
 

3063
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,590
into this gray box. So, if we lift
through this, it very well might be that

3064
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
through this, it very well might be that
 

3065
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,470
through this, it very well might be that
you get 950 today. If you get over 950,

3066
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480
you get 950 today. If you get over 950,
 

3067
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,990
you get 950 today. If you get over 950,
well, we can't rule out 26,5.

3068

well, we can't rule out 26,5.
But, you know, we will see, won't we,

3095
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,990
Breaking out of this range, right? Maybe
maybe it pulls back into here. But why

It's uh it should be $6.99, but I don't

It's uh it should be $6.99, but I don't

3151
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,270

Can you go over your daily value area

3152
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:01,280
Can you go over your daily value area
 

3153
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,430
Can you go over your daily value area

Um, just 70% of previous days volume,

Um, just 70% of previous days volume,
 

3157

Um, just 70% of previous days volume,
but I'm always looking at the New York

3158
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:08,640
but I'm always looking at the New York
 

3159
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,149
but I'm always looking at the New York
session, right? Don't really care about

3160
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:10,159
session, right? Don't really care about
 

3161
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:32,870
session, right? Don't really care about
overnight.

3162
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880

 

3163
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,790

Can I summarize that into rule? Yeah.

3164
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:34,800
Can I summarize that into rule? Yeah.
 

3165
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,030
Can I summarize that into rule? Yeah.
Don't guess tops, don't guess bottoms.

3166

The main thing where people go wrong,

3168
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:38,719
The main thing where people go wrong,
 

3169
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,990
The main thing where people go wrong,
right, is they they they they see an

3170
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
right, is they they they they see an
 

3171
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,990
right, is they they they they see an
area of interest here, right? And may

3172
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:44,000
area of interest here, right? And may
 

3173
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,390
area of interest here, right? And may
maybe this pulls back to here and maybe

3174
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:46,400
maybe this pulls back to here and maybe
 

3175
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,189
maybe this pulls back to here and maybe
it does that. But why play this move

3176
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:49,199
it does that. But why play this move
 

3177
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,470
it does that. But why play this move
here if the main time frame wants to do

3178
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:52,480
here if the main time frame wants to do
 

3179
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,149
here if the main time frame wants to do
this move here, right? So

3180
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
this move here, right? So
 

3181
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,030
this move here, right? So
if you lose this, then maybe you can

3182
01:18:59,030 --> 01:18:59,040
if you lose this, then maybe you can
 

3183
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,229
if you lose this, then maybe you can
think about short. If we're going to

3184
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239
think about short. If we're going to
 

3185
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,990
think about short. If we're going to
lose all of this, then then you can

3186
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
lose all of this, then then you can
 

3187
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,910
lose all of this, then then you can
think about the rotation. But why bother

3188
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:03,920
think about the rotation. But why bother
 

3189
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,990
think about the rotation. But why bother
up here? You will become liquidity.

3190
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,000
up here? You will become liquidity.
 

3191
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,430
up here? You will become liquidity.
Think about how many people saying, "Oh,

3192
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:07,440
Think about how many people saying, "Oh,
 

3193
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,870
Think about how many people saying, "Oh,
this has gone too far. This has to come

3194
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:08,880
this has gone too far. This has to come
 

3195
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,390
this has gone too far. This has to come
down." What what if it doesn't come

3196
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:10,400
down." What what if it doesn't come
 

3197
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,390
down." What what if it doesn't come
down? What if everyone gets short here

3198
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:12,400
down? What if everyone gets short here
 

3199
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,750
down? What if everyone gets short here
and they all put their stop at higher

3200
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:13,760
and they all put their stop at higher
 

3201
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,910
and they all put their stop at higher
day? What then happens when they mark it

3202
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
day? What then happens when they mark it
 

3203
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,910
day? What then happens when they mark it
out? Where's the structure here? What

3204
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
out? Where's the structure here? What
 

3205
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,669
out? Where's the structure here? What
here is telling you to go short? Unless

3206
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
here is telling you to go short? Unless
 

3207
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,750
here is telling you to go short? Unless
we build out volume here and we leave

3208
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
we build out volume here and we leave
 

3209
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,430
we build out volume here and we leave
volume and even that it would just be a

3210
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
volume and even that it would just be a
 

3211
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,270
volume and even that it would just be a
counter trend down. So, you'd be trading

3212
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:25,280
counter trend down. So, you'd be trading
 

3213
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,550
counter trend down. So, you'd be trading
from 76s to maybe 50. So, it's just not

3214
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:28,560
from 76s to maybe 50. So, it's just not
 

3215
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,110
from 76s to maybe 50. So, it's just not
worth it. It's not worth it, folks.

3216
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120

 

3217
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,470

Do I have a discount code for the

3218
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:34,480
Do I have a discount code for the

covered in that course. 20 hours. It's
 

3227
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,430
covered in that course. 20 hours. It's
it's quite efficient. It's a lot to go

3228
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:49,440
it's quite efficient. It's a lot to go
 

3229
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,149
it's quite efficient. It's a lot to go

Like I said, it might be that they come
 

3233
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,550
Like I said, it might be that they come
back and back test some of this. Now,

3234
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
back and back test some of this. Now,
 

3235
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,310
back and back test some of this. Now,
we can have a look at that high day.

3236
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:58,320
we can have a look at that high day.
 

3237
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,030
we can have a look at that high day.
What was left at hive day?

3238
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:01,040

3239
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,350
What was left at hive day?
Not much of an auction up there. Uh, and

3240
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
Not much of an auction up there. Uh, and
 

3241
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,950
Not much of an auction up there. Uh, and
you can see this imbalance starting to

3242
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:04,960
you can see this imbalance starting to
 

3243
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,870
you can see this imbalance starting to
be bid on again. So, I'm not convinced

3244
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:06,880
be bid on again. So, I'm not convinced
 

3245
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:19,910
be bid on again. So, I'm not convinced
high day is in yet, but we will see.

3365
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,910
I can hold the runner on a rebid if it
keeps going. But I also have to be open

3366

short's working. The short is back down

3372
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:00,719
short's working. The short is back down
 

3373
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,110
short's working. The short is back down
into here. All right, I wouldn't trade

3374
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,120
into here. All right, I wouldn't trade
 

3375
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,790
into here. All right, I wouldn't trade
this. It's counter trend. We they can

3376
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:04,800
this. It's counter trend. We they can
 

3377
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,590
this. It's counter trend. We they can
still bid this up, right? But if you let

3378
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:07,600
still bid this up, right? But if you let
 

3379
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,750
still bid this up, right? But if you let
go of this, there is your safer

3380
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:09,760
go of this, there is your safer
 

3381
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,870
go of this, there is your safer
rotation. If we trap bulls over this,

3382
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:12,880
rotation. If we trap bulls over this,
 

3383
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,790
rotation. If we trap bulls over this,
this is your safer rotation back down

3384
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:14,800
this is your safer rotation back down
 

3385
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,310
this is your safer rotation back down
into the edge. If they let go of 750,

3386
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:18,320
into the edge. If they let go of 750,
 

3387
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,270
into the edge. If they let go of 750,
there's a trade back down into 700s,

3388
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:21,280
there's a trade back down into 700s,
 

3389
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,790
there's a trade back down into 700s,
then 650, then 550, and we get much more

3390
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:24,800
then 650, then 550, and we get much more
 

3391
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,950
then 650, then 550, and we get much more
bearish under 550. All right, so

3392
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:26,960
bearish under 550. All right, so
 

3393
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,790
bearish under 550. All right, so
remember 750 to 550 is a rotation. What

3394
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:30,800
remember 750 to 550 is a rotation. What
 

3395
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,030
remember 750 to 550 is a rotation. What
that means is everything over 750 is

3396
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:33,040
that means is everything over 750 is
 

3397
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,110
that means is everything over 750 is
technically bullish. All right, so you

3398
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:35,120
technically bullish. All right, so you
 

3399
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,149
technically bullish. All right, so you
can do this whole move back down. All

3400
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
can do this whole move back down. All
 

3401
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,870
can do this whole move back down. All
right, but that would be counter trend

3402
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:40,880
right, but that would be counter trend
 

3403
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,350
right, but that would be counter trend
because technically they can rebid that

3404
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,360
because technically they can rebid that
 

3405
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,110
because technically they can rebid that
up. That means you can take a counter

3406
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,120
up. That means you can take a counter
 

3407
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:49,830
up. That means you can take a counter
trend short under 800s 2750 if they trap

3408
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
trend short under 800s 2750 if they trap
 

3409
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,149
trend short under 800s 2750 if they trap
buyers. I wouldn't be short before that.

3410
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:52,159
buyers. I wouldn't be short before that.
 

3411
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,390
buyers. I wouldn't be short before that.
There's your pivot pivot to here. All

3412
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:54,400
There's your pivot pivot to here. All
 

3413
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,629
There's your pivot pivot to here. All
right, this is a pullback. It can hold.

3414
01:23:56,629 --> 01:23:56,639
right, this is a pullback. It can hold.
 

3415
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,270
right, this is a pullback. It can hold.
If they lose this, there's a short here.

3416
01:23:59,270 --> 01:23:59,280
If they lose this, there's a short here.
 

3417
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,149
If they lose this, there's a short here.
If they lose 750, then you can trade. If

3418
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:02,159
If they lose 750, then you can trade. If
 

3419
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,430
If they lose 750, then you can trade. If
you really want to trade inside the

3420
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:03,440
you really want to trade inside the
 

3421
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,669
you really want to trade inside the
range, you can trade 750 to 550. I'm

3422
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:05,679
range, you can trade 750 to 550. I'm
 

3423
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,350
range, you can trade 750 to 550. I'm
going to avoid this week as much as

3424
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
going to avoid this week as much as
 

3425
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,550
going to avoid this week as much as
possible 550 to 7450. I really don't

3426
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
possible 550 to 7450. I really don't
 

3427
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,910
possible 550 to 7450. I really don't
want to trade in here. So, I would like

3428
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:11,920
want to trade in here. So, I would like
 

3429
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,229
want to trade in here. So, I would like
bulls to be above this and I'd like

3430
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
bulls to be above this and I'd like
 

3431
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,790
bulls to be above this and I'd like
bears to be below this. I will trade

3432
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:16,800
bears to be below this. I will trade
 

3433
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,390
bears to be below this. I will trade
failed breakouts back inside and I will

3434
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:20,400
failed breakouts back inside and I will
 

3435
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,149
failed breakouts back inside and I will
trade

3436
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159
trade
 

3437
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,790
trade
failed breakouts back down, but I will

3438
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
failed breakouts back down, but I will
 

3439
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,149
failed breakouts back down, but I will
not enter inside that range or do my

3440
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:28,159
not enter inside that range or do my
 

3441
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,870
not enter inside that range or do my
best not to.

3442
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:30,880
best not to.
 

3443
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,110
best not to.
If that doesn't make sense to you, um

3444
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:33,120
If that doesn't make sense to you, um
 

3445
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,629
If that doesn't make sense to you, um
I've probably got some stuff for free on

01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:34,639
I've probably got some stuff for free on

3463

Shoulders held. Gave good clean moves

3480
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:12,880
Shoulders held. Gave good clean moves
 

3481
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,310
Shoulders held. Gave good clean moves
off the edges. Have a great day. And

3482
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:14,320
off the edges. Have a great day. And
 

3483
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,870
off the edges. Have a great day. And
you, Rob, nice work. Looking short here

3484
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:16,880
you, Rob, nice work. Looking short here
 

3485
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,990
you, Rob, nice work. Looking short here
would be high risk, lowreward.

3486
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,000
would be high risk, lowreward.
 

3487
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,229
would be high risk, lowreward.
Uh, it'd be a high risk, high reward if

3488
01:25:22,229 --> 01:25:22,239
Uh, it'd be a high risk, high reward if
 

3489
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:23,669
Uh, it'd be a high risk, high reward if
it worked. I mean, it's probably only

3490
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:23,679
it worked. I mean, it's probably only
 

3491
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:26,149
it worked. I mean, it's probably only
low reward, but like, you know, if you

3492
01:25:26,149 --> 01:25:26,159
low reward, but like, you know, if you
 

3493
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:29,350
low reward, but like, you know, if you
were short here and you got lucky, you'd

3494
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
were short here and you got lucky, you'd
 

3495
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,030
were short here and you got lucky, you'd
get down into this. If you got really

3496
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040
get down into this. If you got really
 

3497
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,030
get down into this. If you got really
lucky, you'd get down lower. But there's

3498
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:33,040
lucky, you'd get down lower. But there's
 

3499
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,470
lucky, you'd get down lower. But there's
nothing to say it's going to do that for

3500
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
nothing to say it's going to do that for
 

3501
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,590
nothing to say it's going to do that for
me. Look at this. This here is what's

3502
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
me. Look at this. This here is what's
 

3503
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,550
me. Look at this. This here is what's
key, right? This is what's key now for

3504
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
key, right? This is what's key now for
 

3505
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,790
key, right? This is what's key now for
the day, right? Do we trade underneath

3506
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:42,800
the day, right? Do we trade underneath
 

3507
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:52,149
the day, right? Do we trade underneath
that or do we hold that and go again?

3508
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:52,159

 

3509
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:55,189

What levels do I have past 26k?

3510
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:55,199
What levels do I have past 26k?
 

3511
01:25:55,199 --> 01:26:01,270
What levels do I have past 26k?
Let's have a look

3512
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:01,280

 

3513
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,270

this chart right here, guys. All right.

3514
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:03,280
this chart right here, guys. All right.
 

3515
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:08,310
this chart right here, guys. All right.
So this move here will be sort of into 9

3516
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:08,320
So this move here will be sort of into 9
 

3517
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:12,229
So this move here will be sort of into 9
stops at 930 to 960. The edge of it is

3518
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:12,239
stops at 930 to 960. The edge of it is
 

3519
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:15,350
stops at 930 to 960. The edge of it is
actually at 26,000

3520
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,360
actually at 26,000
 

3521
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,550
actually at 26,000
and let's just call it 20. And then

3522
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560
and let's just call it 20. And then
 

3523
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,830
and let's just call it 20. And then
stops here, let's just move this up are

3524
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:21,840
stops here, let's just move this up are
 

3525
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,229
stops here, let's just move this up are
into 26,045.

3526
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
into 26,045.
 

3527
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,629
into 26,045.
And then we have a ton of stops above

3528
01:26:26,629 --> 01:26:26,639
And then we have a ton of stops above
 

3529
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:28,709
And then we have a ton of stops above
here into 100. So if we think about this

3530
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:28,719
here into 100. So if we think about this
 

3531
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,310
here into 100. So if we think about this
move here, all right, if we just pull

3532
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:30,320
move here, all right, if we just pull
 

3533
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,510
move here, all right, if we just pull
this back, right, this is where if we

3534
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:33,520
this back, right, this is where if we
 

3535
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,590
this back, right, this is where if we
talk about a range, a bigger range, all

3536
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:35,600
talk about a range, a bigger range, all
 

3537
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,149
talk about a range, a bigger range, all
right, a bigger range,

3538
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:38,159
right, a bigger range,
 

3539
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:41,669
right, a bigger range,
the big range in this market right now

3540
01:26:41,669 --> 01:26:41,679
the big range in this market right now
 

3541
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,590
the big range in this market right now
is here.

3542
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:43,600
is here.
 

3543
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,590
is here.
All right. If we think about from

3544
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,600
All right. If we think about from
 

3545
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,030
All right. If we think about from
November, right, November, bottom side

3553
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,470

01:26:58,470 --> 01:26:58,480
fail, reclaim the range, held the dip,

01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:14,159
reversion. Right? Does that make sense
 

3569
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,470
reversion. Right? Does that make sense
to you? Here's your middle. Right? Look

3570
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
to you? Here's your middle. Right? Look
 

3571
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,910
to you? Here's your middle. Right? Look
how much we're trading around this core

3572
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:17,920
how much we're trading around this core
 

3573
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,629
how much we're trading around this core
of the middle. Right? We can't get under

3574
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:20,639
of the middle. Right? We can't get under
 

3575
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,910
of the middle. Right? We can't get under
and we can't get over. So over 26,000.

3576
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:23,920
and we can't get over. So over 26,000.
 

3577
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,669
and we can't get over. So over 26,000.
What we looking for? Basically 120s,

3578
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:25,679
What we looking for? Basically 120s,
 

3579
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:29,110
What we looking for? Basically 120s,
150s. If they do this, I can tell you

3580
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:29,120
150s. If they do this, I can tell you
 

3581
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,709
150s. If they do this, I can tell you
massive all-time highs are likely to

3582
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:30,719
massive all-time highs are likely to
 

3583
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,310
massive all-time highs are likely to
happen unless they do a very quick look

3584
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:32,320
happen unless they do a very quick look
 

3585
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,189
happen unless they do a very quick look
and a huge flush. But if they base over

3586
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:35,199
and a huge flush. But if they base over
 

3587
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,790
and a huge flush. But if they base over
all these stops, think about all these

3588
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:36,800
all these stops, think about all these
 

3589
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,629
all these stops, think about all these
stops from November, November, December,

3590
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
stops from November, November, December,
 

3591
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,910
stops from November, November, December,
December, January, January, January. If

3592
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:43,920
December, January, January, January. If
 

3593
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,110
December, January, January, January. If
they do this, think about how much

3594
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,120
they do this, think about how much
 

3595
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,669
they do this, think about how much
liquidity is in here. All right, how

3596
01:27:49,669 --> 01:27:49,679
liquidity is in here. All right, how
 

3597
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:51,750
liquidity is in here. All right, how
much liquidity is in here? We will

3598
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:51,760
much liquidity is in here? We will
 

3599
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,750
much liquidity is in here? We will
absolutely rip faces. All right, the

3600
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:53,760
absolutely rip faces. All right, the
 

3601
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,270
absolutely rip faces. All right, the
same thing. If they look above and then

3602
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:55,280
same thing. If they look above and then
 

3603
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,110
same thing. If they look above and then
they fail under here, they will

3604
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:57,120
they fail under here, they will
 

3605
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,350
they fail under here, they will
absolutely tank this probably back down

3606
01:27:59,350 --> 01:27:59,360
absolutely tank this probably back down
 

3607
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,430
absolutely tank this probably back down
towards the 200 day moving average. All

3608
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,440
towards the 200 day moving average. All
 

3609
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,669
towards the 200 day moving average. All
right, because we have so much liquidity

3610
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:03,679
right, because we have so much liquidity
 

3611
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,629
right, because we have so much liquidity
being built in a sideways market, right?

3612
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
being built in a sideways market, right?
 

3613
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,229
being built in a sideways market, right?
Even if you think about the beginning of

3614
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:08,239
Even if you think about the beginning of
 

3615
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:11,270
Even if you think about the beginning of
the day when we talked about um on the

3616
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
the day when we talked about um on the
 

3617
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,189
the day when we talked about um on the
daily chart,

3618
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:13,199
daily chart,
 

3619
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,750
daily chart,
we go back to the daily chart,

3620
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:15,760
we go back to the daily chart,
 

3621
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,390
we go back to the daily chart,
right? Look how tight we are getting.

3622
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:18,400
right? Look how tight we are getting.
 

3623
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,590
right? Look how tight we are getting.
You can see the edge of this range.

3624
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
You can see the edge of this range.
 

3625
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,830
You can see the edge of this range.
Basically got it drawn out. Blue box,

3626
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:21,840
Basically got it drawn out. Blue box,
 

3627
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,669
Basically got it drawn out. Blue box,
red box. Look at the Ballingers. They're

3628
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:23,679
red box. Look at the Ballingers. They're
 

3629
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,510
red box. Look at the Ballingers. They're
getting so tight. When we're healthy,

3630
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:25,520
getting so tight. When we're healthy,
 

3631
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,030
getting so tight. When we're healthy,
Ballingers are nice and wide. Now the

3632
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,040
Ballingers are nice and wide. Now the
 

3633
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,430
Ballingers are nice and wide. Now the
Ballingers are very tight. 20-day,

3634
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,440
Ballingers are very tight. 20-day,
 

3635
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,990
Ballingers are very tight. 20-day,
50-day, 5day, everything's tight here.

3636
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:32,000
50-day, 5day, everything's tight here.
 

3637
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,830
50-day, 5day, everything's tight here.
All right, so we're trading away from

3638
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:33,840
All right, so we're trading away from
 

3639
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,590
All right, so we're trading away from
the mean towards the top side. If we

3640
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:35,600
the mean towards the top side. If we
 

3641
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,750
the mean towards the top side. If we
find acceptance here, all right, and the

3642
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:37,760
find acceptance here, all right, and the
 

3643
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,149
find acceptance here, all right, and the
bulls trend up and the SMA support, then

3644
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:40,159
bulls trend up and the SMA support, then
 

3645
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:42,709
bulls trend up and the SMA support, then
we can go back to all-time highs, right?

3646
01:28:42,709 --> 01:28:42,719
we can go back to all-time highs, right?
 

3647
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,790
we can go back to all-time highs, right?
If they reject this again and we go back

3648
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
If they reject this again and we go back
 

3649
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,950
If they reject this again and we go back
into that range trade, if they get under

3650
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:46,960
into that range trade, if they get under
 

3651
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,430
into that range trade, if they get under
here, this is the flush where we can

3652
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:49,440
here, this is the flush where we can
 

3653
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,430
here, this is the flush where we can
maybe get towards this 200, which by the

3654
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:51,440
maybe get towards this 200, which by the
 

3655
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,430
maybe get towards this 200, which by the
time we do that, if we do it, it's

3656
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:53,440
time we do that, if we do it, it's
 

3657
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,189
time we do that, if we do it, it's
probably going to be very close to this

3658
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:55,199
probably going to be very close to this
 

3659
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,590
probably going to be very close to this
wick. All right. So, this is often a

3660
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
wick. All right. So, this is often a
 

3661
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,750
wick. All right. So, this is often a
higher time frame trigger long. We have

3662
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
higher time frame trigger long. We have
 

3663
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,430
higher time frame trigger long. We have
not hit that since here.

3664
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:03,440
not hit that since here.
 

3665
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,750
not hit that since here.
May 23rd. All right. June, July, August,

3666
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:07,760
May 23rd. All right. June, July, August,
 

3667
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,149
May 23rd. All right. June, July, August,
September, October, November, December,

01:29:10,149 --> 01:29:10,159
September, October, November, December,
 

3669
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:12,390
September, October, November, December,
January. It's already been 8 months. I

3670
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:12,400
January. It's already been 8 months. I
 

3671
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,990
January. It's already been 8 months. I
can't see it happening right now in the

3672
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,000
can't see it happening right now in the
 

3673
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,110
can't see it happening right now in the
next few days. So, it's probably going

3674
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:15,120
next few days. So, it's probably going
 

3675
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,950
next few days. So, it's probably going
to be 9 or 10 months before we even get

3676
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:16,960
to be 9 or 10 months before we even get
 

3677
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,110
to be 9 or 10 months before we even get
anywhere close. But, we are building out

3678
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:19,120
anywhere close. But, we are building out
 

3679
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,790
anywhere close. But, we are building out
huge amount of liquidity up here for

3680
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:20,800
huge amount of liquidity up here for
 

3681
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,390
huge amount of liquidity up here for
months and months and months and months.

3682
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,400
months and months and months and months.
 

3683
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,669
months and months and months and months.
It's really important you understand

3684
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:23,679
It's really important you understand
 

3685
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:28,709
It's really important you understand
what the market's trying to do.

3686
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719

 

3687
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,990

Okay. So,

3688
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:32,000
Okay. So,
 

3689
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,149
Okay. So,
market rejecting this. So, I'd be

3690
01:29:34,149 --> 01:29:34,159
market rejecting this. So, I'd be
 

3691
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,709
market rejecting this. So, I'd be
watching this right now.

3692
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:36,719
watching this right now.
 

3693
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,790
watching this right now.
Right. This is

3694
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:38,800
Right. This is
 

3695
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,790
Right. This is
where buyers are potentially stuck. Let

3696
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
where buyers are potentially stuck. Let
 

3697
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,669
where buyers are potentially stuck. Let
me have a look at my uh

3698
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
me have a look at my uh
 

3699
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,030
me have a look at my uh
actually dig into this.

3700
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
actually dig into this.
 

3701
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,550
actually dig into this.
Not too much to be. Buyers are stuck

3702
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,560
Not too much to be. Buyers are stuck
 

3703
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,390
Not too much to be. Buyers are stuck
over 80, but lots of sellers are caught

3704
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:50,400
over 80, but lots of sellers are caught
 

3705
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,270
over 80, but lots of sellers are caught
up there at 75. We are still absorbing.

3706
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:53,280
up there at 75. We are still absorbing.
 

3707
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,950
up there at 75. We are still absorbing.
Like I said, I would not really feel

3708
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,960
Like I said, I would not really feel
 

3709
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,390
Like I said, I would not really feel
comfortable about short unless we get

3710
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:56,400
comfortable about short unless we get
 

3711
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,390
comfortable about short unless we get
under all of this. All right, for me,

3712
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:58,400
under all of this. All right, for me,
 

3713
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,629
under all of this. All right, for me,
this is bullish volume being built out

3714
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:00,639
this is bullish volume being built out
 

3715
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:02,229
this is bullish volume being built out
and the narrative is to still to go

3716
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:02,239
and the narrative is to still to go
 

3717
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:03,910
and the narrative is to still to go
higher. I'm out of this position, right?

3718
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:03,920
higher. I'm out of this position, right?
 

3719
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,750
higher. I'm out of this position, right?
I sold into that. Once I saw that fail,

3720
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:05,760
I sold into that. Once I saw that fail,
 

3721
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,070
I sold into that. Once I saw that fail,
I sold into that. Low hanging fruits

3722
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,080
I sold into that. Low hanging fruits
 

3723
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,590
I sold into that. Low hanging fruits
have hit, but I would still be bullish

3724
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:09,600
have hit, but I would still be bullish
 

3725
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,030
have hit, but I would still be bullish
in this market. There's no reason to

3726
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,040
in this market. There's no reason to
 

3727
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,870
in this market. There's no reason to
trade lower right now. All right, zoom

3728
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:12,880
trade lower right now. All right, zoom
 

3729
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,550
trade lower right now. All right, zoom
out. No reason to trade lower. Like I

3730
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
out. No reason to trade lower. Like I
 

3731
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,629
out. No reason to trade lower. Like I
said, you when one of you asked about

3732
01:30:16,629 --> 01:30:16,639
said, you when one of you asked about
 

3733
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,390
said, you when one of you asked about
the short, I said I wouldn't do it. It

3734
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:18,400
the short, I said I wouldn't do it. It
 

3735
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,669
the short, I said I wouldn't do it. It
might come to here to here, but they

3736
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
might come to here to here, but they
 

3737
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:20,950
might come to here to here, but they
will probably rebid it. Well, what have

3738
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:20,960
will probably rebid it. Well, what have
 

3739
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,669
will probably rebid it. Well, what have
we seen? A rebid. Why? volume. All

3740
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:23,679
we seen? A rebid. Why? volume. All
 

3741
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,229
we seen? A rebid. Why? volume. All
right. Volume. All right. So, think

3742
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:26,239
right. Volume. All right. So, think
 

3743
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:30,070
right. Volume. All right. So, think
about if you're going to draw this out.

3744
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:30,080
about if you're going to draw this out.
 

3745
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,510
about if you're going to draw this out.
Is there any breaker structure here? Is

3746
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:31,520
Is there any breaker structure here? Is
 

3747
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,110
Is there any breaker structure here? Is
there any change of character? No. So,

3748
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:33,120
there any change of character? No. So,
 

3749
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,350
there any change of character? No. So,
what we assuming higher prices? We're

3750
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:35,360
what we assuming higher prices? We're
 

3751
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:39,270
what we assuming higher prices? We're
assuming higher prices.

3752
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:39,280
assuming higher prices.
 

3753
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,270
assuming higher prices.
The only key level now is this little

3754
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:41,280
The only key level now is this little
 

3755
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,229
The only key level now is this little
shelf right here. This is sentiment

3756
01:30:44,229 --> 01:30:44,239
shelf right here. This is sentiment
 

3757
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,310
shelf right here. This is sentiment
right now for if there's a resqueeze,

3758
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:46,320
right now for if there's a resqueeze,
 

3759
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,030
right now for if there's a resqueeze,
which they're going to try and do. Okay.

3760
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:49,040
which they're going to try and do. Okay.
 

3761
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,709
which they're going to try and do. Okay.
So hopefully those of you who are

3762
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:50,719
So hopefully those of you who are
 

3763
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:52,470
So hopefully those of you who are
looking short, hopefully I've kept you

3764
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480
looking short, hopefully I've kept you
 

3765
01:30:52,480 --> 01:31:01,270
looking short, hopefully I've kept you
out of it.

3766
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:01,280

 

3767
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,270

Hey Alex, still working my way through

3768
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:03,280
Hey Alex, still working my way through
 

3769
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,270
Hey Alex, still working my way through
the course. Question for you. That may

3770
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:05,280
the course. Question for you. That may
 

3771
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,110
the course. Question for you. That may
be your answer as you finish up, but do

3772
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:07,120
be your answer as you finish up, but do
 

3773
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,950
be your answer as you finish up, but do
you have any volume minimums that you

3774
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:08,960
you have any volume minimums that you
 

3775
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,470
you have any volume minimums that you
look at to keep an eye out for the

3776
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:10,480
look at to keep an eye out for the
 

3777
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,510
look at to keep an eye out for the
market? No. Uh, not really. But what I'm

3778
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:13,520
market? No. Uh, not really. But what I'm
 

3779
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,590
market? No. Uh, not really. But what I'm
looking for is outliers, right? So what

3780
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:15,600
looking for is outliers, right? So what
 

3781
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,189
looking for is outliers, right? So what
I'm always looking for is outliers. I

3782
01:31:17,189 --> 01:31:17,199
I'm always looking for is outliers. I
 

3783
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:18,709
I'm always looking for is outliers. I
don't really care about the the the

3784
01:31:18,709 --> 01:31:18,719
don't really care about the the the
 

3785
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,870
don't really care about the the the
small intricate volumes, but like if I'm

3786
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:20,880
small intricate volumes, but like if I'm
 

3787
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,390
small intricate volumes, but like if I'm
looking for someone stuck, I'm looking

3788
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:22,400
looking for someone stuck, I'm looking
 

3789
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,950
looking for someone stuck, I'm looking
for them to be stuck as an outlier. So

3790
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:24,960
for them to be stuck as an outlier. So
 

3791
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,110
for them to be stuck as an outlier. So
like on the delta,

3792
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:27,120
like on the delta,
 

3793
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,390
like on the delta,
right, I'd be looking for them to be

3794
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,400
right, I'd be looking for them to be
 

3795
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,470
right, I'd be looking for them to be
stuck here. So if we zoom up right now,

3796
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:30,480
stuck here. So if we zoom up right now,
 

3797
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,110
stuck here. So if we zoom up right now,
there's nothing like huge out of place,

3798
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:33,120
there's nothing like huge out of place,
 

3799
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,790
there's nothing like huge out of place,
but maybe if we go downside, we might

3800
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:34,800
but maybe if we go downside, we might
 

3801
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,790
but maybe if we go downside, we might
see some players of bigger size that are

3802
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:36,800
see some players of bigger size that are
 

3803
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,470
see some players of bigger size that are
stuck. So we can see buyers stepped in

3804
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:38,480
stuck. So we can see buyers stepped in
 

3805
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,990
stuck. So we can see buyers stepped in
here. Here we go. So sellers are stuck

3806
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,000
here. Here we go. So sellers are stuck
 

3807
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,669
here. Here we go. So sellers are stuck
here from 57. So I know 57s and 56s is a

3808
01:31:43,669 --> 01:31:43,679
here from 57. So I know 57s and 56s is a
 

3809
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,350
here from 57. So I know 57s and 56s is a
big level where sellers got stuck,

3810
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:45,360
big level where sellers got stuck,
 

3811
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,750
big level where sellers got stuck,
right? So, I'm looking for outliers the

3812
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:47,760
right? So, I'm looking for outliers the
 

3813
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,149
right? So, I'm looking for outliers the
wrong side of the tape. And you can

3814
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:50,159
wrong side of the tape. And you can
 

3815
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:53,110
wrong side of the tape. And you can
either use the DOM to do that or you can

3816
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:53,120
either use the DOM to do that or you can
 

3817
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,870
either use the DOM to do that or you can
use footprint or you can use bookmap,

3818
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:54,880
use footprint or you can use bookmap,
 

3819
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,390
use footprint or you can use bookmap,
whatever you're comfortable with. I'm

3820
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:56,400
whatever you're comfortable with. I'm
 

3821
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,310
whatever you're comfortable with. I'm
I'm looking for bigger lot sizes

3822
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:58,320

comes from higher time frame and then we
 

3909
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,709
comes from higher time frame and then we
join based on what I'm seeing on lower

a 50k account you do not need more than

3982
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:48,960
a 50k account you do not need more than
 

3983
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,110
a 50k account you do not need more than
that not in this market when we're

3984
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:51,120
that not in this market when we're
 

3985
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,629
that not in this market when we're
getting 100 plus points point moves

3986
01:35:52,629 --> 01:35:52,639
getting 100 plus points point moves
 

3987
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:54,629
getting 100 plus points point moves
numerous times a day and if you go up in

3988
01:35:54,629 --> 01:35:54,639
numerous times a day and if you go up in
 

3989
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:56,629
numerous times a day and if you go up in
account size or you start to get above

3990
01:35:56,629 --> 01:35:56,639
account size or you start to get above
 

3991
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,629
account size or you start to get above
your buffer then you can start moving to

3992
01:35:58,629 --> 01:35:58,639
your buffer then you can start moving to
 

3993
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:01,270
your buffer then you can start moving to
five to six to 7 to 1 minute mini etc

3994
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:01,280
five to six to 7 to 1 minute mini etc
 

3995
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,790
five to six to 7 to 1 minute mini etc
etc.

3996
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:02,800
etc.
 

3997
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,149
etc.
Biggest problem traders do is they

3998
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:04,159
Biggest problem traders do is they
 

3999
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:08,550
Biggest problem traders do is they
oversize too early.

4000
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:08,560

 

4001
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,390

Can I explain how I get buyers or

4002
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:10,400
Can I explain how I get buyers or
 

4003
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,950
Can I explain how I get buyers or
sellers stuck on the dom? Yeah, I use

4004
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:12,960
sellers stuck on the dom? Yeah, I use
 

4005
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,990
sellers stuck on the dom? Yeah, I use
delta. So I use volume profile delta on

4006
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:16,000
delta. So I use volume profile delta on
 

4007
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,870
delta. So I use volume profile delta on
the dom. So back down. So we failed to

4008
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:18,880
the dom. So back down. So we failed to
 

4009
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,709
the dom. So back down. So we failed to
get above this green, the gray box,

4010
01:36:20,709 --> 01:36:20,719
get above this green, the gray box,
 

4011
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,709
get above this green, the gray box,
right? So this was the target. They

4012
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:22,719
right? So this was the target. They
 

4013
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,550
right? So this was the target. They
needed to get back above this. This is

4014
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:24,560
needed to get back above this. This is
 

4015
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,070
needed to get back above this. This is
why we put it in. This is where buyers

4016
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:26,080
why we put it in. This is where buyers
 

4017
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,510
why we put it in. This is where buyers
were stuck. All right, we didn't find

4018
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:27,520
were stuck. All right, we didn't find
 

4019
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,430
were stuck. All right, we didn't find
acceptance above for the resqueeze.

4020
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
acceptance above for the resqueeze.
 

4021
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,510
acceptance above for the resqueeze.
And we still have the ability buyers can

4022
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
And we still have the ability buyers can
 

4023
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,110
And we still have the ability buyers can
still try and keep bidding this, but

4024
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:35,120
still try and keep bidding this, but
 

4025
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:37,110
still try and keep bidding this, but
this is a failed breakout. Now, this is

4026
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:37,120
this is a failed breakout. Now, this is
 

4027
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,709
this is a failed breakout. Now, this is
your first attempt to move higher that's

4028
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:38,719
your first attempt to move higher that's
 

4029
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,950
your first attempt to move higher that's
failed. It might be that we do this for

4030
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:40,960
failed. It might be that we do this for
 

4031
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,669
failed. It might be that we do this for
a while. If we do this for long enough,

4032
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:43,679
a while. If we do this for long enough,
 

4033
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,830
a while. If we do this for long enough,
all right, and we let go, then we can

4034
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:45,840
all right, and we let go, then we can
 

4035
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,830
all right, and we let go, then we can
use that volume to go lower. right now

4036
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:47,840
use that volume to go lower. right now
 

4037
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,990
use that volume to go lower. right now
and technically it's still for me it's

4038
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:50,000
and technically it's still for me it's
 

4039
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,350
and technically it's still for me it's
still bullish cuz your pivot is from

4040
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:51,360
still bullish cuz your pivot is from
 

4041
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,109
still bullish cuz your pivot is from
here to here. This is internal range

4042
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
here to here. This is internal range
 

4043
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,189
here to here. This is internal range
being being built out. If we start

4044
01:36:55,189 --> 01:36:55,199
being being built out. If we start
 

4045
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:59,030
being being built out. If we start
losing this it gets more interesting.

4046
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,040
losing this it gets more interesting.
 

4047
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,790
losing this it gets more interesting.
If you're a scalper maybe is an argument

4048
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:00,800
If you're a scalper maybe is an argument
 

4049
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,270
If you're a scalper maybe is an argument
to take this to here but for me no I try

4050
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:03,280
to take this to here but for me no I try
 

4051
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:12,629
to take this to here but for me no I try
and avoid stuff like that.

4052
01:37:12,629 --> 01:37:12,639

 

4053
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:15,430

How many props? Fiff prop firms I trade

4054
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:15,440
How many props? Fiff prop firms I trade
 

4055
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,910
How many props? Fiff prop firms I trade
with at the moment. What do I use? Just

4056
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:17,920
with at the moment. What do I use? Just
 

4057
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:24,470
with at the moment. What do I use? Just
this one here on um bookmap.

4058
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:24,480

 

4059
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,950

I have a funded TPT 50k account. Should

4060
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:26,960
I have a funded TPT 50k account. Should
 

4061
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,790
I have a funded TPT 50k account. Should
I just use only one contract? You can

4062
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:28,800
I just use only one contract? You can
 

4063
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,270
I just use only one contract? You can
use like two two or three micros. Micros

4064
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:31,280
use like two two or three micros. Micros
 

4065
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,750
use like two two or three micros. Micros
though, not minis.

4066
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:33,760
though, not minis.
 

4067
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,430
though, not minis.
Just start with micros. You don't need

4068
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
Just start with micros. You don't need
 

4069
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,350
Just start with micros. You don't need
minis to start with and get above the

4070
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:37,360
minis to start with and get above the
 

4071
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:46,470
minis to start with and get above the
buffer. Build some like room.

4072
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:46,480

 

4073
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,109

ES back into its VWAP now. VIX trying to

we've already been here for what almost

4080
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,360
we've already been here for what almost
 

4081
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,590
we've already been here for what almost
probably over two hours now. 800 of you

4082
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:57,600
probably over two hours now. 800 of you
 

4083
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,590
probably over two hours now. 800 of you
live. Smash that like button. Let's get

4084
01:37:59,590 --> 01:37:59,600
live. Smash that like button. Let's get
 

4085
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,030
live. Smash that like button. Let's get
this over 500. We're going to give away

4086
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:01,040
this over 500. We're going to give away
 

4087
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,109
this over 500. We're going to give away
some Apex accounts and maybe some

4088
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:03,119
some Apex accounts and maybe some
 

4089
01:38:03,119 --> 01:40:07,430
some Apex accounts and maybe some
courses as well. Be right back.

4090
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:07,440

 

4091
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,790

Okay, so they're still rebidding this.

4092
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:10,800
Okay, so they're still rebidding this.
 

4093
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,109
Okay, so they're still rebidding this.
Same thing. Structure still bullish.

4094
01:40:13,109 --> 01:40:13,119
Same thing. Structure still bullish.
 

4095
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,830
Same thing. Structure still bullish.
Still re rebidding it. The squeeze will

4096
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840
Still re rebidding it. The squeeze will
 

4097
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,590
Still re rebidding it. The squeeze will
probably happen over 880s, but they're

4098
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,600
probably happen over 880s, but they're
 

4099
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,229
probably happen over 880s, but they're
still trying to rebid this.

4100
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:20,239
still trying to rebid this.
 

4101
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:23,590
still trying to rebid this.
Right. This is potentially can build out

4102
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:23,600
Right. This is potentially can build out
 

4103
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,270
Right. This is potentially can build out
liquidity here which can still be

4104
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,280
liquidity here which can still be
 

4105
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,950
liquidity here which can still be
bullish for this move here. Until we're

4106
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:26,960
bullish for this move here. Until we're
 

4107
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,629
bullish for this move here. Until we're
underneath this, there's no short in my

4108
01:40:28,629 --> 01:40:28,639
underneath this, there's no short in my
 

4109
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:30,149
underneath this, there's no short in my
mind. All right, made that as clear as

4110
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:30,159
mind. All right, made that as clear as
 

4111
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,310
mind. All right, made that as clear as
possible today. Very, very bullish in

4112
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,320
possible today. Very, very bullish in
 

4113
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:44,070
possible today. Very, very bullish in
structure right now.

4114
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:44,080

 

4115
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,950

Yes. 10 micros is one minute. Correct.

Hi Alex, the bar graph at the bottom of

4122
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:52,639
Hi Alex, the bar graph at the bottom of
 

4123
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:54,070
Hi Alex, the bar graph at the bottom of
your screen which is helpful for

4124
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,080
your screen which is helpful for
 

4125
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,830
your screen which is helpful for
beginner traders. If so, what indicators

4126
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:57,840
beginner traders. If so, what indicators
 

4127
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,390
beginner traders. If so, what indicators
would it fall under on top set the uh

4128
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:00,400
would it fall under on top set the uh
 

4129
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,109
would it fall under on top set the uh
this is volume. So there's two, right?

4130
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:03,119
this is volume. So there's two, right?
 

4131
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:05,270
this is volume. So there's two, right?
So this is delta.

4132
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,280
So this is delta.
 

4133
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,270
So this is delta.
All right. And this is volume. All

4134
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:07,280
All right. And this is volume. All
 

4135
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,189
All right. And this is volume. All
right. So the bottom one I don't that

4136
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:09,199
right. So the bottom one I don't that
 

4137
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,870
right. So the bottom one I don't that
would just be some type of volume

4138
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:10,880
would just be some type of volume
 

4139
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,550
would just be some type of volume
profile volume uh indicator on top step.

4140
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:14,560
profile volume uh indicator on top step.
 

4141
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,470
profile volume uh indicator on top step.
I don't know if they have delta. You I

4142
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:16,480
I don't know if they have delta. You I
 

4143
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,910
I don't know if they have delta. You I
don't trade with them. You you'd have to

4144
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:17,920
don't trade with them. You you'd have to
 

4145
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,149
don't trade with them. You you'd have to
check, but this is Delta, right?

4146
01:41:22,149 --> 01:41:22,159
check, but this is Delta, right?
 

4147
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,310
check, but this is Delta, right?
What do I use? I think you just asked

4148
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:24,320
What do I use? I think you just asked
 

4149
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,550
What do I use? I think you just asked
that a minute ago. I use the one right

4150
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:26,560
that a minute ago. I use the one right
 

4151
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,390
that a minute ago. I use the one right
above me on bookmap. Right. So, the

4152
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:28,400
above me on bookmap. Right. So, the
 

4153
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,910
above me on bookmap. Right. So, the
ladder you see on the top right hand

4154
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:29,920
ladder you see on the top right hand
 

4155
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,510
ladder you see on the top right hand
side of my screen, that's the DOM that I

4156
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:31,520
side of my screen, that's the DOM that I
 

4157
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:35,990
side of my screen, that's the DOM that I
use.

4158
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:36,000

 

4159
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,229

Alex, would you please trade GC live

4160
01:41:38,229 --> 01:41:38,239
Alex, would you please trade GC live
 

4161
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,390
Alex, would you please trade GC live
with us sometimes or record an overnight

4162
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:40,400
with us sometimes or record an overnight
 

4163
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,390
with us sometimes or record an overnight
session? It would be much appreciated.

4164
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400
session? It would be much appreciated.
 

4165
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,550
session? It would be much appreciated.
It moves about $50 on an average day,

4166
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:44,560
It moves about $50 on an average day,
 

4167
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,550
It moves about $50 on an average day,
which is about 5K on one minute. Yeah, I

4168
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:46,560
which is about 5K on one minute. Yeah, I
 

4169
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,109
which is about 5K on one minute. Yeah, I
just don't trade it. So, I mean it it's

4170
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:49,119
just don't trade it. So, I mean it it's
 

4171
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,189
just don't trade it. So, I mean it it's
all the same principles, right? The the

4172
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:51,199
all the same principles, right? The the
 

4173
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:52,870
all the same principles, right? The the
principles will be exactly the same if

4174
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:52,880
principles will be exactly the same if
 

4175
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,790
principles will be exactly the same if
we go over to GC.

4176
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:56,800

 

4177
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,709

So, I would I would trade it exactly the

4178
01:41:58,709 --> 01:41:58,719
So, I would I would trade it exactly the
 

4179
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:01,030
So, I would I would trade it exactly the
same way.

4180
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:01,040
same way.
 

4181
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:08,310
same way.
There's your 9:30 open,

4182
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:08,320

 

4183
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,709

right? So, that's your dance right now.

4184
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:10,719
right? So, that's your dance right now.
 

4185
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:12,470
right? So, that's your dance right now.
I'd be going from higher time frame. You

4186
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,480
I'd be going from higher time frame. You
 

4187
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,350
I'd be going from higher time frame. You
can see a clear pivot here. So this is

4188
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:15,360
can see a clear pivot here. So this is
 

4189
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,149
can see a clear pivot here. So this is
the low that made this high. All right,

4190
01:42:18,149 --> 01:42:18,159
the low that made this high. All right,
 

4191
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:20,310
the low that made this high. All right,
we're trading inside GlobeEx. I'd be

4192
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
we're trading inside GlobeEx. I'd be
 

4193
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,229
we're trading inside GlobeEx. I'd be
very careful about building an overnight

4194
01:42:22,229 --> 01:42:22,239
very careful about building an overnight
 

4195
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:23,830
very careful about building an overnight
range. If you start to lose this is

4196
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:23,840
range. If you start to lose this is
 

4197
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,750
range. If you start to lose this is
where it gets more interesting. And

4198
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:25,760
where it gets more interesting. And
 

4199
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,910
where it gets more interesting. And
right now inside the New York session,

4200
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:27,920
right now inside the New York session,
 

4201
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:31,109
right now inside the New York session,
you have a look below and fail of value,

4202
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:31,119
you have a look below and fail of value,
 

4203
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:32,550
you have a look below and fail of value,
right? And they're trying to bid back up

4204
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:32,560
right? And they're trying to bid back up
 

4205
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,709
right? And they're trying to bid back up
to the midpoint right here, right? And

4206
01:42:34,709 --> 01:42:34,719
to the midpoint right here, right? And
 

4207
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,310
to the midpoint right here, right? And
they find acceptance of it, they come to

4208
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,320
they find acceptance of it, they come to
 

4209
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,149
they find acceptance of it, they come to
the top side. And if we find acceptance

4210
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:38,159
the top side. And if we find acceptance
 

4211
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:39,430
the top side. And if we find acceptance
over that, then they'll come to the top

4212
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:39,440
over that, then they'll come to the top
 

4213
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,870
over that, then they'll come to the top
side of GlobeEx because they have lots

4214
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:40,880
side of GlobeEx because they have lots
 

4215
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,070
side of GlobeEx because they have lots
of stops to run. All right? is is

4216
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:44,080
of stops to run. All right? is is
 

4217
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,910
of stops to run. All right? is is
exactly the same principles. You don't

4218
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:45,920
exactly the same principles. You don't
 

4219
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,990
exactly the same principles. You don't
need me. You don't need me. You just

4220
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,000
need me. You don't need me. You just
 

4221
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,830
need me. You don't need me. You just
trade it the same way. The markets move

4222
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:49,840
trade it the same way. The markets move
 

4223
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,510
trade it the same way. The markets move
the same way. No market moves a

4224
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:51,520
the same way. No market moves a
 

4225
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,590
the same way. No market moves a
different way. We all move the same way,

4226
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:53,600
different way. We all move the same way,
 

4227
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,750
different way. We all move the same way,
right? We bid up the same way. We sell

4228
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:55,760
right? We bid up the same way. We sell
 

4229
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,990
right? We bid up the same way. We sell
off the same way. The only difference is

4230
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,000
off the same way. The only difference is
 

4231
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,149
off the same way. The only difference is
the personality of the market. Why?

4232
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:00,159
the personality of the market. Why?
 

4233
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:01,830
the personality of the market. Why?
Because that depends who's interested in

4234
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:01,840
Because that depends who's interested in
 

4235
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,030
Because that depends who's interested in
the market. So ENQ volatile, likes to

4236
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,040
the market. So ENQ volatile, likes to
 

4237
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,350
the market. So ENQ volatile, likes to
run stops, especially Alex's stops,

4238
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:07,360
run stops, especially Alex's stops,
 

4239
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,149
run stops, especially Alex's stops,
right? Likes to overextend through some

4240
01:43:10,149 --> 01:43:10,159
right? Likes to overextend through some
 

4241
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:13,030
right? Likes to overextend through some
levels a bit more. ES most this thickest

4242
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:13,040
levels a bit more. ES most this thickest
 

4243
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,709
levels a bit more. ES most this thickest
traded market in the world. So probably

4244
01:43:14,709 --> 01:43:14,719
traded market in the world. So probably
 

4245
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:16,390
traded market in the world. So probably
respects levels a bit more. So if

4246
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:16,400
respects levels a bit more. So if
 

4247
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,510
respects levels a bit more. So if
there's a shelf, it's probably going to

4248
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:17,520
there's a shelf, it's probably going to
 

4249
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,709
there's a shelf, it's probably going to
bid off that shelf. It's probably not

4250
01:43:18,709 --> 01:43:18,719
bid off that shelf. It's probably not
 

4251
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:19,910
bid off that shelf. It's probably not
going to swipe through the shelf and

4252
01:43:19,910 --> 01:43:19,920
going to swipe through the shelf and
 

4253
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:26,550
going to swipe through the shelf and
reclaim the same way as NQ does, right?

4254
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:26,560

 

4255
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,470

I passed four funded accounts and still

4256
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:28,480
I passed four funded accounts and still
 

4257
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,470
I passed four funded accounts and still
only trade two micros. Sometimes I scale

4258
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:30,480
only trade two micros. Sometimes I scale
 

4259
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,550
only trade two micros. Sometimes I scale
out three micros, but that's max. It's

4260
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:32,560
out three micros, but that's max. It's
 

4261
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,990
out three micros, but that's max. It's
all you need. Honestly, it's all you

4262
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:34,000
all you need. Honestly, it's all you
 

4263
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,629
all you need. Honestly, it's all you
need. That that's your biggest friend.

4264
01:43:36,629 --> 01:43:36,639
need. That that's your biggest friend.
 

4265
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,149
need. That that's your biggest friend.
If you move to minis and you got to do

4266
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:38,159
If you move to minis and you got to do
 

4267
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:39,510
If you move to minis and you got to do
it a when you're a very good trader and

4268
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:39,520
it a when you're a very good trader and
 

4269
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,189
it a when you're a very good trader and
very confident or b when you've built

4270
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
very confident or b when you've built
 

4271
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,709
very confident or b when you've built
the buffer. If you move to minis too

4272
01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:42,719
the buffer. If you move to minis too
 

4273
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:45,270
the buffer. If you move to minis too
early, you are a prop firm's best friend

4274
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:45,280
early, you are a prop firm's best friend
 

4275
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,189
early, you are a prop firm's best friend
because you are likely to get get caught

4276
01:43:47,189 --> 01:43:47,199
because you are likely to get get caught
 

4277
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:50,550
because you are likely to get get caught
in something.

4278
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,560

 

4279
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,910

I would actually love to trade the

4280
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:51,920
I would actually love to trade the
 

4281
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,750
I would actually love to trade the
cattle market.

4282
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:53,760
cattle market.
 

4283
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,750
cattle market.
The one I was looking at last year was

4284
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:57,760
The one I was looking at last year was
 

4285
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,430
The one I was looking at last year was
uh is it caca?

4286
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:01,440
uh is it caca?
 

4287
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:09,990
uh is it caca?
The cow.

4288
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:10,000

 

4289
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:16,310

Am I spelling it wrong?

4290
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:16,320

 

4291
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:32,070

I can't see it. Why am I being stupid?

4292
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:32,080

 

4293
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:36,709

There we go.

4294
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:36,719

 

4295
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,310

This last year because we got that

4296
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:38,320
This last year because we got that
 

4297
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,709
This last year because we got that
overextension.

4298
01:44:40,709 --> 01:44:40,719
overextension.
 

4299
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:42,550
overextension.
Look at this.

4300
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:42,560
Look at this.
 

4301
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,470
Look at this.
Back down it comes. All right. This is

4302
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:44,480
Back down it comes. All right. This is
 

4303
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,870
Back down it comes. All right. This is
what I was looking at last year. It's

4304
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:46,880
what I was looking at last year. It's
 

4305
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,629
what I was looking at last year. It's
when we had like no chocolate in the

4306
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:48,639
when we had like no chocolate in the
 

4307
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,189
when we had like no chocolate in the
world.

4308
01:44:51,189 --> 01:44:51,199
world.
 

4309
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:58,790
world.
Big old ripper.

4310
01:44:58,790 --> 01:44:58,800

 

4311
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:05,910

So [\h__\h] dumb.

4312
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:05,920

 

4313
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,830

So dumb.

4314
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:09,840

 

4315
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,550

All right, back to that gray box.

4316
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,560
All right, back to that gray box.
 

4317
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,229
All right, back to that gray box.
Edge of value on the day. If you get a

4318
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:14,239
Edge of value on the day. If you get a
 

4319
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:15,669
Edge of value on the day. If you get a
squeeze through this, the things I'd be

4320
01:45:15,669 --> 01:45:15,679
squeeze through this, the things I'd be
 

4321
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:17,669
squeeze through this, the things I'd be
considering now is still bullish, but

4322
01:45:17,669 --> 01:45:17,679
considering now is still bullish, but
 

4323
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:19,510
considering now is still bullish, but
you're coming into premium. So like if

4324
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:19,520
you're coming into premium. So like if
 

4325
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,189
you're coming into premium. So like if
you rebid this, you want to be selling

4326
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:21,199
you rebid this, you want to be selling
 

4327
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:23,270
you rebid this, you want to be selling
some into this and then holding runners

4328
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,280
some into this and then holding runners
 

4329
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,709
some into this and then holding runners
here. here. You want to see a base and

4330
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
here. here. You want to see a base and
 

4331
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:27,109
here. here. You want to see a base and
hold above it for expansion. If you're

4332
01:45:27,109 --> 01:45:27,119
hold above it for expansion. If you're
 

4333
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:28,790
hold above it for expansion. If you're
going to get that IB rotation, then

4334
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:28,800
going to get that IB rotation, then
 

4335
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,629
going to get that IB rotation, then
you're going to see that failed break

4336
01:45:30,629 --> 01:45:30,639
you're going to see that failed break
 

4337
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:32,229
you're going to see that failed break
and then come back inside. And if you're

4338
01:45:32,229 --> 01:45:32,239
and then come back inside. And if you're
 

4339
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:34,229
and then come back inside. And if you're
going to play the IB trade specifically,

4340
01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:34,239
going to play the IB trade specifically,
 

4341
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:35,510
going to play the IB trade specifically,
then you'd be looking for that trade

4342
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:35,520
then you'd be looking for that trade
 

4343
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,910
then you'd be looking for that trade
back towards VWAP. But uh just be

4344
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:37,920
back towards VWAP. But uh just be
 

4345
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,149
back towards VWAP. But uh just be
cautious on that today. The way we've

4346
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:40,159
cautious on that today. The way we've
 

4347
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:53,350
cautious on that today. The way we've
built out very very thick underneath.

4348
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:53,360

 

4349
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,189

01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,189
you, Sean. Honestly, my friend, it's the
easiest way to lose money. Right. This

4354
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:01,199
easiest way to lose money. Right. This
 

4355
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:04,070
easiest way to lose money. Right. This
trade here is the hardest trade in the

4356
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:04,080
trade here is the hardest trade in the
 

4357
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,709
trade here is the hardest trade in the
book. Right. I know like that trade

4358
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:06,719
book. Right. I know like that trade
 

4359
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:08,870
book. Right. I know like that trade
there is the hardest trade in the book,

4360
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:08,880
there is the hardest trade in the book,
 

4361
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,189
there is the hardest trade in the book,
right? Why? Because it's not the

4362
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:11,199
right? Why? Because it's not the
 

4363
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,550
right? Why? Because it's not the
protrend. So if we think about

4364
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:14,560
protrend. So if we think about
 

4365
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,870
protrend. So if we think about
if your higher time frame, if your

4366
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:16,880
if your higher time frame, if your
 

4367
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:21,750
if your higher time frame, if your
daily, let's say the daily is doing this

4368
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:21,760
daily, let's say the daily is doing this
 

4369
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:27,669
daily, let's say the daily is doing this
and then the hourly we're doing this,

4370
01:46:27,669 --> 01:46:27,679

 

4371
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:29,510

right? Then your one minute is doing

4372
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
right? Then your one minute is doing
 

4373
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:37,189
right? Then your one minute is doing
this.

4374
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:37,199

 

4375
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:42,870

Yeah.

4376
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:42,880

 

4377
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,950

Right. Daily hourly M1. What you just

4378
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:46,960
Right. Daily hourly M1. What you just
 

4379
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,750
Right. Daily hourly M1. What you just
tried to catch is this move here. Right.

4380
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:49,760
tried to catch is this move here. Right.

You tried to catch this this part of
this when the easier move to get is that

4384
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:54,400
this when the easier move to get is that

high. It's why I said I wouldn't be

4446
01:48:04,629 --> 01:48:04,639
high. It's why I said I wouldn't be
 

4447
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,070
high. It's why I said I wouldn't be
short. But like maybe if you got long

4448
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:06,080
short. But like maybe if you got long
 

4449
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,109
short. But like maybe if you got long
here, you got wicked out and you got

4450
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:07,119
here, you got wicked out and you got
 

4451
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:09,510
here, you got wicked out and you got
back in. I don't know. But that makes

4452
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:09,520
back in. I don't know. But that makes
 

4453
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,950
back in. I don't know. But that makes
sense. Hopefully that makes sense to

4454
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:10,960
sense. Hopefully that makes sense to
 

4455
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,790
sense. Hopefully that makes sense to
you.

01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,669

I wouldn't be holding that. But I mean,

4500
01:49:15,669 --> 01:49:15,679
I wouldn't be holding that. But I mean,
 

4501
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,350
I wouldn't be holding that. But I mean,
I don't know what your strategy is, so I

4502
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:17,360
I don't know what your strategy is, so I
 

4503
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,270

don't want to tell you what to do. But
 

4505
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:20,950
don't want to tell you what to do. But
right now, we're we're trading the other

4506
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:20,960
right now, we're we're trading the other
 

4507
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,470
right now, we're we're trading the other
side of the range. If we start the base

4508
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:22,480
side of the range. If we start the base
 

4509
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,750
side of the range. If we start the base
today above here, you're going to be in

01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:23,760
today above here, you're going to be in
 

4511
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:38,390

What price is a huge seller defending?

4550
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:33,360
What price is a huge seller defending?
 

4551
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,950
What price is a huge seller defending?
Well, the biggest lot right now on the

4552
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:34,960
Well, the biggest lot right now on the
 

4553
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,350
Well, the biggest lot right now on the
book is 900. There's 113 lot defending

4554
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:37,360
book is 900. There's 113 lot defending
 

4555
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,669
book is 900. There's 113 lot defending
at 9 900. But there's liquidity above

4556
01:50:39,669 --> 01:50:39,679
at 9 900. But there's liquidity above
 

4557
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:41,669
at 9 900. But there's liquidity above
him. Let's zoom out. We've got liquidity

4558
01:50:41,669 --> 01:50:41,679
him. Let's zoom out. We've got liquidity
 

4559
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:43,430
him. Let's zoom out. We've got liquidity
all the way up into 930 right now. In

4560
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
all the way up into 930 right now. In
 

4561
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,990
all the way up into 930 right now. In
fact, we've got liquidity up at 950.

4562
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:46,000
fact, we've got liquidity up at 950.
 

4563
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,830
fact, we've got liquidity up at 950.
Yeah, 950 is the highest liquidity of

4564
01:50:47,830 --> 01:50:47,840
Yeah, 950 is the highest liquidity of
 

4565
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,270
Yeah, 950 is the highest liquidity of
the day with anything reasonable. There

4566
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:49,280
the day with anything reasonable. There
 

4567
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,189
the day with anything reasonable. There
is a little bit at 26,000 to be fair,

4568
01:50:51,189 --> 01:50:51,199
is a little bit at 26,000 to be fair,
 

4569
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,430
is a little bit at 26,000 to be fair,
but yeah, 900's currently being

4570
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:53,440
but yeah, 900's currently being
 

4571
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:56,390
but yeah, 900's currently being
defended.

4572
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:56,400
defended.
 

4573
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,590
defended.
I would say you're probably going to

4574
01:50:57,590 --> 01:50:57,600
I would say you're probably going to
 

4575
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,990
I would say you're probably going to
trade through it.

4576
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:00,000
trade through it.
 

4577
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,470
trade through it.
So now see this last dip, the IB, which

4578
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:02,480
So now see this last dip, the IB, which
 

4579
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,790
So now see this last dip, the IB, which
is also the old naked point of control.

4580
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:04,800
is also the old naked point of control.
 

4581
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,950
is also the old naked point of control.
It is starting to hold, right? So if

4582
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:06,960
It is starting to hold, right? So if
 

4583
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,870
It is starting to hold, right? So if
they keep rebidding this, they're trying

4584
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:08,880
they keep rebidding this, they're trying
 

4585
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:11,189
they keep rebidding this, they're trying
to try trade to this set of stops here

4586
01:51:11,189 --> 01:51:11,199
to try trade to this set of stops here
 

4587
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:13,270
to try trade to this set of stops here
and then we have more stops up here. All

4588
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:13,280
and then we have more stops up here. All
 

4589
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,870
and then we have more stops up here. All
right? So if they can hold this, they'll

4590
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:14,880
right? So if they can hold this, they'll
 

4591
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,790
right? So if they can hold this, they'll
trade to here. If they let go of this,

4592
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:16,800
trade to here. If they let go of this,
 

4593
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,310
trade to here. If they let go of this,
this would be the failed look above the

4594
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:18,320
this would be the failed look above the
 

4595
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:22,470
this would be the failed look above the
IB. I'd be cons you'd con consider it

4596
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:22,480
IB. I'd be cons you'd con consider it
 

4597
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:25,109
IB. I'd be cons you'd con consider it
sub 77. If you really wanted to try and

4598
01:51:25,109 --> 01:51:25,119
sub 77. If you really wanted to try and
 

4599
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:27,189
sub 77. If you really wanted to try and
trade that IB trade, it's a riskier

4600
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:27,199
trade that IB trade, it's a riskier
 

4601
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:28,709
trade that IB trade, it's a riskier
trade today because we're moving value

4602
01:51:28,709 --> 01:51:28,719
trade today because we're moving value
 

4603
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:30,790
trade today because we're moving value
higher. But

4604
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:30,800
higher. But
 

4605
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,109
higher. But
if you're absolutely adamant on it, I

4606
01:51:33,109 --> 01:51:33,119
if you're absolutely adamant on it, I
 

4607
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:34,310
if you're absolutely adamant on it, I
would say you've got to get closes

4608
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320
would say you've got to get closes
 

4609
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,310
would say you've got to get closes
underneath 77. But look how look at the

4610
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:36,320
underneath 77. But look how look at the
 

4611
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:37,589
underneath 77. But look how look at the
structure, the way we've built out

4612
01:51:37,589 --> 01:51:37,599
structure, the way we've built out
 

4613
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:39,830
structure, the way we've built out
structure. All right, there's lots of

4614
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:39,840
structure. All right, there's lots of
 

4615
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,470
structure. All right, there's lots of
nodes here which they can use to bid

4616
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:42,480
nodes here which they can use to bid
 

4617
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:43,990
nodes here which they can use to bid
off. That's the only thing. But if we

4618
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:44,000
off. That's the only thing. But if we
 

4619
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,149
off. That's the only thing. But if we
let go of this, there is an argument for

4620
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:46,159
let go of this, there is an argument for
 

4621
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:47,750
let go of this, there is an argument for
this. Again, it's counter trend, but

4622
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:47,760
this. Again, it's counter trend, but
 

4623
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,070
this. Again, it's counter trend, but
it's based on a very specific trade, a

4624
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:50,080
it's based on a very specific trade, a
 

4625
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,830
it's based on a very specific trade, a
look above and fail of the IB for a

4626
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:51,840
look above and fail of the IB for a
 

4627
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,189
look above and fail of the IB for a
trade back down to VWAP. I'm not

4628
01:51:53,189 --> 01:51:53,199
trade back down to VWAP. I'm not
 

4629
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:55,350
trade back down to VWAP. I'm not
convinced we do it today, but it's

4630
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:55,360
convinced we do it today, but it's
 

4631
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:58,149
convinced we do it today, but it's
possible right now. Until you get under

4632
01:51:58,149 --> 01:51:58,159
possible right now. Until you get under
 

4633
01:51:58,159 --> 01:51:59,430
possible right now. Until you get under
this gray box, you couldn't even think

4634
01:51:59,430 --> 01:51:59,440
this gray box, you couldn't even think
 

4635
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,350
this gray box, you couldn't even think
about it. And even then, would be my

4636
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:01,360
about it. And even then, would be my
 

4637
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,030
about it. And even then, would be my
least favorite trade today, I'd say.

4638
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:03,040
least favorite trade today, I'd say.
 

4639
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:13,669
least favorite trade today, I'd say.
even if it works out.

4640
01:52:13,669 --> 01:52:13,679

 

4641
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:15,189

I think you can use any of those prop

4642
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:15,199
I think you can use any of those prop
 

4643

I think you can use any of those prop

that today we got that. Sometimes we
 

4671
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:00,149

don't go for low hanging fruit. This was

don't go for low hanging fruit. This was
 

4673
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:01,910

If you start to lose this, all right, if

4734
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,080
If you start to lose this, all right, if
 

4735

If you start to lose this, all right, if
they stay heavy versus this and this,

4736
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,960
they stay heavy versus this and this,
 

4737
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,470
they stay heavy versus this and this,
all right, there's an argument for this

4738
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:22,480
all right, there's an argument for this
 

4739
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,790
all right, there's an argument for this
trade here. Again, I'm not going to take

4740
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:24,800
trade here. Again, I'm not going to take
 

4741
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,229
trade here. Again, I'm not going to take
it because it's counter trend. So, I

4742
01:54:26,229 --> 01:54:26,239
it because it's counter trend. So, I
 

4743
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:27,830
it because it's counter trend. So, I
know it's an IB trade, but I think it's

4744
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:27,840
know it's an IB trade, but I think it's
 

4745
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,629
know it's an IB trade, but I think it's
very, very risky today based on what

4746
01:54:30,629 --> 01:54:30,639
very, very risky today based on what
 

4747
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:33,589
very, very risky today based on what

4899
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,149
post. I I still do the same on Discord
when I'm drawing out. like when I'm

4900
01:57:38,149 --> 01:57:38,159
when I'm drawing out. like when I'm
 

4901
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:39,669
when I'm drawing out. like when I'm
drawing out, I'm drawing it on here cuz

4902
01:57:39,669 --> 01:57:39,679
drawing out, I'm drawing it on here cuz
 

4903
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:41,589
drawing out, I'm drawing it on here cuz
it's it's just way easier for me to draw

4904
01:57:41,589 --> 01:57:41,599
it's it's just way easier for me to draw
 

4905
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:44,310
it's it's just way easier for me to draw
on. But if I'm taking actual trades, I

4906
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:44,320
on. But if I'm taking actual trades, I
 

4907
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,149
on. But if I'm taking actual trades, I
don't know how far I'd have to go up the

4908
01:57:46,149 --> 01:57:46,159
don't know how far I'd have to go up the
 

4909
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:48,390
don't know how far I'd have to go up the
last time we took a trade together in

4910
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:48,400
last time we took a trade together in
 

4911
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,070
last time we took a trade together in
here last week somewhere. But if I'm

4912
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:50,080
here last week somewhere. But if I'm
 

4913
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,669
here last week somewhere. But if I'm
taking executions, I will show the

4914
01:57:51,669 --> 01:57:51,679
taking executions, I will show the
 

4915
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:54,070
taking executions, I will show the
execution in Discord on on Ninja Trader,

4916
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:54,080
execution in Discord on on Ninja Trader,
 

4917
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,070
execution in Discord on on Ninja Trader,
but I will always do the teaching on

4918
01:57:56,070 --> 01:57:56,080
but I will always do the teaching on
 

4919
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,750
but I will always do the teaching on
Trading View. Always, always, always,

4923
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,830
always it'll be on Trading View. See all
of these trading views and then we get

4924
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:01,840
of these trading views and then we get
 

4925
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,270
of these trading views and then we get
into some Ninja Traders. some of the

4926
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:03,280
into some Ninja Traders. some of the
 

4927
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,270
into some Ninja Traders. some of the
other guys even the same for bookmap

4928
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:05,280
other guys even the same for bookmap
 

4929
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,990
other guys even the same for bookmap
everyone we will always draw it out

4930
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:08,000
everyone we will always draw it out
 

4931
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,109
everyone we will always draw it out
where we can see it see still all in

4932
01:58:11,109 --> 01:58:11,119
where we can see it see still all in
 

4933
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:16,709
where we can see it see still all in
discord in in uh trading view

4934
01:58:16,709 --> 01:58:16,719

 

4935
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:19,109

and it shows how long since it's been an

4936
01:58:19,109 --> 01:58:19,119
and it shows how long since it's been an
 

4937
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:26,550
and it shows how long since it's been an
afternoon trade. It's been a while

4938
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:26,560

 

4939
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,070

and it's been a really long time by the

4940
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,080
and it's been a really long time by the
 

4941
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:30,470
and it's been a really long time by the
looks of it.

4942
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:30,480
looks of it.
 

4943
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,510
looks of it.
really long.

4944
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:33,520
really long.
 

4945
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:39,510
really long.
And there was one there maybe.

4946
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:39,520

 

4947
01:58:39,520 --> 01:59:16,310

Yeah, that's the only reason

4948
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:16,320

 

4949
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:18,229

As mentioned earlier, I can't see an

4950
01:59:18,229 --> 01:59:18,239
As mentioned earlier, I can't see an
 

4951
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:21,030
As mentioned earlier, I can't see an
edge in bookmap over footprint. And then

4952
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:21,040
edge in bookmap over footprint. And then
 

4953
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:27,750
edge in bookmap over footprint. And then
that's good for you. SPT,

4954
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:27,760

 

4955
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,830

I like it cuz I like seeing where the

4956
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:29,840
I like it cuz I like seeing where the
 

4957
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:32,310
I like it cuz I like seeing where the
liquidity above is and below and I like

4958
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:32,320
liquidity above is and below and I like
 

4959
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,709
liquidity above is and below and I like
seeing who's spoofing. So that is edge

4960
01:59:34,709 --> 01:59:34,719
seeing who's spoofing. So that is edge
 

4961
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:36,390
seeing who's spoofing. So that is edge
that you already don't get in footprint,

4962
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:36,400
that you already don't get in footprint,
 

4963
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,910
that you already don't get in footprint,
right? You don't have any historical

4964
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:37,920
right? You don't have any historical
 

4965
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,910
right? You don't have any historical
data on people who haven't filled their

4966
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:39,920
data on people who haven't filled their
 

4967
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,149
data on people who haven't filled their
orders. So if there's someone spoofing

4968
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159
orders. So if there's someone spoofing
 

4969
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:43,830
orders. So if there's someone spoofing
or moving around or jostling, you won't

4970
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:43,840
or moving around or jostling, you won't
 

4971
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,149
or moving around or jostling, you won't
you won't see him unless you're very

4972
01:59:46,149 --> 01:59:46,159
you won't see him unless you're very
 

4973
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:49,589
you won't see him unless you're very
very good at reading the bid and ask it

4974
01:59:49,589 --> 01:59:49,599
very good at reading the bid and ask it
 

4975
01:59:49,599 --> 02:00:00,550
very good at reading the bid and ask it
moves up and down and people pull.

4976
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:00,560

 

4977
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:04,149

Are my homies with Dom? Yeah, I am.

4978
02:00:04,149 --> 02:00:04,159
Are my homies with Dom? Yeah, I am.
 

4979
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:09,510
Are my homies with Dom? Yeah, I am.
good friends with Dom. Why is that?

4980
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:09,520

 

4981
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,430

What does delta divergence usually

4982
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:11,440
What does delta divergence usually
 

4983
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,430
What does delta divergence usually
signify? Uh it's all about who's in

4984
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:13,440
signify? Uh it's all about who's in
 

4985
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:15,589
signify? Uh it's all about who's in
control of the market. So we can see if

4986
02:00:15,589 --> 02:00:15,599
control of the market. So we can see if
 

4987
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:17,430
control of the market. So we can see if
we have any divergence today in the

4988
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:17,440
we have any divergence today in the
 

4989
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:26,950
we have any divergence today in the
market

4990
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:26,960

 

4991
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,109

pretty much in line. Um but we actually

4992
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:29,119
pretty much in line. Um but we actually
 

4993
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:32,070
pretty much in line. Um but we actually
had passive buyers today. So if we go to

4994
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:32,080
had passive buyers today. So if we go to
 

4995
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:37,750
had passive buyers today. So if we go to
just a five minute.

4996
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:37,760

 

4997
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:39,430

All right, if this is delta, all right,

4998
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:39,440
All right, if this is delta, all right,
 

4999
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,270
All right, if this is delta, all right,
so we got aggressive buyers stepping in

5000
02:00:41,270 --> 02:00:41,280
so we got aggressive buyers stepping in
 

5001
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,030
so we got aggressive buyers stepping in
and aggressive take moving higher. All

5002
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:43,040
and aggressive take moving higher. All
 

5003
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,109
and aggressive take moving higher. All
right, price moves higher. We see a

5004
02:00:45,109 --> 02:00:45,119
right, price moves higher. We see a
 

5005
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:47,350
right, price moves higher. We see a
pullback here in Delta. So we see some

5006
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:47,360
pullback here in Delta. So we see some
 

5007
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,870
pullback here in Delta. So we see some
aggressive sellers stepping in. We see

5008
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:48,880
aggressive sellers stepping in. We see
 

5009
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,510
aggressive sellers stepping in. We see
aggressive uh pullback and then we see

5010
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:51,520
aggressive uh pullback and then we see
 

5011
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:54,070
aggressive uh pullback and then we see
buyers step in. We only just about take

5012
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:54,080
buyers step in. We only just about take
 

5013
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,669
buyers step in. We only just about take
out that high on Delta, which means

5014
02:00:55,669 --> 02:00:55,679
out that high on Delta, which means
 

5015
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:57,910
out that high on Delta, which means
there's a passive buyer here pushing

5016
02:00:57,910 --> 02:00:57,920
there's a passive buyer here pushing
 

5017
02:00:57,920 --> 02:00:59,990
there's a passive buyer here pushing
bids up. All right, which shows even

5018
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:00,000
bids up. All right, which shows even
 

5019
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,750
bids up. All right, which shows even
more strength if anything. We go

5020
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:01,760
more strength if anything. We go
 

5021
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,870
more strength if anything. We go
sideways from here. There's a little

5022
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:04,880
sideways from here. There's a little
 

5023
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:07,510
sideways from here. There's a little
pullback and we're pretty much in line.

5024
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:07,520
pullback and we're pretty much in line.
 

5025
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,870
pullback and we're pretty much in line.
We're making higher highs and higher

5026
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:08,880
We're making higher highs and higher
 

5027
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,709
We're making higher highs and higher
low. What you'd be looking for is

5028
02:01:10,709 --> 02:01:10,719
low. What you'd be looking for is
 

5029
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:12,229
low. What you'd be looking for is
something like if if we were going to

5030
02:01:12,229 --> 02:01:12,239
something like if if we were going to
 

5031
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:14,870
something like if if we were going to
put a high in, right? If we were going

5032
02:01:14,870 --> 02:01:14,880
put a high in, right? If we were going
 

5033
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:16,709
put a high in, right? If we were going
to put a high in, what you'd want to see

5034
02:01:16,709 --> 02:01:16,719
to put a high in, what you'd want to see
 

5035
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:19,189
to put a high in, what you'd want to see
is delta start to move down, all right,

5036
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:19,199
is delta start to move down, all right,
 

5037
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:21,830
is delta start to move down, all right,
and start to get stuck and buyers not

5038
02:01:21,830 --> 02:01:21,840
and start to get stuck and buyers not
 

5039
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,510
and start to get stuck and buyers not
able to move it higher. Or you'd want

5040
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:23,520
able to move it higher. Or you'd want
 

5041
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,950
able to move it higher. Or you'd want
like to know that there's a passive

5042
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:24,960
like to know that there's a passive
 

5043
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,830
like to know that there's a passive
seller holding price here non-stop. So,

5044
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:27,840
seller holding price here non-stop. So,
 

5045
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,910
seller holding price here non-stop. So,
someone just unloading passively. So,

5046
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
someone just unloading passively. So,
 

5047
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:32,629
someone just unloading passively. So,
Delta can't move higher, which we might

5048
02:01:32,629 --> 02:01:32,639
Delta can't move higher, which we might
 

5049
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:35,510
Delta can't move higher, which we might
get soon actually in fairness.

5050
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:35,520
get soon actually in fairness.
 

5051
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,950
get soon actually in fairness.
So, you're looking to see where the

5052
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:36,960
So, you're looking to see where the
 

5053
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,950
So, you're looking to see where the

potentially if they lose this, there is
 

5065
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,430
potentially if they lose this, there is
a trade down here, but you need to be

02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:51,440
a trade down here, but you need to be
 

5067
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:54,550
a trade down here, but you need to be

02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,629
move higher delta is pushing higher and
we're not able to so that is a sign that

02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:09,270
we're not able to so that is a sign that
someone is unloading here right so it's

very possible we we fade under this but
 

5205
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:13,589
very possible we we fade under this but
this this is what makes it hard the way

5206
02:05:13,589 --> 02:05:13,599
this this is what makes it hard the way
 

5207
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:15,030
this this is what makes it hard the way
we've built out structure. Look at this

5208
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:15,040
we've built out structure. Look at this
 

5209
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,709
we've built out structure. Look at this
node. Look at this PC. Like I keep

5210
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:16,719
node. Look at this PC. Like I keep
 

5211
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:21,030
node. Look at this PC. Like I keep
saying, if we lose these levels,

5212
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:21,040
saying, if we lose these levels,
 

5213
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:22,629
saying, if we lose these levels,
then there might be a trade down. But

5214
02:05:22,629 --> 02:05:22,639
then there might be a trade down. But
 

5215
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:24,310
then there might be a trade down. But
again, it's counter trend. It's not the

5216
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:24,320
again, it's counter trend. It's not the
 

5217
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:25,830
again, it's counter trend. It's not the
best trade in the book. All we're seeing

5218
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:25,840
best trade in the book. All we're seeing
 

5219
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,510
best trade in the book. All we're seeing
right now is there is a seller here. We

5220
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:27,520
right now is there is a seller here. We
 

5221
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,629
right now is there is a seller here. We
know he's up towards 900.

5222
02:05:30,629 --> 02:05:30,639
know he's up towards 900.
 

5223
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:32,629
know he's up towards 900.
But if you look at Delta, it was uh

5224
02:05:32,629 --> 02:05:32,639
But if you look at Delta, it was uh
 

5225
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:33,910
But if you look at Delta, it was uh
creeping higher and higher and higher

5226
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:33,920
creeping higher and higher and higher
 

5227
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:50,790
creeping higher and higher and higher
without price moving higher.

5228
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:50,800

 

5229
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,790

Hey, Alex. After using Bookmap for a

5230
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:52,800
Hey, Alex. After using Bookmap for a
 

5231
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,629
Hey, Alex. After using Bookmap for a
while now, what's it missing that would

5232
02:05:54,629 --> 02:05:54,639
while now, what's it missing that would
 

5233
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:57,189
while now, what's it missing that would
make it better?

5234
02:05:57,189 --> 02:05:57,199
make it better?
 

5235
02:05:57,199 --> 02:06:02,070
make it better?
Um,

5236
02:06:02,070 --> 02:06:02,080

 

5237
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:03,589

I think the DOM could be a little

5238
02:06:03,589 --> 02:06:03,599
I think the DOM could be a little
 

5239
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:05,510
I think the DOM could be a little
better.

5240
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:05,520
better.
 

5241
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:09,270
better.
Um,

5242
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:09,280

 

5243
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,629

I don't know. I don't use any of the

5244
02:06:10,629 --> 02:06:10,639
I don't know. I don't use any of the
 

5245
02:06:10,639 --> 02:06:12,390
I don't know. I don't use any of the
add-ons because I don't think I I need

5246
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:12,400
add-ons because I don't think I I need
 

5247
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,709
add-ons because I don't think I I need
them.

5248
02:06:14,709 --> 02:06:14,719
them.
 

5249
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:16,629
them.
Um, I'm sure like lots of the add-ons

5250
02:06:16,629 --> 02:06:16,639
Um, I'm sure like lots of the add-ons
 

5251
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:18,870
Um, I'm sure like lots of the add-ons
can be useful, but I I quite like it.

5252
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:18,880
can be useful, but I I quite like it.
 

5253
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,270
can be useful, but I I quite like it.
It's it's it's easy enough as it is. I

5254
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:21,280
It's it's it's easy enough as it is. I
 

5255
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,830
It's it's it's easy enough as it is. I
don't think I have any major criticisms

5256
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:23,840
don't think I have any major criticisms
 

5257
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:32,149
don't think I have any major criticisms
of it or anything like that.

5258
02:06:32,149 --> 02:06:32,159

 

5259
02:06:32,159 --> 02:06:34,470

Maybe like a

5260
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:34,480
Maybe like a
 

5261
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:36,470
Maybe like a
maybe the way it looks, to be honest,

5262
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:36,480
maybe the way it looks, to be honest,
 

5263
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:37,830
maybe the way it looks, to be honest,
could be a bit better. Just like the

5264
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:37,840
could be a bit better. Just like the
 

5265
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,589
could be a bit better. Just like the
actual detail of how it looks, like even

5266
02:06:39,589 --> 02:06:39,599
actual detail of how it looks, like even
 

5267
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:41,669
actual detail of how it looks, like even
the the the profiles and stuff, it's a

5268
02:06:41,669 --> 02:06:41,679
the the the profiles and stuff, it's a
 

5269
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:43,910
the the the profiles and stuff, it's a
bit like pixy and janky. Maybe that

5270
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:43,920
bit like pixy and janky. Maybe that
 

5271
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:52,470
bit like pixy and janky. Maybe that
could be smoothened out a bit.

5272
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:52,480

 

5273
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:54,310

The candles are closing funny as this

5274
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:54,320
The candles are closing funny as this
 

5275
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:55,589
The candles are closing funny as this
usual. What do you mean they're closing

5276
02:06:55,589 --> 02:06:55,599
usual. What do you mean they're closing
 

5277
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:58,229
usual. What do you mean they're closing
funny? I don't think it's just normal

5278
02:06:58,229 --> 02:06:58,239
funny? I don't think it's just normal
 

5279
02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:07,189
funny? I don't think it's just normal
and sideways.

5280
02:07:07,189 --> 02:07:07,199

 

5281
02:07:07,199 --> 02:07:10,390

How would I characterize spoofers

5282
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:10,400
How would I characterize spoofers
 

5283
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,910
How would I characterize spoofers
that they literally have to leave the

5284
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:11,920
that they literally have to leave the
 

5285
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:15,430
that they literally have to leave the
tape, right? So, see this this guy above

5286
02:07:15,430 --> 02:07:15,440
tape, right? So, see this this guy above
 

5287
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:17,990
tape, right? So, see this this guy above
us? If you just see this solid red line,

5288
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:18,000
us? If you just see this solid red line,
 

5289
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,830
us? If you just see this solid red line,
he's been there since the open, right?

5290
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:19,840
he's been there since the open, right?
 

5291
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:22,069
he's been there since the open, right?
He's never left. Now, if we trade up

5292
02:07:22,069 --> 02:07:22,079
He's never left. Now, if we trade up
 

5293
02:07:22,079 --> 02:07:24,069
He's never left. Now, if we trade up
towards him and he pulls his order and

5294
02:07:24,069 --> 02:07:24,079
towards him and he pulls his order and
 

5295
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:25,510
towards him and he pulls his order and
he moves it higher, let's say he moves

5296
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:25,520
he moves it higher, let's say he moves
 

5297
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:28,870
he moves it higher, let's say he moves
from 900 to 20 to 30 to 50 to right,

5298
02:07:28,870 --> 02:07:28,880
from 900 to 20 to 30 to 50 to right,
 

5299
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,310
from 900 to 20 to 30 to 50 to right,
then he's a spoofer. What does that

5300
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:30,320
then he's a spoofer. What does that
 

5301
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,870
then he's a spoofer. What does that
mean? If he's lifting, right, then he's

5302
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:32,880
mean? If he's lifting, right, then he's
 

5303
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,390
mean? If he's lifting, right, then he's
a buyer looking to sell higher. Or he's

5304
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:36,400
a buyer looking to sell higher. Or he's
 

5305
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,229
a buyer looking to sell higher. Or he's
a buyer attracting price. Come and get

5306
02:07:38,229 --> 02:07:38,239
a buyer attracting price. Come and get
 

5307
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:39,589
a buyer attracting price. Come and get
me. Come and get me. Come and get me.

5308
02:07:39,589 --> 02:07:39,599
me. Come and get me. Come and get me.
 

5309
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:40,790
me. Come and get me. Come and get me.
Come and get me. Come and get me. Come

5310
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:40,800
Come and get me. Come and get me. Come
 

5311
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,870
Come and get me. Come and get me. Come
and get me. Right? That's a spoofer. A

5312
02:07:42,870 --> 02:07:42,880
and get me. Right? That's a spoofer. A
 

5313
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,310
and get me. Right? That's a spoofer. A
spoofer is someone coming on the tape,

5314
02:07:44,310 --> 02:07:44,320
spoofer is someone coming on the tape,
 

5315
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,069
spoofer is someone coming on the tape,
off the tape, on the tape, off the tape,

5316
02:07:46,069 --> 02:07:46,079
off the tape, on the tape, off the tape,
 

5317
02:07:46,079 --> 02:07:47,750
off the tape, on the tape, off the tape,
on the tape, off the tape, trying to

5318
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:47,760
on the tape, off the tape, trying to
 

5319
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,069
on the tape, off the tape, trying to
move price around. If he's just there

5320
02:07:50,069 --> 02:07:50,079
move price around. If he's just there
 

5321
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:52,790
move price around. If he's just there
and not moving, there's nothing in this

5322
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:52,800
and not moving, there's nothing in this
 

5323
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,790
and not moving, there's nothing in this
right now to say he's he's anything but

5324
02:07:54,790 --> 02:07:54,800
right now to say he's he's anything but
 

5325
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,390
right now to say he's he's anything but
a legit seller. He's never left the

5326
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:56,400
a legit seller. He's never left the
 

5327
02:07:56,400 --> 02:08:04,069
a legit seller. He's never left the
tape, not once.

5328
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:04,079

 

5329
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:05,830

There you go. Literally just what Adam

5330
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:05,840
There you go. Literally just what Adam
 

5331
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,589
There you go. Literally just what Adam
said. Yeah. Ridiculous size coming on

5332
02:08:07,589 --> 02:08:07,599
said. Yeah. Ridiculous size coming on
 

5333
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:08,950
said. Yeah. Ridiculous size coming on
the opposite side of the movement and

5334
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:08,960
the opposite side of the movement and
 

5335
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,470
the opposite side of the movement and
then moving it around to catch eyes.

5336
02:08:10,470 --> 02:08:10,480
then moving it around to catch eyes.
 

5337
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:12,390
then moving it around to catch eyes.
Exactly.

5338
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:12,400
Exactly.
 

5339
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,229
Exactly.
Do you see passive buyers and sellers?

5340
02:08:14,229 --> 02:08:14,239
Do you see passive buyers and sellers?
 

5341
02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:18,550
Do you see passive buyers and sellers?
If if you do see a big move coming, do

5342
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:18,560
If if you do see a big move coming, do
 

5343
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,790
If if you do see a big move coming, do
Hey, Alex, do you see passive buyers and

5344
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:20,800
Hey, Alex, do you see passive buyers and
 

5345
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,270
Hey, Alex, do you see passive buyers and
sellers? If so, so do you see a big move

5346
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:23,280
sellers? If so, so do you see a big move
 

5347
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:25,350
sellers? If so, so do you see a big move
coming?

5348
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:25,360
coming?
 

5349
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:27,030
coming?
I'm not sure what you mean. As in right

5350
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
I'm not sure what you mean. As in right
 

5351
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:30,069
I'm not sure what you mean. As in right
now, I mean, there's a passive seller at

5352
02:08:30,069 --> 02:08:30,079
now, I mean, there's a passive seller at
 

5353
02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:32,550
now, I mean, there's a passive seller at
900. If we trade through him, maybe

5354
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:32,560
900. If we trade through him, maybe
 

5355
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,990
900. If we trade through him, maybe
there's a squeeze out, but maybe that's

5356
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:34,000
there's a squeeze out, but maybe that's
 

5357
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,430
there's a squeeze out, but maybe that's
the top of the auction for the day. Um,

5358
02:08:37,430 --> 02:08:37,440
the top of the auction for the day. Um,
 

5359
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,189
the top of the auction for the day. Um,
all we see right now is a huge amount of

5360
02:08:39,189 --> 02:08:39,199
all we see right now is a huge amount of
 

5361
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:41,510
all we see right now is a huge amount of
liquidity being built.

5362
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:41,520
liquidity being built.
 

5363
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:45,510
liquidity being built.
We're getting stuck right here.

5364
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:45,520
We're getting stuck right here.
 

5365
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:47,910
We're getting stuck right here.
This is your build out.

5366
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:47,920
This is your build out.
 

5367
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,910
This is your build out.
Their target is to come and take the 900

5368
02:08:49,910 --> 02:08:49,920
Their target is to come and take the 900
 

5369
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,510
Their target is to come and take the 900
out and maybe lift. And if they get

5370
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:51,520
out and maybe lift. And if they get
 

5371
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:53,750
out and maybe lift. And if they get
lucky, they come into all these stops up

5372
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:53,760
lucky, they come into all these stops up
 

5373
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:57,189
lucky, they come into all these stops up
here, right? If there's a passive seller

5374
02:08:57,189 --> 02:08:57,199
here, right? If there's a passive seller
 

5375
02:08:57,199 --> 02:08:59,109
here, right? If there's a passive seller
slams 900 and above. I can only see

5376
02:08:59,109 --> 02:08:59,119
slams 900 and above. I can only see
 

5377
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:00,870
slams 900 and above. I can only see
really a guy at 900 right now. There are

5378
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:00,880
really a guy at 900 right now. There are
 

5379
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,709
really a guy at 900 right now. There are
guys above him, but if they chase the

5380
02:09:02,709 --> 02:09:02,719
guys above him, but if they chase the
 

5381
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:05,669
guys above him, but if they chase the
market down and they sell under here on

5382
02:09:05,669 --> 02:09:05,679
market down and they sell under here on
 

5383
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:07,750
market down and they sell under here on
a retest, then we'll get the rotation.

5384
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:07,760
a retest, then we'll get the rotation.
 

5385
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,109
a retest, then we'll get the rotation.
There's nothing else to look at right

5386
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:09,119
There's nothing else to look at right
 

5387
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:11,030
There's nothing else to look at right
now. that that that's all there is right

5388
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:11,040
now. that that that's all there is right
 

5389
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:14,310
now. that that that's all there is right
now. ES stuck between its new. So ES by

5390
02:09:14,310 --> 02:09:14,320
now. ES stuck between its new. So ES by
 

5391
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:16,390
now. ES stuck between its new. So ES by
the way has done the IB trade. All

5392
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:16,400
the way has done the IB trade. All
 

5393
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:17,750
the way has done the IB trade. All
right, that's another thing we should

5394
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:17,760
right, that's another thing we should
 

5395
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:21,030
right, that's another thing we should
mention. ES has done the IB trade. IB

5396
02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:21,040
mention. ES has done the IB trade. IB
 

5397
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:23,030
mention. ES has done the IB trade. IB

IB high 2 V. It's done the trade right

5402
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:28,800
IB high 2 V. It's done the trade right
 

5403
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,629
IB high 2 V. It's done the trade right
now. It's in the middle of the two. It's

now. It's in the middle of the two. It's
 

5405
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:44,229

already completed it.

5406
02:09:44,229 --> 02:09:44,239

 

5407
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:45,910

Sorry guys, I'm trying to read all your

5408
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:45,920
Sorry guys, I'm trying to read all your
 

5409
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:48,149
Sorry guys, I'm trying to read all your
questions here.

5410
02:09:48,149 --> 02:09:48,159
questions here.
 

5411
02:09:48,159 --> 02:09:50,709
questions here.
Um,

5412
02:09:50,709 --> 02:09:50,719
Um,
 

5413
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:52,870
Um,
I just joined when the delta moves but

5414
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:52,880
I just joined when the delta moves but
 

5415
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:54,550
I just joined when the delta moves but
the price not really as you mentioned.

5416
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:54,560
the price not really as you mentioned.
 

5417
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:56,470
the price not really as you mentioned.
What is it meaning? All right, so if

5418
02:09:56,470 --> 02:09:56,480
What is it meaning? All right, so if
 

5419
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:58,550
What is it meaning? All right, so if
you've got positive delta, right, if

5420
02:09:58,550 --> 02:09:58,560
you've got positive delta, right, if
 

5421
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:00,310
you've got positive delta, right, if
you've got big positive delta but price

5422
02:10:00,310 --> 02:10:00,320
you've got big positive delta but price
 

5423
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,830
you've got big positive delta but price
isn't moving higher, it means you got a

5424
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:01,840
isn't moving higher, it means you got a
 

5425
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,350
isn't moving higher, it means you got a
passive seller. means you got someone

5426
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:03,360
passive seller. means you got someone
 

5427
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,750
passive seller. means you got someone
just unloading on the limit, right? Just

5428
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:05,760
just unloading on the limit, right? Just
 

5429
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,750
just unloading on the limit, right? Just
unloading, unloading, unloading, which

5430
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:07,760
unloading, unloading, unloading, which
 

5431
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:09,669
unloading, unloading, unloading, which
which is when you can get buyers stuck

5432
02:10:09,669 --> 02:10:09,679
which is when you can get buyers stuck
 

5433
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:11,589
which is when you can get buyers stuck
because you got big aggressive buyers,

5434
02:10:11,589 --> 02:10:11,599
because you got big aggressive buyers,
 

5435
02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:13,350
because you got big aggressive buyers,
delta moving higher, but price can't

5436
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:13,360
delta moving higher, but price can't
 

5437
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,109
delta moving higher, but price can't
move higher, right? It means you got a

5438
02:10:15,109 --> 02:10:15,119
move higher, right? It means you got a
 

5439
02:10:15,119 --> 02:10:16,470
move higher, right? It means you got a
passive seller. So if you then come

5440
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:16,480
passive seller. So if you then come
 

5441
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:18,950
passive seller. So if you then come
under that neath that price of delta

5442
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:18,960
under that neath that price of delta
 

5443
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,629
under that neath that price of delta
point where those guys come in, we get

5444
02:10:20,629 --> 02:10:20,639
point where those guys come in, we get
 

5445
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:22,629
point where those guys come in, we get
weak, right? Which is probably going to

5446
02:10:22,629 --> 02:10:22,639
weak, right? Which is probably going to
 

5447
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:23,830
weak, right? Which is probably going to
be here. All right? All right. So, if

5448
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:23,840
be here. All right? All right. So, if
 

5449
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,350
be here. All right? All right. So, if
we've got big aggressive buyers keep

5450
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:25,360
we've got big aggressive buyers keep
 

5451
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:27,510
we've got big aggressive buyers keep
stepping in here, if they don't get

5452
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:27,520
stepping in here, if they don't get
 

5453
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:29,830
stepping in here, if they don't get
their way and we get stuck under here,

5454
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:29,840
their way and we get stuck under here,
 

5455
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:31,750
their way and we get stuck under here,
then their stop run can open up this

5456
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:31,760
then their stop run can open up this
 

5457
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:34,390
then their stop run can open up this
move. All right. This is what I keep

5458
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:34,400
move. All right. This is what I keep
 

5459
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:35,910
move. All right. This is what I keep
talking about. If we come under here and

5460
02:10:35,910 --> 02:10:35,920
talking about. If we come under here and
 

5461
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:38,709
talking about. If we come under here and
we reject it, this can open up because

5462
02:10:38,709 --> 02:10:38,719
we reject it, this can open up because
 

5463
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:40,709
we reject it, this can open up because
if we have big positive delta above

5464
02:10:40,709 --> 02:10:40,719
if we have big positive delta above
 

5465
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:43,510
if we have big positive delta above
this, they will get caught. So, we can

5466
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:43,520
this, they will get caught. So, we can
 

5467
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:45,830
this, they will get caught. So, we can
have a look at that

5468
02:10:45,830 --> 02:10:45,840
have a look at that
 

5469
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:50,310
have a look at that
right here.

5470
02:10:50,310 --> 02:10:50,320

 

5471
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:52,550

And you have positive delta above 85s

5472
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:52,560
And you have positive delta above 85s
 

5473
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,229
And you have positive delta above 85s
right now. All right. So, we're coming

5474
02:10:54,229 --> 02:10:54,239
right now. All right. So, we're coming
 

5475
02:10:54,239 --> 02:10:55,669
right now. All right. So, we're coming
into this sort of key level. If we start

5476
02:10:55,669 --> 02:10:55,679
into this sort of key level. If we start
 

5477
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:57,589
into this sort of key level. If we start
to lose this, the last time buyers came

5478
02:10:57,589 --> 02:10:57,599
to lose this, the last time buyers came
 

5479
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:00,149
to lose this, the last time buyers came
in were 60s and then 40s. So, we might

5480
02:11:00,149 --> 02:11:00,159
in were 60s and then 40s. So, we might
 

5481
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:02,950
in were 60s and then 40s. So, we might
very well drop down into 60s and 40s

5482
02:11:02,950 --> 02:11:02,960
very well drop down into 60s and 40s
 

5483
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:05,350
very well drop down into 60s and 40s
here. If we start to lose this gray box,

5484
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:05,360
here. If we start to lose this gray box,
 

5485
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:07,750
here. If we start to lose this gray box,
right? If we lose this gray box, 60s.

5486
02:11:07,750 --> 02:11:07,760
right? If we lose this gray box, 60s.
 

5487
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:10,790
right? If we lose this gray box, 60s.
Look at the profile. 60s

5488
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:10,800
Look at the profile. 60s
 

5489
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,270
Look at the profile. 60s
and 40s, right? So, if these become

5490
02:11:13,270 --> 02:11:13,280
and 40s, right? So, if these become
 

5491
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,510
and 40s, right? So, if these become
trapped buyers, we might well get this

5492
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:15,520
trapped buyers, we might well get this
 

5493
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:18,069
trapped buyers, we might well get this
flush to here and here.

5494
02:11:18,069 --> 02:11:18,079
flush to here and here.
 

5495
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:20,229
flush to here and here.
And they will have to reject this. They

5496
02:11:20,229 --> 02:11:20,239
And they will have to reject this. They
 

5497
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:22,470
And they will have to reject this. They
have to reject this to get that. If they

5498
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:22,480
have to reject this to get that. If they
 

5499
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:24,470
have to reject this to get that. If they
reclaim that, this is a look below,

5500
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:24,480
reclaim that, this is a look below,
 

5501
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:27,189
reclaim that, this is a look below,
fail, and a rotation back up again.

5502
02:11:27,189 --> 02:11:27,199
fail, and a rotation back up again.
 

5503
02:11:27,199 --> 02:11:28,629
fail, and a rotation back up again.
Right? So, these will be the trades that

5504
02:11:28,629 --> 02:11:28,639
Right? So, these will be the trades that
 

5505
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:30,390
Right? So, these will be the trades that
you can look for. You're adamant on

5506
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:30,400
you can look for. You're adamant on
 

5507
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,790
you can look for. You're adamant on
short. It must reject this here, and

5508
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:32,800
short. It must reject this here, and
 

5509
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:35,350
short. It must reject this here, and
you'd be looking for this node and this

5510
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:35,360
you'd be looking for this node and this
 

5511
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:37,350
you'd be looking for this node and this
node.

5512
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:37,360
node.
 

5513
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,270
node.
Like I said, buyers currently are caught

5514
02:11:39,270 --> 02:11:39,280
Like I said, buyers currently are caught
 

5515
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:43,510
Like I said, buyers currently are caught
above 85, definitely above 91, but they

5516
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:43,520
above 85, definitely above 91, but they
 

5517
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:47,430
above 85, definitely above 91, but they
have been uh stepping in at 60 today. So

5518
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:47,440
have been uh stepping in at 60 today. So
 

5519
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:48,550
have been uh stepping in at 60 today. So
that's where they're trying to hold.

5520
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:48,560
that's where they're trying to hold.
 

5521
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:57,109
that's where they're trying to hold.
They're trying to hold 60 here.

5522
02:11:57,109 --> 02:11:57,119

 

5523
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:58,709

So this will need to reject now for

5524
02:11:58,709 --> 02:11:58,719
So this will need to reject now for
 

5525
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:00,790
So this will need to reject now for
sellers to take control or at least to

5526
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:00,800
sellers to take control or at least to
 

5527
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:03,030
sellers to take control or at least to
fade down to to 60, which is what

5528
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:03,040
fade down to to 60, which is what
 

5529
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,189
fade down to to 60, which is what
they're trying to do. They're trying to

5530
02:12:05,189 --> 02:12:05,199
they're trying to do. They're trying to
 

5531
02:12:05,199 --> 02:12:07,109
they're trying to do. They're trying to
aggressively step in here. If they fail

5532
02:12:07,109 --> 02:12:07,119
aggressively step in here. If they fail
 

5533
02:12:07,119 --> 02:12:08,470
aggressively step in here. If they fail
to do it, there will be a squeeze. If

5534
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:08,480
to do it, there will be a squeeze. If
 

5535
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,310
to do it, there will be a squeeze. If
they reclaim this gray box, there'll be

5536
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:10,320
they reclaim this gray box, there'll be
 

5537
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,790
they reclaim this gray box, there'll be
a squeeze out to higher day. That's the

5538
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:12,800
a squeeze out to higher day. That's the
 

5539
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:14,629
a squeeze out to higher day. That's the
two sides of the tape. So if sellers can

5540
02:12:14,629 --> 02:12:14,639
two sides of the tape. So if sellers can
 

5541
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:16,310
two sides of the tape. So if sellers can
step in here, you get this. If they

5542
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:16,320
step in here, you get this. If they
 

5543
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,870
step in here, you get this. If they
reclaim, then there'll probably squeeze

5544
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:18,880
reclaim, then there'll probably squeeze
 

5545
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,109
reclaim, then there'll probably squeeze
out.

5546
02:12:21,109 --> 02:12:21,119
out.
 

5547
02:12:21,119 --> 02:12:23,669
out.
There you go. There's a reclaim. So, if

5548
02:12:23,669 --> 02:12:23,679
There you go. There's a reclaim. So, if
 

5549
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:25,109
There you go. There's a reclaim. So, if
they base above this, there will

5550
02:12:25,109 --> 02:12:25,119
they base above this, there will
 

5551
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:28,069
they base above this, there will
probably be a high day squeeze out. Now,

5552
02:12:28,069 --> 02:12:28,079
probably be a high day squeeze out. Now,
 

5553
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:29,669
probably be a high day squeeze out. Now,
that's the battle. That's literally how

5554
02:12:29,669 --> 02:12:29,679
that's the battle. That's literally how
 

5555
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:31,750
that's the battle. That's literally how
they battle over an area. That's why

5556
02:12:31,750 --> 02:12:31,760
they battle over an area. That's why
 

5557
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:33,430
they battle over an area. That's why
today I've said I'm not going to trade

5558
02:12:33,430 --> 02:12:33,440
today I've said I'm not going to trade
 

5559
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,589
today I've said I'm not going to trade
the short because there's just not for

5560
02:12:35,589 --> 02:12:35,599
the short because there's just not for
 

5561
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:37,270
the short because there's just not for
me. There's not enough edge in the short

5562
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:37,280
me. There's not enough edge in the short
 

5563
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:39,830
me. There's not enough edge in the short
today. Doesn't mean it doesn't do it,

5564
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:39,840
today. Doesn't mean it doesn't do it,
 

5565
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:42,310
today. Doesn't mean it doesn't do it,
but it just means like is it a favorable

5566
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:42,320
but it just means like is it a favorable
 

5567
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:43,910
but it just means like is it a favorable
short? Is it where I think it has to

5568
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:43,920
short? Is it where I think it has to
 

5569
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,830
short? Is it where I think it has to
happen? No, not really. doesn't have to

5570
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:45,840
happen? No, not really. doesn't have to
 

5571
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:48,629
happen? No, not really. doesn't have to
happen today. It can happen, but the way

5572
02:12:48,629 --> 02:12:48,639
happen today. It can happen, but the way
 

5573
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:50,550
happen today. It can happen, but the way
we've built structure out, you know, am

5574
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:50,560
we've built structure out, you know, am
 

5575
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,229
we've built structure out, you know, am
I going to am I going to like I probably

5576
02:12:52,229 --> 02:12:52,239
I going to am I going to like I probably
 

5577
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:53,430
I going to am I going to like I probably
would have just got stopped out here

5578
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:53,440
would have just got stopped out here
 

5579
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:54,870
would have just got stopped out here
again. Maybe now they're going to do it

5580
02:12:54,870 --> 02:12:54,880
again. Maybe now they're going to do it
 

5581
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:57,430
again. Maybe now they're going to do it
down to 60 and then I've got to argue

5582
02:12:57,430 --> 02:12:57,440
down to 60 and then I've got to argue
 

5583
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:58,950
down to 60 and then I've got to argue
with myself. Am I really looking for 10

5584
02:12:58,950 --> 02:12:58,960
with myself. Am I really looking for 10
 

5585
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,910
with myself. Am I really looking for 10
points and hoping I get 30 points when

5586
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:01,920
points and hoping I get 30 points when
 

5587
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:06,149
points and hoping I get 30 points when
I've had 100 100? Not really. Right. So

5588
02:13:06,149 --> 02:13:06,159
I've had 100 100? Not really. Right. So
 

5589
02:13:06,159 --> 02:13:08,709
I've had 100 100? Not really. Right. So
maybe they do this. Maybe you get lucky

5590
02:13:08,709 --> 02:13:08,719
maybe they do this. Maybe you get lucky
 

5591
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:12,149
maybe they do this. Maybe you get lucky
and come to here. It just fail IB. It's

5592
02:13:12,149 --> 02:13:12,159
and come to here. It just fail IB. It's
 

5593
02:13:12,159 --> 02:13:14,149
and come to here. It just fail IB. It's
kind of nasty. This is like NQ. This is

5594
02:13:14,149 --> 02:13:14,159
kind of nasty. This is like NQ. This is
 

5595
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:15,669
kind of nasty. This is like NQ. This is
how it did me at the lower day. Pop

5596
02:13:15,669 --> 02:13:15,679
how it did me at the lower day. Pop
 

5597
02:13:15,679 --> 02:13:17,669
how it did me at the lower day. Pop
through it and then fades away. So your

5598
02:13:17,669 --> 02:13:17,679
through it and then fades away. So your
 

5599
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:19,510
through it and then fades away. So your
TP if you are in this short and you

5600
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:19,520
TP if you are in this short and you
 

5601
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:21,510
TP if you are in this short and you
really want to take this short your 40

5602
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:21,520
really want to take this short your 40
 

5603
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:23,669
really want to take this short your 40
is here. There you go. And then then 60

5604
02:13:23,669 --> 02:13:23,679
is here. There you go. And then then 60
 

5605
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:26,229
is here. There you go. And then then 60
here. Sorry. And then 40s. Right. These

5606
02:13:26,229 --> 02:13:26,239
here. Sorry. And then 40s. Right. These
 

5607
02:13:26,239 --> 02:13:28,149
here. Sorry. And then 40s. Right. These
are your targets. So TP1 is about to be

5608
02:13:28,149 --> 02:13:28,159
are your targets. So TP1 is about to be
 

5609
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:33,589
are your targets. So TP1 is about to be
hit. TP2 is down into this block here.

5610
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:33,599

 

5611
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:35,910

And did we reject those sellers? Get all

5612
02:13:35,910 --> 02:13:35,920
And did we reject those sellers? Get all
 

5613
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:38,149
And did we reject those sellers? Get all
my screens up. Remember we just talked

5614
02:13:38,149 --> 02:13:38,159
my screens up. Remember we just talked
 

5615
02:13:38,159 --> 02:13:39,430
my screens up. Remember we just talked
about where these sellers were, where

5616
02:13:39,430 --> 02:13:39,440
about where these sellers were, where
 

5617
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:41,189
about where these sellers were, where
these buyers were. Or give me that Ninja

5618
02:13:41,189 --> 02:13:41,199
these buyers were. Or give me that Ninja
 

5619
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:43,669
these buyers were. Or give me that Ninja
Trader screen back.

5620
02:13:43,669 --> 02:13:43,679
Trader screen back.
 

5621
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:46,629
Trader screen back.
No, don't say that's just left. I need

5622
02:13:46,629 --> 02:13:46,639
No, don't say that's just left. I need
 

5623
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:48,390
No, don't say that's just left. I need
it back. There we go. All right. So,

5624
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:48,400
it back. There we go. All right. So,
 

5625
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,830
it back. There we go. All right. So,
that pop up. Where were the buyers

5626
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:49,840
that pop up. Where were the buyers
 

5627
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,189
that pop up. Where were the buyers
caught? We talked about them caught

5628
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:51,199
caught? We talked about them caught
 

5629
02:13:51,199 --> 02:13:54,550
caught? We talked about them caught
above 86s, 85s, and 90s. So, we rejected

5630
02:13:54,550 --> 02:13:54,560
above 86s, 85s, and 90s. So, we rejected
 

5631
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:56,950
above 86s, 85s, and 90s. So, we rejected
that into this imbalance here of 60. See

5632
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:56,960
that into this imbalance here of 60. See
 

5633
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,550
that into this imbalance here of 60. See
the how they're bidding at 60 where the

5634
02:13:58,550 --> 02:13:58,560
the how they're bidding at 60 where the
 

5635
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:01,030
the how they're bidding at 60 where the
buyers came in earlier. We're rebidding

5636
02:14:01,030 --> 02:14:01,040
buyers came in earlier. We're rebidding
 

5637
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:02,790
buyers came in earlier. We're rebidding
60. This is why I'm saying you're going

5638
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:02,800
60. This is why I'm saying you're going
 

5639
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:04,229
60. This is why I'm saying you're going
to take the shorts, you've got to be

5640
02:14:04,229 --> 02:14:04,239
to take the shorts, you've got to be
 

5641
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:06,310
to take the shorts, you've got to be
taking partials into each one of these.

5642
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:06,320
taking partials into each one of these.
 

5643
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:08,390
taking partials into each one of these.
You do not know if it's going to fade.

5644
02:14:08,390 --> 02:14:08,400
You do not know if it's going to fade.
 

5645
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,910
You do not know if it's going to fade.
So you have to respect it because

5646
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:09,920
So you have to respect it because
 

5647
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,870
So you have to respect it because
overall structure is still bullish,

5648
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:12,880
overall structure is still bullish,
 

5649
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,950
overall structure is still bullish,
right? That's your range right now. This

5650
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:14,960
right? That's your range right now. This
 

5651
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:17,669
right? That's your range right now. This
swing low to this swing high. This can

5652
02:14:17,669 --> 02:14:17,679
swing low to this swing high. This can
 

5653
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:19,270
swing low to this swing high. This can
still be protected if they want. If you

5654
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:19,280
still be protected if they want. If you
 

5655
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:26,149
still be protected if they want. If you
get lucky, you will get this.

5656
02:14:26,149 --> 02:14:26,159

02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:27,669

Working hard to try and teach you guys

02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:38,310
Working hard to try and teach you guys
today.

5660
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:38,320

 

5661
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:40,229

No, definitely isn't nothing for free.

5662
02:14:40,229 --> 02:14:40,239
No, definitely isn't nothing for free.
 

5663
02:14:40,239 --> 02:14:45,910
No, definitely isn't nothing for free.
Uh, jockey.

5664
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:45,920

 

5665
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:47,589

Spoofing is illegal. It is, but you've

5666
02:14:47,589 --> 02:14:47,599
Spoofing is illegal. It is, but you've
 

5667
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:49,669
Spoofing is illegal. It is, but you've
got to prove that they're spoofing. And

5668
02:14:49,669 --> 02:14:49,679
got to prove that they're spoofing. And
 

5669
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:50,870
got to prove that they're spoofing. And
it's quite hard to do. They might just

5670
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:50,880
it's quite hard to do. They might just
 

5671
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,310
it's quite hard to do. They might just
be like, "Well, I wanted that price and

5672
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:52,320
be like, "Well, I wanted that price and
 

5673
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,750
be like, "Well, I wanted that price and
then it came up and I didn't want that

5674
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:53,760
then it came up and I didn't want that
 

5675
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,709
then it came up and I didn't want that
price." And you know, yeah, Luna's

5676
02:14:56,709 --> 02:14:56,719
price." And you know, yeah, Luna's
 

5677
02:14:56,719 --> 02:14:58,229
price." And you know, yeah, Luna's
great. She's doing great. Thanks, mate.

5678
02:14:58,229 --> 02:14:58,239
great. She's doing great. Thanks, mate.
 

5679
02:14:58,239 --> 02:14:59,910
great. She's doing great. Thanks, mate.
She's currently asleep in my bed. All

5680
02:14:59,910 --> 02:14:59,920
She's currently asleep in my bed. All
 

5681
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:01,910
She's currently asleep in my bed. All
right. So, maybe you guys will get your

5682
02:15:01,910 --> 02:15:01,920
right. So, maybe you guys will get your
 

5683
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:03,830
right. So, maybe you guys will get your
40s now. So I'd be watching into sort of

5684
02:15:03,830 --> 02:15:03,840
40s now. So I'd be watching into sort of
 

5685
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:06,950
40s now. So I'd be watching into sort of
45 all the way down to 33s. I would be

5686
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:06,960
45 all the way down to 33s. I would be
 

5687
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,830
45 all the way down to 33s. I would be
taking at least 80% off into here. All

5688
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
taking at least 80% off into here. All
 

5689
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,589
taking at least 80% off into here. All
right? Because you are not expecting

5690
02:15:11,589 --> 02:15:11,599
right? Because you are not expecting
 

5691
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:13,990
right? Because you are not expecting
price to move under here today. If you

5692
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:14,000
price to move under here today. If you
 

5693
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,589
price to move under here today. If you
get under there, you'd be very very

5694
02:15:15,589 --> 02:15:15,599
get under there, you'd be very very
 

5695
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:18,790
get under there, you'd be very very
happy. So you've hit TP1. This is TP2.

5696
02:15:18,790 --> 02:15:18,800
happy. So you've hit TP1. This is TP2.
 

5697
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,950
happy. So you've hit TP1. This is TP2.
Buyers became trapped up here. Failed to

02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:20,960
Buyers became trapped up here. Failed to
 

5699
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:22,790
Buyers became trapped up here. Failed to
break higher. It whipped you out

5700
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:22,800
break higher. It whipped you out
 

5701
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,229
break higher. It whipped you out
probably the first time and then dropped

5702
02:15:24,229 --> 02:15:24,239
probably the first time and then dropped
 

5703
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:25,750
probably the first time and then dropped
down because it's NQ and it's a little

5704
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:25,760
down because it's NQ and it's a little
 

5705
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:29,189
down because it's NQ and it's a little
[\h__\h] that way. And now you have to see

5706
02:15:29,189 --> 02:15:29,199
[\h__\h] that way. And now you have to see
 

5707
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:35,430
[\h__\h] that way. And now you have to see
what's what.

5708
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:35,440

 

5709
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:38,069

Uh, it's called City Footprint. It's a

5710
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:38,079
Uh, it's called City Footprint. It's a
 

5711
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:43,990
Uh, it's called City Footprint. It's a
paid indicator.

5712
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:44,000

 

5713
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,390

No worries, guys. Doing my best here.

5714
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:48,400
No worries, guys. Doing my best here.
 

5715

No worries, guys. Doing my best here.
How does one participate in the

5716
02:15:49,669 --> 02:15:49,679
How does one participate in the
 

5717
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:51,750
How does one participate in the
giveaways? Uh, I'll I'll tell you. We

5718
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:51,760
giveaways? Uh, I'll I'll tell you. We
 

5719
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,510
giveaways? Uh, I'll I'll tell you. We
We'll do it in the next 20 minutes or

5720
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:53,520
We'll do it in the next 20 minutes or
 

5721
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:58,069
We'll do it in the next 20 minutes or
so.

5722
02:15:58,069 --> 02:15:58,079

 

5723
02:15:58,079 --> 02:16:00,310

Yeah, it's it's like I said, it's

5724
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:00,320
Yeah, it's it's like I said, it's
 

5725
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:02,390
Yeah, it's it's like I said, it's
definitely possible, right? Think about

5726
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
definitely possible, right? Think about
 

5727
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:05,109
definitely possible, right? Think about
the structure. Ignore all ignore all

5728
02:16:05,109 --> 02:16:05,119
the structure. Ignore all ignore all
 

5729
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:06,229
the structure. Ignore all ignore all
everything else. Think about the

5730
02:16:06,229 --> 02:16:06,239
everything else. Think about the
 

5731
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:08,229
everything else. Think about the
structure.

5732
02:16:08,229 --> 02:16:08,239
structure.
 

5733
02:16:08,239 --> 02:16:13,030
structure.
Main structure.

5734
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:13,040

 

5735
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,629

That's your main structure, right? Until

5736
02:16:14,629 --> 02:16:14,639
That's your main structure, right? Until
 

5737
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:17,350
That's your main structure, right? Until
we break below this, we are still

5738
02:16:17,350 --> 02:16:17,360
we break below this, we are still
 

5739
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:19,270
we break below this, we are still
technically bullish. Okay, this is why

5740
02:16:19,270 --> 02:16:19,280
technically bullish. Okay, this is why
 

5741
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:21,510
technically bullish. Okay, this is why
I'm ignoring this trade. It's exactly

5742
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:21,520
I'm ignoring this trade. It's exactly
 

5743
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:23,350
I'm ignoring this trade. It's exactly
why I'm ignoring this trade. If we were

5744
02:16:23,350 --> 02:16:23,360
why I'm ignoring this trade. If we were
 

5745
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:26,149
why I'm ignoring this trade. If we were
pro if we were protrend down, right, I'd

5746
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:26,159
pro if we were protrend down, right, I'd
 

5747
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:28,310
pro if we were protrend down, right, I'd
be much willing to hit that trade

5748
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:28,320
be much willing to hit that trade
 

5749
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:30,709
be much willing to hit that trade
because the if we did a magnet, it would

5750
02:16:30,709 --> 02:16:30,719
because the if we did a magnet, it would
 

5751
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:32,870
because the if we did a magnet, it would
be much more likely, right, to come down

5752
02:16:32,870 --> 02:16:32,880
be much more likely, right, to come down
 

5753
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:35,429
be much more likely, right, to come down
here if the protrend was lower. Right

5754
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:35,439
here if the protrend was lower. Right
 

5755
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,110
here if the protrend was lower. Right
now, the pro trend is not lower. All

5756
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:37,120
now, the pro trend is not lower. All
 

5757
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,709
now, the pro trend is not lower. All
right, look, we're bidding above

5758
02:16:38,709 --> 02:16:38,719
right, look, we're bidding above
 

5759
02:16:38,719 --> 02:16:40,230
right, look, we're bidding above
previous week value area high. We're

5760
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:40,240
previous week value area high. We're
 

5761
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:42,070
previous week value area high. We're
bidding above previous day value area

5762
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:42,080
bidding above previous day value area
 

5763
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:44,150
bidding above previous day value area
high. We're not even in a rotation. The

5764
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:44,160
high. We're not even in a rotation. The
 

5765
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:46,709
high. We're not even in a rotation. The
rotation was in here, right? We're above

5766
02:16:46,709 --> 02:16:46,719
rotation was in here, right? We're above
 

5767
02:16:46,719 --> 02:16:48,549
rotation was in here, right? We're above
the rotation, right? We're above the

5768
02:16:48,549 --> 02:16:48,559
the rotation, right? We're above the
 

5769
02:16:48,559 --> 02:16:50,870
the rotation, right? We're above the
rotation. The protrend is higher. This

5770
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:50,880
rotation. The protrend is higher. This
 

5771
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,709
rotation. The protrend is higher. This
is why I was saying like you have to

5772
02:16:52,709 --> 02:16:52,719
is why I was saying like you have to
 

5773
02:16:52,719 --> 02:16:54,230
is why I was saying like you have to
take partials counter trend. Remember

5774
02:16:54,230 --> 02:16:54,240
take partials counter trend. Remember
 

5775
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,549
take partials counter trend. Remember
this morning we I went over that example

5776
02:16:56,549 --> 02:16:56,559
this morning we I went over that example
 

5777
02:16:56,559 --> 02:16:59,190
this morning we I went over that example
of drawing what a pro trend on a daily

5778
02:16:59,190 --> 02:16:59,200
of drawing what a pro trend on a daily
 

5779
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:02,709
of drawing what a pro trend on a daily
is right daily

5780
02:17:02,709 --> 02:17:02,719
is right daily
 

5781
02:17:02,719 --> 02:17:05,990
is right daily
hourly

5782
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,000

 

5783
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:13,990

1 minute.

5784
02:17:13,990 --> 02:17:14,000

 

5785
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,629

Right? What you just took is this.

5786
02:17:16,629 --> 02:17:16,639
Right? What you just took is this.
 

5787
02:17:16,639 --> 02:17:17,910
Right? What you just took is this.
Right? If you took that short what you

5788
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:17,920
Right? If you took that short what you
 

5789
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:19,349
Right? If you took that short what you
took is this. But the easier move is

5790
02:17:19,349 --> 02:17:19,359
took is this. But the easier move is
 

5791
02:17:19,359 --> 02:17:21,110
took is this. But the easier move is
higher. Remember we went over that a

5792
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:21,120
higher. Remember we went over that a
 

5793
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:23,270
higher. Remember we went over that a
couple hours ago or an hour ago or so.

5794
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:23,280
couple hours ago or an hour ago or so.
 

5795
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:24,870
couple hours ago or an hour ago or so.
All right, so there you go. Didn't even

5796
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:24,880
All right, so there you go. Didn't even
 

5797
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:26,709
All right, so there you go. Didn't even
get to that 40s, did it? Held in the low

5798
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:26,719
get to that 40s, did it? Held in the low
 

5799
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:28,870
get to that 40s, did it? Held in the low
volume node. Didn't even get down here.

5800
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:28,880
volume node. Didn't even get down here.
 

5801
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,709
volume node. Didn't even get down here.
Held it and reclaimed and reclaimed the

5802
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:30,719
Held it and reclaimed and reclaimed the
 

5803
02:17:30,719 --> 02:17:33,030
Held it and reclaimed and reclaimed the
squeeze. So maybe that can explain to

5804
02:17:33,030 --> 02:17:33,040
squeeze. So maybe that can explain to
 

5805
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:35,910
squeeze. So maybe that can explain to
you the trade, why it's set up, but also

5806
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:35,920
you the trade, why it's set up, but also
 

5807
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:38,230
you the trade, why it's set up, but also
why I didn't take it, why I was

5808
02:17:38,230 --> 02:17:38,240
why I didn't take it, why I was
 

5809
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:47,190
why I didn't take it, why I was
unwilling to take it today.

5810
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:47,200

 

5811
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,030

Fundamentally, there's no reason for NQ

02:17:49,030 --> 02:17:49,040
Fundamentally, there's no reason for NQ
 

5813
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,709
Fundamentally, there's no reason for NQ

02:18:01,509 --> 02:18:01,519
really wish I didn't disagree with it
 

5823
02:18:01,519 --> 02:18:03,509
really wish I didn't disagree with it
because I want the market to do a

5824
02:18:03,509 --> 02:18:03,519
because I want the market to do a
 

5825
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:05,589
because I want the market to do a
gigantic pullback.

5826
02:18:05,589 --> 02:18:05,599
gigantic pullback.
 

5827
02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:08,309
gigantic pullback.
Um, but what you might see is a bunch of

Um, but what you might see is a bunch of
 

5829
02:18:08,319 --> 02:18:10,790
Um, but what you might see is a bunch of
liquidity coming into ENQ um, based on

5830
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:10,800
liquidity coming into ENQ um, based on
 

5831
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:13,830
liquidity coming into ENQ um, based on
what's going on in Asia, especially as

5832
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:13,840
what's going on in Asia, especially as
 

5833
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:16,150
what's going on in Asia, especially as
they position into this week. Hopefully

5834
02:18:16,150 --> 02:18:16,160
they position into this week. Hopefully
 

5835
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:17,910
they position into this week. Hopefully
that doesn't happen. Hopefully we get a

5836
02:18:17,910 --> 02:18:17,920
that doesn't happen. Hopefully we get a
 

5837
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:20,469
that doesn't happen. Hopefully we get a
giant sell-off. I would much rather that

02:18:20,469 --> 02:18:20,479
giant sell-off. I would much rather that
 

5839
02:18:20,479 --> 02:18:23,589

5840
02:18:23,589 --> 02:18:23,599
happens, but uh, yeah, it's very, very,
 

5841
02:18:23,599 --> 02:18:27,030
happens, but uh, yeah, it's very, very,
very, very, very possible um, with

very, very, very possible um, with

02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,030
very, very, very possible um, with
what's going on in Japan that you see

5844
02:18:29,030 --> 02:18:29,040
what's going on in Japan that you see
 

5845
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:30,629
what's going on in Japan that you see
more liquidity coming to the market. I

5846
02:18:30,629 --> 02:18:30,639
more liquidity coming to the market. I
 

5847
02:18:30,639 --> 02:18:32,309
more liquidity coming to the market. I

Trump's comments. I mean, if his cronies

5850
02:18:34,709 --> 02:18:34,719
Trump's comments. I mean, if his cronies
 

5851
02:18:34,719 --> 02:18:36,309
Trump's comments. I mean, if his cronies
based on what he said in Davos last

5852
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:36,319
based on what he said in Davos last
 

5853
02:18:36,319 --> 02:18:38,389
based on what he said in Davos last
week, it's not too dissimilar to what he

02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:38,399
week, it's not too dissimilar to what he
 

5855
02:18:38,399 --> 02:18:40,389
week, it's not too dissimilar to what he
said in April last year when he said buy

5973
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:41,349

5975
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:43,990
And then there's a ton of stops up here
into 950s. All right. So, that that 100

5976
02:21:43,990 --> 02:21:44,000
into 950s. All right. So, that that 100
 

5977

5980
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:48,880
spoofer like I said. So 261 lot buy side
 

5981

Yeah. So, trap sellers came in here as
we started to break underneath this low.

6054
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:29,760
we started to break underneath this low.
 

6055
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:31,030
we started to break underneath this low.
Look at the amount of selling that came

6056
02:23:31,030 --> 02:23:31,040
Look at the amount of selling that came
 

6057
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:32,710
Look at the amount of selling that came
in

6058
02:23:32,710 --> 02:23:32,720
in
 

6059
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:36,150
in
right under 67 down into 50. All these

6060
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:36,160
right under 67 down into 50. All these
 

6061
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:38,469
right under 67 down into 50. All these
sellers got absorbed instantly and now

6062
02:23:38,469 --> 02:23:38,479
sellers got absorbed instantly and now
 

6063
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:39,830
sellers got absorbed instantly and now
they're out the money. So, they are

6064
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:39,840
they're out the money. So, they are
 

6065
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,230
they're out the money. So, they are
causing this squeeze up and we now have

6066
02:23:42,230 --> 02:23:42,240
causing this squeeze up and we now have
 

6067
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:43,590
causing this squeeze up and we now have
a new pivot here. But definitely at

6068
02:23:43,590 --> 02:23:43,600
a new pivot here. But definitely at
 

6069
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:45,030
a new pivot here. But definitely at
these highs, you have some buyers. Look

6070
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:45,040
these highs, you have some buyers. Look
 

6071
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:47,830
these highs, you have some buyers. Look
at these uh 900s and above. So, you're

6072
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:47,840
at these uh 900s and above. So, you're
 

6073
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:48,950
at these uh 900s and above. So, you're
going to need to see this keep

6074
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:48,960
going to need to see this keep
 

6075
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:50,550
going to need to see this keep
auctioning up and then pull back and

6076
02:23:50,550 --> 02:23:50,560
auctioning up and then pull back and
 

6077
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:55,030
auctioning up and then pull back and
rehold the dips because we can see here

6078
02:23:55,030 --> 02:23:55,040
rehold the dips because we can see here
 

6079
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:57,429
rehold the dips because we can see here
strong buying came in with moving point

6080
02:23:57,429 --> 02:23:57,439
strong buying came in with moving point
 

6081
02:23:57,439 --> 02:23:59,270
strong buying came in with moving point
of control higher. I'd say as long as

6082
02:23:59,270 --> 02:23:59,280
of control higher. I'd say as long as
 

6083
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:01,349
of control higher. I'd say as long as
they're holding over 96s or somewhere

6084
02:24:01,349 --> 02:24:01,359
they're holding over 96s or somewhere
 

6085
02:24:01,359 --> 02:24:03,349
they're holding over 96s or somewhere
over there, we should see continuation

6086
02:24:03,349 --> 02:24:03,359
over there, we should see continuation
 

6087
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:05,670
over there, we should see continuation
for a squeeze.

6088
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:05,680

6089
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:06,790

here like we keep talking about 925 and

6100
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:17,680
here like we keep talking about 925 and
 

6101
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:19,830
here like we keep talking about 925 and
then 950.

6102
02:24:19,830 --> 02:24:19,840
then 950.
 

6103
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:21,270
then 950.
And then if you get very lucky today,

6104
02:24:21,270 --> 02:24:21,280
And then if you get very lucky today,
 

6105

way up to 30s at the moment and then

6170
02:25:35,510 --> 02:25:35,520
way up to 30s at the moment and then
 

6171
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:37,190
way up to 30s at the moment and then
through there 950s. All right. And then

6172
02:25:37,190 --> 02:25:37,200
through there 950s. All right. And then
 

6173
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:39,670
through there 950s. All right. And then

over 950s, then my expectation would be
 

6181
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:53,990
over 950s, then my expectation would be
26,000.

Where we've traded through aggressively
 

6397
02:31:20,399 --> 02:31:22,070
Where we've traded through aggressively
very quickly. Where there has not been

02:31:27,990 --> 02:31:28,000
this is price acceptance down here. This

was an area fair value because we traded
 

6405
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:32,389
was an area fair value because we traded
there for a while. Then they deemed it

6406
02:31:32,389 --> 02:31:32,399
there for a while. Then they deemed it
 

6407
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:33,910
there for a while. Then they deemed it
was too cheap. We moved aggressively

6408
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:33,920
was too cheap. We moved aggressively
 

6409
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:36,230
was too cheap. We moved aggressively
away from it. We had an area fair value

6410

deem here. And then they deemed for a
 

6413
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,110
deem here. And then they deemed for a
moment it was too expensive. So we

6414
02:31:39,110 --> 02:31:39,120
moment it was too expensive. So we
 

6415
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:41,110
moment it was too expensive. So we
traded aggressively below it. Here's the

6416
02:31:41,110 --> 02:31:41,120

02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:43,040
low volume. Here's the high volume. Then
 

6419
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:44,790
low volume. Here's the high volume. Then
they went, "No, no, no, no. We've

02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:50,070
back up." Okay, go back up. Trade
sideways. Now we're searching for higher

6426
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:50,080
sideways. Now we're searching for higher
 

6427
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:52,230
sideways. Now we're searching for higher
prices. Now it's in an auction looking

6428
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:52,240
prices. Now it's in an auction looking
 

6429
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:54,230
prices. Now it's in an auction looking
to see are we going to find fair value

6430
02:31:54,230 --> 02:31:54,240
to see are we going to find fair value
 

6431
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:56,710
to see are we going to find fair value
here. Right? If we don't then if we

6432
02:31:56,710 --> 02:31:56,720
here. Right? If we don't then if we
 

6433
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:58,469
here. Right? If we don't then if we
can't find fair value then we'll come

6434
02:31:58,469 --> 02:31:58,479
can't find fair value then we'll come
 

6435
02:31:58,479 --> 02:32:04,710
can't find fair value then we'll come
back down and look for fair value again.

6436
02:32:04,710 --> 02:32:04,720

 

6437
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:06,230

We know there are stops up here at the

6438
02:32:06,230 --> 02:32:06,240
We know there are stops up here at the
 

6439
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:08,150
We know there are stops up here at the
top of the gray box as their next target

6440
02:32:08,150 --> 02:32:08,160
top of the gray box as their next target
 

6441
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:13,510
top of the gray box as their next target
and then over that 26,000.

6442
02:32:13,510 --> 02:32:13,520

 

6443
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:14,790

Hunter Porsche, thank you for your

6444
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:14,800
Hunter Porsche, thank you for your
 

6445
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:17,110
Hunter Porsche, thank you for your
analysis. You are insane. Hopefully you

6446
02:32:17,110 --> 02:32:17,120
analysis. You are insane. Hopefully you
 

6447
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:20,230
analysis. You are insane. Hopefully you
mean insane in a good way.

6448
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:20,240
mean insane in a good way.

So, when am I going to short? Well,

6450
02:32:22,150 --> 02:32:22,160
So, when am I going to short? Well,
 

6451
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:24,150
So, when am I going to short? Well,
right now,

6452
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:24,160
right now,
 

6453
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:25,830
right now,
I can't see a short developing today.

6454
02:32:25,830 --> 02:32:25,840
I can't see a short developing today.
 

6455
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:27,270
I can't see a short developing today.
There might be a counter short down a

6456
02:32:27,270 --> 02:32:27,280
There might be a counter short down a
 

6457
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:29,510
There might be a counter short down a
little bit, but until we let go of all

6458
02:32:29,510 --> 02:32:29,520
little bit, but until we let go of all
 

6459
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:31,750
little bit, but until we let go of all
this volume, until there is a reason for

6460
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:31,760
this volume, until there is a reason for
 

6461
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:34,469
this volume, until there is a reason for
this market to let go of this and this,

6462
02:32:34,469 --> 02:32:34,479
this market to let go of this and this,
 

6463
02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:36,630
this market to let go of this and this,
all right, until there's a failure,

6464
02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:36,640
all right, until there's a failure,
 

6465
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:38,469
all right, until there's a failure,
right, underneath all of this, then

6466
02:32:38,469 --> 02:32:38,479
right, underneath all of this, then
 

6467
02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:40,309
right, underneath all of this, then
there's a rotation back down. But right

6468
02:32:40,309 --> 02:32:40,319
there's a rotation back down. But right
 

6469
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:42,630
there's a rotation back down. But right
now, the only short would be a counter

6470
02:32:42,630 --> 02:32:42,640
now, the only short would be a counter
 

6471
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:44,389
now, the only short would be a counter
trend pullback, right? That's all we're

6472
02:32:44,389 --> 02:32:44,399
trend pullback, right? That's all we're
 

6473
02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:45,670
trend pullback, right? That's all we're
going to that's all that today might

6474
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:45,680
going to that's all that today might
 

6475
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:46,870
going to that's all that today might
offer. If it offers a short, it's

6476
02:32:46,870 --> 02:32:46,880
offer. If it offers a short, it's
 

6477
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:47,830
offer. If it offers a short, it's
probably going to be a counter trend

6478
02:32:47,830 --> 02:32:47,840
probably going to be a counter trend
 

6479
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:49,030
probably going to be a counter trend
pullback. If you get really lucky, it

6480
02:32:49,030 --> 02:32:49,040
pullback. If you get really lucky, it
 

6481
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:50,870
pullback. If you get really lucky, it
comes down there for a continuation. But

6482
02:32:50,870 --> 02:32:50,880
comes down there for a continuation. But
 

6483
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,469
comes down there for a continuation. But
this is the pivot. We are bullish over

6484
02:32:52,469 --> 02:32:52,479
this is the pivot. We are bullish over
 

6485
02:32:52,479 --> 02:32:54,870
this is the pivot. We are bullish over
750 right now.

6486
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:54,880
750 right now.
 

6487
02:32:54,880 --> 02:33:16,230
750 right now.
We are bullish over 750 right now.

6488

6493
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:21,750
now, my friend, just scroll towards the
end of the course and there's a module

6494
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:21,760
end of the course and there's a module
 

6495
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:23,429
end of the course and there's a module
that talks about Discord and then you

6496
02:33:23,429 --> 02:33:23,439
that talks about Discord and then you
 

6497
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:25,510
that talks about Discord and then you
just do what it says in that module and

6498
02:33:25,510 --> 02:33:25,520
just do what it says in that module and
 

6499
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:29,990
just do what it says in that module and
I can add you straight away.

No, I don't think many people use wealth

No, I don't think many people use wealth

6513
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:51,110

But we did get a good IB breakout trade.

6514
02:33:51,110 --> 02:33:51,120
But we did get a good IB breakout trade.
 

6515

But we did get a good IB breakout trade.
I didn't take it. What should I have

6516
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:52,640
I didn't take it. What should I have
 

6517
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:54,150
I didn't take it. What should I have
been looking for to possibly take it

6518
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,160
been looking for to possibly take it
 

6519
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:57,190
been looking for to possibly take it
next time? Just that mini flag

6520
02:33:57,190 --> 02:33:57,200
next time? Just that mini flag
 

6521
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:58,710
next time? Just that mini flag
once we reclaimed. I mean, it's not

6522
02:33:58,710 --> 02:33:58,720
once we reclaimed. I mean, it's not
 

6523
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,910
once we reclaimed. I mean, it's not
ideal because we are so close to to uh

6524
02:34:01,910 --> 02:34:01,920
ideal because we are so close to to uh
 

6525
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:04,389
ideal because we are so close to to uh
TPS here, right? Because you've set up

6526
02:34:04,389 --> 02:34:04,399
TPS here, right? Because you've set up
 

6527
02:34:04,399 --> 02:34:06,790
TPS here, right? Because you've set up
the IB here. All right. And your target

6528
02:34:06,790 --> 02:34:06,800
the IB here. All right. And your target
 

6529
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:09,830
the IB here. All right. And your target
is one, two, three. It's not ideal. I'm

6530
02:34:09,830 --> 02:34:09,840
is one, two, three. It's not ideal. I'm
 

6531
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:11,670
is one, two, three. It's not ideal. I'm
going to be honest with you. What would

6532
02:34:11,670 --> 02:34:11,680
going to be honest with you. What would
 

6533
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:13,190
going to be honest with you. What would
a better IB have been? Well, if we

6534
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:13,200
a better IB have been? Well, if we
 

6535
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:14,790
a better IB have been? Well, if we
hadn't taken low for hanging through,

6536
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:14,800
hadn't taken low for hanging through,
 

6537
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:18,870
hadn't taken low for hanging through,
let's say IB was here,

6538
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:18,880
let's say IB was here,
 

6539
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:20,469
let's say IB was here,
right?

6540
02:34:20,469 --> 02:34:20,479
right?
 

6541
02:34:20,479 --> 02:34:22,309
right?
That would have been a good IB trade

6542
02:34:22,309 --> 02:34:22,319
That would have been a good IB trade
 

6543
02:34:22,319 --> 02:34:24,230
That would have been a good IB trade
because you got room. I would say the IB

6544
02:34:24,230 --> 02:34:24,240
because you got room. I would say the IB
 

6545
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:26,469
because you got room. I would say the IB
trade today, although bullish, right?

6546
02:34:26,469 --> 02:34:26,479
trade today, although bullish, right?
 

6547
02:34:26,479 --> 02:34:29,110
trade today, although bullish, right?
This is the same thing, right? Look, I

6548
02:34:29,110 --> 02:34:29,120
This is the same thing, right? Look, I
 

6549
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:30,870
This is the same thing, right? Look, I
want you to see these traps that we talk

6550
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:30,880
want you to see these traps that we talk
 

6551
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:36,389
want you to see these traps that we talk
about.

your t your long trigger. But you

your t your long trigger. But you
 

6561
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:49,510
your t your long trigger. But you
haven't got much room which is the

02:34:49,510 --> 02:34:49,520
haven't got much room which is the
 

6563
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:51,349
haven't got much room which is the
problem now. You're buying premium to

6564
02:34:51,349 --> 02:34:51,359
problem now. You're buying premium to
 

6565
02:34:51,359 --> 02:34:53,030
problem now. You're buying premium to
sell premium. What you want to do is buy

And really really we were buying

6570
02:34:58,710 --> 02:34:58,720
And really really we were buying
 

6571
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:01,110
And really really we were buying
previous days fair value actually and

02:35:01,110 --> 02:35:01,120
previous days fair value actually and

then we actually bought premium but now

6574
02:35:04,230 --> 02:35:04,240
then we actually bought premium but now
 

6575
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:17,190
then we actually bought premium but now
we're deep in premium.

6577
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:18,950

No, they're not really order blocks.

they're where stops have been placed.

6582
02:35:24,309 --> 02:35:24,319
they're where stops have been placed.
 

6583
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:26,790
they're where stops have been placed.
They're they're high volume nodes. I

6584
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:26,800
They're they're high volume nodes. I
 

6585
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:37,030
They're they're high volume nodes. I
mean, you could call them that, I guess.

6586
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:37,040

 

6587
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:38,950

How is the gray box level determined

6588
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:38,960
How is the gray box level determined
 

6589
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:46,630
How is the gray box level determined
based on volume?

6590
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:46,640

 

6591
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:49,110

Alex, I heard a guy recently made 900ks

6592
02:35:49,110 --> 02:35:49,120
Alex, I heard a guy recently made 900ks
 

6593
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:53,030
Alex, I heard a guy recently made 900ks
in two days on TPT over 550k accounts

6594
02:35:53,030 --> 02:35:53,040
in two days on TPT over 550k accounts
 

6595
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:54,550
in two days on TPT over 550k accounts
and managed to cash it out with no

6596
02:35:54,550 --> 02:35:54,560
and managed to cash it out with no
 

6597
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:57,429
and managed to cash it out with no
problems.

6598
02:35:57,429 --> 02:35:57,439
problems.
 

6599
02:35:57,439 --> 02:35:59,030
problems.
What do you think's the ideal scenario

6600
02:35:59,030 --> 02:35:59,040
What do you think's the ideal scenario
 

6601
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:01,110
What do you think's the ideal scenario
and contract number would be needed? I

6602
02:36:01,110 --> 02:36:01,120
and contract number would be needed? I
 

6603
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:02,230
and contract number would be needed? I
don't think you can do that unless he's

6604
02:36:02,230 --> 02:36:02,240
don't think you can do that unless he's
 

6605
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:04,309
don't think you can do that unless he's
on a live they would they would they

6606
02:36:04,309 --> 02:36:04,319
on a live they would they would they
 

6607
02:36:04,319 --> 02:36:07,429
on a live they would they would they
will cash you out at um 10k each account

6608
02:36:07,429 --> 02:36:07,439
will cash you out at um 10k each account
 

6609
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:09,750
will cash you out at um 10k each account
and maybe if they moved him to live they

6610
02:36:09,750 --> 02:36:09,760
and maybe if they moved him to live they
 

6611
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:11,349
and maybe if they moved him to live they
they would have done it. If he was on a

6612
02:36:11,349 --> 02:36:11,359
they would have done it. If he was on a
 

6613
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:13,349
they would have done it. If he was on a
live then yeah for sure he could have

6614
02:36:13,349 --> 02:36:13,359
live then yeah for sure he could have
 

6615
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:16,389
live then yeah for sure he could have
done it.

6616
02:36:16,389 --> 02:36:16,399
done it.
 

6617
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:18,630
done it.
Uh what do you think the ideal scenario

6618
02:36:18,630 --> 02:36:18,640
Uh what do you think the ideal scenario
 

6619
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:20,150
Uh what do you think the ideal scenario
and contract number would be needed?

6620
02:36:20,150 --> 02:36:20,160
and contract number would be needed?
 

6621
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,110
and contract number would be needed?
Well they would have had to be well

6622
02:36:21,110 --> 02:36:21,120
Well they would have had to be well
 

6623
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:24,070
Well they would have had to be well
above their buffer and scaled in to a

6624
02:36:24,070 --> 02:36:24,080
above their buffer and scaled in to a
 

6625
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:27,190
above their buffer and scaled in to a
trend day. So if if they were, you know,

6626
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:27,200
trend day. So if if they were, you know,
 

6627
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:29,830
trend day. So if if they were, you know,
today wouldn't have been bad if they

6628
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:29,840
today wouldn't have been bad if they
 

6629
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:32,950
today wouldn't have been bad if they
were trading GlobeEx.

6630
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:32,960
were trading GlobeEx.
 

6631
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:37,830
were trading GlobeEx.
So if they did bought this, for example,

6632
02:36:37,830 --> 02:36:37,840
So if they did bought this, for example,
 

6633
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:40,630
So if they did bought this, for example,
and then rebid this and then rebid this

6634
02:36:40,630 --> 02:36:40,640
and then rebid this and then rebid this
 

6635
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:42,230
and then rebid this and then rebid this
and they have a core position down here

6636
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:42,240
and they have a core position down here
 

6637
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:45,190
and they have a core position down here
with some big size. So they're 500 and

6638
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:45,200
with some big size. So they're 500 and
 

6639
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,670
with some big size. So they're 500 and
they're 400 points higher, right? With

6640
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:47,680
they're 400 points higher, right? With
 

6641
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:50,230
they're 400 points higher, right? With
some big size. That will do it. And if

6642
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:50,240
some big size. That will do it. And if
 

6643
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:52,150
some big size. That will do it. And if
we keep going, that'll do it even more.

6644
02:36:52,150 --> 02:36:52,160
we keep going, that'll do it even more.
 

6645
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:54,870
we keep going, that'll do it even more.
But I mean, just don't worry about it.

6646
02:36:54,870 --> 02:36:54,880
But I mean, just don't worry about it.
 

6647
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:56,630
But I mean, just don't worry about it.
Just focus on your setup. Don't worry

6648
02:36:56,630 --> 02:36:56,640
Just focus on your setup. Don't worry
 

6649
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:59,030
Just focus on your setup. Don't worry
about all of that.

6650
02:36:59,030 --> 02:36:59,040
about all of that.
 

6651
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:01,190
about all of that.
Okay. So, gray box getting tagged.

6652
02:37:01,190 --> 02:37:01,200
Okay. So, gray box getting tagged.
 

6653
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:03,110
Okay. So, gray box getting tagged.
Here's your shelf here. Again, buyers

6654
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:03,120
Here's your shelf here. Again, buyers
 

6655
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:06,630
Here's your shelf here. Again, buyers
will now want to defend this into here.

6656
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:06,640
will now want to defend this into here.
 

6657
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:08,070
will now want to defend this into here.
Right? This is your sentiment for the

6658
02:37:08,070 --> 02:37:08,080
Right? This is your sentiment for the
 

6659
02:37:08,080 --> 02:37:10,550
Right? This is your sentiment for the
day. Buyers must defend this. If they

6660
02:37:10,550 --> 02:37:10,560
day. Buyers must defend this. If they
 

6661
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:12,870
day. Buyers must defend this. If they
start failing to defend that, then maybe

6662
02:37:12,870 --> 02:37:12,880
start failing to defend that, then maybe
 

6663
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:15,030
start failing to defend that, then maybe
there's a rotation, but I'll again be

6664
02:37:15,030 --> 02:37:15,040
there's a rotation, but I'll again be
 

6665
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:18,070
there's a rotation, but I'll again be
somewhat cautious today. I'm definitely

6666
02:37:18,070 --> 02:37:18,080
somewhat cautious today. I'm definitely
 

6667
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:19,750
somewhat cautious today. I'm definitely
done for the day. 15 minutes left. I

6668
02:37:19,750 --> 02:37:19,760
done for the day. 15 minutes left. I
 

6669
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:21,190
done for the day. 15 minutes left. I
want to do some giveaways. How we doing

6670
02:37:21,190 --> 02:37:21,200
want to do some giveaways. How we doing
 

6671

Woff, same same kind of thing, right?

6678
02:37:48,070 --> 02:37:48,080

 

6679
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:49,990

My plan is to show up every day with

6680
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:50,000
My plan is to show up every day with
 

6681
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,070
My plan is to show up every day with
you. Maybe I can win a volume course

6682
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:52,080
you. Maybe I can win a volume course
 

6683
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:53,590
you. Maybe I can win a volume course
with Discord. Oh, we don't give away

6684
02:37:53,590 --> 02:37:53,600
with Discord. Oh, we don't give away
 

6685
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:55,349
with Discord. Oh, we don't give away
those courses. This is only like the

6686
02:37:55,349 --> 02:37:55,359
those courses. This is only like the
 

6687
02:37:55,359 --> 02:37:58,389
those courses. This is only like the
introduction courses.

6688
02:37:58,389 --> 02:37:58,399
introduction courses.
 

6689
02:37:58,399 --> 02:38:05,990
introduction courses.
Sorry, too too invaluable those.

6690
02:38:05,990 --> 02:38:06,000

 

6691
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,510

Uh yeah, it's very possible he was a

6692
02:38:07,510 --> 02:38:07,520
Uh yeah, it's very possible he was a
 

6693
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:08,710
Uh yeah, it's very possible he was a
swing. He could have been a swing long

6694
02:38:08,710 --> 02:38:08,720
swing. He could have been a swing long
 

6695
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:10,469
swing. He could have been a swing long
buyer. The guy selling 900. Yeah, very

6696
02:38:10,469 --> 02:38:10,479
buyer. The guy selling 900. Yeah, very
 

6697
02:38:10,479 --> 02:38:16,710
buyer. The guy selling 900. Yeah, very
very possible. Very possible.

6698
02:38:16,710 --> 02:38:16,720

 

6699
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:19,429

Overall market not in sync. Um, you've

6700
02:38:19,429 --> 02:38:19,439
Overall market not in sync. Um, you've
 

6701
02:38:19,439 --> 02:38:20,790
Overall market not in sync. Um, you've
probably just got a sector like a little

6702
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:20,800
probably just got a sector like a little
 

6703
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:28,150
probably just got a sector like a little
bit weaker. Let's have a look.

6704
02:38:28,150 --> 02:38:28,160

 

6705
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:30,469

Uh, energy. So, energy today is a bit

6706
02:38:30,469 --> 02:38:30,479
Uh, energy. So, energy today is a bit
 

6707
02:38:30,479 --> 02:38:32,790
Uh, energy. So, energy today is a bit
weaker. All right. So, you got Exxon,

6708
02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:32,800
weaker. All right. So, you got Exxon,
 

6709
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:35,190
weaker. All right. So, you got Exxon,
COP, VLOO,

6710
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:35,200
COP, VLOO,
 

6711
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:36,950
COP, VLOO,
um,

6712
02:38:36,950 --> 02:38:36,960
um,
 

6713
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:41,590
um,
FNG, KMI, MPC, all down on the day. So,

6714
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:41,600
FNG, KMI, MPC, all down on the day. So,
 

6715
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:44,710
FNG, KMI, MPC, all down on the day. So,
that's the sector showing weakness. Um,

6716
02:38:44,710 --> 02:38:44,720
that's the sector showing weakness. Um,
 

6717
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:46,150
that's the sector showing weakness. Um,
nothing really out. Some of the semis

6718
02:38:46,150 --> 02:38:46,160
nothing really out. Some of the semis
 

6719
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:47,750
nothing really out. Some of the semis
are down a little bit. Nvidia a little

6720
02:38:47,750 --> 02:38:47,760
are down a little bit. Nvidia a little
 

6721
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:50,389
are down a little bit. Nvidia a little
bit red. MU, AMD, INTC all red, but

6722
02:38:50,389 --> 02:38:50,399
bit red. MU, AMD, INTC all red, but
 

6723
02:38:50,399 --> 02:38:52,630
bit red. MU, AMD, INTC all red, but
they're being outpriced by the size of

6724
02:38:52,630 --> 02:38:52,640
they're being outpriced by the size of
 

6725
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,710
they're being outpriced by the size of
Apple, Google, Meta, Oracle, and

6726
02:38:54,710 --> 02:38:54,720
Apple, Google, Meta, Oracle, and
 

6727
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:57,190
Apple, Google, Meta, Oracle, and
Microsoft moves. All of those bigger.

6728
02:38:57,190 --> 02:38:57,200
Microsoft moves. All of those bigger.
 

6729
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:59,429
Microsoft moves. All of those bigger.
Um, and Tesla also red. But yeah, the

6730
02:38:59,429 --> 02:38:59,439
Um, and Tesla also red. But yeah, the
 

6731
02:38:59,439 --> 02:39:01,510
Um, and Tesla also red. But yeah, the
breadth I guess industrials are down a

6732
02:39:01,510 --> 02:39:01,520
breadth I guess industrials are down a
 

6733
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:03,670
breadth I guess industrials are down a
little bit. Farm down a bit. A little

6734
02:39:03,670 --> 02:39:03,680
little bit. Farm down a bit. A little
 

6735
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:06,950
little bit. Farm down a bit. A little

Give you guys a couple minutes to do

6960
02:46:40,950 --> 02:46:40,960
Give you guys a couple minutes to do
 

6961
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:42,070
Give you guys a couple minutes to do
that. As you can see, we're still

6962
02:46:42,070 --> 02:46:42,080
that. As you can see, we're still
 

6963
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:43,349
that. As you can see, we're still
holding the gray box. You see why

6964
02:46:43,349 --> 02:46:43,359
holding the gray box. You see why
 

6965
02:46:43,359 --> 02:46:45,030
holding the gray box. You see why
there's no shorts for me? We're still

6966
02:46:45,030 --> 02:46:45,040
there's no shorts for me? We're still
 

6967
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:46,950
there's no shorts for me? We're still
holding the edge of this node, right?

6968
02:46:46,950 --> 02:46:46,960
holding the edge of this node, right?
 

6969
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:49,990
holding the edge of this node, right?
Every single dip today so far is being

6970
02:46:49,990 --> 02:46:50,000
Every single dip today so far is being
 

6971
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,389
Every single dip today so far is being
absorbed. Until that changes, for me,

6972
02:46:52,389 --> 02:46:52,399
absorbed. Until that changes, for me,
 

6973
02:46:52,399 --> 02:46:54,150
absorbed. Until that changes, for me,
there's probably no edge short side. If

6974
02:46:54,150 --> 02:46:54,160
there's probably no edge short side. If
 

6975
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:55,830
there's probably no edge short side. If
that changes and the sentiment changes,

6976
02:46:55,830 --> 02:46:55,840
that changes and the sentiment changes,
 

6977
02:46:55,840 --> 02:47:03,670
that changes and the sentiment changes,
then maybe there's a bit of edge.

6978
02:47:03,670 --> 02:47:03,680

 

6979
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:06,070

And you've got what about 8 minutes left

6980
02:47:06,070 --> 02:47:06,080
And you've got what about 8 minutes left
 

6981
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:52,469
And you've got what about 8 minutes left
to get into

6982
02:47:52,469 --> 02:47:52,479

 

6983
02:47:52,479 --> 02:47:57,510

Alex, do you like the break and retest

6986
02:47:59,510 --> 02:47:59,520
Alex, do you like the break and retest
 

6987
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:02,550
Alex, do you like the break and retest
of the naked PC? Um, we've kind of

6988
02:48:02,550 --> 02:48:02,560
of the naked PC? Um, we've kind of
 

6989
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:05,269
of the naked PC? Um, we've kind of
already Oh, you mean to the downside or

6990
02:48:05,269 --> 02:48:05,279
already Oh, you mean to the downside or
 

6991
02:48:05,279 --> 02:48:07,190
already Oh, you mean to the downside or
the upside?

6992
02:48:07,190 --> 02:48:07,200
the upside?
 

6993
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:09,590
the upside?
Yeah. I mean, look, this the only thing

6994
02:48:09,590 --> 02:48:09,600
Yeah. I mean, look, this the only thing
 

6995
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:10,870
Yeah. I mean, look, this the only thing
that would per my interest and I don't

6996
02:48:10,870 --> 02:48:10,880
that would per my interest and I don't
 

6997
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:12,070
that would per my interest and I don't
think I'm going to trade it would be

6998
02:48:12,070 --> 02:48:12,080
think I'm going to trade it would be
 

6999
02:48:12,080 --> 02:48:14,070
think I'm going to trade it would be
this, which is the old naked PC would be

7000
02:48:14,070 --> 02:48:14,080
this, which is the old naked PC would be
 

7001
02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:15,830
this, which is the old naked PC would be
to trade under it, get stuck in this

7002
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:15,840
to trade under it, get stuck in this
 

7003
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:18,150
to trade under it, get stuck in this
kind of node here and rotate down. But

7004
02:48:18,150 --> 02:48:18,160
kind of node here and rotate down. But
 

7005
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:19,110
kind of node here and rotate down. But
even then, you're going to have to

7006
02:48:19,110 --> 02:48:19,120
even then, you're going to have to
 

7007
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:21,190
even then, you're going to have to
respect everything we've built out.

7008
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:21,200
respect everything we've built out.
 

7009
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:23,269
respect everything we've built out.
We're very, very, very bullish for the

7010
02:48:23,269 --> 02:48:23,279
We're very, very, very bullish for the
 

7011
02:48:23,279 --> 02:48:24,710
We're very, very, very bullish for the
day. All right, this is just like a

7012
02:48:24,710 --> 02:48:24,720
day. All right, this is just like a
 

7013
02:48:24,720 --> 02:48:27,590
day. All right, this is just like a
straight grind. All right, trying to

7014
02:48:27,590 --> 02:48:27,600
straight grind. All right, trying to
 

7015
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:29,030
straight grind. All right, trying to
come higher. All right, if they let go

7016
02:48:29,030 --> 02:48:29,040
come higher. All right, if they let go
 

7017
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:30,469
come higher. All right, if they let go
of this, maybe there's a pull back into

7018
02:48:30,469 --> 02:48:30,479
of this, maybe there's a pull back into
 

7019
02:48:30,479 --> 02:48:32,150
of this, maybe there's a pull back into
it. Again, this is still counter trend.

7020
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:32,160
it. Again, this is still counter trend.
 

7021
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:33,990
it. Again, this is still counter trend.
We are not pro 10 short until we get

7022
02:48:33,990 --> 02:48:34,000
We are not pro 10 short until we get
 

7023
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:37,349
We are not pro 10 short until we get
underneath all of this, right? Really,

7024
02:48:37,349 --> 02:48:37,359
underneath all of this, right? Really,
 

7025
02:48:37,359 --> 02:48:38,870
underneath all of this, right? Really,
and even on the weekly, it's got to let

7026
02:48:38,870 --> 02:48:38,880
and even on the weekly, it's got to let
 

7027
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:41,910
and even on the weekly, it's got to let
go of 300, but maybe under 700, there's

7028
02:48:41,910 --> 02:48:41,920
go of 300, but maybe under 700, there's
 

7029
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:45,830
go of 300, but maybe under 700, there's
a 550 rotation. Under 550, there's a 200

7030
02:48:45,830 --> 02:48:45,840
a 550 rotation. Under 550, there's a 200
 

7031
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:48,230
a 550 rotation. Under 550, there's a 200
rotation. But really, anything here can

7032
02:48:48,230 --> 02:48:48,240
rotation. But really, anything here can
 

7033
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:49,429
rotation. But really, anything here can
still be a pullback. So, if you're going

7034
02:48:49,429 --> 02:48:49,439
still be a pullback. So, if you're going
 

7035
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:50,630
still be a pullback. So, if you're going
to take the short today, you're going to

7036
02:48:50,630 --> 02:48:50,640
to take the short today, you're going to
 

7037
02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:56,309
to take the short today, you're going to
have to be very, very careful.

7038
02:48:56,309 --> 02:48:56,319

 

7039
02:48:56,319 --> 02:48:57,590

All right, I'm going to pull this winner

7040
02:48:57,590 --> 02:48:57,600
All right, I'm going to pull this winner
 

7041
02:48:57,600 --> 02:49:04,389
All right, I'm going to pull this winner
in five, four, three, two, one.

7042
02:49:04,389 --> 02:49:04,399
in five, four, three, two, one.
 

7043
02:49:04,399 --> 02:49:08,630
in five, four, three, two, one.

7202
02:53:40,710 --> 02:53:40,720
through it. There we go. If they
 

7203
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:43,670
through it. There we go. If they
continue to hold this gray box, right,

7204
02:53:43,670 --> 02:53:43,680
continue to hold this gray box, right,
 

7205
02:53:43,680 --> 02:53:44,950
continue to hold this gray box, right,
then you're looking for extension up

7206
02:53:44,950 --> 02:53:44,960
then you're looking for extension up
 

7207
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:46,950
then you're looking for extension up
into here. But, you know, I'm not going

7208
02:53:46,950 --> 02:53:46,960
into here. But, you know, I'm not going
 

7209
02:53:46,960 --> 02:53:48,389
into here. But, you know, I'm not going
to buy that cuz we're buying, remember,

7210
02:53:48,389 --> 02:53:48,399
to buy that cuz we're buying, remember,
 

7211
02:53:48,399 --> 02:53:50,630
to buy that cuz we're buying, remember,
we were buying today here, here, and

7212
02:53:50,630 --> 02:53:50,640
we were buying today here, here, and
 

7213
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:52,309
we were buying today here, here, and
here. I don't really want to buy this

7214
02:53:52,309 --> 02:53:52,319
here. I don't really want to buy this
 

7215
02:53:52,319 --> 02:53:53,830
here. I don't really want to buy this
for this. We bought this for this, and

7216
02:53:53,830 --> 02:53:53,840
for this. We bought this for this, and
 

7217
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:55,590
for this. We bought this for this, and
we bought this for this, and we bought

7218
02:53:55,590 --> 02:53:55,600
we bought this for this, and we bought
 

7219
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:57,190
we bought this for this, and we bought
this for this. We don't really want to

7220
02:53:57,190 --> 02:53:57,200
this for this. We don't really want to
 

7221
02:53:57,200 --> 02:53:59,750
this for this. We don't really want to
buy up here. But if you are adamant on

7222
02:53:59,750 --> 02:53:59,760
buy up here. But if you are adamant on
 

7223
02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:01,830
buy up here. But if you are adamant on
adding to your position or or looking

7224
02:54:01,830 --> 02:54:01,840
adding to your position or or looking
 

7225
02:54:01,840 --> 02:54:04,550
adding to your position or or looking
for a new trade, then that is what you

7226
02:54:04,550 --> 02:54:04,560
for a new trade, then that is what you
 

7227
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:07,030
for a new trade, then that is what you
can look for. If we lose this gray box,

7228
02:54:07,030 --> 02:54:07,040
can look for. If we lose this gray box,
 

7229
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:10,469
can look for. If we lose this gray box,
right? If we lose

7230
02:54:10,469 --> 02:54:10,479
right? If we lose
 

7231
02:54:10,479 --> 02:54:13,429
right? If we lose
under here and we stay heavy, there is

7232
02:54:13,429 --> 02:54:13,439
under here and we stay heavy, there is
 

7233
02:54:13,439 --> 02:54:15,750
under here and we stay heavy, there is
potentially a rotation into VWAP into

7234
02:54:15,750 --> 02:54:15,760
potentially a rotation into VWAP into
 

7235
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:17,429
potentially a rotation into VWAP into
this node here and previous week value

7236
02:54:17,429 --> 02:54:17,439
this node here and previous week value
 

7237
02:54:17,439 --> 02:54:19,190
this node here and previous week value
area high. They might very well rebid

7238
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:19,200
area high. They might very well rebid
 

7239
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:20,870
area high. They might very well rebid
off that again. If they don't rebid off

7240
02:54:20,870 --> 02:54:20,880
off that again. If they don't rebid off
 

7241
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:22,389
off that again. If they don't rebid off
that, you're looking for next target

7242
02:54:22,389 --> 02:54:22,399
that, you're looking for next target
 

7243
02:54:22,399 --> 02:54:24,469
that, you're looking for next target
down current day and previous day value

7244
02:54:24,469 --> 02:54:24,479
down current day and previous day value
 

7245
02:54:24,479 --> 02:54:27,030
down current day and previous day value
area high. If they lose that then all

7246
02:54:27,030 --> 02:54:27,040
area high. If they lose that then all
 

7247
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:28,550
area high. If they lose that then all
the way down into here. I would very

7248
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:28,560
the way down into here. I would very
 

7249
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:29,990
the way down into here. I would very
much doubt we see that. I would imagine

7250
02:54:29,990 --> 02:54:30,000
much doubt we see that. I would imagine
 

7251
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:33,190
much doubt we see that. I would imagine
they will either bid this or bid this.

7252
02:54:33,190 --> 02:54:33,200
they will either bid this or bid this.
 

7253
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:35,910
they will either bid this or bid this.

7257
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:41,590
800s but is NQ maybe. I would love to be
a buy down here later in the week now.

7258
02:54:41,590 --> 02:54:41,600
a buy down here later in the week now.
