Wasn't as uh bad as expected. And you
 

19
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,110
Wasn't as uh bad as expected. And you
can see we're seeing weakness in the

20
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
can see we're seeing weakness in the
 

21
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,550
can see we're seeing weakness in the
market. If you didn't know, over the

22
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
market. If you didn't know, over the

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
weekend, tensions started to rise
 

25
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,470
weekend, tensions started to rise
between America and the rest of Europe

26
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
between America and the rest of Europe
 

27
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,350
between America and the rest of Europe

positioning on Greenland and threaten
them back. He said, "Well, I'll tariff

32
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
them back. He said, "Well, I'll tariff
 

33
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,030
them back. He said, "Well, I'll tariff
you then." And so, this is what we're

34
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
you then." And so, this is what we're
 

35
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,509
you then." And so, this is what we're
we're now getting as a result. Um, back

36
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
we're now getting as a result. Um, back
 

37
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,470
we're now getting as a result. Um, back
into tariff wars, it seems. What are we

38
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
into tariff wars, it seems. What are we
 

39
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,750
into tariff wars, it seems. What are we
doing? Well, we're leaving this low

40
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
doing? Well, we're leaving this low
 

41
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,350
doing? Well, we're leaving this low
volume node. You we can see these

42
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
volume node. You we can see these
 

43
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,509
volume node. You we can see these
clusters here. We failed to break out.

44
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
clusters here. We failed to break out.
 

45
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,509
clusters here. We failed to break out.
All right. So,

46
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
All right. So,
 

47
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,269
All right. So,
this is starting to break. We went over

48
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
this is starting to break. We went over
 

49
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,870
this is starting to break. We went over
this last week. this wedge pattern and

50
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
this last week. this wedge pattern and
 

51
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,430
this last week. this wedge pattern and
we're starting to leave 5day, 20-day,

52
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
we're starting to leave 5day, 20-day,
 

53
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,590
we're starting to leave 5day, 20-day,
50-day all stuck in the lower volume

54
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
50-day all stuck in the lower volume
 

55
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,070
50-day all stuck in the lower volume
node above in and around the sort of

56
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
node above in and around the sort of
 

57
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,630
node above in and around the sort of
650s and we've come down back towards

58
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
650s and we've come down back towards
 

59
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,389
650s and we've come down back towards
this naked point of control that we

60
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
this naked point of control that we
 

61
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,070
this naked point of control that we
talked about. Uh I'll go over this in

62
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
talked about. Uh I'll go over this in
 

63
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,910
talked about. Uh I'll go over this in
the higher time frame. This is all from

64
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
the higher time frame. This is all from
 

65
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,430
the higher time frame. This is all from
the weekly newsletter and you can see

66
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
the weekly newsletter and you can see
 

67
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,190
the weekly newsletter and you can see
where we're finding a bid for now.

68
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
where we're finding a bid for now.
 

69
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,790
where we're finding a bid for now.
Right. If we start to lose this bid,

70
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
Right. If we start to lose this bid,
 

71
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,790
Right. If we start to lose this bid,
whether it's today or later in in the

72
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
whether it's today or later in in the
 

73
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,630
whether it's today or later in in the
week, then we've got some clear targets

74
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
week, then we've got some clear targets
 

75
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,350
week, then we've got some clear targets
down below the lower Ballinger band,

76
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
down below the lower Ballinger band,
 

77
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,030
down below the lower Ballinger band,
next low volume node, 24,800s, even this

78
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
next low volume node, 24,800s, even this
 

79
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,990
next low volume node, 24,800s, even this
200 day. Everything's possible.

80
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
200 day. Everything's possible.
 

81
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,190
200 day. Everything's possible.
So, we're definitely starting to leave

82
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
So, we're definitely starting to leave
 

83
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,389
So, we're definitely starting to leave
it. The question is, are we going to

84
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
it. The question is, are we going to
 

85
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,710
it. The question is, are we going to
reject here this morning or because this

86
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
reject here this morning or because this
 

87
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,150
reject here this morning or because this
is such a big drop, are we now looking

88
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
is such a big drop, are we now looking
 

89
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,790
is such a big drop, are we now looking
at a sideways movement? Time will tell.

90
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
at a sideways movement? Time will tell.
 

91
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,430
at a sideways movement? Time will tell.
Let's look at the higher time frames,

92
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
Let's look at the higher time frames,
 

93
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,550
Let's look at the higher time frames,
and you can see what we've got. All

94
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
and you can see what we've got. All
 

95
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,949
and you can see what we've got. All
right, here's the gap down uh from

96
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
right, here's the gap down uh from
 

97
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,110
right, here's the gap down uh from
Friday to Sunday. This is yesterday's

98
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
Friday to Sunday. This is yesterday's
 

99
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,509
Friday to Sunday. This is yesterday's
price and you can see this was the key

100
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
price and you can see this was the key
 

101
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,790
price and you can see this was the key
level that we were looking for an

102
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
level that we were looking for an
 

103
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,430
level that we were looking for an
overunder in 25300. This is what we

104
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
overunder in 25300. This is what we
 

105
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,710
overunder in 25300. This is what we
talked about in the newsletter. All

106
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
talked about in the newsletter. All
 

107
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,310
talked about in the newsletter. All
right, we're expecting that drop down to

108
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
right, we're expecting that drop down to
 

109
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,910
right, we're expecting that drop down to
there. Then what happens? Well, we're

110
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
there. Then what happens? Well, we're
 

111
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,389
there. Then what happens? Well, we're
starting to lose it. All right, we're

112
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
starting to lose it. All right, we're
 

113
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,590
starting to lose it. All right, we're
starting to lose it. If we look at the

114
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
starting to lose it. If we look at the
 

115
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,230
starting to lose it. If we look at the
volume we created yesterday, it was in

116
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
volume we created yesterday, it was in
 

117
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,069
volume we created yesterday, it was in
here. If we look at the current

118
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
here. If we look at the current
 

119
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,630
here. If we look at the current
developing profile, it's here. And we're

120
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
developing profile, it's here. And we're
 

121
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,550
developing profile, it's here. And we're
not finding acceptance back inside those

122
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
not finding acceptance back inside those
 

123
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,750
not finding acceptance back inside those
levels. So it's not the ideal position

124
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
levels. So it's not the ideal position
 

125
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,670
levels. So it's not the ideal position
to short but momentum is definitely

126
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
to short but momentum is definitely
 

127
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,509
to short but momentum is definitely
short biased. Right? The ideal position

128
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
short biased. Right? The ideal position
 

129
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,590
short biased. Right? The ideal position
to short was up here or even on a

130
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
to short was up here or even on a
 

131
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,430
to short was up here or even on a
rejection of this. So I will be watching

132
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
rejection of this. So I will be watching
 

133
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,829
rejection of this. So I will be watching
this morning into previous day's value

134
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
this morning into previous day's value
 

135
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,670
this morning into previous day's value
area low which we've rejected twice this

136
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
area low which we've rejected twice this
 

137
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,470
area low which we've rejected twice this
morning already 25750

138
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
morning already 25750
 

139
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,949
morning already 25750
and the current uh weekly developing

140
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
and the current uh weekly developing
 

141
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,750
and the current uh weekly developing
profile 25 uh 250. So 250 750. I'll be

142
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
profile 25 uh 250. So 250 750. I'll be
 

143
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,310
profile 25 uh 250. So 250 750. I'll be
watching this area here. Does this hold

144
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
watching this area here. Does this hold
 

145
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,949
watching this area here. Does this hold
as resistance in this area here? If the

146
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
as resistance in this area here? If the
 

147
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,870
as resistance in this area here? If the
answer is yes, then we can look for

148
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
answer is yes, then we can look for
 

149
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,470
answer is yes, then we can look for
downside pressure. We're going to look

150
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
downside pressure. We're going to look
 

151
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,190
downside pressure. We're going to look
left. Okay, we want to see can we get

152
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
left. Okay, we want to see can we get
 

153
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,350
left. Okay, we want to see can we get
underneath, right? Are we going to get

154
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
underneath, right? Are we going to get
 

155
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,710
underneath, right? Are we going to get
underneath this old level here? All

156
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
underneath this old level here? All
 

157
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,350
underneath this old level here? All
right, so 25 um sorry, we'll just call

158
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
right, so 25 um sorry, we'll just call
 

159
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,710
right, so 25 um sorry, we'll just call
it 250 to 27 uh 275. If we reject that,

160
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
it 250 to 27 uh 275. If we reject that,
 

161
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,949
it 250 to 27 uh 275. If we reject that,
do we start rejecting 170? So there's a

162
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
do we start rejecting 170? So there's a
 

163
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,630
do we start rejecting 170? So there's a
maybe a 100 point drive here. If we

164
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
maybe a 100 point drive here. If we
 

165
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,430
maybe a 100 point drive here. If we
reject 170, we're looking for deeper rot

166
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
reject 170, we're looking for deeper rot
 

167
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,949
reject 170, we're looking for deeper rot
rotation down. We want to be very

168
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
rotation down. We want to be very
 

169
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,389
rotation down. We want to be very
careful getting short near the low of

170
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
careful getting short near the low of
 

171
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,910
careful getting short near the low of
day, though. All right, very very

172
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
day, though. All right, very very
 

173
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,389
day, though. All right, very very
careful. If we find acceptance back

174
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
careful. If we find acceptance back
 

175
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,470
careful. If we find acceptance back
inside this, then I'm expecting a

176
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
inside this, then I'm expecting a
 

177
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,630
inside this, then I'm expecting a
rotation inside yesterday's range. All

178
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
rotation inside yesterday's range. All
 

179
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,710
rotation inside yesterday's range. All
right, we're going to respect previous

180
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
right, we're going to respect previous
 

181
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,150
right, we're going to respect previous
day's point of control, 325 and 380. So,

182
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
day's point of control, 325 and 380. So,
 

183
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,790
day's point of control, 325 and 380. So,
if we start reclaiming a bid over 300,

184
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
if we start reclaiming a bid over 300,
 

185
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,509
if we start reclaiming a bid over 300,
then we're looking for 320, 380, see if

186
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
then we're looking for 320, 380, see if
 

187
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,190
then we're looking for 320, 380, see if
resistance comes in. If not, then maybe

188
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
resistance comes in. If not, then maybe
 

189
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,509
resistance comes in. If not, then maybe
a squeeze up to 450s. All right, so both

190
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
a squeeze up to 450s. All right, so both
 

191
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,350
a squeeze up to 450s. All right, so both
things are possible here. Just remember,

192
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
things are possible here. Just remember,
 

193
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,829
things are possible here. Just remember,
if you're getting short, we uh we're

194
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
if you're getting short, we uh we're
 

195
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,670
if you're getting short, we uh we're
just trying to play momentum. We do not

196
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
just trying to play momentum. We do not
 

197
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,269
just trying to play momentum. We do not
have the best structure of the day down

198
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
have the best structure of the day down
 

199
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,430
have the best structure of the day down
here. We are short in deep deep

200
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
here. We are short in deep deep
 

201
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,750
here. We are short in deep deep
discount. Remember, we've left, right?

202
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
discount. Remember, we've left, right?
 

203
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,590
discount. Remember, we've left, right?
The balanced range that we talked about

204
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
The balanced range that we talked about
 

205
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,269
The balanced range that we talked about
has been in here for a number of weeks.

206
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
has been in here for a number of weeks.
 

207
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,509
has been in here for a number of weeks.
Okay? And we've left it in gapped, which

208
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
Okay? And we've left it in gapped, which
 

209
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,750
Okay? And we've left it in gapped, which
means we've got one week, two week,

210
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
means we've got one week, two week,
 

211
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,670
means we've got one week, two week,
three week, four weeks of buyers now

212
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
three week, four weeks of buyers now
 

213
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,990
three week, four weeks of buyers now
caught above. All right? And all they

214
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
caught above. All right? And all they
 

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,509
caught above. All right? And all they
have to support them is this guy down

216
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
have to support them is this guy down
 

217
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,870
have to support them is this guy down
here where we had that first reaction.

218
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
here where we had that first reaction.
 

219
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,550
here where we had that first reaction.
If we lose that, it is a good night

220
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
If we lose that, it is a good night
 

221
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,509
If we lose that, it is a good night
market. Very simple. momentum is

222
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
market. Very simple. momentum is
 

223
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,430
market. Very simple. momentum is
absolutely downside right now.

224
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
absolutely downside right now.
 

225
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,310
absolutely downside right now.
Absolutely downside. We're leaving we're

226
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
Absolutely downside. We're leaving we're
 

227
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,470
Absolutely downside. We're leaving we're
leaving trapped buyers a uh above us.

228
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
leaving trapped buyers a uh above us.
 

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,150
leaving trapped buyers a uh above us.
It's just about how uh

230
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
It's just about how uh
 

231
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,829
It's just about how uh
where price comes and can we get a good

232
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
where price comes and can we get a good
 

233
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,430
where price comes and can we get a good
price to get short off really is what

234
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
price to get short off really is what
 

235
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,990
price to get short off really is what
we're thinking about. Uh on a 5m minute

236
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
we're thinking about. Uh on a 5m minute
 

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,870
we're thinking about. Uh on a 5m minute
you can see if we just look in here.

238
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
you can see if we just look in here.
 

239
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,710
you can see if we just look in here.
All right,

240
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
All right,
 

241
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,710
All right,
Asia kind of went sideways and then lost

242
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
Asia kind of went sideways and then lost
 

243
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,550
Asia kind of went sideways and then lost
the bid and then London's really started

244
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
the bid and then London's really started
 

245
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,069
the bid and then London's really started
attacking it. The question is does this

246
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
attacking it. The question is does this
 

247
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,389
attacking it. The question is does this
pivot hold here? So, if you're desperate

248
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
pivot hold here? So, if you're desperate
 

249
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,829
pivot hold here? So, if you're desperate
to be a bull, you're going to need to

250
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
to be a bull, you're going to need to
 

251
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,710
to be a bull, you're going to need to
see this pivot of 180 hold and a reclaim

252
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
see this pivot of 180 hold and a reclaim
 

253
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,389
see this pivot of 180 hold and a reclaim
inside 250 275. All right, that's what

254
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
inside 250 275. All right, that's what
 

255
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,069
inside 250 275. All right, that's what
you're going to need if you're a bull.

256
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
you're going to need if you're a bull.
 

257
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,710
you're going to need if you're a bull.
Let's go through the other time frames

258
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
Let's go through the other time frames
 

259
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,710
Let's go through the other time frames
and have a look at what the ETFs and the

260
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
and have a look at what the ETFs and the
 

261
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,310
and have a look at what the ETFs and the
ES are doing. Most things will look

262
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
ES are doing. Most things will look
 

263
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,110
ES are doing. Most things will look
fairly similar today. ES

264
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
fairly similar today. ES
 

265
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,790
fairly similar today. ES
exactly the same. All right, leaving

266
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
exactly the same. All right, leaving
 

267
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,030
exactly the same. All right, leaving
this huge balance. Remember, if we zoom

268
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
this huge balance. Remember, if we zoom
 

269
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,230
this huge balance. Remember, if we zoom
out on here, all right, ES did that look

270
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
out on here, all right, ES did that look
 

271
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,430
out on here, all right, ES did that look
above and fail. All right, if it can't

272
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
above and fail. All right, if it can't
 

273
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,990
above and fail. All right, if it can't
catch a bid here, it is good night. It's

274
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
catch a bid here, it is good night. It's
 

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,230
catch a bid here, it is good night. It's
going to come into these 780s. And if we

276
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
going to come into these 780s. And if we
 

277
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,310
going to come into these 780s. And if we
start really letting go, it's got quite

278
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
start really letting go, it's got quite
 

279
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,069
start really letting go, it's got quite
a long way down until it hits some form

280
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
a long way down until it hits some form
 

281
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,150
a long way down until it hits some form
of structure down here into the 6,000s.

282
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
of structure down here into the 6,000s.
 

283
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,230
of structure down here into the 6,000s.
I mean, take weeks and weeks to develop,

284
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
I mean, take weeks and weeks to develop,
 

285
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,750
I mean, take weeks and weeks to develop,
but I'd be watching 6000s, 6450 swing

286
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
but I'd be watching 6000s, 6450 swing
 

287
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,310
but I'd be watching 6000s, 6450 swing
shorts if we start letting go of sort of

288
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
shorts if we start letting go of sort of
 

289
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,629
shorts if we start letting go of sort of
780s. All right, if we start letting go

290
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
780s. All right, if we start letting go
 

291
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,990
780s. All right, if we start letting go
of here, but the same structure here.

292
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
of here, but the same structure here.
 

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,069
of here, but the same structure here.
It's a look above and fail. And we just

294
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
It's a look above and fail. And we just
 

295
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,110
It's a look above and fail. And we just
want to see if on a back test, does it

296
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
want to see if on a back test, does it
 

297
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,030
want to see if on a back test, does it
stay heavy? If it reclaims, then it's

298
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
stay heavy? If it reclaims, then it's
 

299
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,710
stay heavy? If it reclaims, then it's
got a chance. But if on a back test, it

300
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
got a chance. But if on a back test, it
 

301
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,230
got a chance. But if on a back test, it
stays heavy. We're going to move lower.

302
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
stays heavy. We're going to move lower.
 

303
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,710
stays heavy. We're going to move lower.
That's going to be shown in the ETFs the

304
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
That's going to be shown in the ETFs the
 

305
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,910
That's going to be shown in the ETFs the
same way. So, you can see that look

306
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
same way. So, you can see that look
 

307
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,990
same way. So, you can see that look
above and fail. This line that we had in

308
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
above and fail. This line that we had in
 

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,269
above and fail. This line that we had in
for last week, big reaction after that,

310
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
for last week, big reaction after that,
 

311
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,750
for last week, big reaction after that,
right? Little poke above and then we all

312
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
right? Little poke above and then we all
 

313
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,430
right? Little poke above and then we all
we've done is roll over and gap. So,

314
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
we've done is roll over and gap. So,
 

315
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,269
we've done is roll over and gap. So,
we've gapped and trapped above. right

316
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
we've gapped and trapped above. right
 

317
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,910
we've gapped and trapped above. right
now. Q's same story. Gapped and trapped

318
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
now. Q's same story. Gapped and trapped
 

319
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,150
now. Q's same story. Gapped and trapped
above this blue line which now becomes

320
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
above this blue line which now becomes
 

321
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,269
above this blue line which now becomes
red.

322
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279

 

323
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,269

Gapped and trapped above and this is the

324
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
Gapped and trapped above and this is the
 

325
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,670
Gapped and trapped above and this is the
next pivot down into 600. So it's really

326
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
next pivot down into 600. So it's really
 

327
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,670
next pivot down into 600. So it's really
do we react there or in front of there

328
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
do we react there or in front of there
 

329
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,189
do we react there or in front of there
or not? If we have a look at the Dixie,

330
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
or not? If we have a look at the Dixie,
 

331
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,790
or not? If we have a look at the Dixie,
it's starting to fall off and that drive

332
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
it's starting to fall off and that drive
 

333
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,389
it's starting to fall off and that drive
back towards the 100 that we talked

334
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
back towards the 100 that we talked
 

335
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,910
back towards the 100 that we talked
about.

336
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
about.
 

337
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,310
about.
Right, same kind of story. If we look at

338
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
Right, same kind of story. If we look at
 

339
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,710
Right, same kind of story. If we look at
the VIX, it's very high. All right, here

340
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
the VIX, it's very high. All right, here
 

341
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,189
the VIX, it's very high. All right, here
we talked about this, didn't we? We

342
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
we talked about this, didn't we? We
 

343
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,150
we talked about this, didn't we? We
cannot do this forever. This grind up

344
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
cannot do this forever. This grind up
 

345
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,150
cannot do this forever. This grind up
and it's starting to accelerate. That is

346
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
and it's starting to accelerate. That is
 

347
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,310
and it's starting to accelerate. That is
a big move. That's a big gap. It's a

348
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
a big move. That's a big gap. It's a
 

349
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,870
a big move. That's a big gap. It's a
four almost five point gap on the VIX.

350
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
four almost five point gap on the VIX.
 

351
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,230
four almost five point gap on the VIX.
We're watching it into sort of these

352
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
We're watching it into sort of these
 

353
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,629
We're watching it into sort of these
21s. If we start to drive through 21s,

354
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
21s. If we start to drive through 21s,
 

355
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,230
21s. If we start to drive through 21s,
then

356
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
then
 

357
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,389
then
especially through 2180, then we're

358
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
especially through 2180, then we're
 

359
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,990
especially through 2180, then we're
going to come all the way back up to top

360
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
going to come all the way back up to top
 

361
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,230
going to come all the way back up to top
to test this top level. And you best

362
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
to test this top level. And you best
 

363
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,829
to test this top level. And you best
believe the market will get weak if we

364
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
believe the market will get weak if we
 

365
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,750
believe the market will get weak if we
start breaking out through that. But uh

366
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
start breaking out through that. But uh
 

367
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,069
start breaking out through that. But uh
you know, let's just see. It's Tuesday

368
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
you know, let's just see. It's Tuesday
 

369
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,189
you know, let's just see. It's Tuesday
morning after a uh sort of bank holiday.

370
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
morning after a uh sort of bank holiday.
 

371
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,030
morning after a uh sort of bank holiday.
Let's have a look at the mag.

372
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
Let's have a look at the mag.
 

373
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,910
Let's have a look at the mag.
Big weakness in Apple

374
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
Big weakness in Apple
 

375
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,350
Big weakness in Apple
continues. All right, same kind of

376
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
continues. All right, same kind of
 

377
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,750
continues. All right, same kind of
story. It's left this gap. If we mark

378
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
story. It's left this gap. If we mark
 

379
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,870
story. It's left this gap. If we mark
this out, balance range here. All right,

380
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
this out, balance range here. All right,
 

381
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,150
this out, balance range here. All right,
we've gapped down and left it. All

382
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
we've gapped down and left it. All
 

383
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,949
we've gapped down and left it. All
right, very very weak. So big sell

384
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
right, very very weak. So big sell
 

385
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,430
right, very very weak. So big sell
opportunity. Um

386
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
opportunity. Um
 

387
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,430
opportunity. Um
just have to see if we retest it and how

388
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
just have to see if we retest it and how
 

389
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,750
just have to see if we retest it and how
we when we retest. I might actually add

390
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:37,760
we when we retest. I might actually add
 

391
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,910
we when we retest. I might actually add
an alert there. It's just unfortunate

392
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
an alert there. It's just unfortunate
 

393
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,790
an alert there. It's just unfortunate
it's done such a big move overnight.

394
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
it's done such a big move overnight.
 

395
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,790
it's done such a big move overnight.
Same probably story here on Amazon.

396
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
Same probably story here on Amazon.
 

397
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,189
Same probably story here on Amazon.
Yeah, same thing. Waiting to see do we

398
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199
Yeah, same thing. Waiting to see do we
 

399
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,230
Yeah, same thing. Waiting to see do we
retest this kind of level up here.

400
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
retest this kind of level up here.
 

401
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,069
retest this kind of level up here.
You would imagine on a retest we stay

402
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
You would imagine on a retest we stay
 

403
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,749
You would imagine on a retest we stay
heavy unless they're going to force some

404
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
heavy unless they're going to force some
 

405
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,710
heavy unless they're going to force some
gigantic squeeze. Same story on Google.

406
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
gigantic squeeze. Same story on Google.
 

407
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,230
gigantic squeeze. Same story on Google.
All right, leaving this balance range.

408
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
All right, leaving this balance range.
 

409
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,670
All right, leaving this balance range.
It does have a bit more support on

410
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
It does have a bit more support on
 

411
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,509
It does have a bit more support on
Google compared to the others, but we've

412
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
Google compared to the others, but we've
 

413
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,389
Google compared to the others, but we've
definitely left left participants above

414
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
definitely left left participants above
 

415
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,790

right, coming back into where we found a

420
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
right, coming back into where we found a
 

421
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,829
right, coming back into where we found a
bid before. All right, so the question

422
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
bid before. All right, so the question
 

423
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,230
bid before. All right, so the question
is, does does uh Meta hold a bid here

424
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
is, does does uh Meta hold a bid here
 

425
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,590
is, does does uh Meta hold a bid here
and start to drive out or is this going

426
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
and start to drive out or is this going
 

427
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,230
and start to drive out or is this going
to be a breakdown under 580s and start

428
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
to be a breakdown under 580s and start
 

429
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,910
to be a breakdown under 580s and start
to see major weakness in the market?

430
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
to see major weakness in the market?
 

431
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,430
to see major weakness in the market?
It's definitely possible. Cannot rule

432
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
It's definitely possible. Cannot rule
 

433
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,710
It's definitely possible. Cannot rule
that out right now. We're going to go

434
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
that out right now. We're going to go
 

435
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,470
that out right now. We're going to go
into these big sales Q1 that I've been

436
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
into these big sales Q1 that I've been
 

437
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,150
into these big sales Q1 that I've been
talking about. This might well be the

438
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
talking about. This might well be the
 

439
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,949
talking about. This might well be the
start of it. Uh Microsoft, same story.

440
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
start of it. Uh Microsoft, same story.
 

441
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,269

You can see the balance range here and

442
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
You can see the balance range here and
 

443
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,990
You can see the balance range here and
we've left it gapping down, starting to

444
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
we've left it gapping down, starting to
 

445
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,470
we've left it gapping down, starting to
drive away from it. Nvidia

446
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
drive away from it. Nvidia
 

447
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,990
drive away from it. Nvidia
failed to reclaim the highs. That's a

448
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
failed to reclaim the highs. That's a
 

449
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,509
failed to reclaim the highs. That's a
little bit stronger though. It's just a

450
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
little bit stronger though. It's just a
 

451
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,670
little bit stronger though. It's just a
little bit more in no man's land here.

Pivot here. Pivot here we can get back

456
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
into. All right. Nvidia is not too bad
 

457
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,430

start to the week. Covering some into

744
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,640
start to the week. Covering some into
 

745
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,149
start to the week. Covering some into
this

746
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
this
 

747
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,830
this
buyers turning up at these lows. This is

748
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
buyers turning up at these lows. This is
 

749
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,190
buyers turning up at these lows. This is
where we just broke out from. Not going

750
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
where we just broke out from. Not going
 

751
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,590
where we just broke out from. Not going
to hold too much. If we snap under all

752
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
to hold too much. If we snap under all
 

753
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,350
to hold too much. If we snap under all
of this, then I expect a retest of here.

754
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
of this, then I expect a retest of here.
 

755
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,950
of this, then I expect a retest of here.
But this was the first play that I was

756
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
But this was the first play that I was
 

757
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,350
But this was the first play that I was

760
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
a drive back down. That was almost 100
 

761
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,950
a drive back down. That was almost 100
pointer out the gate.

762
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960

Yeah, I've just got a tiny piece left in
 

765
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,110
Yeah, I've just got a tiny piece left in
case we want to move lower.

766
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
case we want to move lower.
 

767
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,950
case we want to move lower.
But yes,

768
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
But yes,
 

769
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,789
But yes,

770
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
we hit my levels very, very quick there.
 

771
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,230

And we're at the opening print of the
 

773
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,750
And we're at the opening print of the
day, right? So, I'm not looking to hold

774
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
day, right? So, I'm not looking to hold
 

775
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,990
day, right? So, I'm not looking to hold
on too long at the opening print of the

776
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
on too long at the opening print of the
 

777
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,630
on too long at the opening print of the
day.

778
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,789
day.

Okay, we're coming back up to these 320s

808
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
Okay, we're coming back up to these 320s
 

809
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,110
Okay, we're coming back up to these 320s
again. These are the big levels out of

again. These are the big levels out of
 

811
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,870

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,230
squeeze back through this, the next
level to come and test the chatting

822
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
level to come and test the chatting
 

823
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,669
level to come and test the chatting
previous day point of control will be

824
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
previous day point of control will be
 

825
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,950
previous day point of control will be
all the way up here into 400s.

826
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
all the way up here into 400s.
 

827
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,310
all the way up here into 400s.
So, I'm out of this now. Sorry, just

give me one second to fix these levels.

830
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
give me one second to fix these levels.
 

831
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,750
give me one second to fix these levels.
I don't know why Ninja has deleted all

832
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
I don't know why Ninja has deleted all
 

833
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,750
I don't know why Ninja has deleted all
of these.

834
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
of these.
 

835
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,950
of these.
So, 700

836
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960

 

837
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:31,669

890

838
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679

 

839
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:39,190

26,000. Okay,

840
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200

 

841
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,269

there we go.

842
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
there we go.
 

843
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,350
there we go.
All righty.

844
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360

 

845
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,669

Okay, so they held the dip into this key

846
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
Okay, so they held the dip into this key
 

847
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,909
Okay, so they held the dip into this key
level. So, we're finding acceptance now

848
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
level. So, we're finding acceptance now
 

849
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,990
level. So, we're finding acceptance now
inside the current week value. We're

850
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
inside the current week value. We're
 

851
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,830
inside the current week value. We're
going to drive up and test these 330s.

852
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:53,840
going to drive up and test these 330s.
 

853
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,029
going to drive up and test these 330s.
Now, if we get through that, we're going

854
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
Now, if we get through that, we're going
 

855
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,430
Now, if we get through that, we're going
to test 380s all the way up here. All

856
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
to test 380s all the way up here. All
 

857
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,190
to test 380s all the way up here. All
right? So, if you bought the dip there,

858
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
right? So, if you bought the dip there,
 

859
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,950
right? So, if you bought the dip there,
remember I paid played the fade the

860
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:00,960
remember I paid played the fade the
 

861
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,310
remember I paid played the fade the
first attempt here from here to here. If

862
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
first attempt here from here to here. If
 

863
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,070
first attempt here from here to here. If
you bought this dip, you're now looking

864
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
you bought this dip, you're now looking
 

865
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,950
you bought this dip, you're now looking
for this for your continuation. And we

866
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
for this for your continuation. And we
 

867
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,149
for this for your continuation. And we
are now inside previous day and current

868
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
are now inside previous day and current
 

869
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,990
are now inside previous day and current
week value. So, we're in a rotational

870
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
week value. So, we're in a rotational
 

871
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:23,750
week value. So, we're in a rotational
market again.

872
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760

 

873
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,070

Uh it wasn't just yesterday though. If

874
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
Uh it wasn't just yesterday though. If
 

875
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,830
Uh it wasn't just yesterday though. If
you if you look at the current week and

876
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
you if you look at the current week and
 

877
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,149
you if you look at the current week and
you look at the structure of the week

878
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
you look at the structure of the week
 

879
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,590
you look at the structure of the week
starting uh 15th of December,

880
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
starting uh 15th of December,
 

881
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,190
starting uh 15th of December,
that's what we're also looking at.

882
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,200
that's what we're also looking at.
 

883
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,710
that's what we're also looking at.
I'm going to let this just sort itself

884
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:38,720
I'm going to let this just sort itself
 

885
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,070
I'm going to let this just sort itself
out. Let's have a quick look at the mag

faded those same levels. We couldn't
 

903

917
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,070

Has the ENQ been hard to read lately?

918
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
Has the ENQ been hard to read lately?
 

919
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,070
Has the ENQ been hard to read lately?
No, I don't think so. I think it's been

920
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
No, I don't think so. I think it's been
 

921

No, I don't think so. I think it's been
um it's actually been quite nice. It's

um it's actually been quite nice. It's
 

923
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,789
um it's actually been quite nice. It's
actually been playing ball for a change.

924
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799

 

925
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,269

Some volume on here now.

926
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279

 

927
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,789

Okay, as you can see, they keep getting

928
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
Okay, as you can see, they keep getting
 

929
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,830
Okay, as you can see, they keep getting
stuck up here.

930
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840

 

931
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,590

250s is a key level today. 250s is a key

932
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
250s is a key level today. 250s is a key
 

933
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,909
250s is a key level today. 250s is a key
level today. If we stay inside 250s,

934
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919
level today. If we stay inside 250s,
 

935
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,750
level today. If we stay inside 250s,
then we're going to look to rotate

936
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
then we're going to look to rotate
 

937
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,230
then we're going to look to rotate
upside. If we lose 250s, there's more

938
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
upside. If we lose 250s, there's more
 

939
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,230
upside. If we lose 250s, there's more
downside pressure.

940
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
downside pressure.
 

941
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:11,750
downside pressure.
It's a big level.

942
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760

 

943
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,190

Just letting this settle down a bit now

944
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
Just letting this settle down a bit now
 

945
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,990
Just letting this settle down a bit now
after that first short of the day.

946
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,000
after that first short of the day.
 

947
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,789
after that first short of the day.
Don't fully trust it.

948
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799

 

949
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,630

It's rejecting that same level. There's

950
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
It's rejecting that same level. There's
 

951
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,710
It's rejecting that same level. There's
a really clear pivot between the two

952
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
a really clear pivot between the two
 

953
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,750
a really clear pivot between the two
VWOPS and and just in front of uh 890 on

954
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
VWOPS and and just in front of uh 890 on
 

955
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,510
VWOPS and and just in front of uh 890 on
ES. Really, really clear pivot there.

956
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,520
ES. Really, really clear pivot there.
 

957
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,350
ES. Really, really clear pivot there.
So worth watching. We are above the New

958
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
So worth watching. We are above the New
 

959
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,549
So worth watching. We are above the New
York open though. They are trying to

960
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:38,559
York open though. They are trying to
 

961
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,710
York open though. They are trying to
force a squeeze up. Remember we have

962
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:40,720
force a squeeze up. Remember we have
 

963
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,630
force a squeeze up. Remember we have
gapped down significantly. We've come

964
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
gapped down significantly. We've come
 

965
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,669
gapped down significantly. We've come
into some big big levels all the way

966
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
into some big big levels all the way
 

967
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,830

the newsletter, it should have been in
your inbox Saturday morning. We talked

978
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:56,880
your inbox Saturday morning. We talked
 

979
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,110
your inbox Saturday morning. We talked
about this old naked PC being retested

980
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
about this old naked PC being retested
 

981
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:08,630
about this old naked PC being retested
as it's only been tested once.

982
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640

 

983
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,230

And I think we're just we're going to be

984
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
And I think we're just we're going to be
 

985
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,789
And I think we're just we're going to be
in these sort of rotations now unless we

986
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
in these sort of rotations now unless we
 

987
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,389
in these sort of rotations now unless we
get political weakness come in. Then

988
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
get political weakness come in. Then
 

989
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,750
get political weakness come in. Then
we're going to be in rotations until we

990
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
we're going to be in rotations until we
 

991
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,269
we're going to be in rotations until we
get to earnings. And the big question is

992
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
get to earnings. And the big question is
 

993
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,669
get to earnings. And the big question is
is how do we operate in these earnings

994
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
is how do we operate in these earnings
 

995
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,630
is how do we operate in these earnings
really next week all the big big tech

996
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
really next week all the big big tech
 

997
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,630
really next week all the big big tech
starts. We have Netflix today and some

998
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
starts. We have Netflix today and some
 

999
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,549
starts. We have Netflix today and some
more banks. But banks earnings haven't

1000
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:26,559
more banks. But banks earnings haven't
 

1001
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,310
more banks. But banks earnings haven't
been too strong and we have not held the

1002
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
been too strong and we have not held the
 

1003
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,710
been too strong and we have not held the
bid well.

1004
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
bid well.
 

1005
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,070
bid well.
They're

1006
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080

 

1007
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,269

still holding this dip. They're trying

1008
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
still holding this dip. They're trying
 

1009
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,710
still holding this dip. They're trying
to come up into here like we talked

1010
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
to come up into here like we talked
 

1011
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,710
to come up into here like we talked
about 380s. They're trying to retest

1012
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,720
about 380s. They're trying to retest
 

1013
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,310
about 380s. They're trying to retest
380s and if they get through that the

1014
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
380s and if they get through that the
 

1015
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,190
380s and if they get through that the
four what's this up here? 430s 440s

1016
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200

 

1017
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,750

Asia high up there

1018
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
Asia high up there
 

1019
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,830
Asia high up there
value area high for this current week up

1020
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
value area high for this current week up
 

1021
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,549
value area high for this current week up
here. And if we get through that gap

1022
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
here. And if we get through that gap
 

1023
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,510
here. And if we get through that gap
starts above 475. If they really want to

1024
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:57,520
starts above 475. If they really want to
 

1025
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,669
starts above 475. If they really want to
push, they've got to get above 475 to

1026
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
push, they've got to get above 475 to
 

1027
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,710
push, they've got to get above 475 to
close it all the way to 700.

1028
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:02,720
close it all the way to 700.
 

1029
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,070
close it all the way to 700.
I don't think we're going to see that

1030
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
I don't think we're going to see that
 

1031
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:13,029
I don't think we're going to see that
today.

1032
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039

 

1033
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,310

And they're trying to force this squeeze

1034
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
And they're trying to force this squeeze
 

1035
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,190
And they're trying to force this squeeze
up towards these 380s, 400s. That's what

1036
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
up towards these 380s, 400s. That's what
 

1037
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,190
up towards these 380s, 400s. That's what
they're trying to do at the moment. Yes.

1038
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
they're trying to do at the moment. Yes.
 

1039
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:39,029
they're trying to do at the moment. Yes.
Coming into its VWAP.

1040
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039

 

1041
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,269

There we go. Back to these 300s again.

1042
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:43,279
There we go. Back to these 300s again.
 

1043
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,110
There we go. Back to these 300s again.
Just letting this develop. You can see a

1044
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
Just letting this develop. You can see a
 

1045
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,630
Just letting this develop. You can see a
bit of a D-shape developing here at the

1046
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
bit of a D-shape developing here at the
 

1047
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,070
bit of a D-shape developing here at the
moment. I'm just being patient. We had

1048
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
moment. I'm just being patient. We had
 

1049
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,669
moment. I'm just being patient. We had
that first trade this morning. Made good

1050
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
that first trade this morning. Made good
 

1051
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,950
that first trade this morning. Made good
money on that first trade. That first

1052
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
money on that first trade. That first
 

1053
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,830
money on that first trade. That first
short when the buyers got stuck,

1054
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:53,840
short when the buyers got stuck,
 

1055
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,590
short when the buyers got stuck,
almost paid us 100 points in uh the

1056
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
almost paid us 100 points in uh the
 

1057
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,110
almost paid us 100 points in uh the
second minute of the day. This one right

1058
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,120
second minute of the day. This one right
 

1059
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,750
second minute of the day. This one right
here fading back down. Let's see. Yes,

1060
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
here fading back down. Let's see. Yes,
 

1061
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,350
here fading back down. Let's see. Yes,
rejecting that clear pivot. We just

1062
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
rejecting that clear pivot. We just
 

1063
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,350
rejecting that clear pivot. We just
talked about that big pivot on ES. It's

1064
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,360
talked about that big pivot on ES. It's
 

1065
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,669
talked about that big pivot on ES. It's
still rejecting it. If they come below

1066
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
still rejecting it. If they come below
 

1067
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,029
still rejecting it. If they come below
beneath the New York open here, they're

1068
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
beneath the New York open here, they're
 

1069
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,350
beneath the New York open here, they're
going to be in trouble.

1070
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360
going to be in trouble.
 

1071
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,870
going to be in trouble.
That's what ES is trying to hold right

1072
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:12,880
That's what ES is trying to hold right
 

1073
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,990
That's what ES is trying to hold right
now is that New York open.

1074
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,000

 

1075
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,029

really nice.

1076
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:23,039
really nice.
 

1077
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,870
really nice.
Here's the New York open and value area

1078
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880
Here's the New York open and value area
 

1079
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,710
Here's the New York open and value area
low on the week. So, this is the area we

1080
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
low on the week. So, this is the area we
 

1081
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,990
low on the week. So, this is the area we
talked about. 50s are going to be the

1082
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
talked about. 50s are going to be the
 

1083
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,669
talked about. 50s are going to be the
key area today. If we start losing the

1084
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:29,679
key area today. If we start losing the
 

1085
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,830
key area today. If we start losing the
50s, you might well see some weakness in

1086
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:31,840
50s, you might well see some weakness in
 

1087
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,269
50s, you might well see some weakness in
the market. It really would not surprise

1088
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
the market. It really would not surprise
 

1089
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:51,590
the market. It really would not surprise
me in the slightest.

1090
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:51,600

 

1091
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,149

Yes, we went over the trend before the

1092
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
Yes, we went over the trend before the
 

1093
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,470
Yes, we went over the trend before the
market opened ironclad. So hopefully you

1094
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
market opened ironclad. So hopefully you
 

1095
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,110
market opened ironclad. So hopefully you
joined for that. It's also about how

1096
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,120
joined for that. It's also about how
 

1097
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,630
joined for that. It's also about how
many buyers we've left trapped above.

1098
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
many buyers we've left trapped above.
 

1099
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,549
many buyers we've left trapped above.
Hourly trend is down. Location is not

1100
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
Hourly trend is down. Location is not
 

1101
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,230
Hourly trend is down. Location is not
prime on the day to be short at lows,

1102
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
prime on the day to be short at lows,
 

1103
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,909
prime on the day to be short at lows,
which is why we're trying to fade pops

1104
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
which is why we're trying to fade pops
 

1105
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,750
which is why we're trying to fade pops
at the moment. I'd really like a retest

1106
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760
at the moment. I'd really like a retest
 

1107
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,590
at the moment. I'd really like a retest
up here to fade. But if we start

1108
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,600
up here to fade. But if we start
 

1109
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,350
up here to fade. But if we start
snapping,

1110
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,360
snapping,
 

1111
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,630
snapping,
we can think about how we might operate.

1112
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
we can think about how we might operate.
 

1113
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,470
we can think about how we might operate.

50s we just talked about. These are the
key level. This is sentiment for day. I

1122
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:24,159
key level. This is sentiment for day. I
 

1123
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:34,630
key level. This is sentiment for day. I
would say these 50s.

1124
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640

 

1125

trying to find a bid is what I'm saying.
 

1129
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,149
trying to find a bid is what I'm saying.
this if we zoom out here to give you an

1130
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:40,159
this if we zoom out here to give you an
 

1131
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,789
this if we zoom out here to give you an
idea of what we're looking at. Right? We

1132
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:42,799
idea of what we're looking at. Right? We
 

1133
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,230
idea of what we're looking at. Right? We
talked about the importance of the

1134
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,240
talked about the importance of the
 

1135
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,990
talked about the importance of the
current developing week's value here and

1136
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,000
current developing week's value here and
 

1137
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,549
current developing week's value here and
this node here, right? And we keep

1138
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
this node here, right? And we keep
 

1139
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,549
this node here, right? And we keep
rejecting up into here, but we are

1140
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
rejecting up into here, but we are
 

1141
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,990
rejecting up into here, but we are
holding current week's value. We're

1142
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
holding current week's value. We're
 

1143
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,110
holding current week's value. We're
going to have to let go of current

1144
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
going to have to let go of current
 

1145
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,389
going to have to let go of current
week's value if we're really going to

1146
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399
week's value if we're really going to
 

1147
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,549
week's value if we're really going to
look for expansion down. And we have

1148
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:58,559
look for expansion down. And we have
 

1149
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,549
look for expansion down. And we have
some key levels here. If we look left,

1150
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
some key levels here. If we look left,
 

1151
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,110
some key levels here. If we look left,
right, this is the edge from the uh

1152
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
right, this is the edge from the uh
 

1153
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,870
right, this is the edge from the uh
December 15th I keep talking about. So,

1154
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
December 15th I keep talking about. So,
 

1155
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,070
December 15th I keep talking about. So,
we're going to need to find acceptance

1156
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
we're going to need to find acceptance
 

1157
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,029
we're going to need to find acceptance
under there if we're going to move

1158
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:07,039
under there if we're going to move
 

1159
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,349
under there if we're going to move
lower. Otherwise, I'm somewhat expecting

1160
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:09,359
lower. Otherwise, I'm somewhat expecting
 

1161
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,270
lower. Otherwise, I'm somewhat expecting
rotation because we've had a big gap

1162
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:11,280
rotation because we've had a big gap
 

1163
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,349
rotation because we've had a big gap
down. All right. If we think about where

1164
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:13,359
down. All right. If we think about where
 

1165
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,349
down. All right. If we think about where
we closed last week or value last week,

1166
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:15,359
we closed last week or value last week,
 

1167
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,950
we closed last week or value last week,
we've moved from 700s into, you know,

1168
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:18,960
we've moved from 700s into, you know,
 

1169
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,349
we've moved from 700s into, you know,
the low 200s today. So, we want to be

1170
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
the low 200s today. So, we want to be
 

1171
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,030
the low 200s today. So, we want to be
careful if we're thinking about shorts.

1172
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
careful if we're thinking about shorts.
 

1173
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,790
careful if we're thinking about shorts.
You have to understand your location is

1174
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
You have to understand your location is
 

1175
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,950
You have to understand your location is
not ideal, is it? Buyers are trapped at

1176
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
not ideal, is it? Buyers are trapped at
 

1177
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,190
not ideal, is it? Buyers are trapped at
700 and above.

1178
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
700 and above.
 

1179
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,790
700 and above.
All right? So, we're not retesting any

1180
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:30,800
All right? So, we're not retesting any
 

1181
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,990
All right? So, we're not retesting any
key levels yet even of uh Friday. And

1182
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
key levels yet even of uh Friday. And
 

1183
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,349
key levels yet even of uh Friday. And
even if we look at the daily,

1184
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
even if we look at the daily,
 

1185
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,349
even if we look at the daily,
is this on a daily? Oh my god. On a

1186
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:39,359
is this on a daily? Oh my god. On a
 

1187
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,950
is this on a daily? Oh my god. On a
daily, we are at the lower Ballinger

1188
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:40,960
daily, we are at the lower Ballinger
 

1189
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,230
daily, we are at the lower Ballinger
band. Let me get you guys over.

1190
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240

 

1191
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,829

Right. On the daily, we're at this lower

1192
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:47,839
Right. On the daily, we're at this lower
 

1193
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,389
Right. On the daily, we're at this lower
Ballinger band. Right. We got a

1194
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
Ballinger band. Right. We got a
 

1195
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,069
Ballinger band. Right. We got a
contracting Ballinger band. So, we're

1196
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,079
contracting Ballinger band. So, we're
 

1197
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,990
contracting Ballinger band. So, we're
going to need to wait for if we're

1198
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
going to need to wait for if we're
 

1199
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,270
going to need to wait for if we're
really going to get weak, we're going to

1200
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
really going to get weak, we're going to
 

1201
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,150
really going to get weak, we're going to
need some crosses to start happen here

1202
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160

 

1203
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,390

and this to open up and then this to

1204
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
and this to open up and then this to
 

1205
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,390
and this to open up and then this to
close down and the 5day to give us that

1206
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,400
close down and the 5day to give us that
 

1207
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,349
close down and the 5day to give us that
hug. All right. So, it might take a

1208
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:07,359
hug. All right. So, it might take a
 

1209
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,030
hug. All right. So, it might take a
little bit of time to develop just based

1210
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
little bit of time to develop just based
 

1211
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,870
little bit of time to develop just based
on what we've got on dailies at the

1212
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
on what we've got on dailies at the
 

1213
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,670
on what we've got on dailies at the
moment.

1214
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680

 

1215
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,750

Unless we see absolute panic, you're

1216
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,760
Unless we see absolute panic, you're
 

1217
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,510
Unless we see absolute panic, you're
probably not going to see no straight

1218
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
probably not going to see no straight
 

1219
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:28,710
probably not going to see no straight
downside moves.

1220
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:28,720

 

1221
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,230

You keep buying the top and the bottom.

1222
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,240
You keep buying the top and the bottom.
 

1223
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,550
You keep buying the top and the bottom.
Well,

1224
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
Well,
 

1225
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,990
Well,
at least you know at least you know your

1226
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000
at least you know at least you know your
 

1227
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,510
at least you know at least you know your
issue. I guess that's that's your first

1228
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
issue. I guess that's that's your first
 

1229
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,630
issue. I guess that's that's your first
thing. At least you know what you're

1230
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:36,640
thing. At least you know what you're
 

1231
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,710
thing. At least you know what you're
doing wrong. So, just don't do it.

1232
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:38,720
doing wrong. So, just don't do it.
 

1233
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,230
doing wrong. So, just don't do it.
You've identified your issue. You're

1234
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,240
You've identified your issue. You're
 

1235
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:51,589
You've identified your issue. You're
chasing. That means

1236
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599

 

1237
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,190

Okay, ES still holding that New York

1238
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
Okay, ES still holding that New York
 

1239
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,550
Okay, ES still holding that New York
open. Trying to find a bid here.

1240
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:56,560
open. Trying to find a bid here.
 

1241
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,750
open. Trying to find a bid here.
Like I talked about that sort of 90s is

1242
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,760
Like I talked about that sort of 90s is
 

1243
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,030
Like I talked about that sort of 90s is
a big big level on ES. 90s is a big

1244
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
a big big level on ES. 90s is a big
 

1245
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,430
a big big level on ES. 90s is a big
level. 24-hour VWAP up there and a clear

1246
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:05,440
level. 24-hour VWAP up there and a clear
 

1247
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,390
level. 24-hour VWAP up there and a clear
pivot over 90s. You see there a failed a

1248
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,400
pivot over 90s. You see there a failed a
 

1249
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,069
pivot over 90s. You see there a failed a
look above and fail or you're going to

1250
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:10,079
look above and fail or you're going to
 

1251
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,950
look above and fail or you're going to
see a squeeze back up into sort of the

1252
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:12,960
see a squeeze back up into sort of the
 

1253
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,230
see a squeeze back up into sort of the
tens and 15s potentially on ES. Right.

1254
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
tens and 15s potentially on ES. Right.
 

1255
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,790
tens and 15s potentially on ES. Right.
So just waiting here patiently. Now, we

1256
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:18,800
So just waiting here patiently. Now, we
 

1257
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,310
So just waiting here patiently. Now, we
didn't see a breakdown under here for me

1258
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,320
didn't see a breakdown under here for me
 

1259
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,750
didn't see a breakdown under here for me
to trade. We're still inside this

1260
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
to trade. We're still inside this
 

1261
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,230
to trade. We're still inside this
Dshape. We're still inside current

1262
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,240
Dshape. We're still inside current
 

1263
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,910
Dshape. We're still inside current
week's developing profile and we're

1264
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920
week's developing profile and we're
 

1265
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,829
week's developing profile and we're
inside previous days value. Remember

1266
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
inside previous days value. Remember
 

1267
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,310
inside previous days value. Remember
values here and value area high up here.

1268
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,320
values here and value area high up here.
 

1269
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,990
values here and value area high up here.
So, if they want to rotate previous day,

1270
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,000
So, if they want to rotate previous day,
 

1271
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,069
So, if they want to rotate previous day,
this is their target. We're in a

1272
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
this is their target. We're in a
 

1273
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,550
this is their target. We're in a
rotational day. I know it's not going to

1274
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:36,560
rotational day. I know it's not going to
 

1275
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,670
rotational day. I know it's not going to
show an inside bar on uh the daily

1276
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:39,680
show an inside bar on uh the daily
 

1277
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,349
show an inside bar on uh the daily
chart, but we are on an inside bar

1278
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:43,359
chart, but we are on an inside bar
 

1279
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:51,510
chart, but we are on an inside bar
if you include yesterday's volume.

1280
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:51,520

 

1281
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,790

This is their attempt. They're trying to

1282
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:52,800
This is their attempt. They're trying to
 

1283
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,230
This is their attempt. They're trying to
get up here right now.

1284
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240
get up here right now.
 

1285
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:03,829
get up here right now.
It's where they would like to go.

1286
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:03,839

 

1287
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,230

There's ES stuck into the 90. Exactly

1288
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
There's ES stuck into the 90. Exactly
 

1289
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,589
There's ES stuck into the 90. Exactly
like I said, tap 90, the VWAP. We got an

1290
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599
like I said, tap 90, the VWAP. We got an
 

1291
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,150
like I said, tap 90, the VWAP. We got an
89.75 print there. So, it's big big

1292
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160
89.75 print there. So, it's big big
 

1293
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,470
89.75 print there. So, it's big big
pivot on ES like I've talked about. So,

1294
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:14,480
pivot on ES like I've talked about. So,
 

1295
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,230
pivot on ES like I've talked about. So,
we're either going to see a rejection

1296
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,240
we're either going to see a rejection
 

1297
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,750
we're either going to see a rejection
here or a look above and fail, or we're

1298
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:17,760
here or a look above and fail, or we're
 

1299
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,430
here or a look above and fail, or we're
going to see a base and hold above for a

1300
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,440
going to see a base and hold above for a
 

1301
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:28,710
going to see a base and hold above for a
squeeze.

1302
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:28,720

 

1303
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,430

Just going to be patient now.

1304
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
Just going to be patient now.
 

1305
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:42,870
Just going to be patient now.
Fixes into a pivot as well.

1306
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880

 

1307
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,510

Waiting to see if we put a squeeze in or

1308
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
Waiting to see if we put a squeeze in or
 

1309
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,430
Waiting to see if we put a squeeze in or
if we're going to fade underneath 250s

1310
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,440
if we're going to fade underneath 250s
 

1311
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,030
if we're going to fade underneath 250s
today. I don't really want to trade the

1312
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,040
today. I don't really want to trade the
 

1313
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,109
today. I don't really want to trade the
midpoint of this range. Right, here's

1314
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,119
midpoint of this range. Right, here's
 

1315
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,710
midpoint of this range. Right, here's
your current profile on the day. Here's

1316
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:54,720
your current profile on the day. Here's
 

1317
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,870
your current profile on the day. Here's
your where's current week?

1318
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
your where's current week?
 

1319
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,510
your where's current week?
Current week

1320
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,520
Current week
 

1321
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,310
Current week
between here. So in and your previous

1322
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
between here. So in and your previous
 

1323
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,430
between here. So in and your previous
day between here. So all very tight in

1324
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440
day between here. So all very tight in
 

1325
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,390
day between here. So all very tight in
here, right? This is your range. Trying

1326
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,400
here, right? This is your range. Trying
 

1327
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,910
here, right? This is your range. Trying
to leave that alone for me personally.

1328
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:11,920
to leave that alone for me personally.
 

1329
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:29,589
to leave that alone for me personally.
You know, I dislike trading ranges.

1330
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599

 

1331
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,349

Well, quite right, Josh. Yeah.

1332
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
Well, quite right, Josh. Yeah.
 

1333
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,069
Well, quite right, Josh. Yeah.
Uh

1334
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079
Uh
 

1335
00:38:36,079 --> 00:39:08,870
Uh
move

1336
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880

 

1337
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,710

passing EVA on the first candle. Nice,

1338
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:10,720
passing EVA on the first candle. Nice,
 

1339
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,069
passing EVA on the first candle. Nice,
nice work, DS

1340
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
nice work, DS
 

1341
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,910
nice work, DS
seems to be weaker today. I mean, ES is

1342
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:15,920
seems to be weaker today. I mean, ES is
 

1343
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,829
seems to be weaker today. I mean, ES is
1.42 down. ENQ is 1.58 down. I think

1344
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
1.42 down. ENQ is 1.58 down. I think
 

1345
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,750
1.42 down. ENQ is 1.58 down. I think
they all look pretty pretty much in line

1346
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760
they all look pretty pretty much in line
 

1347
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,390
they all look pretty pretty much in line
to be honest. Um, let me have a look at

1348
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
to be honest. Um, let me have a look at
 

1349
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,750
to be honest. Um, let me have a look at
the breadth of the market. It's probably

1350
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
the breadth of the market. It's probably
 

1351
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,190
the breadth of the market. It's probably
all pretty reds because we're all

1352
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,200
all pretty reds because we're all
 

1353
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,790
all pretty reds because we're all
gapping down. Yeah, I mean the breadth

1354
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:28,800
gapping down. Yeah, I mean the breadth
 

1355
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,589
gapping down. Yeah, I mean the breadth
is awful outside of energy,

1356
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:31,599
is awful outside of energy,
 

1357
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,630
is awful outside of energy,
right? So if we come outside of energy

1358
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:36,640

 

1359
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,230

right pretty much everything getting

1360
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,240
right pretty much everything getting
 

1361
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,670
right pretty much everything getting
destroyed definitely tech's getting

1362
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680
destroyed definitely tech's getting
 

1363
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,829
destroyed definitely tech's getting
destroyed

1364
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839
destroyed
 

1365
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,270
destroyed
it's uh I think many outliers in here

1366
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,280
it's uh I think many outliers in here
 

1367
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,750
it's uh I think many outliers in here
right now

1368
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:51,760

 

1369
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,069

this is anchored uh volume profile who

1370
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:54,079
this is anchored uh volume profile who
 

1371
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,150
this is anchored uh volume profile who
asked me that John anchored volume

1372
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,160
asked me that John anchored volume
 

1373
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,190
asked me that John anchored volume
profile anchor to the 930 open anchor

1374
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
profile anchor to the 930 open anchor

volume profile

1376

1377
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,670

Okay, we're right at this previous day

1378
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
Okay, we're right at this previous day
 

1379
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,150
Okay, we're right at this previous day
value area low again.

1380
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
value area low again.
 

1381
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,990
value area low again.
ES trying to find a bid here again. It's

1382
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,000
ES trying to find a bid here again. It's
 

1383
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,510
ES trying to find a bid here again. It's
trying to protect its New York open.

1384
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,520
trying to protect its New York open.
 

1385
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,349
trying to protect its New York open.
We're still just in the midpoint of the

1386
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:15,359
We're still just in the midpoint of the
 

1387
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,430
We're still just in the midpoint of the
range. If we start losing the bid here,

1388
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
range. If we start losing the bid here,
 

1389
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,430
range. If we start losing the bid here,
we might well retest these 40s and 50s.

1390
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
we might well retest these 40s and 50s.
 

1391
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,710
we might well retest these 40s and 50s.
If we lose that, there's probably a

1392
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:20,720
If we lose that, there's probably a
 

1393
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,109
If we lose that, there's probably a
trade down to 170s. So, that's what I'm

1394
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:23,119
trade down to 170s. So, that's what I'm
 

1395
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,030
trade down to 170s. So, that's what I'm
waiting to see how we act at each side

1396
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
waiting to see how we act at each side
 

1397
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,310
waiting to see how we act at each side
of the range, trying to leave this

1398
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:26,320
of the range, trying to leave this
 

1399
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,710
of the range, trying to leave this
middle part out, leave it alone.

1400
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720

 

1401
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,990

Vick's starting to find a little bit of

1402
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
Vick's starting to find a little bit of
 

1403
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,870
Vick's starting to find a little bit of
a bid. I will say that. Got a gap above.

1404
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
a bid. I will say that. Got a gap above.
 

1405
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,470
a bid. I will say that. Got a gap above.
Let's see if it can get into its gap. If

1406
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
Let's see if it can get into its gap. If
 

1407
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,589
Let's see if it can get into its gap. If
it does, you're probably going to see

1408
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
it does, you're probably going to see
 

1409
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,270
it does, you're probably going to see
some weakness come in the market. But we

1410
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,280
some weakness come in the market. But we
 

1411
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,710
some weakness come in the market. But we
will see see how it operates.

1412
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:48,720

 

1413
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,069

Yes. Back to these levels. It's found

1414
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:50,079
Yes. Back to these levels. It's found
 

1415
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,630
Yes. Back to these levels. It's found
dips at all morning

1416

trying to protect them, but it can't get

1418
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
trying to protect them, but it can't get
 

1419
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,230
trying to protect them, but it can't get
through those 890s I've talked about.

1420
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
through those 890s I've talked about.
 

1421
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,829
through those 890s I've talked about.
That's absolutely clear. It cannot get

1422
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
That's absolutely clear. It cannot get
 

1423
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:07,190
That's absolutely clear. It cannot get
through 890.

1424
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,200

 

1425
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,870

Keep rejecting point of control on

1426
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:08,880
Keep rejecting point of control on
 

1427
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,950
Keep rejecting point of control on
retests here. Are we going to get

1428
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:10,960
retests here. Are we going to get
 

1429
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,030
retests here. Are we going to get
squeezed through it that top side or do

1430
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,040
squeezed through it that top side or do
 

1431
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:28,470
squeezed through it that top side or do
they just let go of this whole thing?

1432
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:28,480

 

1433
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,270

He's gone to sleep then. Did no one come

1434
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,280
He's gone to sleep then. Did no one come
 

1435
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,990
He's gone to sleep then. Did no one come
back from holiday?

1436
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,000

this is just not going anywhere sideways

00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
this is just not going anywhere sideways
 

1457
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,790
this is just not going anywhere sideways
at the moment and you just require

1458
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:00,800
at the moment and you just require
 

1459
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,150
at the moment and you just require
patience

1460
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160

 

1461
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,870

found a bit of the bid. All right. So,

1464
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:09,280
found a bit of the bid. All right. So,
 

1465
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,069
found a bit of the bid. All right. So,
we gap up from VIX, right? From

1466
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,079
we gap up from VIX, right? From
 

1467
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,230
we gap up from VIX, right? From
pre-market, we traded between sort of

1468
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,240
pre-market, we traded between sort of
 

1469
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,589
pre-market, we traded between sort of
1990 and 2075.

1470
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:17,599
1990 and 2075.
 

1471
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,150
1990 and 2075.
We opened up, we've caught a bid at

1472
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
We opened up, we've caught a bid at
 

1473
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,190
We opened up, we've caught a bid at
1924. We're now trading at 1970. The New

1474
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
1924. We're now trading at 1970. The New
 

1475
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,069
1924. We're now trading at 1970. The New
York high is 1975. If we blast through

1476
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
York high is 1975. If we blast through
 

1477
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,190
York high is 1975. If we blast through
that, we're going to go 20.30. So, it's

1478
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
that, we're going to go 20.30. So, it's
 

1479
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,270
that, we're going to go 20.30. So, it's
not really falling. So, it's a big gap

1480
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280
not really falling. So, it's a big gap
 

1481
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,109
not really falling. So, it's a big gap
up and so far it's finding a bit. It's

1482
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
up and so far it's finding a bit. It's
 

1483
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,710
up and so far it's finding a bit. It's
going to have to trade under 19 to

1484
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:34,720
going to have to trade under 19 to
 

1485
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,710
going to have to trade under 19 to
really start falling to get into a gap

1486
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:36,720
really start falling to get into a gap
 

1487
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,349

fill of 1587.

1488
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:39,359
fill of 1587.
 

1489
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,750
fill of 1587.
All right. So, understand what you're

1490
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:41,760
All right. So, understand what you're
 

1491
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,230
All right. So, understand what you're
looking at.

1492
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,240
looking at.
 

1493
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,309
looking at.
Okay. Testing value area high on the day

1494
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
Okay. Testing value area high on the day
 

1495
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,829
Okay. Testing value area high on the day
now. Let's see if they break this out

1496
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:47,839
now. Let's see if they break this out
 

1497
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,510
now. Let's see if they break this out
and they can get this squeeze up to here

1498
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:49,520
and they can get this squeeze up to here
 

1499
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,309
and they can get this squeeze up to here
or not.

1500
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:52,319
or not.
 

1501
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:59,589
or not.
I'm just waiting patiently.

1502
00:42:59,589 --> 00:42:59,599

 

1503
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,270

How can you get your anchor volumeing

1504
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,280
How can you get your anchor volumeing
 

1505
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,630
How can you get your anchor volumeing
profile to the right? It's just a new

1506
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
profile to the right? It's just a new
 

1507
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,470
profile to the right? It's just a new
settings

1508
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480

 

1509
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,430

style placement. Right.

1510
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440

 

1511
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,670

Here we go. So through current value,

1512
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:13,680
Here we go. So through current value,
 

1513
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,990
Here we go. So through current value,
three point previous day point control.

1514
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,000
three point previous day point control.
 

1515
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,190
three point previous day point control.
Next target for them is up here. 360 to

1516
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
Next target for them is up here. 360 to
 

1517
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,670
Next target for them is up here. 360 to
380 and then through that 450s and

1518
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:21,680
380 and then through that 450s and
 

1519
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,470
380 and then through that 450s and
above. That's what they're trying to do.

1520
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
above. That's what they're trying to do.
 

1521
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,630
above. That's what they're trying to do.
Remember this is the counter trend leg.

1522
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:30,640

 

1523
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,150

Here we go. into the squeeze.

1524
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,160
Here we go. into the squeeze.
 

1525
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,589
Here we go. into the squeeze.
ES again into 490s. So, two things, one

1526
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:37,599
ES again into 490s. So, two things, one
 

1527
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,790
ES again into 490s. So, two things, one
of two things are going to happen now.

1528
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
of two things are going to happen now.
 

1529
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,990
of two things are going to happen now.
Well, one of three things. We're going

1530
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,000
Well, one of three things. We're going
 

1531
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,270
Well, one of three things. We're going
to get a look above and fail at 890 on

1532
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,280
to get a look above and fail at 890 on
 

1533
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,990
to get a look above and fail at 890 on
ES or we're going to get a squeeze out

1534
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
ES or we're going to get a squeeze out
 

1535
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,230
ES or we're going to get a squeeze out
all the way if it can base above all the

1536
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
all the way if it can base above all the
 

1537
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,750
all the way if it can base above all the
way up to the 10ens and maybe even the

1538
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
way up to the 10ens and maybe even the
 

1539
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,150
way up to the 10ens and maybe even the
teens on ES, right? Which would bring us

1540
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,160
teens on ES, right? Which would bring us
 

1541
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,510
teens on ES, right? Which would bring us
up into here, which is a level of

1542
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
up into here, which is a level of
 

1543
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:01,510
up into here, which is a level of
interest for me.

1544
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520

 

1545
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,109

still hasn't traded through these 90s

1546
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:03,119
still hasn't traded through these 90s
 

1547
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,190
still hasn't traded through these 90s
yet on the think they're going to get at

1548
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
yet on the think they're going to get at
 

1549
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,270
yet on the think they're going to get at
least a look above and fail if not more

1550
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:07,280
least a look above and fail if not more
 

1551
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:29,030
least a look above and fail if not more
at the moment struggling

1552
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040

 

1553
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:41,190

Still seeing sellers step in here.

1554
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:41,200

 

1555
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,870

I'd really love them to come up here. I

1556
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:42,880
I'd really love them to come up here. I
 

1557
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,950
I'd really love them to come up here. I
think it would give us much better

1558
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
think it would give us much better
 

1559
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:55,750
think it would give us much better
opportunity today if we do.

1560
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:55,760

 

1561
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,710

So ES poked through that 90 by one tick

1562
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:58,720
So ES poked through that 90 by one tick
 

1563
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,790
So ES poked through that 90 by one tick
and has not been able to base above yet.

1564
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,800
and has not been able to base above yet.
 

1565
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,950
and has not been able to base above yet.
So still stuck there on ES. I'd like a

1566
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:02,960
So still stuck there on ES. I'd like a
 

1567
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,309
So still stuck there on ES. I'd like a
squeeze higher first.

1568
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:06,319
squeeze higher first.
 

1569
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,470
squeeze higher first.
10 a.m. news. Yeah, I'm like we will see

1570
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
10 a.m. news. Yeah, I'm like we will see
 

1571
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,470
10 a.m. news. Yeah, I'm like we will see
if we get it because they've already

1572
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:10,480
if we get it because they've already
 

1573
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,829
if we get it because they've already
come out this morning saying they're not

1574
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:11,839
come out this morning saying they're not
 

1575
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,349
come out this morning saying they're not
going to release the documents. So let's

1576
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:13,359
going to release the documents. So let's
 

1577
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,069
going to release the documents. So let's
see. Maybe maybe we get it. The other

1578
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,079
see. Maybe maybe we get it. The other
 

1579
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,510
see. Maybe maybe we get it. The other
thing is is it priced it? And if they

1580
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
thing is is it priced it? And if they
 

1581
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,870
thing is is it priced it? And if they
come out and say it's not legal, then

1582
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:18,880
come out and say it's not legal, then
 

1583
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,470
come out and say it's not legal, then
what happens that next? You know, it's

1584
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:20,480
what happens that next? You know, it's
 

1585
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,910
what happens that next? You know, it's
some big long court battle

1586
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:23,920
some big long court battle
 

1587
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,990
some big long court battle
and then uh the other thing is how are

1588
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,000
and then uh the other thing is how are
 

1589
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,630
and then uh the other thing is how are
you going to pay the tariffs back? Who's

1590
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:28,640
you going to pay the tariffs back? Who's
 

1591
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,190
you going to pay the tariffs back? Who's
keeping count of that?

1592
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200

 

1593
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,990

Crazy. What a crazy world we're in in

1594
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
Crazy. What a crazy world we're in in
 

1595
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:45,829
Crazy. What a crazy world we're in in
2022.

1596
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:45,839

 

1597
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,430

So, they're trying to flip this into

1598
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
So, they're trying to flip this into
 

1599
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,190
So, they're trying to flip this into
some sort of support level here. this

1600
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:49,200
some sort of support level here. this
 

1601
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,589
some sort of support level here. this
old naked P and the and the previous day

1605
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,829

is up into 400.

1606
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839

 

1607
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,510

And you can see it's really struggling

1608
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:17,520
And you can see it's really struggling
 

1609
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,390
And you can see it's really struggling
at that 890 pivot. Really struggling. 10

1610
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,400
at that 890 pivot. Really struggling. 10

00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:21,920
points down from it already after taking
 

1613
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,470
points down from it already after taking
it out by one tick. It is struggling up

1614
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:24,480
it out by one tick. It is struggling up
 

1615
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,349
it out by one tick. It is struggling up
there.

1616
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:31,359

 

1617
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,190

Back to previous day point control

1618
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200
Back to previous day point control
 

1619
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,670
Back to previous day point control
again.

1620
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:35,680
again.
 

1621
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,349
again.
Still rotating and rotating and

1622
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:37,359
Still rotating and rotating and
 

1623
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,430
Still rotating and rotating and
rotating.

1624
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:39,440
rotating.
 

1625
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,790
rotating.
If they turn this into bullish

1626
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
If they turn this into bullish
 

1627
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,710
If they turn this into bullish
structure, they'll go for the squeeze up

1628
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:42,720
structure, they'll go for the squeeze up
 

1629
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,270
structure, they'll go for the squeeze up
into here. If we lose it, well, don't do

1630
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,280
into here. If we lose it, well, don't do
 

1631
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,950
into here. If we lose it, well, don't do
that.

1632
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:46,960
that.
 

1633
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,309
that.
I'm going to make this gray for now

1634
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,319
I'm going to make this gray for now
 

1635
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,589
I'm going to make this gray for now
because it's kind of neutral. It could

1636
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:49,599
because it's kind of neutral. It could
 

1637
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,670
because it's kind of neutral. It could
be bullish, but

1638
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:51,680
be bullish, but
 

1639
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,069
be bullish, but
observe it.

1640
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:54,079
observe it.
 

1641
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,390
observe it.
If we lose it, then uh I'm going to

1642
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:56,400
If we lose it, then uh I'm going to
 

1643
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,750
If we lose it, then uh I'm going to
rotate right back down to the edge of

1644
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:57,760
rotate right back down to the edge of
 

1645
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,390
rotate right back down to the edge of
value again.

1646
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,400
value again.
 

1647
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,790
value again.
So, we're bearish overall,

1648
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
So, we're bearish overall,
 

1649
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,870
So, we're bearish overall,
but we're rotational based on current

1650
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:04,880
but we're rotational based on current
 

1651
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,349
but we're rotational based on current
day volume, current week's volume,

1652
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
day volume, current week's volume,
 

1653
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:13,589
day volume, current week's volume,
previous day's volume.

1654
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599

 

1655
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:24,309

Peter, there's a gap to 22.

1656
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:24,319

 

1657
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,790

I see what you're talking about. Yeah. I

1658
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
I see what you're talking about. Yeah. I
 

1659
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:35,030
I see what you're talking about. Yeah. I
mean, we don't have to do it today.

1660
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040

 

1661
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,510

I actually see a spike up there from in

1662
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:37,520
I actually see a spike up there from in
 

1663
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,349
I actually see a spike up there from in
a New York session. So, I think that I

1664
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:39,359
a New York session. So, I think that I
 

1665
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,109
a New York session. So, I think that I
don't see the gap as still open.

1666
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:43,119
don't see the gap as still open.
 

1667
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,510
don't see the gap as still open.
I don't know. Maybe you can send me a

1668
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:45,520
I don't know. Maybe you can send me a

I don't have it on Trading View. Maybe
 

1675
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,710
I don't have it on Trading View. Maybe
you have it on Inca Swim or something. I

1676
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:52,720
you have it on Inca Swim or something. I
 

1677
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,349
you have it on Inca Swim or something. I
don't know what you're using.

1678
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
don't know what you're using.
 

1679

don't know what you're using.
Okay, Vick's trying to get going now

1680
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
Okay, Vick's trying to get going now
 

1681
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,150
Okay, Vick's trying to get going now
through these uh hive days. If they get

1682
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,160
through these uh hive days. If they get
 

1683
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,910
through these uh hive days. If they get
through hive days, then it will try and

1684
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
through hive days, then it will try and
 

1685
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,990
through hive days, then it will try and
get all the way back up to 2030 like we

1686
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
get all the way back up to 2030 like we
 

1687
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,750
get all the way back up to 2030 like we
talked about.

1688
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:05,760
talked about.
 

1689
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,109
talked about.
And it's trying they're trying to flip

this old naked point of control and the
 

1693
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,510
this old naked point of control and the
previous day point of control. They're

1694
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:11,520
previous day point of control. They're
 

1695
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,829
previous day point of control. They're
trying to flip this for a squeeze up.

1696
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:13,839
trying to flip this for a squeeze up.
 

1697
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:23,109
trying to flip this for a squeeze up.

Maybe we'll wait four minutes for this
 

1709

You've got a gap of you. All right, I'll
double check that.

Let's see if they protect that, I guess,

1730
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:22,640
Let's see if they protect that, I guess,
 

1731
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,910
Let's see if they protect that, I guess,
first.

1732
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:25,920

 

1733
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,150

1737
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,549
trade to start the day. the first test
of supply here. So, this has faded this

1738
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
of supply here. So, this has faded this
 

1739
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,829
of supply here. So, this has faded this
back down into this. That's all I've

1740
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
back down into this. That's all I've
 

1741
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,710
back down into this. That's all I've
done so far. Now, just waiting. Let them

done so far. Now, just waiting. Let them
build out some volume and liquidity for

build out some volume and liquidity for
the next move.

1746

the next move.
 

1747
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,710
the next move.
Right,

1748
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:42,720
Right,
 

1749
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,230
Right,
I'm going to refill this tea. We've got

1750
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,240
I'm going to refill this tea. We've got
 

1751
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,470

00:49:46,480 --> 00:50:23,030
like 2 minutes until 10 a.m. I'll be
right back.

1754
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,040

 

1755
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,670

We're definitely not uptrending.

1756
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:25,680
We're definitely not uptrending.
 

1757
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,030
We're definitely not uptrending.
Um, unless you're talking about this New

1758
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:27,040
Um, unless you're talking about this New
 

1759
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,990
Um, unless you're talking about this New
York, maybe you're just talking about

1760
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,000
York, maybe you're just talking about
 

1761
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,589
York, maybe you're just talking about
the New York open. Yeah, in New York

1762
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:29,599
the New York open. Yeah, in New York
 

1763
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,390
the New York open. Yeah, in New York
open. Yeah, we're doing this.

1764
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,400
open. Yeah, we're doing this.
 

1765
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,190
open. Yeah, we're doing this.
But if you zoom out, you understand that

1766
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
But if you zoom out, you understand that
 

1767
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,270
But if you zoom out, you understand that
we are most certainly starting to break

1768
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:37,280
we are most certainly starting to break
 

1769
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,589
we are most certainly starting to break
away from some key levels, right? So,

1770
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
away from some key levels, right? So,
 

1771
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,589
away from some key levels, right? So,
this is if this is the uptrend, then

1772
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
this is if this is the uptrend, then
 

1773
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,069
this is if this is the uptrend, then
it's a higher time frame pullback, isn't

1774
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:44,079
it's a higher time frame pullback, isn't
 

1775
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,670
it's a higher time frame pullback, isn't
it? If we've left, if we think about

1776
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
it? If we've left, if we think about
 

1777
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,670
it? If we've left, if we think about
this, all right, we're pulling back. How

1778
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:47,680
this, all right, we're pulling back. How
 

1779
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,109
this, all right, we're pulling back. How
we operate here is going to be

1780
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:49,119
we operate here is going to be
 

1781
00:50:49,119 --> 00:51:02,150
we operate here is going to be
important.

1782
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:02,160

 

1783
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,150

1787
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,910
we're starting to see spikes in
volatility. We're up towards 50 points

1788
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:07,920
volatility. We're up towards 50 points
 

1789
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,630
volatility. We're up towards 50 points
per M1 candle at the moment. Just be

00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,640
per M1 candle at the moment. Just be
 

1791
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,230

Nice, Rob. Nice. Nice.

1800
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:29,359

 

1801
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,190

They're trying to get use this as

1802
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,200
They're trying to get use this as
 

1803
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,990
They're trying to get use this as
support now and trying to expand. These

1804
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
support now and trying to expand. These
 

1805
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,270
support now and trying to expand. These
are the levels they'll be looking at.

1806
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:35,280
are the levels they'll be looking at.
 

1807
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,270
are the levels they'll be looking at.
380, 395, sort of 400s, anywhere up

1808
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,280
380, 395, sort of 400s, anywhere up
 

1809
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,190
380, 395, sort of 400s, anywhere up
here. And then a squeeze will be all the

1810
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:41,200
here. And then a squeeze will be all the
 

1811
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,109
here. And then a squeeze will be all the
way up to previous day value of 450 and

1812
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:43,119
way up to previous day value of 450 and
 

1813
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,710
way up to previous day value of 450 and
above.

1814
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:44,720
above.
 

1815
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,109
above.
Right? So those who've been buying bids,

1816
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,119
Right? So those who've been buying bids,
 

1817
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,950
Right? So those who've been buying bids,
they'll be offloading into each of these

1818
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:48,960
they'll be offloading into each of these
 

1819
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,549
they'll be offloading into each of these
pushes. And if they get really lucky,

1820
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:50,559
pushes. And if they get really lucky,
 

1821
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,069
pushes. And if they get really lucky,
they're offloading to here. I would have

1822
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:52,079
they're offloading to here. I would have
 

1823
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,309
they're offloading to here. I would have
thought

1824
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:54,319
thought
 

1825
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,549
thought
every push up here is getting sold into.

1826
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:56,559
every push up here is getting sold into.
 

1827
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,630
every push up here is getting sold into.
As you can see,

1828
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
As you can see,

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,470
As you can see,
down to this same level again. It's

1830

1837
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,230
stepping on the tape here. There's a
passive seller up here at 360. He's

1838
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:08,240
passive seller up here at 360. He's

seller trying to step on the tape and
force this lower at this point. We're

1856
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:41,359
force this lower at this point. We're
 

1857
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,030
force this lower at this point. We're
right at point of control on the day at

10 again. We might get some weakness

1866
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960
10 again. We might get some weakness
 

1867
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,470
10 again. We might get some weakness
here if they really start to step on

1868
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:56,480
here if they really start to step on
 

1869
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,030
here if they really start to step on
this tape cuz overall we're bearish.

00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,990
this tape cuz overall we're bearish.
Remember, back to trend again. Back to

1872
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,000
Remember, back to trend again. Back to
 

1873
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,829
Remember, back to trend again. Back to
VWAP.

1874
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:03,839
VWAP.
 

1875
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,430
VWAP.
Messy, messy, messy. So, we can't find

1876
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:05,440
Messy, messy, messy. So, we can't find
 

1877
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,589
Messy, messy, messy. So, we can't find
acceptance over 340. We can't ac find

1878
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
acceptance over 340. We can't ac find
 

1879
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,829
acceptance over 340. We can't ac find
acceptance under 277 right now. This is

1880
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:09,839
acceptance under 277 right now. This is
 

1881
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,390
acceptance under 277 right now. This is
our range, this D-shaped profile. I'm

1882
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
our range, this D-shaped profile. I'm
 

1883
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,069
our range, this D-shaped profile. I'm
just trying to wait to see if we find

1884
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:14,079
just trying to wait to see if we find
 

1885
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:21,670
just trying to wait to see if we find
acceptance outside of either side of it.

1886
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:21,680

 

1887
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,430

ES right down to its New York open

1888
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:23,440
ES right down to its New York open
 

1889
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,510
ES right down to its New York open
again. So, relative weakness there. ES

1890
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:25,520
again. So, relative weakness there. ES
 

1891
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,069
again. So, relative weakness there. ES
is right down here right now,

1892
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
is right down here right now,
 

1893
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,790
is right down here right now,
having failed that 890 push that we

1894
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:30,800
having failed that 890 push that we
 

1895
00:53:30,800 --> 00:54:06,630
having failed that 890 push that we
talked about.

1896
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640

 

1897
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,069

big levels here. We're starting to

1898
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:08,079
big levels here. We're starting to
 

1899
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,990
big levels here. We're starting to
reject. Here's value. Back to these 80s

1900
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,000
reject. Here's value. Back to these 80s
 

1901
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,549
reject. Here's value. Back to these 80s
again. Finding a bid on edge of value

1902
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:12,559
again. Finding a bid on edge of value
 

1903
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,549
again. Finding a bid on edge of value
again. So, this is still in a rotation

1904
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:14,559
again. So, this is still in a rotation
 

1905
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,390
again. So, this is still in a rotation
until we expand value. Remember, we're

1906
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,400
until we expand value. Remember, we're
 

1907
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,230
until we expand value. Remember, we're
still above the New York open. We're

1908
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,240
still above the New York open. We're
 

1909
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,390
still above the New York open. We're
still in a rotation until we expand

1910
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:20,400
still in a rotation until we expand
 

1911
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:28,390
still in a rotation until we expand
value.

1912
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,400

 

1913
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,990

The sell is still not walked down. He's

1914
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,000
The sell is still not walked down. He's
 

1915
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,069
The sell is still not walked down. He's
still just sat there at 360s.

1916
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,079

 

1917
00:54:34,079 --> 00:55:24,390

It's still inside right now.

1918
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:24,400

 

1919
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,510

H val VWAP previous day val.

1920
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:29,520
H val VWAP previous day val.
 

1921
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,549
H val VWAP previous day val.
Are we going to expand underneath these

1922
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:34,559

 

1923
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,710

or do we go back in a rotation back to

1924
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
or do we go back in a rotation back to
 

1925
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:42,630
or do we go back in a rotation back to
top side again?

1926
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:42,640

 

1927
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,470

Yes, this New York open. They're

1928
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,480
Yes, this New York open. They're
 

1929
00:55:44,480 --> 00:56:09,510
Yes, this New York open. They're
starting to bid a bit lower here.

1930
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,520

 

1931
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,630

still holding value for now. Wonder if

1932
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:12,640
still holding value for now. Wonder if
 

1933
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,710
still holding value for now. Wonder if
there's expansion coming under these. I

1934
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:14,720
there's expansion coming under these. I
 

1935
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,470
there's expansion coming under these. I
feel like if they start losing the bid

1936
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:16,480
feel like if they start losing the bid
 

1937
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,510
feel like if they start losing the bid
here, they're going to be in big

1938
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:17,520
here, they're going to be in big
 

1939
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,950
here, they're going to be in big
trouble, but uh can't be early here.

1940
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
trouble, but uh can't be early here.
 

1941
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,750
trouble, but uh can't be early here.
Back to VWOP and PC. There we go. Back

1942
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
Back to VWOP and PC. There we go. Back
 

1943
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,950
Back to VWOP and PC. There we go. Back
to VWOP and P. Rotate, rotate, rotate,

1944
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:28,960
to VWOP and P. Rotate, rotate, rotate,
 

1945
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,470

00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
rotate, rotate, rotate. These are the
 

1947
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:40,789
rotate, rotate, rotate. These are the
markets I don't enjoy.

1948
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:40,799

 

1949
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:53,349

300s again.

1950
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:53,359

 

1951
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,950

Yeah, they're just stacking both sides.

1952
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
Yeah, they're just stacking both sides.
 

1953
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,390
Yeah, they're just stacking both sides.
No one knows what to do here at the

1954
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:56,400
No one knows what to do here at the
 

1955
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,990
No one knows what to do here at the
moment.

1956
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
moment.
 

1957
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,309
moment.
Both sides stacked. No acceptance

1958
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:00,319
Both sides stacked. No acceptance
 

1959
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,910
Both sides stacked. No acceptance
outside of the current value on the day.

1960
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
outside of the current value on the day.
 

1961
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,069
outside of the current value on the day.
You can see the rotation is just 280 or

1962
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
You can see the rotation is just 280 or
 

1963
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,430
You can see the rotation is just 280 or
275 to 340.

1964
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440
275 to 340.
 

1965
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,349
275 to 340.
We're not finding any move outside of

1966
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:09,359
We're not finding any move outside of
 

1967
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,190
We're not finding any move outside of
that yet. Nothing.

1968
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:13,200
that yet. Nothing.
 

1969
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,030
that yet. Nothing.
Yeah, exactly.

1970
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:15,040
Yeah, exactly.
 

1971
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,030
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly. Just worth waiting. If we move

1972
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:17,040
Exactly. Just worth waiting. If we move
 

1973
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,309
Exactly. Just worth waiting. If we move
outside of that, we can think about

1974
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:18,319
outside of that, we can think about
 

1975
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,829
outside of that, we can think about
attacking it, but we're just not seeing

1976
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:19,839
attacking it, but we're just not seeing
 

1977
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,430
attacking it, but we're just not seeing
it.

1978
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440

 

1979
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,270

VIX is into that gap starting to try and

1980
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
VIX is into that gap starting to try and
 

1981
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,990
VIX is into that gap starting to try and
fill. All right. So, through that New

1982
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,000
fill. All right. So, through that New
 

1983
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,670
fill. All right. So, through that New
York open high, it's trying to fill that

1984
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:29,680
York open high, it's trying to fill that
 

1985
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:37,910
York open high, it's trying to fill that
gap up to sort of 2030s at the moment.

1986
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:37,920

 

1987
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,829

Still seeing absorption on VWAP and

1988
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:39,839
Still seeing absorption on VWAP and
 

1989
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,589
Still seeing absorption on VWAP and
value area low on the day.

1990
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:43,599
value area low on the day.
 

1991
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,349
value area low on the day.
There we go. So, just absorbed again.

1992
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
There we go. So, just absorbed again.
 

1993
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:53,750
There we go. So, just absorbed again.
Just drove back through 300 again.

1994
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:53,760

 

1995
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,190

So, your New York View up, your daily VW

2186
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:54,079
ES weakness
 

2187
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,990
ES weakness
back down to its New York low.

2188
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,000

 

2189
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,870

What are these guys doing?

2190
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880
What are these guys doing?
 

2191
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,309
What are these guys doing?
It's not quite filled the gap yet. See

2192
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
It's not quite filled the gap yet. See
 

2193
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,069
It's not quite filled the gap yet. See
if it holds 20 here on a bid. If it

2194
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:06,079
if it holds 20 here on a bid. If it
 

2195
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,990
if it holds 20 here on a bid. If it
does, then it can have a little push

2196
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:08,000
does, then it can have a little push
 

2197
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,990
does, then it can have a little push
back up, add more weakness into this

2198
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,000
back up, add more weakness into this
 

2199
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:22,069
back up, add more weakness into this
market.

2200
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079

 

2201
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,069

Supreme Court does not issue the ruling

2202
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:24,079
Supreme Court does not issue the ruling
 

2203
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,829
Supreme Court does not issue the ruling
in changing to legality of Trump's

2204
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
in changing to legality of Trump's
 

2205
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,190
in changing to legality of Trump's
global tariffs. Exactly what we heard

2206
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:29,200
global tariffs. Exactly what we heard
 

2207
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,950
global tariffs. Exactly what we heard
pre-market. So, they kicked it down the

2208
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
pre-market. So, they kicked it down the
 

2209
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,710
pre-market. So, they kicked it down the
road again.

2210
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:32,720
road again.
 

2211
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,630
road again.
It's a joke, mate. This country is a

2212
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:34,640
It's a joke, mate. This country is a
 

2213
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,109
It's a joke, mate. This country is a
joke when it comes to news. Cut the

2214
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:37,119
joke when it comes to news. Cut the
 

2215
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,710
joke when it comes to news. Cut the
books and don't do what you say you're

2216
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:38,720
books and don't do what you say you're
 

2217
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:53,910
books and don't do what you say you're
going to do.

2218
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:53,920

 

2219
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:05,829

Relentless bid here.

2220
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839

 

2221
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,430

edge of value. Do we get expansion down

2222
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:07,440
edge of value. Do we get expansion down
 

2223
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,950
edge of value. Do we get expansion down
here is what I'm wondering right now.

2224
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
here is what I'm wondering right now.
 

2225
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,430
here is what I'm wondering right now.
But uh it's relentless bid here. It is

2226
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
But uh it's relentless bid here. It is
 

2227
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,710
But uh it's relentless bid here. It is
literally relentless joining in at 70s

2228
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:14,720
literally relentless joining in at 70s
 

2229
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:32,950
literally relentless joining in at 70s
and 60s.

2230
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960

 

2231
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,589

There's the bid up to 300s again. It is

2232
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:35,599
There's the bid up to 300s again. It is
 

2233
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,430
There's the bid up to 300s again. It is
relentless. It's amazing. This guy is

2234
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:37,440
relentless. It's amazing. This guy is
 

2235
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,950
relentless. It's amazing. This guy is
just un unloading bids down here.

2236
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960

 

2237
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,109

Right, ES back into New York open market

2238
01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:47,119
Right, ES back into New York open market
 

2239
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,710
Right, ES back into New York open market
back into point of control. We're back

2240
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,720
back into point of control. We're back
 

2241
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,549
back into point of control. We're back
inside value. So the edge of value now

2242
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:50,559
inside value. So the edge of value now
 

2243
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:53,190
inside value. So the edge of value now
at 330 topside.

2244
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,200
at 330 topside.
 

2245
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,950
at 330 topside.
So if they get a resqueeze, that's where

2246
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960
So if they get a resqueeze, that's where
 

2247
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,950
So if they get a resqueeze, that's where
they're going to go. If they reject

2248
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:56,960
they're going to go. If they reject
 

2249
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,309
they're going to go. If they reject
point of control, then we're going to

2250
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
point of control, then we're going to
 

2251
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,990
point of control, then we're going to
come and retest this. And if they snap

2252
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
come and retest this. And if they snap
 

2253
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,349
come and retest this. And if they snap
it, having trapped buyers, then they've

2254
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:01,359
it, having trapped buyers, then they've
 

2255
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,190
it, having trapped buyers, then they've
got a chance. But it just looks a little

2256
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
got a chance. But it just looks a little
 

2257
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,950
got a chance. But it just looks a little
messy for my liking right now. I'm going

2258
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:04,960
messy for my liking right now. I'm going
 

2259
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,230
messy for my liking right now. I'm going
to be honest, folks. I don't think they

2260
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
to be honest, folks. I don't think they
 

2261
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,829
to be honest, folks. I don't think they
know what they want to do with this at

2262
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:07,839
know what they want to do with this at
 

2263
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,430
know what they want to do with this at
the moment.

2264
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
the moment.
 

2265
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,349
the moment.
Yes, no ruling on tariffs. Like we said,

2266
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:11,359
Yes, no ruling on tariffs. Like we said,
 

2267
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,430
Yes, no ruling on tariffs. Like we said,
we said pre-market, they suggested that

2268
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:13,440
we said pre-market, they suggested that
 

2269
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,390
we said pre-market, they suggested that
would be the case and it was the case.

2270
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:16,400
would be the case and it was the case.
 

2271
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,150
would be the case and it was the case.
No ruling on it. They're going to keep

2272
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160
No ruling on it. They're going to keep
 

2273
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,670
No ruling on it. They're going to keep
kicking it down the road. This is what

2274
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:19,680
kicking it down the road. This is what
 

2275
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,910
kicking it down the road. This is what
they do and then they're going to do it

2276
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:21,920
they do and then they're going to do it
 

2277
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,630
they do and then they're going to do it
when no one expects it.

2278
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:24,640
when no one expects it.
 

2279
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,230
when no one expects it.
And by that point, it's probably priced

2280
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:26,240
And by that point, it's probably priced
 

2281
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,910
And by that point, it's probably priced
in anyway.

2282
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:29,920

 

2283
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,990

Just the way it is, right? ES so far

2284
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,000
Just the way it is, right? ES so far
 

2285
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,230
Just the way it is, right? ES so far
rejecting that New York open.

2286
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:36,240

 

2287
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,150

This is a really, really ugly day so

2288
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
This is a really, really ugly day so
 

2289
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,029
This is a really, really ugly day so
far. Very, very ugly. Not much to do

2290
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:41,039
far. Very, very ugly. Not much to do
 

2291
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,549
far. Very, very ugly. Not much to do
here, folks. We had that one trade this

2292
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:42,559
here, folks. We had that one trade this
 

2293
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,990
here, folks. We had that one trade this
morning. If we start leaving value, we

2294
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:44,000
morning. If we start leaving value, we
 

2295
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,270
morning. If we start leaving value, we
can think about trading lower. If we

2296
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:45,280
can think about trading lower. If we
 

2297
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,950
can think about trading lower. If we
start leaving value upside, we can think

2298
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:46,960
start leaving value upside, we can think
 

2299
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,309
start leaving value upside, we can think
about the squeeze up and then a fade

2300
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
about the squeeze up and then a fade
 

2301
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,270
about the squeeze up and then a fade
higher. I just do not want to bother in

2302
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
higher. I just do not want to bother in
 

2303
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,950
higher. I just do not want to bother in
here. Look what we're doing in here.

2304
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:52,960
here. Look what we're doing in here.
 

2305
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,390
here. Look what we're doing in here.
Absolutely nothing. Do you want to trade

2306
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
Absolutely nothing. Do you want to trade
 

2307
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,750
Absolutely nothing. Do you want to trade
this? You really want to trade this?

2308
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:55,760
this? You really want to trade this?
 

2309
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,309
this? You really want to trade this?
There's nothing to do in here. Not for

2310
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:58,319
There's nothing to do in here. Not for
 

2311
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,150
There's nothing to do in here. Not for
me anyway. Maybe if you if you like

2312
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:00,160
me anyway. Maybe if you if you like
 

2313
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,789
me anyway. Maybe if you if you like
trading edgeto edge, maybe that's your

2314
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:02,799
trading edgeto edge, maybe that's your
 

2315
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:12,549
trading edgeto edge, maybe that's your
bread and butter.

2316
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:12,559

 

2317
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,109

Back down to VW up again. I've got a

2318
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:15,119
Back down to VW up again. I've got a
 

2319
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:16,950
Back down to VW up again. I've got a
24-hour view up on my screen just under

2320
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
24-hour view up on my screen just under
 

2321
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,829
24-hour view up on my screen just under
here. I don't know why there quite a big

2322
01:06:19,829 --> 01:06:19,839
here. I don't know why there quite a big
 

2323
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,510
here. I don't know why there quite a big
discrepancy there between the two, but

2324
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:21,520
discrepancy there between the two, but
 

2325
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,910
discrepancy there between the two, but
we will see. Back down to value area low

2326
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:23,920
we will see. Back down to value area low
 

2327
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,589
we will see. Back down to value area low
again.

2328
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
again.
 

2329
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,430
again.
Are they going to see follow through or

2330
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:27,440
Are they going to see follow through or
 

2331
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,029
Are they going to see follow through or
this little bare flag and snap or do

2332
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
this little bare flag and snap or do
 

2333
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,309
this little bare flag and snap or do
they catch it?

2334
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:32,319
they catch it?
 

2335
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,230
they catch it?
Just everything's flat. Look at EMAs,

2336
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
Just everything's flat. Look at EMAs,
 

2337
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,829
Just everything's flat. Look at EMAs,
VWAP. Everything's flat right now. We

2338
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
VWAP. Everything's flat right now. We
 

2339
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,069
VWAP. Everything's flat right now. We
need to see some of these open up either

2340
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:38,079

underneath that. So, they're trying they
 

2497
01:10:47,040 --> 01:11:02,550
underneath that. So, they're trying they
are now trying to get down to these 45s.

2498
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:02,560

 

2499
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,550

If they reject 70s and 80s here, there's

2500
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:04,560
If they reject 70s and 80s here, there's
 

2501
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,990
If they reject 70s and 80s here, there's
a chance for follow through downside,

2502
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
a chance for follow through downside,
 

2503
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,750
a chance for follow through downside,
but it's a big if based on what I've

2504
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:07,760
but it's a big if based on what I've
 

2505
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,070
but it's a big if based on what I've
seen so far.

2506
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,080
seen so far.
 

2507
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,669
seen so far.
If they reject this value, there's a

2508
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
If they reject this value, there's a
 

2509
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,310
If they reject this value, there's a
chance for this wash and rotation.

2510
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:14,320
chance for this wash and rotation.
 

2511
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,270
chance for this wash and rotation.
But I'd say it's a big if.

2512
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:17,280
But I'd say it's a big if.
 

2513
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,590
But I'd say it's a big if.
Not uh not sure I'm liking what I'm

2514
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:19,600
Not uh not sure I'm liking what I'm
 

2515
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,790
Not uh not sure I'm liking what I'm
seeing here. Look, they're restacking

2516
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,800
seeing here. Look, they're restacking
 

2517
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:42,310
seeing here. Look, they're restacking
now. 60s, 55s, 50s, 45s. There they go.

2518
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:42,320

 

2519
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,070

Just hanging around these 70s. Same

2520
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,080
Just hanging around these 70s. Same
 

2521
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,310
Just hanging around these 70s. Same
level that this buy has been up all day.

2522
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,320
level that this buy has been up all day.
 

2523
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,510
level that this buy has been up all day.
Well, I say all day for the last I know

2524
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
Well, I say all day for the last I know
 

2525
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,630
Well, I say all day for the last I know
20 minutes. If he gets stuck though, it

2526
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:52,640
20 minutes. If he gets stuck though, it
 

2527
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,550
20 minutes. If he gets stuck though, it
will get very aggressive. I tell you

2528
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:54,560
will get very aggressive. I tell you
 

2529
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,149
will get very aggressive. I tell you
that much because it's been nonstop

2530
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:56,159
that much because it's been nonstop
 

2531
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:07,750
that much because it's been nonstop
here.

2532
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:07,760

 

2533
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,669

They're off. They're bidding at 35 now.

2534
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:09,679
They're off. They're bidding at 35 now.
 

2535
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,229
They're off. They're bidding at 35 now.
So,

2536
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:12,239
So,
 

2537
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:13,830
So,
let's see if they stay heavy versus

2538
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:13,840
let's see if they stay heavy versus
 

2539
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,070
let's see if they stay heavy versus
these 870s and 80s. If they do, there's

2540
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,080
these 870s and 80s. If they do, there's
 

2541
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,669
these 870s and 80s. If they do, there's
a wash.

2542
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679

 

2543
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,590

Maybe we can get these flow zones to

2544
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:21,600
Maybe we can get these flow zones to
 

2545
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,030
Maybe we can get these flow zones to
like come and trend and do something

2546
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,040
like come and trend and do something
 

2547
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,790
like come and trend and do something
rather than just be sideways all day.

2548
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
rather than just be sideways all day.
 

2549
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,950
rather than just be sideways all day.
Here's the attempt back into 70s and 80s

2550
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:26,960
Here's the attempt back into 70s and 80s
 

2551
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,270
Here's the attempt back into 70s and 80s
that they're trying

2552
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:29,280
that they're trying
 

2553
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,590
that they're trying
over 300. They have a squeeze. This is

2554
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:31,600
over 300. They have a squeeze. This is
 

2555
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,350
over 300. They have a squeeze. This is
the attempt back into value, back into

2556
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,360
the attempt back into value, back into
 

2557
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,110
the attempt back into value, back into
VWAP, back into this same level we've

2558
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:35,120
VWAP, back into this same level we've
 

2559
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,030
VWAP, back into this same level we've
talked about where we have just had a

2560
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:37,040
talked about where we have just had a
 

2561
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,149
talked about where we have just had a
little imbalance here.

2562
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:40,159
little imbalance here.
 

2563
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,110
little imbalance here.
Yes, right at that New York open.

2564
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:43,120
Yes, right at that New York open.
 

2565
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:47,830
Yes, right at that New York open.
We're just so stuck here, folks.

2566
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:47,840

 

2567
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,229

So, we're failing that so far on that

2568
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:50,239
So, we're failing that so far on that
 

2569
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,830
So, we're failing that so far on that
first attempt. Still not close this

2570
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
first attempt. Still not close this
 

2571
01:12:51,840 --> 01:13:06,390
first attempt. Still not close this
candle, but

2572
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:06,400

 

2573
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,310

back into value if they don't reject

2574
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:08,320
back into value if they don't reject
 

2575
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,870
back into value if they don't reject
this. So, sellers will want to reject

2576
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:10,880
this. So, sellers will want to reject
 

2577
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,630
this. So, sellers will want to reject
here. If they can't reject here, they're

2578
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:12,640
here. If they can't reject here, they're
 

2579
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,830
here. If they can't reject here, they're
going to get squeezed out right to the

2580
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:13,840
going to get squeezed out right to the
 

2581
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,310
going to get squeezed out right to the
300s again.

2582
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:18,320

 

2583
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,990

And they haven't done a very good job.

2584
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,000
And they haven't done a very good job.
 

2585
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,110
And they haven't done a very good job.
Yeah, this is a leave alone for me. Let

2586
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:23,120
Yeah, this is a leave alone for me. Let
 

2587
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:28,790
Yeah, this is a leave alone for me. Let
these guys piss about with it.

2588
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:28,800

 

2589
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,310

Let them piss about with it. They don't

2590
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,320
Let them piss about with it. They don't
 

2591
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,830
Let them piss about with it. They don't
know what they want to do, so they can

2592
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:31,840
know what they want to do, so they can
 

2593
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,630
know what they want to do, so they can
just piss about with it.

2594
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,640

 

2595
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,229

There's the squeeze up to the 300 we

2596
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:38,239
There's the squeeze up to the 300 we
 

2597
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,070
There's the squeeze up to the 300 we
just talked about. Over 300. We can come

2598
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,080
just talked about. Over 300. We can come
 

2599
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,910
just talked about. Over 300. We can come
right back up to the 320. I mean, it's

2600
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
right back up to the 320. I mean, it's
 

2601
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,590
right back up to the 320. I mean, it's
just ridiculous what's going on here.

2602
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
just ridiculous what's going on here.
 

2603
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,070
just ridiculous what's going on here.
This is just like

2604
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:46,080
This is just like
 

2605
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,830
This is just like
huge battle over a level and then a

2606
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:47,840
huge battle over a level and then a
 

2607
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,510
huge battle over a level and then a
straight move up and then we'll lack

2608
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,520
straight move up and then we'll lack
 

2609
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,110
straight move up and then we'll lack
structure again probably. Look at this

2610
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,120
structure again probably. Look at this
 

2611
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:55,750
structure again probably. Look at this
bid. Look at this bid. Holy [\h__\h] This

2612
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:55,760
bid. Look at this bid. Holy [\h__\h] This
 

2613
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,350
bid. Look at this bid. Holy [\h__\h] This
guy has just absolutely gobbled

2614
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:57,360
guy has just absolutely gobbled
 

2615
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,990
guy has just absolutely gobbled
everything from 60s and 70s and is now

2616
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:00,000
everything from 60s and 70s and is now
 

2617
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:12,229
everything from 60s and 70s and is now
non-stop trying to bid up to the 360.

2618
01:14:12,229 --> 01:14:12,239

 

2619
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:19,590

Oh my gosh.

2620
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:19,600

 

2621
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,870

Well, they're going to have to get

2622
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:20,880
Well, they're going to have to get
 

2623
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,390
Well, they're going to have to get
through this level, find acceptance

2624
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:22,400
through this level, find acceptance
 

2625
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,110
through this level, find acceptance
above 325s now, which is what they've

2626
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,120
above 325s now, which is what they've
 

2627
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,550
above 325s now, which is what they've
just tried to do on that last dip. And

2628
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:26,560
just tried to do on that last dip. And
 

2629
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,590
just tried to do on that last dip. And
if they do, they're going to try and

2630
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
if they do, they're going to try and
 

2631
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,110
if they do, they're going to try and
complete the move all the way to 400

2632
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
complete the move all the way to 400
 

2633
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,510
complete the move all the way to 400
Amino. But we lack structure now on this

2634
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,520
Amino. But we lack structure now on this
 

2635
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:36,470
Amino. But we lack structure now on this
straight move upside.

2636
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480

 

2637
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,750

I don't know what to tell you folks.

2638
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:37,760
I don't know what to tell you folks.
 

2639
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:53,590
I don't know what to tell you folks.
We're inside a rotation.

2640
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:53,600

 

2641
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,830

They're holding it. They are holding

2642
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:55,840
They're holding it. They are holding
 

2643
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,830
They're holding it. They are holding
this

2644
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840

 

2645
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,590

non-stop bid. I told you down there

2646
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:01,600
non-stop bid. I told you down there
 

2647
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,550
non-stop bid. I told you down there
there was non-stop bid.

2648
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:06,560

 

2649
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,310

I don't touch it when one side's just

2650
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,320
I don't touch it when one side's just
 

2651
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,550
I don't touch it when one side's just
being like that

2652
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,560
being like that
 

2653
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,229
being like that
when we can't break down and there's a

2654
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
when we can't break down and there's a
 

2655
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,470
when we can't break down and there's a
guy just like bye bye by bye bye. Like I

2656
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:14,480
guy just like bye bye by bye bye. Like I
 

2657
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,990
guy just like bye bye by bye bye. Like I
can't tell you like how much he bought

2658
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:16,000
can't tell you like how much he bought
 

2659
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,390
can't tell you like how much he bought
down here. It was ridiculous.

2660
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
down here. It was ridiculous.
 

2661
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,830
down here. It was ridiculous.
He just bought absolutely everything

2662
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:19,840
He just bought absolutely everything
 

2663
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,590
He just bought absolutely everything
non-stop, non-stop, non-stop, non-stop,

2664
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
non-stop, non-stop, non-stop, non-stop,
 

2665
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,270
non-stop, non-stop, non-stop, non-stop,
non-stop, non-stop. And then he chased

2666
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:23,280
non-stop, non-stop. And then he chased
 

2667
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:30,149
non-stop, non-stop. And then he chased
it all the way up.

2668
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:30,159

 

2669
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:36,310

I can show you it. Uh,

2670
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:36,320

 

2671
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,149

non-stop

2672
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:38,159
non-stop
 

2673
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,590
non-stop
buying, non-stop buying down here. Every

2674
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:41,600
buying, non-stop buying down here. Every
 

2675
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,070
buying, non-stop buying down here. Every
time it came down here was relentless

2676
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:44,080
time it came down here was relentless
 

2677
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,390
time it came down here was relentless
and then just chased this huge squeeze

2678
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:46,400
and then just chased this huge squeeze
 

2679
01:15:46,400 --> 01:16:03,830
and then just chased this huge squeeze
up.

2680
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:03,840

 

2681
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,550

Okay, so ES back to these 890s now. If

2682
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:06,560
Okay, so ES back to these 890s now. If
 

2683
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,229
Okay, so ES back to these 890s now. If
they get through the 890s, there's a

2684
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:08,239
they get through the 890s, there's a
 

2685
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:09,990
they get through the 890s, there's a
squeeze. Otherwise, this is the edge

2686
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,000
squeeze. Otherwise, this is the edge
 

2687
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:29,270
squeeze. Otherwise, this is the edge
again.

2688
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280

 

2689
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:49,110

890 is key on ES that we talked about.

2690
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:49,120

 

2691
01:16:49,120 --> 01:17:05,430

Can hold a bid over it or not?

2692
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,440

 

2693
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,830

Delete this.

2694
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:07,840
Delete this.
 

2695
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,390
Delete this.
Let me There we go.

2696
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,400
Let me There we go.
 

2697
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,910
Let me There we go.
Yeah, just nothing to do here, folks.

2698
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:11,920
Yeah, just nothing to do here, folks.
 

2699
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,630
Yeah, just nothing to do here, folks.
Really, unfortunately, it's a bit messy.

2700
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:14,640
Really, unfortunately, it's a bit messy.
 

2701
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,470
Really, unfortunately, it's a bit messy.
Maybe some of you want to bid, try and

2702
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,480
Maybe some of you want to bid, try and
 

2703
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,310
Maybe some of you want to bid, try and
force this squeeze out. I mean, I'd be

2704
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
force this squeeze out. I mean, I'd be
 

2705
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,310
force this squeeze out. I mean, I'd be
watching for ES to hold the 890s and

2706
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:20,320
watching for ES to hold the 890s and
 

2707
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,070
watching for ES to hold the 890s and
find acceptance. It's I guess it's

2708
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:22,080
find acceptance. It's I guess it's
 

2709
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,990
find acceptance. It's I guess it's
trying.

2710
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,000
trying.
 

2711
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,430
trying.
Just remember we lack structure under

2712
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,440
Just remember we lack structure under
 

2713
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,870
Just remember we lack structure under
here. You want to be very careful.

2714
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:28,880
here. You want to be very careful.
 

2715
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,430
here. You want to be very careful.
There's a seller at 360s over over this.

2716
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,440
There's a seller at 360s over over this.
 

2717
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:36,709
There's a seller at 360s over over this.
Maybe we can start squeezing

2718
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:36,719

 

2719
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,350

and targets would be up here

2720
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:39,360
and targets would be up here
 

2721
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,430
and targets would be up here
70s and 90s and then through that right

2722
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
70s and 90s and then through that right
 

2723
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:47,990
70s and 90s and then through that right
up into 450s again.

2724
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000

 

2725
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,070

Yes. Now going through that n that 90

2726
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,080
Yes. Now going through that n that 90
 

2727
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,310
Yes. Now going through that n that 90
level nicely. Can it hold a pullback

2728
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
level nicely. Can it hold a pullback
 

2729
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,790
level nicely. Can it hold a pullback
there? That's the key. You don't want to

2730
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:54,800
there? That's the key. You don't want to
 

2731
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,550
there? That's the key. You don't want to
look above and fail. Can ES hold a

2732
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:56,560
look above and fail. Can ES hold a
 

2733
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,630
look above and fail. Can ES hold a
pullback? Looks like it actually has

2734
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:58,640
pullback? Looks like it actually has
 

2735
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:12,630
pullback? Looks like it actually has
held a little pullback there

2736
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:12,640

 

2737
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,709

at 60s again. through here. We can go uh

2738
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:16,719
at 60s again. through here. We can go uh
 

2739
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:21,030
at 60s again. through here. We can go uh
yeah, definitely 80s and maybe 400s.

2740
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,040
yeah, definitely 80s and maybe 400s.
 

2741
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,550
yeah, definitely 80s and maybe 400s.
I'm just not interested. I'm not

2742
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:22,560
I'm just not interested. I'm not
 

2743
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,669
I'm just not interested. I'm not
interested in how they're setting this

2744
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:23,679
interested in how they're setting this
 

2745
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,990
interested in how they're setting this
up right now. I'm looking at a daily and

2746
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
up right now. I'm looking at a daily and
 

2747
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,430
up right now. I'm looking at a daily and
an hourly and just like doesn't look

2748
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:27,440
an hourly and just like doesn't look
 

2749
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:33,990
an hourly and just like doesn't look
very good.

2750
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,000

 

2751
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,910

Yes, trying to get going over those 90s.

2752
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:35,920
Yes, trying to get going over those 90s.
 

2753
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,590
Yes, trying to get going over those 90s.
Trying to force this squeeze up. It is

2754
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:37,600
Trying to force this squeeze up. It is
 

2755
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,350
Trying to force this squeeze up. It is
trying.

2756
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,360
trying.
 

2757
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,149
trying.
Into these 60s we go.

2758
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:42,159
Into these 60s we go.
 

2759
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:44,550
Into these 60s we go.
So, there's a seller here stacked up to

2760
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:44,560
So, there's a seller here stacked up to
 

2761
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,430
So, there's a seller here stacked up to
75. He's just sat on the book selling

2762
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
75. He's just sat on the book selling
 

2763
01:18:47,440 --> 01:19:00,550
75. He's just sat on the book selling
everything that comes his way.

2764
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:00,560

 

2765
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:09,110

We can't get through him.

2766
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:09,120

 

2767
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:20,630

Fix right back down to lower day.

2768
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:20,640

 

2769
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,709

into this opening range high. Failing at

2770
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:22,719
into this opening range high. Failing at
 

2771
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,149
into this opening range high. Failing at
this opening range high. Buyers are

2772
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
this opening range high. Buyers are
 

2773
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,830
this opening range high. Buyers are
stuck above this opening range high

2774
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:25,840
stuck above this opening range high
 

2775
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,590
stuck above this opening range high
right now. You have delta above it into

2776
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:27,600
right now. You have delta above it into
 

2777
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,590
right now. You have delta above it into
60s caught. We had a passive seller

2778
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:29,600
60s caught. We had a passive seller
 

2779
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,870
60s caught. We had a passive seller
there that we talked about all morning

2780
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
there that we talked about all morning
 

2781
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,950
there that we talked about all morning
long. So buyers really need to get back

2782
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
long. So buyers really need to get back
 

2783
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,310
long. So buyers really need to get back
above that. If they don't, we're going

2784
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:34,320
above that. If they don't, we're going
 

2785
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:41,750
above that. If they don't, we're going
to go back into this rotation again.

2786
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:41,760

 

2787
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,709

We have got a seller up at 400 though.

2788
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
We have got a seller up at 400 though.
 

2789
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,870
We have got a seller up at 400 though.
So 60 is the key level. ES looks really

2790
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:46,880
So 60 is the key level. ES looks really
 

2791
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,950
So 60 is the key level. ES looks really
strong here. It's just can ENQ get back

2792
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:48,960
strong here. It's just can ENQ get back
 

2793
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,430
strong here. It's just can ENQ get back
above this outline delta into sort of

2794
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:51,440
above this outline delta into sort of
 

2795
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,910
above this outline delta into sort of
60. If it gets back above there then

2796
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:53,920
60. If it gets back above there then
 

2797
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,590
60. If it gets back above there then
maybe we go 80s 86s and 400s is on debt.

2798
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:57,600
maybe we go 80s 86s and 400s is on debt.
 

2799
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,390
maybe we go 80s 86s and 400s is on debt.
But we will have to see

2800
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:00,400
But we will have to see
 

2801
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:07,510
But we will have to see
the moment it's struggling every push.

2802
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:07,520

 

2803
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:13,030

CBD looks awful, by the way.

2804
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040

 

2805
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:21,030

It's just like barcoding.

2806
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040

 

2807
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:26,950

Okay, testing these 60s again.

2808
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:26,960

 

2809
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,550

ES really starting to get going. It's

2810
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:28,560
ES really starting to get going. It's
 

2811
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,390
ES really starting to get going. It's
going to come into these 900s soon. So,

2812
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:30,400
going to come into these 900s soon. So,
 

2813
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,669
going to come into these 900s soon. So,
you got to imagine that whole number

2814
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:31,679
you got to imagine that whole number
 

2815
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,790
you got to imagine that whole number
might be a level for ES into this trap

2816
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,800
might be a level for ES into this trap
 

2817
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,709
might be a level for ES into this trap
buyer again. And still no acceptance

2818
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:36,719
buyer again. And still no acceptance
 

2819
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,709
buyer again. And still no acceptance
above the 60s. Above 60s there is a

2820
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:38,719
above the 60s. Above 60s there is a
 

2821
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,510
above the 60s. Above 60s there is a
squeeze out possible. And they keep

2822
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,520
squeeze out possible. And they keep
 

2823
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,310
squeeze out possible. And they keep
offering here into 75s all the way up

2824
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:44,320
offering here into 75s all the way up
 

2825
01:20:44,320 --> 01:21:12,870
offering here into 75s all the way up
into 75s which is the edge of today.

2826
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:12,880

 

2827
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,470

What a boring day. What a shame. Or at

2828
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:14,480
What a boring day. What a shame. Or at
 

2829
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,910
What a boring day. What a shame. Or at
least we had a really nice trade to

2830
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:15,920
least we had a really nice trade to
 

2831
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,310
least we had a really nice trade to
start the day.

2832
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:20,320

 

2833
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,550

Yes. Uh someone's front running that

2834
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
Yes. Uh someone's front running that
 

2835
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,830
Yes. Uh someone's front running that
6,900 in ES. Be aware of that that whole

2836
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:25,840
6,900 in ES. Be aware of that that whole
 

2837
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:47,030
6,900 in ES. Be aware of that that whole
number.

2838
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040

 

2839
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,950

Lower day mix

2840
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:50,960

 

2841
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,350

telling these 60s are big big levels

2842
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:53,360
telling these 60s are big big levels
 

2843
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,070
telling these 60s are big big levels
here. They got to get back above and

2844
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,080
here. They got to get back above and
 

2845
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,990
here. They got to get back above and
base above this if buyers want a shot of

2846
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:58,000
base above this if buyers want a shot of
 

2847
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,510
base above this if buyers want a shot of
getting up to these 400s. They are

2848
01:21:59,510 --> 01:21:59,520
getting up to these 400s. They are
 

2849
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,510
getting up to these 400s. They are
trying. They cannot do it. Initial

2850
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:01,520
trying. They cannot do it. Initial
 

2851
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:09,110
trying. They cannot do it. Initial
balance now set as well folks.

2852
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:09,120

 

2853
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,950

So you can think about an IB rotation

2854
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:10,960
So you can think about an IB rotation
 

2855
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,950
So you can think about an IB rotation
day which might fit the profile

2856
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:12,960
day which might fit the profile
 

2857
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:25,990
day which might fit the profile
especially if we look above and fail.

2858
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,000

 

2859
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,669

Here they go. Trying to get to that IB

2860
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:27,679
Here they go. Trying to get to that IB
 

2861
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,750
Here they go. Trying to get to that IB
high the 70s failed again. Couldn't even

2862
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:29,760
high the 70s failed again. Couldn't even
 

2863
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:47,590
high the 70s failed again. Couldn't even
take out high of day. So weak

2864
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:47,600

 

2865
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,590

protecting that IB high. Did ES take it

2866
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:49,600
protecting that IB high. Did ES take it
 

2867
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,870
protecting that IB high. Did ES take it
out? I think it might have taken it by

2868
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:50,880
out? I think it might have taken it by
 

2869
01:22:50,880 --> 01:23:01,189
out? I think it might have taken it by
tick or it just printed it.

2870
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199

 

2871
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,030

Somewhat surprised there isn't like one

2872
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:03,040
Somewhat surprised there isn't like one
 

2873
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,270
Somewhat surprised there isn't like one
more squeeze up leg here for them to

2874
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
more squeeze up leg here for them to
 

2875
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,669
more squeeze up leg here for them to
sell into. Maybe they're going to try

2876
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:07,679
sell into. Maybe they're going to try
 

2877
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:30,070
sell into. Maybe they're going to try
now.

2878
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080

 

2879
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:34,790

This is like the market last few weeks.

2880
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:34,800

 

2881
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,990

Compression rip compression. Can they

2882
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:38,000
Compression rip compression. Can they
 

2883
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,830
Compression rip compression. Can they
come and do a pop and then do they fade

2884
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:39,840
come and do a pop and then do they fade
 

2885
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,149
come and do a pop and then do they fade
that straight back down? Okay, taking

2909
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:47,189

All right. How are we doing on stream?

Okay, here's the squeeze.

2920
01:25:00,149 --> 01:25:00,159
Okay, here's the squeeze.
 

2921
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,910
Okay, here's the squeeze.
So, PDC will be into these 400s. ES now

2922
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:03,920
So, PDC will be into these 400s. ES now
 

2923
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,990
So, PDC will be into these 400s. ES now
into the 900s. That whole number.

2924
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:08,000
into the 900s. That whole number.
 

2925
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,470
into the 900s. That whole number.
And we can think about whether we go IB

2926
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:10,480
And we can think about whether we go IB
 

2927
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,550
And we can think about whether we go IB
uh initial balance look above and fail

uh initial balance look above and fail
 

2929
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,470
uh initial balance look above and fail
or if we're going to hold and try and

2930
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
or if we're going to hold and try and
 

2931
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,390
or if we're going to hold and try and
actually come all the way up into here.

2932
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,400
actually come all the way up into here.
 

2933
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:31,750
actually come all the way up into here.
Both of these are possible right now.

2934
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:31,760

 

2935
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,070

QQQ coming up to 50 day and a big pivot.

QQQ coming up to 50 day and a big pivot.
 

2937
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,510
QQQ coming up to 50 day and a big pivot.
It's trying to get up into this pivot

2938
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,520
It's trying to get up into this pivot
 

2939
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:42,550
It's trying to get up into this pivot
615 616 and QQQ.

2941
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,870

Does it have the juice?

2942
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880
Does it have the juice?
 

2943
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,550
Does it have the juice?
Let's measure from that gap. Hang on.

2944
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,560
Let's measure from that gap. Hang on.
 

2945
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,750
Let's measure from that gap. Hang on.
Give me a second. Coming right into 50%

2946
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:49,760
Give me a second. Coming right into 50%
 

2947
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,470
Give me a second. Coming right into 50%
off the gap actually on the cues on the

2948
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,480
off the gap actually on the cues on the
 

2949
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,310
off the gap actually on the cues on the
ETFs.

2950
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,320
ETFs.
 

2951
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,390
ETFs.
So, I might find some might struggle a

2952
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:56,400
So, I might find some might struggle a
 

2953
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,149
So, I might find some might struggle a
little bit up here. Let's see how we act

2954
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
little bit up here. Let's see how we act
 

2955
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:16,149
little bit up here. Let's see how we act
at IB.

2956
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:16,159

 

2957
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,310

rejecting

2958
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
rejecting
 

2959
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,950
rejecting
uh previous day value. Is that wrong?

2960
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:20,960
uh previous day value. Is that wrong?
 

2961
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:29,750
uh previous day value. Is that wrong?
Hang on.

2962
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760

 

2963
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:58,870

Measure this out. I've done that.

2964
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:58,880

 

2965
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:11,350

That's way off, mate. What is that?

2966
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,360

 

2967
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,030

What's wrong? I must have moved it.

2968
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:13,040
What's wrong? I must have moved it.
 

2969
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,270
What's wrong? I must have moved it.
Okay, good to know. All right, into

2970
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:15,280
Okay, good to know. All right, into
 

2971
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,790
Okay, good to know. All right, into
previous day value high here. That's why

2972
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:16,800
previous day value high here. That's why
 

2973
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,790
previous day value high here. That's why
I was just checking. Sorry, folks. Just

2974
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:18,800
I was just checking. Sorry, folks. Just
 

2975
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,550
I was just checking. Sorry, folks. Just
looked different to Ninja and it was it

2976
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
looked different to Ninja and it was it
 

2977
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,950
looked different to Ninja and it was it
was wrong.

2978
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:22,960
was wrong.
 

2979
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,950
was wrong.
Okay, previous day close up here into

2980
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:24,960
Okay, previous day close up here into
 

2981
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,510
Okay, previous day close up here into
400. ES trying to find acceptance over

2982
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:27,520
400. ES trying to find acceptance over
 

2983
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,350
400. ES trying to find acceptance over
900 right now. There's lots of buying

2984
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:29,360
900 right now. There's lots of buying
 

2985
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,110
900 right now. There's lots of buying
activity coming in up here. They might

2986
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:31,120
activity coming in up here. They might
 

2987
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,629
activity coming in up here. They might
well get trapped soon. We can think

2988
01:27:32,629 --> 01:27:32,639
well get trapped soon. We can think
 

2989
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:35,030
well get trapped soon. We can think
about an IB failure. Right? If we do a

2990
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:35,040
about an IB failure. Right? If we do a
 

2991
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,590
about an IB failure. Right? If we do a
look above, right into previous states

2992
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:37,600
look above, right into previous states
 

2993
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,750
look above, right into previous states
value into the 400 and we start failing,

2994
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:39,760
value into the 400 and we start failing,
 

2995
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,430
value into the 400 and we start failing,
we can think about that rotation back

2996
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
we can think about that rotation back
 

2997
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,550
we can think about that rotation back
down. It's very very possible.

2998
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:44,560
down. It's very very possible.
 

2999
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,950
down. It's very very possible.
So here's IB.

3000
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960

 

3001
01:27:48,960 --> 01:28:02,709

They set this up for us.

3002
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:02,719

 

3003
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,790

So, if we take the IB trade today, we're

3004
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:04,800
So, if we take the IB trade today, we're
 

3005
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,070
So, if we take the IB trade today, we're
going to have to be careful of a few

3006
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:06,080
going to have to be careful of a few
 

3007
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,110
going to have to be careful of a few
levels. A value area high into those

3008
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:09,120
levels. A value area high into those
 

3009
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,030
levels. A value area high into those
350s. The buyers that got trapped at

3010
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,040
350s. The buyers that got trapped at
 

3011
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,350
350s. The buyers that got trapped at
360. So, or they're not trapped. They

3012
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:13,360
360. So, or they're not trapped. They
 

3013
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,390
360. So, or they're not trapped. They
could have been trapped. They weren't.

3014
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:14,400
could have been trapped. They weren't.
 

3015
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,149
could have been trapped. They weren't.
So, we need to trade back under 360

3016
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,159
So, we need to trade back under 360
 

3017
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,910
So, we need to trade back under 360
really for us to really have

3018
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,920
really for us to really have
 

3019
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,310
really for us to really have
continuation follow through. Downside

3020
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,320
continuation follow through. Downside
 

3021
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,470
continuation follow through. Downside
that is right at the moment, we're

3022
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:22,480
that is right at the moment, we're
 

3023
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,470
that is right at the moment, we're
holding IB. Now, it's still printing IB

3024
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:24,480
holding IB. Now, it's still printing IB
 

3025
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,470
holding IB. Now, it's still printing IB
and holding. Same on ES. It's absorbing

3026
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
and holding. Same on ES. It's absorbing
 

3027
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,470
and holding. Same on ES. It's absorbing
IB.

3028
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480

 

3029
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,270

Um, I'll consider the fade if we do

3030
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,280
Um, I'll consider the fade if we do
 

3031
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,310
Um, I'll consider the fade if we do
something like this. And otherwise,

3032
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:36,320
something like this. And otherwise,
 

3033
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,510
something like this. And otherwise,
we're probably going to squeeze all the

3034
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:37,520
we're probably going to squeeze all the
 

3035
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:47,669
we're probably going to squeeze all the
way up into here if we can't do that.

3036
01:28:47,669 --> 01:28:47,679

 

3037
01:28:47,679 --> 01:29:06,870

Holding IB for now.

3038
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:06,880

 

3039
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,709

We're right at the daily Ballinger low

3040
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:08,719
We're right at the daily Ballinger low
 

3041
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,550
We're right at the daily Ballinger low
as well.

3042
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:12,560

 

3043
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,310

Maybe a tiny little bit more room for

3044
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:14,320
Maybe a tiny little bit more room for
 

3045
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,149
Maybe a tiny little bit more room for
the QQQ.

3046
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:16,159
the QQQ.
 

3047
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,510
the QQQ.
if it really wants to come and back

3048
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:17,520

test.
What was that pivot? 1455

3052
01:29:22,629 --> 01:29:22,639
What was that pivot? 1455
 

3053
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,510
What was that pivot? 1455
to 16s.

The only thing I'm aware of is the cash

3056
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:27,199
The only thing I'm aware of is the cash
 

3057
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,790
The only thing I'm aware of is the cash
market. If we're going to really want to

3058
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:28,800
market. If we're going to really want to
 

3059
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,030
market. If we're going to really want to
back test

3060
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:33,040

 

3061
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,510

this level here, uh if I zoom out to my

3062
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:35,520
this level here, uh if I zoom out to my
 

3063
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,189
this level here, uh if I zoom out to my
15 minutes, make it easy for you to see

3064
01:29:37,189 --> 01:29:37,199
15 minutes, make it easy for you to see
 

3065
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:39,669
15 minutes, make it easy for you to see
right here. This is also the 50-day,

3066
01:29:39,669 --> 01:29:39,679
right here. This is also the 50-day,
 

3067
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,270
right here. This is also the 50-day,
right?

3068
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:41,280
right?
 

3069
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,350
right?
But if we look at this, this is the gap.

3070
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:43,360
But if we look at this, this is the gap.
 

3071
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:47,830
But if we look at this, this is the gap.
This is 50% retrace, right? from the gap

3072
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:47,840
This is 50% retrace, right? from the gap
 

3073
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,709
This is 50% retrace, right? from the gap
to the low. We're right into it. So,

3074
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:50,719
to the low. We're right into it. So,
 

3075
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,229
to the low. We're right into it. So,
we're coming into a level of interest.

3076
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:52,239
we're coming into a level of interest.
 

3077
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:54,709
we're coming into a level of interest.
Here we go. Starting to see that fade.

3078
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:54,719
Here we go. Starting to see that fade.
 

3079
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,270
Here we go. Starting to see that fade.
Watching these uh 60s now.

3080
01:29:59,270 --> 01:29:59,280
Watching these uh 60s now.
 

3081
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,110
Watching these uh 60s now.
That's where the big buyer came in at

3082
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,120
That's where the big buyer came in at
 

3083
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,470
That's where the big buyer came in at
60s.

3084
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:04,480

 

3085
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:08,070

And he's rebid there again, folks.

3086
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,080
And he's rebid there again, folks.
 

3087
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,709
And he's rebid there again, folks.
He just rebid there again.

3088
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:10,719
He just rebid there again.
 

3089
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,149
He just rebid there again.
I'm saying I'm gonna wait for 60s

3090
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:12,159
I'm saying I'm gonna wait for 60s
 

3091
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,830
I'm saying I'm gonna wait for 60s
because this is where remember the big

3092
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:13,840
because this is where remember the big
 

3093
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,189
because this is where remember the big
buyer that was in here and we said we

3094
01:30:15,189 --> 01:30:15,199
buyer that was in here and we said we
 

3095
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,430
buyer that was in here and we said we
had outlying delta. He's just rebid

3096
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:17,440
had outlying delta. He's just rebid
 

3097
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,189
had outlying delta. He's just rebid
there again. So twice. So he bid there

3098
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:19,199
there again. So twice. So he bid there
 

3099
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,430
there again. So twice. So he bid there
at 1027 and he just bid there again on

3100
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:21,440
at 1027 and he just bid there again on
 

3101
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,189
at 1027 and he just bid there again on
that last flush down exactly the same

3102
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:23,199
that last flush down exactly the same
 

3103
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:35,110
that last flush down exactly the same
level.

3104
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:35,120

 

3105
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:39,990

[\h__\h] hell. He's not done. Hey,

3106
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:40,000

 

3107
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,750

he's got balls of steel just bidding

3108
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:41,760
he's got balls of steel just bidding
 

3109
01:30:41,760 --> 01:31:17,430
he's got balls of steel just bidding
this market nonstop.

3110
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,440

 

3111
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,910

What's our high B range today? Feel very

3112
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,920
What's our high B range today? Feel very
 

3113
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,790
What's our high B range today? Feel very
big. It's all right. 190 is actually

3114
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:22,800
big. It's all right. 190 is actually
 

3115
01:31:22,800 --> 01:32:22,709
big. It's all right. 190 is actually
quite good. Bigger than I thought.

3116
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:22,719

 

3117
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,189

3118
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:25,199
just not moving.

01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:26,629
just not moving.
I'm going to wait for them to create

3120
01:32:26,629 --> 01:32:26,639
I'm going to wait for them to create
 

3121
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:46,390
I'm going to wait for them to create
some volume and leave it.

3122
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:46,400

 

3123
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,310

buyer again.

3124
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:48,320
buyer again.

3170
01:34:43,669 --> 01:34:43,679

 

3171
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,390

Where's the outlier? 400 is the first

3172
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:46,400
Where's the outlier? 400 is the first
 

3173
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,669
Where's the outlier? 400 is the first
outlier. So see if they rebid this 400.

3174
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:49,679
outlier. So see if they rebid this 400.
 

3175
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,750
outlier. So see if they rebid this 400.
And then it's still the 60s, right?

3176
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:51,760
And then it's still the 60s, right?
 

3177
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,750
And then it's still the 60s, right?
Still the 60s. There's a big shelf down

3178
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:53,760
Still the 60s. There's a big shelf down
 

3179
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,149
Still the 60s. There's a big shelf down
there now. This level here. So, we're

3180
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
there now. This level here. So, we're
 

3181
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:57,830
there now. This level here. So, we're
bullish all the time. We're holding this

3182
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:57,840
bullish all the time. We're holding this
 

3183
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,910
bullish all the time. We're holding this
uh in the short term. That is

3184
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:01,920
uh in the short term. That is
 

3185
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,590
uh in the short term. That is
delete this now as well. We've traded

3186
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:03,600
delete this now as well. We've traded
 

3187
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,990
delete this now as well. We've traded
through it.

3188
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:06,000
through it.
 

3189
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,629
through it.
So, this is the level here

3190
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:10,639

 

3191
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:22,310

where that big buyer came in.

3192
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:22,320

 

3193
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,709

the previous day value area high trying

3194
01:35:24,709 --> 01:35:24,719
the previous day value area high trying
 

3195
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,550
the previous day value area high trying
to rebid this at the moment.

3196
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:28,560
to rebid this at the moment.
 

3197
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,229
to rebid this at the moment.
I don't think this lasts forever. I

3198
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:30,239
I don't think this lasts forever. I
 

3199
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:31,590
I don't think this lasts forever. I
don't think they can just keep bidding

3200
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:31,600
don't think they can just keep bidding
 

3201
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,270
don't think they can just keep bidding
and bidding and bidding and bidding and

3202
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:33,280
and bidding and bidding and bidding and
 

3203
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,709
and bidding and bidding and bidding and
bidding. Uh I think he's probably

3204
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
bidding. Uh I think he's probably
 

3205
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,390
bidding. Uh I think he's probably
bidding to get his exit. It's just

3206
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,400
bidding to get his exit. It's just
 

3207
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,149
bidding to get his exit. It's just
where's his exit? Is it previous week

3208
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:38,159
where's his exit? Is it previous week
 

3209
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:41,590
where's his exit? Is it previous week
low? Is it up in in this like untested

3210
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:41,600
low? Is it up in in this like untested
 

3211
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:53,110
low? Is it up in in this like untested
supply?

3212
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:53,120

 

3213
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,390

They have to hold the gray box. Yeah,

01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:54,400
They have to hold the gray box. Yeah,
 

3215
01:35:54,400 --> 01:36:19,510
They have to hold the gray box. Yeah,

3216
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:19,520

 

3217
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,950

Just trying to be patient. Wait for

01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:26,149
Just trying to be patient. Wait for
something to stand out to me.

3220
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:26,159

 

3221
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:28,310

Definitely trapped buyers at 400 so far,

3222
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:28,320
Definitely trapped buyers at 400 so far,
 

3223
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:47,510
Definitely trapped buyers at 400 so far,
but structure is still bullish.

3224
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:47,520

 

3225
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,790

It's trying to catch a little bit of a

01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:48,800
It's trying to catch a little bit of a
 

3227
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,870
It's trying to catch a little bit of a
bid at 1875.

3228
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:52,880
bid at 1875.
 

3229
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,750
bid at 1875.
No man's land though.

3230
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:55,760
No man's land though.
 

3231
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,470
No man's land though.
No man's land. Next pivot now is 1925

3232
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:58,480
No man's land. Next pivot now is 1925
 

3233
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:06,310
No man's land. Next pivot now is 1925
for a back test on VIX.

3234
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:06,320

 

3235
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,990

Right in this previous day value area

3236
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:08,000
Right in this previous day value area
 

3237
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,510
Right in this previous day value area
high right now. If we don't find

3238
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,520
high right now. If we don't find
 

3239
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,709
high right now. If we don't find
acceptance in that, then we're going to

3240
01:37:10,709 --> 01:37:10,719
acceptance in that, then we're going to
 

3241
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:17,430
acceptance in that, then we're going to
rotate previous days value again.

3242
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:17,440

 

3243
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:27,189

3245
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:29,350

we go. So, do we come back down towards

3246
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:29,360
we go. So, do we come back down towards
 

3247
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,229
we go. So, do we come back down towards
IBM 60? They still bidding above

3248
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,239
IBM 60? They still bidding above
 

3249
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:43,669
IBM 60? They still bidding above
previous day's value.

3250
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679

 

3251
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,350

See if they build out a node here and

3252
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:45,360
See if they build out a node here and
 

3253
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,109
See if they build out a node here and
then leave it.

3254
01:37:47,109 --> 01:37:47,119
then leave it.
 

3255
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,709
then leave it.
Then we might have a trade back inside

3256
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:48,719
Then we might have a trade back inside
 

3257
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,870
Then we might have a trade back inside
the range if we're lucky. If we're very

3258
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:50,880
the range if we're lucky. If we're very
 

3259

lucky.

we leave this, if we leave this trapped,
 

3283
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,590
we leave this, if we leave this trapped,
we build enough volume up here

3284
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:47,600
we build enough volume up here
 

3285
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,669

You can hold runners if they get very
 

3493
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,950
You can hold runners if they get very
weak because we lack structure in this

3494
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:52,960
weak because we lack structure in this
 

3495
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,109
weak because we lack structure in this
this candle here. We lack structure. All

3496
01:43:55,109 --> 01:43:55,119
this candle here. We lack structure. All
 

3497
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:56,950
this candle here. We lack structure. All
right. So, if we get underneath this and

3498
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:56,960
right. So, if we get underneath this and
 

3499
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,550
right. So, if we get underneath this and
stay heavy, there's a very good chance

3500
01:43:58,550 --> 01:43:58,560
stay heavy, there's a very good chance
 

3501
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,510
stay heavy, there's a very good chance
we come all the way down to the low.

3502
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:01,520
we come all the way down to the low.
 

3503
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,189
we come all the way down to the low.

3526
01:44:34,629 --> 01:44:34,639
called out what I was looking for for
 

3527
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:37,270

quite a long time. We talked about the

3528
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:37,280
quite a long time. We talked about the
 

3529
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,669
quite a long time. We talked about the
VWAP trade. We talked about trapping

3530
01:44:39,669 --> 01:44:39,679
VWAP trade. We talked about trapping
 

3531
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:42,629
VWAP trade. We talked about trapping
buyers above the 400. I told you

3532
01:44:42,629 --> 01:44:42,639
buyers above the 400. I told you
 

3533
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:44,149
buyers above the 400. I told you
numerous times buyers have got caught

3534
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
numerous times buyers have got caught
 

3535
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,790
numerous times buyers have got caught
above 400. I told you I will get heavy

3536
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
above 400. I told you I will get heavy
 

3537
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,629
above 400. I told you I will get heavy
if we come under here and we stay heavy

3538
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:48,639
if we come under here and we stay heavy
 

3539
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,669
if we come under here and we stay heavy
at 60 because that's where the big buyer

3540
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:51,679
at 60 because that's where the big buyer
 

3541
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,870
at 60 because that's where the big buyer
came in. All right, he came in here and

I can get heavy against, I get heavy and

right. Do we protect this level or
 

3595
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:29,750

further downside is the question now?

3596
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:29,760

 

3597
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,830

No, it's all right, Breezy. But like

3598
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:31,840
No, it's all right, Breezy. But like
 

3599
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,270
No, it's all right, Breezy. But like
it's not that you're tripping. I'm just

3600
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,280
it's not that you're tripping. I'm just
 

3601
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,510
it's not that you're tripping. I'm just
saying like we're not always going to

3602
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:35,520
saying like we're not always going to
 

3603
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,790
saying like we're not always going to
get perfect structure. Remember, the

3604
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:36,800
get perfect structure. Remember, the
 

3605
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,229
get perfect structure. Remember, the
market isn't always perfect. So like

3606
01:46:38,229 --> 01:46:38,239
market isn't always perfect. So like
 

3607
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:40,310
market isn't always perfect. So like
this move here, see this wick? That's

3608
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:40,320
this move here, see this wick? That's
 

3609
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,070
this move here, see this wick? That's
your retest. It's not always going to be

3610
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:42,080
your retest. It's not always going to be
 

3611
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,950
your retest. It's not always going to be
like a two, three bar buildout, which

3612
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:44,960
like a two, three bar buildout, which
 

3613
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,950
like a two, three bar buildout, which
would be lovely. Don't get me wrong. It

3614
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:46,960
would be lovely. Don't get me wrong. It
 

3615
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,149
would be lovely. Don't get me wrong. It
would have been better if we did that,

3616
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:48,159
would have been better if we did that,
 

3617
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:50,070
would have been better if we did that,
but we don't always get that, especially

3618
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,080
but we don't always get that, especially
 

3619
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,830
but we don't always get that, especially
when one side's caught. Remember, above

3620
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:51,840
when one side's caught. Remember, above
 

3621
01:46:51,840 --> 01:47:00,470
when one side's caught. Remember, above
400. If I can show you,

3622
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:00,480

 

3623
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,550

right, this guy here got caught. This is

3624
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:02,560
right, this guy here got caught. This is
 

3625
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,470
right, this guy here got caught. This is
delta. This buy side delta got caught.

3626
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:04,480
delta. This buy side delta got caught.
 

3627
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,310
delta. This buy side delta got caught.
And this is the guy I traded against.

3628
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:06,320
And this is the guy I traded against.
 

3629
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,990
And this is the guy I traded against.
Remember 100 lot, 100 lot. And I said

3630
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:08,000
Remember 100 lot, 100 lot. And I said
 

3631
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,149
Remember 100 lot, 100 lot. And I said
he's caught at 60s. This is his pain.

3632
01:47:10,149 --> 01:47:10,159
he's caught at 60s. This is his pain.
 

3633
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:12,149
he's caught at 60s. This is his pain.
So, we the moment we fail to reclaim

3634
01:47:12,149 --> 01:47:12,159
So, we the moment we fail to reclaim
 

3635
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:14,709
So, we the moment we fail to reclaim
that, he remains stuck. So it means him

3636
01:47:14,709 --> 01:47:14,719
that, he remains stuck. So it means him
 

3637
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,790
that, he remains stuck. So it means him
and the big player at 400 are all stuck.

3638
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:16,800
and the big player at 400 are all stuck.
 

3639
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,629
and the big player at 400 are all stuck.
So we use their pain to move downside.

3640
01:47:18,629 --> 01:47:18,639
So we use their pain to move downside.
 

3641
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:22,790
So we use their pain to move downside.
Yeah.

3642
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:22,800

 

3643
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,270

It's not always like unfortunately with

3644
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:25,280
It's not always like unfortunately with
 

3645
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,390
It's not always like unfortunately with
trading it's not always going to be

3646
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:26,400
trading it's not always going to be
 

3647
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,750
trading it's not always going to be
picture perfect. We're not always going

3648
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:27,760
picture perfect. We're not always going
 

3649
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,270
picture perfect. We're not always going
to get like a retest like this. Like

3650
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:29,280
to get like a retest like this. Like
 

3651
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:33,109
to get like a retest like this. Like
this is like if this had come reached up

3652
01:47:33,109 --> 01:47:33,119
this is like if this had come reached up
 

3653
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,030
this is like if this had come reached up
into here like is the perfect retest.

3654
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,040
into here like is the perfect retest.
 

3655
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,310
into here like is the perfect retest.
We're not always going to get that.

3656
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,320
We're not always going to get that.
 

3657
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,590
We're not always going to get that.
Sometimes we will. Sometimes we get

3658
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:37,600
Sometimes we will. Sometimes we get
 

3659
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:45,750
Sometimes we will. Sometimes we get
lucky but we won't always get it.

3660
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:45,760

 

3661
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,030

3666
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:51,520
Okay. Still holding runners here. Maybe
 

3667
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,590
Okay. Still holding runners here. Maybe
break lower under VW up. We will see.

3668
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:53,600
break lower under VW up. We will see.
 

3669

3673
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,590

01:47:59,590 --> 01:47:59,600
it reclaim anything up here. You do not
 

3675
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,030

VWs.

3686

VWs.
 

3687

VWs.
ES into a key pivot level here as well.

3688

3692
01:48:25,189 --> 01:48:25,199
over 900. There's no close above the IB
 

3693
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,030
over 900. There's no close above the IB
um since we've rejected. We're coming

3694
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:27,040
um since we've rejected. We're coming
 

3695
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,709

01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:28,719
back down to VWAP. It's got New York VW
 

3697
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:31,030
back down to VWAP. It's got New York VW
up left. Heavy heavy market for these

3698
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:31,040
up left. Heavy heavy market for these
 

3699
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,709
up left. Heavy heavy market for these
runners. You never know. We might get a

3700
01:48:32,709 --> 01:48:32,719
runners. You never know. We might get a
 

3701
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:35,109
runners. You never know. We might get a
full rotation if we get very very lucky.

3702
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:35,119
full rotation if we get very very lucky.
 

3703
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,109
full rotation if we get very very lucky.
But this here, remember, is key. We

3704
01:48:37,109 --> 01:48:37,119
But this here, remember, is key. We
 

3705
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:39,590
But this here, remember, is key. We
talked about it. this guy right here.

talked about it. this guy right here.
This is where the imbalance came in,

3708
01:48:42,149 --> 01:48:42,159
This is where the imbalance came in,
 

3709
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:43,990
This is where the imbalance came in,
right? Question is, can we fill some of

3710
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,000
right? Question is, can we fill some of
 

3711
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,629
right? Question is, can we fill some of
this downside? Now,

3712
01:48:46,629 --> 01:48:46,639
this downside? Now,
 

3713
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:48,390
this downside? Now,
looks great for our runners here, guys.

3714
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:48,400
looks great for our runners here, guys.
 

3715
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,189
looks great for our runners here, guys.
We very well might go back down to um

3716
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
We very well might go back down to um
 

3717
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:52,790
We very well might go back down to um
value area low on the day if we get

3718
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:52,800
value area low on the day if we get
 

3719
01:48:52,800 --> 01:49:01,350
value area low on the day if we get
very, very lucky here.

3720
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,360

 

3721
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:09,350

Would be nice.

3722
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,360

 

3723
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,030

Just manage your position. You should be

3724
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:11,040
Just manage your position. You should be
 

3725
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,629
Just manage your position. You should be
short from up here somewhere. Maybe some

3726
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:12,639
short from up here somewhere. Maybe some
 

3727
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:13,910
short from up here somewhere. Maybe some
of you added here. You should be short

3728
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:13,920
of you added here. You should be short
 

3729
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,510
of you added here. You should be short
from somewhere up here. So, just manage

3730
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:15,520
from somewhere up here. So, just manage
 

3731
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,430
from somewhere up here. So, just manage
this position and let's see if we can go

3732
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:17,440
this position and let's see if we can go
 

3733
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:31,350
this position and let's see if we can go
lower.

3734
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:31,360

 

3735
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:38,229

Where did this guy reid earlier? 87ish.

3736
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:38,239

 

3737
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,149

So I'd like to trade back in sort of 90s

3738
01:49:40,149 --> 01:49:40,159
So I'd like to trade back in sort of 90s
 

3739
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:41,990
So I'd like to trade back in sort of 90s
if possible where he started bidding

3740
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:42,000
if possible where he started bidding
 

3741
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,590
if possible where he started bidding
earlier.

3742
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:43,600
earlier.
 

3743
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:46,470
earlier.
90s would be good for the next cover

3744
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:46,480
90s would be good for the next cover
 

3745
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:50,149
90s would be good for the next cover
point. 90s down to yeah 80s would be

3746
01:49:50,149 --> 01:49:50,159
point. 90s down to yeah 80s would be
 

3747
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:52,629
point. 90s down to yeah 80s would be
nice under there. We'll see very very

3748
01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:52,639
nice under there. We'll see very very
 

3749
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:54,229
nice under there. We'll see very very
like strong weakness if we can get under

3750
01:49:54,229 --> 01:49:54,239
like strong weakness if we can get under
 

3751
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:56,709
like strong weakness if we can get under
those.

3752
01:49:56,709 --> 01:49:56,719
those.
 

3753
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,790
those.
Is it an A+ setup? No, probably not.

3754
01:49:58,790 --> 01:49:58,800
Is it an A+ setup? No, probably not.
 

3755
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,790
Is it an A+ setup? No, probably not.
It's It's a decent setup, but it's not

3756
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:00,800
It's It's a decent setup, but it's not
 

3757
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:06,070
It's It's a decent setup, but it's not
an A+

3758
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:06,080

 

3759
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:44,070

mainly because of the daily

3760
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:44,080

 

3761
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,149

There's a chance for more downside here.

3762
01:50:46,149 --> 01:50:46,159
There's a chance for more downside here.
 

3763
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:48,550
There's a chance for more downside here.
They might need to come and revisit the

3764
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:48,560
They might need to come and revisit the
 

3765
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:55,189
They might need to come and revisit the
70s first, but we will see.

3766
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199

 

3767
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:57,830

trying to find a bid coming up for that

3768
01:50:57,830 --> 01:50:57,840
trying to find a bid coming up for that
 

3769
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,310
trying to find a bid coming up for that
um pivot that we talked about that 1925

3770
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,320
um pivot that we talked about that 1925
 

3771
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,310
um pivot that we talked about that 1925
point on VIX. So you want to see VIX

3772
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:02,320
point on VIX. So you want to see VIX
 

3773
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,669
point on VIX. So you want to see VIX
reclaim that really if we're going to

3774
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:03,679
reclaim that really if we're going to
 

3775
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:07,750
reclaim that really if we're going to
stay short in this

3776
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:07,760

 

3777
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,430

don't want VIX to come up and reject

3778
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:09,440
don't want VIX to come up and reject
 

3779
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,750
don't want VIX to come up and reject
this pivot.

3780
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:11,760
this pivot.
 

3781
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,750
this pivot.
So here's the squeeze and they're

3782
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:13,760
So here's the squeeze and they're
 

3783
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,189
So here's the squeeze and they're
probably going to retest some of this

3784
01:51:15,189 --> 01:51:15,199
probably going to retest some of this
 

3785
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:17,990
probably going to retest some of this
now that we just talked about. Here we

3786
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:18,000
now that we just talked about. Here we
 

3787
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,990
now that we just talked about. Here we
go. So retesting those levels we just

3788
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:20,000
go. So retesting those levels we just
 

3789
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,070
go. So retesting those levels we just
talked about

3790
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080
talked about
 

3791
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,950
talked about
ES holding its pivot as well. So this

3792
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:24,960
ES holding its pivot as well. So this
 

3793
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:31,189
ES holding its pivot as well. So this
gray box becomes absolutely key now.

3794
01:51:31,189 --> 01:51:31,199

 

3795
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,270

And the 60s again, right? The 60s are

3796
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:33,280
And the 60s again, right? The 60s are
 

3797
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,629
And the 60s again, right? The 60s are
where those buyers came in. So this is

3798
01:51:34,629 --> 01:51:34,639
where those buyers came in. So this is
 

3799
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:36,550
where those buyers came in. So this is
going to be key

3800
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:36,560
going to be key
 

3801
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,310
going to be key
cuz do they become sellers? This is the

3802
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:38,320
cuz do they become sellers? This is the
 

3803
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,589
cuz do they become sellers? This is the
first retest to see if they become

3804
01:51:39,589 --> 01:51:39,599
first retest to see if they become
 

3805
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:41,270
first retest to see if they become
sellers. If they don't become sellers

3806
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:41,280
sellers. If they don't become sellers
 

3807
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,830
sellers. If they don't become sellers
and we reclaim IB, you do not want to

3809
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,750
and we reclaim IB, you do not want to
touch this. You've probably taken all

3810
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:45,760
touch this. You've probably taken all
 

3811
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,070
touch this. You've probably taken all
your profits now. I'm just waiting to

01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
your profits now. I'm just waiting to

01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:50,400
see if I should consider a re-entry here
 

3815
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,870

3818
01:51:54,229 --> 01:51:54,239
getting this buyer. Look at this
 

3819
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:57,270
getting this buyer. Look at this
relentless bid. It's actually quite

3820
01:51:57,270 --> 01:51:57,280
relentless bid. It's actually quite
 

3821
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,430
relentless bid. It's actually quite
insane that we're getting these huge

3822
01:51:59,430 --> 01:51:59,440
insane that we're getting these huge
 

3823
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:03,910
insane that we're getting these huge
candles up and drip downs.

3824
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,920

 

3825
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:11,109

IB being retested here.

3826
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:11,119

 

3827
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:13,350

Still holding the 60s. He's just rebid

3828
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:13,360
Still holding the 60s. He's just rebid
 

3829
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:17,109
Still holding the 60s. He's just rebid
60s. This is a dangerous take today.

3830
01:52:17,109 --> 01:52:17,119
60s. This is a dangerous take today.
 

3831
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:35,270
60s. This is a dangerous take today.
He's going to play games like this.

3832
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:35,280

 

3833
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:39,510

He's still rebidding 60s and 70s. Wild.

3834
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:39,520
He's still rebidding 60s and 70s. Wild.
 

3835
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,189
He's still rebidding 60s and 70s. Wild.
Wild. So, he's still comfortable right

3836
01:52:41,189 --> 01:52:41,199
Wild. So, he's still comfortable right
 

3837
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:48,709
Wild. So, he's still comfortable right
now. So, the next level's 400 really.

3838
01:52:48,709 --> 01:52:48,719

 

3839
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:50,149

So, I'm not touching this right now.

3840
01:52:50,149 --> 01:52:50,159
So, I'm not touching this right now.
 

3841
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:52,709
So, I'm not touching this right now.
We're going to have to close under some

3842
01:52:52,709 --> 01:52:52,719
We're going to have to close under some
 

3843
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:54,149
We're going to have to close under some
pain points for him. And we're not doing

3844
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:54,159
pain points for him. And we're not doing
 

3845
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:55,669
pain points for him. And we're not doing
that.

3846
01:52:55,669 --> 01:52:55,679
that.
 

3847
01:52:55,679 --> 01:53:01,350
that.
We are definitely not doing that.

3848
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:01,360

 

3849
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,430

And Vick's just rejected that pivot.

3850
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
And Vick's just rejected that pivot.
 

3851
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:13,510
And Vick's just rejected that pivot.
[\h__\h] me. What a mess.

3852
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:13,520

 

3853
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,229

400 we go then.

3854
01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:16,239
400 we go then.
 

3855
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:18,310
400 we go then.
Well, this is ridiculous. I'm not

3856
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:18,320
Well, this is ridiculous. I'm not
 

3857
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,950
Well, this is ridiculous. I'm not
trading this. No chance.

3858
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:20,960
trading this. No chance.
 

3859
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,270
trading this. No chance.
Too many games going on here today. We

3860
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:23,280
Too many games going on here today. We
 

3861
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,589
Too many games going on here today. We
have had like two nice trades. There's

3862
01:53:25,589 --> 01:53:25,599
have had like two nice trades. There's
 

3863
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:27,990
have had like two nice trades. There's
no way I'm gonna play this guy's game.

3864
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:28,000
no way I'm gonna play this guy's game.
 

3865
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,310
no way I'm gonna play this guy's game.
He's relentless bid

3866
01:53:30,310 --> 01:53:30,320
He's relentless bid
 

3867
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,030
He's relentless bid
on the key levels and gets a squeeze and

3868
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:33,040
on the key levels and gets a squeeze and
 

3869
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:36,390
on the key levels and gets a squeeze and
then no one shows up again. So,

3870
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:36,400
then no one shows up again. So,
 

3871
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,070
then no one shows up again. So,
I'm not going to fight him. He's way too

3872
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:38,080
I'm not going to fight him. He's way too
 

3873
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,470
I'm not going to fight him. He's way too
big for me to play. Well, I'm not going

3874
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:40,480
big for me to play. Well, I'm not going
 

3875
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,390
big for me to play. Well, I'm not going
to play upside and I'm not going to

3876
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:42,400
to play upside and I'm not going to
 

3877
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,990
to play upside and I'm not going to
fight him. So, I'm just going to leave

3878
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:44,000
fight him. So, I'm just going to leave
 

3879
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,510
fight him. So, I'm just going to leave
it.

3880
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:45,520
it.
 

3881
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:55,030
it.
Best way I can put it.

3882
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:55,040

 

3883
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,830

Look at that. [\h__\h] insane, mate. 400

01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,510

3889
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:08,229
remember? And now back there. Now back
over this 400 again.

3890
01:54:08,229 --> 01:54:08,239

 

3891
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:12,149

Absolutely insane.

3892
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:12,159
Absolutely insane.
 

3893
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:14,870
Absolutely insane.
In a quiet dull market, he's just ripped

In a quiet dull market, he's just ripped
 

3895
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:35,350
In a quiet dull market, he's just ripped
it 100 points by himself.

3896

It's also like news dropping like

about news. You've just had your

3908
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:46,480
about news. You've just had your
 

3909
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,350
about news. You've just had your
president threaten UK nonstop for like

3910
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,360
president threaten UK nonstop for like
 

3911
01:54:49,360 --> 01:55:03,910
president threaten UK nonstop for like
three or four days.

3912
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:03,920

 

3913
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:07,109

Okay. So, I couldn't hold over 400.

3914
01:55:07,109 --> 01:55:07,119
Okay. So, I couldn't hold over 400.
 

3915
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:10,390
Okay. So, I couldn't hold over 400.
Probably

3916
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:10,400

 

3917
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:14,470

new shelf being developed here now.

3918
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:14,480
new shelf being developed here now.
 

3919
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,790
new shelf being developed here now.
And just move this up. This is messy,

3920
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:16,800
And just move this up. This is messy,
 

3921
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,310
And just move this up. This is messy,
man. This is so messy.

3922
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:20,320
man. This is so messy.
 

3923
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,790
man. This is so messy.
I'm leaving this alone now, folks, until

3924
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:22,800
I'm leaving this alone now, folks, until
 

3925
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:26,470
I'm leaving this alone now, folks, until
something drastically changes.

3926
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:26,480
something drastically changes.
 

3927
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,629
something drastically changes.
Back to IB, back to these 60s again.

3928
01:55:28,629 --> 01:55:28,639
Back to IB, back to these 60s again.
 

3929
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:29,830
Back to IB, back to these 60s again.
Honestly, it's like straight up,

3930
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:29,840
Honestly, it's like straight up,
 

3931
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,669
Honestly, it's like straight up,
straight down. It's absolutely insane.

3932
01:55:31,669 --> 01:55:31,679
straight down. It's absolutely insane.
 

3933
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:33,350
straight down. It's absolutely insane.
Probably moving off the news more than

3934
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:33,360
Probably moving off the news more than
 

3935
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:38,470
Probably moving off the news more than
anything off silly comments.

3936
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:38,480

 

3937
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,470

Okay, if they rebid IB, there is a

3938
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:40,480
Okay, if they rebid IB, there is a
 

3939
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,149
Okay, if they rebid IB, there is a
chance to complete the rotation up here

3940
01:55:42,149 --> 01:55:42,159
chance to complete the rotation up here
 

3941
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:43,990
chance to complete the rotation up here
for sure. But, uh, I'm not going to play

3942
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,000
for sure. But, uh, I'm not going to play
 

3943
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,750
for sure. But, uh, I'm not going to play
it. I'm going to be honest with you.

3944
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:45,760
it. I'm going to be honest with you.
 

3945
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:47,350
it. I'm going to be honest with you.
It's too risky for me right now how

3946
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:47,360
It's too risky for me right now how
 

3947
01:55:47,360 --> 01:56:34,870
It's too risky for me right now how
we're operating.

3948
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:34,880

 

3949
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,790

This is the same kind of level we bid at

3950
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:36,800
This is the same kind of level we bid at
 

3951
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,229
This is the same kind of level we bid at
earlier. He was actually a bit lower

3952
01:56:38,229 --> 01:56:38,239
earlier. He was actually a bit lower
 

3953
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:41,910
earlier. He was actually a bit lower
earlier. He was more like 60s.

3954
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:41,920
earlier. He was more like 60s.
 

3955
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:43,990
earlier. He was more like 60s.
You can see he's here again. He keeps

3956
01:56:43,990 --> 01:56:44,000
You can see he's here again. He keeps
 

3957
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,310
You can see he's here again. He keeps
bidding

3958
01:56:46,310 --> 01:56:46,320
bidding
 

3959
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:51,990
bidding
70s75s.

3960
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,000

 

3961
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,229

Has he got his exit is the question. I

3962
01:56:54,229 --> 01:56:54,239
Has he got his exit is the question. I
 

3963
01:56:54,239 --> 01:57:00,870
Has he got his exit is the question. I
don't think that was an exit.

3964
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:00,880

 

3965
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,149

rebidding again. It's It's absolute

3966
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:04,159
rebidding again. It's It's absolute
 

3967
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:26,229
rebidding again. It's It's absolute
relentless.

3968
01:57:26,229 --> 01:57:26,239

 

3969
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:28,149

We were supposed to go down because it

3970
01:57:28,149 --> 01:57:28,159
We were supposed to go down because it
 

3971
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:30,870
We were supposed to go down because it
break gray box. It failed due to Ricky

3972
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:30,880
break gray box. It failed due to Ricky
 

3973
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,189
break gray box. It failed due to Ricky
Rich playing around. But was the model

3974
01:57:33,189 --> 01:57:33,199
Rich playing around. But was the model
 

3975
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:35,669
Rich playing around. But was the model
right? No, we

3976
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
right? No, we
 

3977
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,629
right? No, we
the model was here.

3978
01:57:38,629 --> 01:57:38,639
the model was here.
 

3979
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:41,510
the model was here.
This was the model. We waited to see if

3980
01:57:41,510 --> 01:57:41,520
This was the model. We waited to see if
 

3981
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:44,550
This was the model. We waited to see if
there was a retest to add. He squeezed

3982
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:44,560
there was a retest to add. He squeezed
 

3983
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:48,149
there was a retest to add. He squeezed
up. So, we don't add.

3984
01:57:48,149 --> 01:57:48,159
up. So, we don't add.
 

3985
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:50,390
up. So, we don't add.
Now, if he wants to hold this and

3986
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400
Now, if he wants to hold this and
 

3987
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,470
Now, if he wants to hold this and
complete rotation, he will. I'm not

3988
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:52,480
complete rotation, he will. I'm not
 

3989
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,550
complete rotation, he will. I'm not
going to really try and reade this. When

3990
01:57:54,550 --> 01:57:54,560
going to really try and reade this. When
 

3991
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,470
going to really try and reade this. When
we're back above IB, we've built

3992
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:56,480
we're back above IB, we've built
 

3993
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:58,310
we're back above IB, we've built
liquidity and there's a chance to

3994
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:58,320
liquidity and there's a chance to
 

3995
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,390
liquidity and there's a chance to
complete rotation. They needed, if I was

3996
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:00,400
complete rotation. They needed, if I was
 

3997
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,470
complete rotation. They needed, if I was
going to add more size on, I would have

3998
01:58:02,470 --> 01:58:02,480
going to add more size on, I would have
 

3999
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,310
going to add more size on, I would have
needed to see a rejection here, which we

4000
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,320
needed to see a rejection here, which we
 

4001
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,709
needed to see a rejection here, which we
haven't seen. And the thing is now he's

4002
01:58:06,709 --> 01:58:06,719
haven't seen. And the thing is now he's
 

4003
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:08,870
haven't seen. And the thing is now he's
come firing in here and firing in here

4004
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:08,880
come firing in here and firing in here
 

4005
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,870
come firing in here and firing in here
with massive size. So, I don't feel

4006
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:10,880
with massive size. So, I don't feel
 

4007
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,030
with massive size. So, I don't feel
comfortable trading in here now in this

4008
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:13,040
comfortable trading in here now in this
 

4009
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,629
comfortable trading in here now in this
slope. So, I'm just going to leave it

4010
01:58:14,629 --> 01:58:14,639
slope. So, I'm just going to leave it
 

4011
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:17,270
slope. So, I'm just going to leave it
alone. It's a messy day. The thing is

4012
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:17,280
alone. It's a messy day. The thing is
 

4013
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:18,790
alone. It's a messy day. The thing is
with everyone that like looks for

4014
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:18,800
with everyone that like looks for
 

4015
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,950
with everyone that like looks for
models, like a model just based on

4016
01:58:20,950 --> 01:58:20,960
models, like a model just based on
 

4017
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,229
models, like a model just based on
levels, you got to understand the

4018
01:58:22,229 --> 01:58:22,239
levels, you got to understand the
 

4019
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:33,669
levels, you got to understand the
environment as well.

4020
01:58:33,669 --> 01:58:33,679

 

4021
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:35,910

Yes. Back down to VW up again. Back into

4022
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:35,920
Yes. Back down to VW up again. Back into
 

4023
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:43,189
Yes. Back down to VW up again. Back into
this pivot.

4024
01:58:43,189 --> 01:58:43,199

 

4025
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:47,030

We're Yeah, we're within the frame, but

4026
01:58:47,030 --> 01:58:47,040
We're Yeah, we're within the frame, but
 

4027
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:51,109
We're Yeah, we're within the frame, but
there's a big difference between this,

4028
01:58:51,109 --> 01:58:51,119
there's a big difference between this,
 

4029
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:53,669
there's a big difference between this,
right, and this.

4030
01:58:53,669 --> 01:58:53,679
right, and this.
 

4031
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:55,350
right, and this.
That's a very big difference where we're

4032
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:55,360
That's a very big difference where we're
 

4033
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,830
That's a very big difference where we're
holding. You have to understand the

4034
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:57,840
holding. You have to understand the
 

4035
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,550
holding. You have to understand the
nuance of this. These guys are now not

4036
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560
nuance of this. These guys are now not
 

4037
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,070
nuance of this. These guys are now not
trapped. So, we're not we can't play

4038
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:02,080
trapped. So, we're not we can't play
 

4039
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:04,229
trapped. So, we're not we can't play
against them, right? Do you understand

4040
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:04,239
against them, right? Do you understand
 

4041
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:06,870
against them, right? Do you understand
liquidity? These guys is what we used to

4042
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:06,880
liquidity? These guys is what we used to
 

4043
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,229
liquidity? These guys is what we used to
break down. Did they become sellers? No.

4044
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:10,239
break down. Did they become sellers? No.
 

4045
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:12,629
break down. Did they become sellers? No.
We're back inside their range. So they

4046
01:59:12,629 --> 01:59:12,639
We're back inside their range. So they
 

4047
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:14,390
We're back inside their range. So they
can now resqueeze which is why I'm now

4048
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:14,400
can now resqueeze which is why I'm now
 

4049
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:17,030
can now resqueeze which is why I'm now
not interested in the market. We did not

4050
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
not interested in the market. We did not
 

4051
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,229
not interested in the market. We did not
show any ability to trade down from

4052
01:59:20,229 --> 01:59:20,239
show any ability to trade down from
 

4053
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:22,149
show any ability to trade down from
there. We are not using their pain to

4054
01:59:22,149 --> 01:59:22,159
there. We are not using their pain to
 

4055
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:24,390
there. We are not using their pain to
move lower right now. We're adding

4056
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:24,400
move lower right now. We're adding
 

4057
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:26,470
move lower right now. We're adding
liquidity in the same level. So, I need

4058
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:26,480
liquidity in the same level. So, I need
 

4059
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:28,149
liquidity in the same level. So, I need
to wait now to see what they want to do

4060
01:59:28,149 --> 01:59:28,159
to wait now to see what they want to do
 

4061
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:30,790
to wait now to see what they want to do
cuz it's very very possible they do this

4062
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:30,800
cuz it's very very possible they do this
 

4063
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:42,629
cuz it's very very possible they do this
if they want.

4064
01:59:42,629 --> 01:59:42,639

 

4065
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:44,470

Uh,

4066
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:44,480
Uh,
 

4067
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:47,109
Uh,
yes, Breezy 360. Yes, potentially for

4068
01:59:47,109 --> 01:59:47,119
yes, Breezy 360. Yes, potentially for
 

4069
01:59:47,119 --> 01:59:48,790
yes, Breezy 360. Yes, potentially for
the squeeze. This is that exactly what

4070
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:48,800
the squeeze. This is that exactly what
 

4071
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,790
the squeeze. This is that exactly what
we're seeing now.

4072
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:50,800
we're seeing now.
 

4073
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,470
we're seeing now.
As we always said, if they hold IB, they

4074
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:52,480
As we always said, if they hold IB, they
 

4075
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,830
As we always said, if they hold IB, they
can do this inverse head and shoulder

4076
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:53,840
can do this inverse head and shoulder
 

4077
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,350
can do this inverse head and shoulder
look and they can try and complete

4078
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:55,360
look and they can try and complete
 

4079
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:56,950
look and they can try and complete
rotation.

4080
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:56,960
rotation.
 

4081
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,229
rotation.
That's why I'm not interested in the

4082
01:59:58,229 --> 01:59:58,239
That's why I'm not interested in the
 

4083
01:59:58,239 --> 02:00:07,589
That's why I'm not interested in the
short side right now.

4084
02:00:07,589 --> 02:00:07,599

 

4085
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:10,950

Weekly gap. Um,

02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:10,960
Weekly gap. Um,
 

4087
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,550
Weekly gap. Um,
we'd have to trade all the way up to

4088
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:14,560
we'd have to trade all the way up to
 

4089
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,430
we'd have to trade all the way up to
I mean 700s. I mean it's asking a lot JD

4090
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:17,440
I mean 700s. I mean it's asking a lot JD
 

4091
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:22,870
I mean 700s. I mean it's asking a lot JD
but

4092
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:22,880

 

4093
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,030

in this market

4094
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:25,040
in this market
 

4095
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,950
in this market
who knows

who knows
or do you mean the edge of the weekly

4098
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:28,400
or do you mean the edge of the weekly
 

4099
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:32,310
or do you mean the edge of the weekly
gap like so four sort 475 to 700 is

4100
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:32,320
gap like so four sort 475 to 700 is
 

4101
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:35,990
gap like so four sort 475 to 700 is
basically the weekly gap the actual gap

4102
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:36,000
basically the weekly gap the actual gap
 

4103
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,030
basically the weekly gap the actual gap
who knows JD yes it's is it's definitely

4119
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:19,430

It would be the counter trend relief

4120
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:19,440
It would be the counter trend relief
 

4121
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:37,189
It would be the counter trend relief
trade. I'm just trying to avoid that.

4122
02:01:37,189 --> 02:01:37,199

Divergence here to ES VIX at low of day.

4190
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
Divergence here to ES VIX at low of day.
 

4191
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:30,070
Divergence here to ES VIX at low of day.
And I just think Q's is very close. So

4192
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:30,080
And I just think Q's is very close. So
 

4193
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:33,830
And I just think Q's is very close. So
we talked about Q's coming into 1450s

4194
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:33,840
we talked about Q's coming into 1450s
 

4195
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:37,270
we talked about Q's coming into 1450s
or for 15s even. It's just hit 15s. We

4196
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:37,280
or for 15s even. It's just hit 15s. We
 

4197
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:39,030
or for 15s even. It's just hit 15s. We
got the 50-day at 16. So we've got like

4198
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:39,040
got the 50-day at 16. So we've got like
 

4199
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:41,109
got the 50-day at 16. So we've got like
a dollar range there on the ETF where I

4200
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:41,119
a dollar range there on the ETF where I
 

4201
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:42,870
a dollar range there on the ETF where I
think there is a chance we will see

4202
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:42,880
think there is a chance we will see
 

4203
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,310
think there is a chance we will see
failure. If it squeezes through that,

4204
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:44,320
failure. If it squeezes through that,
 

4205
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,589
failure. If it squeezes through that,
it's going to be a giant squeeze. This

4206
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
it's going to be a giant squeeze. This
 

4207
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:47,589
it's going to be a giant squeeze. This
is the same kind of levels here. We're

4208
02:03:47,589 --> 02:03:47,599
is the same kind of levels here. We're
 

4209
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:48,870
is the same kind of levels here. We're
looking at the same kind of thing here

4210
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880

02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:53,350
They've rebid this and just forced the

extension. We are technically bullish
 

4253
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:56,070

02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:56,080
over all these levels at the moment. I
 

4255
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:57,589

fade here. So I said I'm going to leave
 

4259
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:00,629
fade here. So I said I'm going to leave
it alone. The moment it didn't react to

4260
02:05:00,629 --> 02:05:00,639
it alone. The moment it didn't react to
 

4261
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:03,350
it alone. The moment it didn't react to
this says to me, okay, if we're not

going to respect this volume, if we've

QQQ definitely reacting off that pivot
 

4331
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:02,310
QQQ definitely reacting off that pivot
which is Wednesday's lows supply from

02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:02,320
which is Wednesday's lows supply from

Okay, previous day value area highs this

4336
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:15,040
Okay, previous day value area highs this
 

4337
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,030
Okay, previous day value area highs this
rotation again to this gray box. Do they

4338
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,040
rotation again to this gray box. Do they
 

4339
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,790
rotation again to this gray box. Do they
rebid this or not? If you lose this gray

4340
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:18,800
rebid this or not? If you lose this gray
 

4341
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,430
rebid this or not? If you lose this gray
box, then I guess we have the same trade

4342
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,440
box, then I guess we have the same trade
 

4343
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,350
box, then I guess we have the same trade
setup as earlier.

4344
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:25,360

 

4345
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:27,189

consider it. I could consider it. I

4346
02:07:27,189 --> 02:07:27,199
consider it. I could consider it. I
 

4347
02:07:27,199 --> 02:07:29,589
consider it. I could consider it. I
guess it's just me. It's very messy how

4348
02:07:29,589 --> 02:07:29,599
guess it's just me. It's very messy how
 

4349
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:37,589
guess it's just me. It's very messy how
they've set it up, though.

4350
02:07:37,589 --> 02:07:37,599

 

4351
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:39,510

If they lose this, I'll consider the

4352
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:39,520
If they lose this, I'll consider the
 

4353
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,750
If they lose this, I'll consider the
rotation underneath. Not not in front of

4354
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:41,760
rotation underneath. Not not in front of
 

4355
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,350
rotation underneath. Not not in front of
they would have to lose this again. I

4356
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:43,360
they would have to lose this again. I
 

4357
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:46,550
they would have to lose this again. I
would need to see this, right?

4358
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:46,560
would need to see this, right?
 

4359
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,149
would need to see this, right?
And I need to see trap buyers come in

4360
02:07:48,149 --> 02:07:48,159
And I need to see trap buyers come in
 

4361
02:07:48,159 --> 02:07:50,149
And I need to see trap buyers come in
here. So, I'd need to see this move here

4362
02:07:50,149 --> 02:07:50,159
here. So, I'd need to see this move here
 

4363
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:51,589
here. So, I'd need to see this move here
for me to be interested at this point.

4364
02:07:51,589 --> 02:07:51,599
for me to be interested at this point.
 

4365
02:07:51,599 --> 02:08:08,470
for me to be interested at this point.
Otherwise, I'm not interested.

4366
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:08,480

 

4367
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:11,510

We are rejecting the developing value

4368
02:08:11,510 --> 02:08:11,520
We are rejecting the developing value
 

4369
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,629
We are rejecting the developing value
which is 407s.

4370
02:08:14,629 --> 02:08:14,639
which is 407s.
 

4371
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:15,910
which is 407s.
I just keep looking at the hourly

4372
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:15,920
I just keep looking at the hourly
 

4373
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,589
I just keep looking at the hourly
thinking this looks not very good for

4374
02:08:17,589 --> 02:08:17,599
thinking this looks not very good for
 

4375
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:19,750
thinking this looks not very good for
upside.

4376
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:19,760
upside.
 

4377
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:21,589
upside.
But uh it just depends if they want to

4378
02:08:21,589 --> 02:08:21,599
But uh it just depends if they want to
 

4379
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:23,430
But uh it just depends if they want to
squeeze over it or not. Okay, here back

4380
02:08:23,430 --> 02:08:23,440
squeeze over it or not. Okay, here back
 

4381
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:26,390
squeeze over it or not. Okay, here back
to the 80s we go. And do we rotate

4382
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:26,400
to the 80s we go. And do we rotate
 

4383
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:28,069
to the 80s we go. And do we rotate
underneath this gray box or not? This is

4384
02:08:28,069 --> 02:08:28,079
underneath this gray box or not? This is
 

4385
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:29,990
underneath this gray box or not? This is
what we keep talking about over and over

4386
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:30,000
what we keep talking about over and over
 

4387
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,950
what we keep talking about over and over
and over again. Right. So I'm my eyes

4388
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:32,960
and over again. Right. So I'm my eyes
 

4389
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:34,629
and over again. Right. So I'm my eyes
are firmly

4390
02:08:34,629 --> 02:08:34,639
are firmly
 

4391
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:37,430
are firmly
in here right now. I'm looking at this

4392
02:08:37,430 --> 02:08:37,440
in here right now. I'm looking at this
 

4393
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,189
in here right now. I'm looking at this
pivot

4394
02:08:39,189 --> 02:08:39,199
pivot
 

4395
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:43,189
pivot
which we've come into on QQQ on the ETF.

4396
02:08:43,189 --> 02:08:43,199
which we've come into on QQQ on the ETF.
 

4397
02:08:43,199 --> 02:08:45,109
which we've come into on QQQ on the ETF.
Right, we're rejecting this. I'm

4398
02:08:45,109 --> 02:08:45,119
Right, we're rejecting this. I'm
 

4399
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:47,990
Right, we're rejecting this. I'm
watching value for this week. We've had

4400
02:08:47,990 --> 02:08:48,000
watching value for this week. We've had
 

4401
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,910
watching value for this week. We've had
no acceptance below. So we've come back

4402
02:08:49,910 --> 02:08:49,920
no acceptance below. So we've come back
 

4403
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,589
no acceptance below. So we've come back
to the top side, but we're not finding

4404
02:08:51,589 --> 02:08:51,599
to the top side, but we're not finding
 

4405
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:53,350
to the top side, but we're not finding
acceptance above. So the question is, do

4406
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:53,360
acceptance above. So the question is, do
 

4407
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:59,669
acceptance above. So the question is, do
we then rotate back down again?

4408
02:08:59,669 --> 02:08:59,679

 

4409
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:04,870

Rotation. Okay, rotational market.

4410
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:04,880

 

4411
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,709

My least favorite market, but it's what

4412
02:09:06,709 --> 02:09:06,719
My least favorite market, but it's what
 

4413
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:13,030
My least favorite market, but it's what
we've got.

4414
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:13,040

 

4415
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,109

So still holding gray box. Still no

4416
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:15,119
So still holding gray box. Still no
 

4417
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,350
So still holding gray box. Still no
trigger for me.

4418
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:17,360
trigger for me.
 

4419
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:19,270

02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:36,800

 

4437
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:39,910

Big buyer got caught, did he?

mean, they're still holding for now.
 

4443
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:45,750
mean, they're still holding for now.
We're not We're not traded away from it

4444
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:45,760
We're not We're not traded away from it
 

4445
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:48,310
We're not We're not traded away from it
yet. Once we start trading away from it

4446
02:11:48,310 --> 02:11:48,320
yet. Once we start trading away from it
 

4447
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:49,750
yet. Once we start trading away from it
and we know that they're caught, it'll

4448
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:49,760
and we know that they're caught, it'll
 

4449
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,550
and we know that they're caught, it'll
be good. Um,

4450
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:52,560
be good. Um,
 

4451
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,310
be good. Um,
we got to get back under these 80s

4452
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,320
we got to get back under these 80s
 

4453
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,709
we got to get back under these 80s
really.

4454
02:11:56,709 --> 02:11:56,719
really.
 

4455
02:11:56,719 --> 02:11:59,510
really.
So 4 400 to uh to 380 is your current

4456
02:11:59,510 --> 02:11:59,520
So 4 400 to uh to 380 is your current
 

4457
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,189
So 4 400 to uh to 380 is your current
rotation, right? They're just battling

4458
02:12:01,189 --> 02:12:01,199
rotation, right? They're just battling
 

4459
02:12:01,199 --> 02:12:02,470
rotation, right? They're just battling
over. We're building out volume

4460
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:02,480
over. We're building out volume
 

4461
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,229
over. We're building out volume
basically. This will start to thicken

4462
02:12:04,229 --> 02:12:04,239
basically. This will start to thicken
 

4463
02:12:04,239 --> 02:12:07,030
basically. This will start to thicken
up, right? Like this, right? We're

4464
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:07,040
up, right? Like this, right? We're
 

4465
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,470
up, right? Like this, right? We're
building out this volume shelf at the

4466
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:08,480
building out this volume shelf at the
 

4467
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:21,189
building out this volume shelf at the
moment.

4468
02:12:21,189 --> 02:12:21,199

 

4469
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:22,950

Let's see if we can leave the shelf, get

4470
02:12:22,950 --> 02:12:22,960
Let's see if we can leave the shelf, get
 

4471
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:25,830
Let's see if we can leave the shelf, get
into IB, and rotate. under here again.

4472
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:25,840
into IB, and rotate. under here again.
 

4473
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:29,189
into IB, and rotate. under here again.
Remember, I got to remind you 60s was

4474
02:12:29,189 --> 02:12:29,199
Remember, I got to remind you 60s was
 

4475
02:12:29,199 --> 02:12:33,589
Remember, I got to remind you 60s was
the level that they bid at all day long.

4476
02:12:33,589 --> 02:12:33,599
the level that they bid at all day long.
 

4477
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:35,750
the level that they bid at all day long.
He's been very aggressive at 60. If he's

4478
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:35,760
He's been very aggressive at 60. If he's
 

4479
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:37,430
He's been very aggressive at 60. If he's
had his exit, he won't be there. And

4480
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:37,440
had his exit, he won't be there. And
 

4481
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:38,950
had his exit, he won't be there. And
that would be nice. If he got his exit

4482
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:38,960
that would be nice. If he got his exit
 

4483
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,470
that would be nice. If he got his exit
into pre maybe he just needed to get

4484
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:40,480
into pre maybe he just needed to get
 

4485
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:43,350
into pre maybe he just needed to get
into previous week low or something to

4486
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:43,360
into previous week low or something to
 

4487
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,350
into previous week low or something to
get his exit. So, if he was long from

4488
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:45,360
get his exit. So, if he was long from
 

4489
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,430
get his exit. So, if he was long from
here all last week, he needed to bid up

4490
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:47,440
here all last week, he needed to bid up
 

4491
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:50,229
here all last week, he needed to bid up
just to get out as possible.

4492
02:12:50,229 --> 02:12:50,239
just to get out as possible.
 

4493
02:12:50,239 --> 02:12:52,229
just to get out as possible.
I mean, he had some serious size to do

4494
02:12:52,229 --> 02:12:52,239
I mean, he had some serious size to do
 

4495
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:58,790
I mean, he had some serious size to do
it.

4496
02:12:58,790 --> 02:12:58,800

 

4497
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:01,030

Uh yeah, that value area will certainly

4498
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:01,040
Uh yeah, that value area will certainly
 

4499
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:02,550
Uh yeah, that value area will certainly
shift up if we stay up here, if we don't

4500
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:02,560
shift up if we stay up here, if we don't
 

4501
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:04,709
shift up if we stay up here, if we don't
leave it soon. Point of control will

4502
02:13:04,709 --> 02:13:04,719
leave it soon. Point of control will
 

4503
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:06,229
leave it soon. Point of control will
shift if we're here too much longer as

4504
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:06,239
shift if we're here too much longer as
 

4505
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:08,709
shift if we're here too much longer as
well. You can see we're developing a lot

4506
02:13:08,709 --> 02:13:08,719
well. You can see we're developing a lot
 

4507
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:12,470
well. You can see we're developing a lot
of uh volume up here at the moment.

4508
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:12,480
of uh volume up here at the moment.
 

4509
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,990
of uh volume up here at the moment.
So, we're finding price acceptance here

4510
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:14,000
So, we're finding price acceptance here
 

4511
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,350
So, we're finding price acceptance here
at the moment. We're we're looking to

4512
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
at the moment. We're we're looking to
 

4513
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:16,870
at the moment. We're we're looking to
leave this area and we're not leaving

4514
02:13:16,870 --> 02:13:16,880
leave this area and we're not leaving
 

4515
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:19,109
leave this area and we're not leaving
this area. If they hold it, we can't

4516
02:13:19,109 --> 02:13:19,119
this area. If they hold it, we can't
 

4517
02:13:19,119 --> 02:13:21,350
this area. If they hold it, we can't
rule out coming up here. We cannot rule

4518
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:21,360
rule out coming up here. We cannot rule
 

4519
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,790
rule out coming up here. We cannot rule
that out, right? which is why we need to

4520
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:22,800
that out, right? which is why we need to
 

4521
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:25,030
that out, right? which is why we need to
have patience for this next trade. If if

4522
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:25,040
have patience for this next trade. If if
 

4523
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:28,629
have patience for this next trade. If if
it sets up, might not set up.

4524
02:13:28,629 --> 02:13:28,639
it sets up, might not set up.
 

4525
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:30,709
it sets up, might not set up.

We've talked about that breakout Move.

4532
02:14:06,709 --> 02:14:06,719

 

4533
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:08,550

They want to trade 75s here. They're

4534
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:08,560
They want to trade 75s here. They're
 

4535
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:12,229
They want to trade 75s here. They're
trying to get these 75s going.

4536
02:14:12,229 --> 02:14:12,239
trying to get these 75s going.
 

4537
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:27,030
trying to get these 75s going.
This guy's still bidding 80s.

4538
02:14:27,030 --> 02:14:27,040

 

4539
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:29,109

They're sat trying to absorb at 80s and

4540
02:14:29,109 --> 02:14:29,119
They're sat trying to absorb at 80s and
 

4541
02:14:29,119 --> 02:14:30,310
They're sat trying to absorb at 80s and
below at the moment. Let's see if we

4542
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
below at the moment. Let's see if we
 

4543
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:33,350
below at the moment. Let's see if we
trade into them and how we act.

4544
02:14:33,350 --> 02:14:33,360
trade into them and how we act.
 

4545
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:38,470
trade into them and how we act.
Be nice to get one more trade here.

4546
02:14:38,470 --> 02:14:38,480

 

4547
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,229

Yeah, I'm sure it did, Dave. I don't I

4548
02:14:40,229 --> 02:14:40,239
Yeah, I'm sure it did, Dave. I don't I
 

4549
02:14:40,239 --> 02:14:45,109
Yeah, I'm sure it did, Dave. I don't I
don't give any uh credit to MQ

4550
02:14:45,109 --> 02:14:45,119

 

4551
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:46,950

because no institutional player is using

4552
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:46,960
because no institutional player is using
 

4553
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,629
because no institutional player is using
MQ, right? So, I need to know where the

4554
02:14:48,629 --> 02:14:48,639
MQ, right? So, I need to know where the
 

4555
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:50,550
MQ, right? So, I need to know where the
volume is that institutional players are

4556
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:50,560
volume is that institutional players are
 

4557
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:55,189
volume is that institutional players are
using.

4558
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:55,199

 

4559
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:56,790

Oh, sorry to hear that JD. Hope you're

4560
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:56,800
Oh, sorry to hear that JD. Hope you're
 

4561
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,350
Oh, sorry to hear that JD. Hope you're
okay, mate. Okay, buyers trapped at 400

4562
02:14:59,350 --> 02:14:59,360
okay, mate. Okay, buyers trapped at 400
 

4563
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:00,709
okay, mate. Okay, buyers trapped at 400
again there. They came in aggressively

4564
02:15:00,709 --> 02:15:00,719
again there. They came in aggressively
 

4565
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:02,870
again there. They came in aggressively
at 400 again and got sold into. That was

4566
02:15:02,870 --> 02:15:02,880
at 400 again and got sold into. That was
 

4567
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:05,510
at 400 again and got sold into. That was
a big lot there or decent size 75 plus

4568
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:05,520
a big lot there or decent size 75 plus
 

4569
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,069
a big lot there or decent size 75 plus
lot into 400. He just got trapped again.

4570
02:15:08,069 --> 02:15:08,079
lot into 400. He just got trapped again.
 

4571
02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:09,830
lot into 400. He just got trapped again.
We need to see this move away from this

4572
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
We need to see this move away from this
 

4573
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,629
We need to see this move away from this
gray box. I'm trying not to uh front run

4574
02:15:12,629 --> 02:15:12,639
gray box. I'm trying not to uh front run
 

4575
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:14,629
gray box. I'm trying not to uh front run
this, but definitely

4576
02:15:14,629 --> 02:15:14,639
this, but definitely
 

4577
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:17,030
this, but definitely
developing weak value area high 400 is a

4578
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:17,040
developing weak value area high 400 is a
 

4579
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,589
developing weak value area high 400 is a
big level. They keep fading that. Every

4580
02:15:19,589 --> 02:15:19,599
big level. They keep fading that. Every
 

4581
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:21,430
big level. They keep fading that. Every
time a buyer steps in here, he's being

4582
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:21,440
time a buyer steps in here, he's being
 

4583
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:24,629
time a buyer steps in here, he's being
sold into. So that's one good sign. We

4584
02:15:24,629 --> 02:15:24,639
sold into. So that's one good sign. We
 

4585
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:26,790
sold into. So that's one good sign. We
just need to move away from this level

4586
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:26,800
just need to move away from this level
 

4587
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:29,510
just need to move away from this level
now and we have to be aware of 60 if

4588
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:29,520
now and we have to be aware of 60 if
 

4589
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,589
now and we have to be aware of 60 if
we're going to trade it. Starting to see

4590
02:15:31,589 --> 02:15:31,599
we're going to trade it. Starting to see
 

4591
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:33,350
we're going to trade it. Starting to see
volume come in for downside. So here's

4592
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,360
volume come in for downside. So here's
 

4593
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,990
volume come in for downside. So here's
80s again. Can we see some aggression

4594
02:15:35,990 --> 02:15:36,000
80s again. Can we see some aggression
 

4595
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,830
80s again. Can we see some aggression
step in here and some momentum start to

4596
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:37,840
step in here and some momentum start to
 

4597
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:43,910
step in here and some momentum start to
take over

4598
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:43,920

 

4599
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,669

back to the 80s. We want to see this

4600
02:15:45,669 --> 02:15:45,679
back to the 80s. We want to see this
 

4601
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:47,350
back to the 80s. We want to see this
trade back down to 60s. We want to lose

4602
02:15:47,350 --> 02:15:47,360
trade back down to 60s. We want to lose
 

4603
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,470
trade back down to 60s. We want to lose
this PC now and trade downside.

4604
02:15:50,470 --> 02:15:50,480
this PC now and trade downside.
 

4605
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:51,669
this PC now and trade downside.
And we're going to have to be very

4606
02:15:51,669 --> 02:15:51,679
And we're going to have to be very
 

4607
02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:53,750
And we're going to have to be very
careful in and around 60s. Okay. I don't

4608
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:53,760
careful in and around 60s. Okay. I don't
 

4609
02:15:53,760 --> 02:16:04,550
careful in and around 60s. Okay. I don't
know if they're going to rebid it.

4610
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:04,560

 

4611
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:05,990

Need to see follow through. Come on,

4614
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:10,400

4615
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:12,310

Yes. Doing it. Coming back down to VWAP

4616
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:12,320
Yes. Doing it. Coming back down to VWAP
 

4617
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:14,629
Yes. Doing it. Coming back down to VWAP
already. Here we go. Okay. Beautiful.

All right. Be careful into 60s here. If

4620
02:16:16,629 --> 02:16:16,639
All right. Be careful into 60s here. If
 

4621
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:18,390
All right. Be careful into 60s here. If
you're trading this with me, you can

4622
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:18,400
you're trading this with me, you can
 

4623
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,069
you're trading this with me, you can
cover some into 60s and we can look for

4624
02:16:20,069 --> 02:16:20,079
cover some into 60s and we can look for
 

4625
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:22,790
cover some into 60s and we can look for
continuation under now. Same trade as as

4626
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:22,800
continuation under now. Same trade as as
 

4627
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,790
continuation under now. Same trade as as
earlier. Be very careful into this level

4628
02:16:24,790 --> 02:16:24,800
earlier. Be very careful into this level
 

4629
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:29,270
earlier. Be very careful into this level
here. If they start absorbing the tape,

4630
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:29,280

 

4631
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:31,109

I want this buyer to just disappear. If

4632
02:16:31,109 --> 02:16:31,119
I want this buyer to just disappear. If
 

4633
02:16:31,119 --> 02:16:33,429
I want this buyer to just disappear. If
he's not here, we can go lower. We're at

4634
02:16:33,429 --> 02:16:33,439
he's not here, we can go lower. We're at
 

4635
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:34,870
he's not here, we can go lower. We're at
value area high on the day here. So,

4636
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:34,880
value area high on the day here. So,
 

4637
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:36,629
value area high on the day here. So,
cover a little bit here and let's see.

4638
02:16:36,629 --> 02:16:36,639
cover a little bit here and let's see.
 

4639
02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:41,030
cover a little bit here and let's see.
Yes. Let's go. Give me more. Give me

4640
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:41,040
Yes. Let's go. Give me more. Give me
 

4641
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:44,150
Yes. Let's go. Give me more. Give me
more. Give me more. Let's rotate the

4642
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:44,160
more. Give me more. Let's rotate the
 

4643
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:47,669
more. Give me more. Let's rotate the
whole [\h__\h] value now. Right, Alex,

4644
02:16:47,669 --> 02:16:47,679
whole [\h__\h] value now. Right, Alex,
 

4645
02:16:47,679 --> 02:16:49,589
whole [\h__\h] value now. Right, Alex,
calm yourself down, mate. Right into

4646
02:16:49,589 --> 02:16:49,599
calm yourself down, mate. Right into
 

4647
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:51,349
calm yourself down, mate. Right into
this imbalance. Be careful here. Right.

4648
02:16:51,349 --> 02:16:51,359
this imbalance. Be careful here. Right.
 

4649
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:52,549
this imbalance. Be careful here. Right.
This is where we squeezed up. So, we're

4650
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:52,559
This is where we squeezed up. So, we're
 

4651
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:53,830
This is where we squeezed up. So, we're
going to fill some of this in. We have a

4652
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:53,840
going to fill some of this in. We have a
 

4653
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:56,230
going to fill some of this in. We have a
node here into sort of 50s, 47s, and

4654
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:56,240
node here into sort of 50s, 47s, and
 

4655
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:59,669
node here into sort of 50s, 47s, and
50s.

4656
02:16:59,669 --> 02:16:59,679

 

4657
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:02,549

Yes. Beautiful.

4658
02:17:02,549 --> 02:17:02,559
Yes. Beautiful.
 

4659
02:17:02,559 --> 02:17:04,309
Yes. Beautiful.
Taking a little bit up off there so I'm

4660
02:17:04,309 --> 02:17:04,319
Taking a little bit up off there so I'm
 

4661
02:17:04,319 --> 02:17:05,910
Taking a little bit up off there so I'm
not greedy. And let's see if we can

4662
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:05,920
not greedy. And let's see if we can
 

4663
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:09,589
not greedy. And let's see if we can
rotate the whole way.

4664
02:17:09,589 --> 02:17:09,599
rotate the whole way.
 

4665
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:11,190
rotate the whole way.
Next stop I've been looking at. It will

4666
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,200
Next stop I've been looking at. It will
 

4667
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:13,270
Next stop I've been looking at. It will
be 530s.

4668
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:13,280
be 530s.
 

4669
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:15,270
be 530s.
Again, took lots of patience. I wasn't

4670
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:15,280
Again, took lots of patience. I wasn't
 

4671
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:19,429
Again, took lots of patience. I wasn't
even convinced I was going to take it.

4672
02:17:19,429 --> 02:17:19,439

 

4673
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:21,589

Let's go.

4674
02:17:21,589 --> 02:17:21,599
Let's go.
 

4675
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:24,549
Let's go.
ES letting go now. Thank god. Right. I

ES letting go now. Thank god. Right. I
 

4677
02:17:24,559 --> 02:17:26,230
ES letting go now. Thank god. Right. I
want to see VIX trade through this pivot

4678
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:26,240
want to see VIX trade through this pivot
 

4679
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:27,990
want to see VIX trade through this pivot
that we came and failed at earlier into

4680
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:28,000
that we came and failed at earlier into
 

4681
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,150
that we came and failed at earlier into
1925. Coming into point of control here.

4682
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:30,160
1925. Coming into point of control here.
 

4683
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:32,150
1925. Coming into point of control here.
Make sure you're covering some into the

Make sure you're covering some into the
 

4685
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,469
Make sure you're covering some into the
330s here. Please into these VWAPs.

4686
02:17:34,469 --> 02:17:34,479
330s here. Please into these VWAPs.
 

4687
02:17:34,479 --> 02:17:36,629
330s here. Please into these VWAPs.
Please make sure you're covering some.

4688
02:17:36,629 --> 02:17:36,639
Please make sure you're covering some.
 

4689
02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:38,549
Please make sure you're covering some.
And once we bleed below this, it would

4690
02:17:38,549 --> 02:17:38,559
And once we bleed below this, it would
 

4691
02:17:38,559 --> 02:17:41,190
And once we bleed below this, it would
be really fun, but we got to assume that

4692
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:41,200
be really fun, but we got to assume that
 

4693
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:53,110
be really fun, but we got to assume that
might not happen.

4694
02:17:53,110 --> 02:17:53,120

 

4695
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:54,870

the same setup as earlier really. They

4696
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:54,880
the same setup as earlier really. They
 

4697
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:57,589
the same setup as earlier really. They
just have to do one more squeeze out. So

4698
02:17:57,589 --> 02:17:57,599
just have to do one more squeeze out. So
 

4699
02:17:57,599 --> 02:17:59,669
just have to do one more squeeze out. So
my assumption now is the guy that was

4700
02:17:59,669 --> 02:17:59,679
my assumption now is the guy that was
 

4701
02:17:59,679 --> 02:18:02,230
my assumption now is the guy that was
relentlessly bidding these, he needed

4702
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:02,240
relentlessly bidding these, he needed
 

4703
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:04,389
relentlessly bidding these, he needed
his exit up here into that weekly level.

4704
02:18:04,389 --> 02:18:04,399
his exit up here into that weekly level.
 

4705
02:18:04,399 --> 02:18:05,669
his exit up here into that weekly level.
He's got his exit because he's not

4706
02:18:05,669 --> 02:18:05,679
He's got his exit because he's not
 

4707
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:07,830
He's got his exit because he's not
appeared again at 60. So if we reject

4708
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:07,840
appeared again at 60. So if we reject
 

4709
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:10,309
appeared again at 60. So if we reject
60s now and reject this, we should wash

4710
02:18:10,309 --> 02:18:10,319
60s now and reject this, we should wash
 

4711
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:12,870
60s now and reject this, we should wash
hard. If he's done with it, we should

4712
02:18:12,870 --> 02:18:12,880
hard. If he's done with it, we should
 

4713
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:14,309
hard. If he's done with it, we should
wash hard because he's been propping it

4714
02:18:14,309 --> 02:18:14,319
wash hard because he's been propping it
 

4715
02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:19,190
wash hard because he's been propping it
up all day.

4716
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:19,200

 

4717
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,709

Let's go. Right. Here are the 30s. VWAP.

4718
02:18:22,709 --> 02:18:22,719
Let's go. Right. Here are the 30s. VWAP.
 

4719
02:18:22,719 --> 02:18:25,589
Let's go. Right. Here are the 30s. VWAP.
So, IB to VWAP again.

4720
02:18:25,589 --> 02:18:25,599
So, IB to VWAP again.
 

4721
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:36,469
So, IB to VWAP again.
Pay yourself here. Please

4722
02:18:36,469 --> 02:18:36,479

 

4723
02:18:36,479 --> 02:18:39,509

want this node. Now, really, if we pop,

4724
02:18:39,509 --> 02:18:39,519
want this node. Now, really, if we pop,
 

4725
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:42,230
want this node. Now, really, if we pop,
this has to act as resistance. Don't

4726
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:42,240
this has to act as resistance. Don't
 

4727
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:45,429
this has to act as resistance. Don't
want to reclaim of that.

4728
02:18:45,429 --> 02:18:45,439
want to reclaim of that.
 

4729
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:57,190
want to reclaim of that.
Certainly don't want to reclaim at that.

4730
02:18:57,190 --> 02:18:57,200

 

4731
02:18:57,200 --> 02:18:59,830

Go. We're going to come test this level.

4732
02:18:59,830 --> 02:18:59,840
Go. We're going to come test this level.
 

4733
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,669
Go. We're going to come test this level.
So, same level, right? 60 is where he

4734
02:19:01,669 --> 02:19:01,679
So, same level, right? 60 is where he
 

4735
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:03,190
So, same level, right? 60 is where he
was earlier. We don't want to just

4736
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:03,200
was earlier. We don't want to just
 

4737
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:04,309
was earlier. We don't want to just
squeeze straight through and we

4738
02:19:04,309 --> 02:19:04,319
squeeze straight through and we
 

4739
02:19:04,319 --> 02:19:06,549
squeeze straight through and we
certainly don't want it through 80s. All

4740
02:19:06,549 --> 02:19:06,559
certainly don't want it through 80s. All
 

4741
02:19:06,559 --> 02:19:07,910
certainly don't want it through 80s. All
right. That will be a leave alone

4742
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:07,920
right. That will be a leave alone
 

4743
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:10,070
right. That will be a leave alone
scenario for me, just like last time if

4744
02:19:10,070 --> 02:19:10,080
scenario for me, just like last time if
 

4745
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:16,950
scenario for me, just like last time if
we do that.

4746
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:16,960

 

4747
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:23,030

set up 80s and above

4748
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:23,040

 

4749
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:25,429

VWAP. Do they resell this now? It's a

4750
02:19:25,429 --> 02:19:25,439
VWAP. Do they resell this now? It's a
 

4751
02:19:25,439 --> 02:19:30,309
VWAP. Do they resell this now? It's a
good resell there.

4752
02:19:30,309 --> 02:19:30,319

 

4753
02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:38,230

Mr. Bid still here at 60s again,

4754
02:19:38,230 --> 02:19:38,240

 

4755
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:44,469

mate. This guy

4756
02:19:44,469 --> 02:19:44,479

All right. Well, it's now or never. They

02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:47,910
All right. Well, it's now or never. They
either sell this now or they will sell

either sell this now or they will sell
 

4761
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:49,670
either sell this now or they will sell
it never and we're going to go back

it never and we're going to go back
upside again.

4764
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:52,560
upside again.
 

4765
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:54,870
upside again.
Very ugly if they reclaim this shelf

4766
02:19:54,870 --> 02:19:54,880
Very ugly if they reclaim this shelf
 

4767
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:56,710
Very ugly if they reclaim this shelf
above this gray level. So, we want red

4768
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,720
above this gray level. So, we want red
 

4769
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:59,510
above this gray level. So, we want red
and gray to reject. Otherwise, well,

4770
02:19:59,510 --> 02:19:59,520
and gray to reject. Otherwise, well,

You went long at 340. Yeah, I don't mind
like that. But the fact of the matter

4840
02:22:01,349 --> 02:22:01,359
like that. But the fact of the matter
 

4841
02:22:01,359 --> 02:22:04,710
like that. But the fact of the matter
that we've traded through this and this

4842
02:22:04,710 --> 02:22:04,720
that we've traded through this and this
 

4843
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:07,110
that we've traded through this and this
uh is not good. We're not respecting

4844
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:07,120
uh is not good. We're not respecting
 

4845
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:09,190
uh is not good. We're not respecting
levels here on ENQ. We're not respecting

4846
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:09,200
levels here on ENQ. We're not respecting
 

4847
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,469
levels here on ENQ. We're not respecting
volume.

4848
02:22:10,469 --> 02:22:10,479
volume.
 

4849
02:22:10,479 --> 02:22:12,389
volume.
We're just one-sided when we go up.

4850
02:22:12,389 --> 02:22:12,399
We're just one-sided when we go up.
 

4851
02:22:12,399 --> 02:22:14,550
We're just one-sided when we go up.
We're one-sided.

4852
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:14,560
We're one-sided.
 

4853
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:16,309
We're one-sided.
Like, we're ripping through, ripping

4854
02:22:16,309 --> 02:22:16,319
Like, we're ripping through, ripping
 

4855
02:22:16,319 --> 02:22:17,590
Like, we're ripping through, ripping
through, ripping through. If they

4856
02:22:17,590 --> 02:22:17,600
through, ripping through. If they
 

4857
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:21,030
through, ripping through. If they
recatch this on a bid now,

4858
02:22:21,030 --> 02:22:21,040
recatch this on a bid now,
 

4859
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:24,389
recatch this on a bid now,
what are you going to do?

4860
02:22:24,389 --> 02:22:24,399
what are you going to do?
 

4861
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:26,710
what are you going to do?
Can't can't sell it again. It's had the

4862
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:26,720
Can't can't sell it again. It's had the
 

4863
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:28,150
Can't can't sell it again. It's had the
opportunity, right? I can't sell this

4864
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:28,160
opportunity, right? I can't sell this
 

4865
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:29,590
opportunity, right? I can't sell this
again. Now, this is just like earlier.

4866
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:29,600
again. Now, this is just like earlier.
 

4867
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:32,309
again. Now, this is just like earlier.
We're back over the level. So, I don't

4868
02:22:32,309 --> 02:22:32,319
We're back over the level. So, I don't
 

4869
02:22:32,319 --> 02:22:33,750
We're back over the level. So, I don't
My feeling is we're not respecting

4870
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:33,760
My feeling is we're not respecting
 

4871
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:36,710
My feeling is we're not respecting
levels uh at the moment, and that's

4872
02:22:36,710 --> 02:22:36,720
levels uh at the moment, and that's
 

4873
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:47,990
levels uh at the moment, and that's
problematic.

4874
02:22:47,990 --> 02:22:48,000

 

4875
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,510

What a squeeze. If they sell this all

4876
02:22:49,510 --> 02:22:49,520
What a squeeze. If they sell this all
 

4877
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:51,349
What a squeeze. If they sell this all
the way that down after running my

4878
02:22:51,349 --> 02:22:51,359
the way that down after running my
 

4879
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:57,110
the way that down after running my
runner out. Oh my god. You absolute

4880
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:57,120

 

4881
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:08,870

something or others.

4882
02:23:08,870 --> 02:23:08,880

 

4883
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:12,070

Big buyer here again.

4884
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,080
Big buyer here again.
 

4885
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,910
Big buyer here again.
You absolute something or others I won't

4886
02:23:13,910 --> 02:23:13,920
You absolute something or others I won't
 

4887
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:19,830
You absolute something or others I won't
say on stream.

4888
02:23:19,830 --> 02:23:19,840

 

4889
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:22,070

And they're now using this low volume

4890
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:22,080
And they're now using this low volume
 

4891
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:25,830
And they're now using this low volume
node as support. That's disgusting, man.

4892
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:25,840
node as support. That's disgusting, man.
 

4893
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:27,510
node as support. That's disgusting, man.
Yeah. Done with this for the day. No way

4894
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:27,520
Yeah. Done with this for the day. No way
 

4895
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:31,830
Yeah. Done with this for the day. No way
am I touching this.

4896
02:23:31,830 --> 02:23:31,840

 

4897
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:40,950

No way am I touching this.

4898
02:23:40,950 --> 02:23:40,960

 

4899
02:23:40,960 --> 02:24:19,510

Look at that.

4900
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,520

 

4901
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:22,710

would have really liked to have uh just

4902
02:24:22,710 --> 02:24:22,720
would have really liked to have uh just
 

4903
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:25,510
would have really liked to have uh just
got a follow through today,

4904
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:25,520
got a follow through today,
 

4905
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:26,950
got a follow through today,
but no. Well, at least we paid

4906
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:26,960
but no. Well, at least we paid
 

4907
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:29,750
but no. Well, at least we paid
ourselves. It's just a shame, man. It's

4908
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:29,760
ourselves. It's just a shame, man. It's
 

4909
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:37,590
ourselves. It's just a shame, man. It's
just a shame.

4910
02:24:37,590 --> 02:24:37,600

 

4911
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:39,429

And they're rebidding. They're not done

4912
02:24:39,429 --> 02:24:39,439
And they're rebidding. They're not done
 

4913
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:42,790
And they're rebidding. They're not done
with it. [\h__\h] hell, man.

4915
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,190
with it. [\h__\h] hell, man.
Right, let's do some giveaways. How we

4916
02:24:45,190 --> 02:24:45,200
Right, let's do some giveaways. How we
 

4917
02:24:45,200 --> 02:25:06,790
Right, let's do some giveaways. How we
doing for the likes?

4918
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:06,800

 

4919
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:09,590

Need 40 more likes here, folks.

4920
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,600
Need 40 more likes here, folks.
 

4921
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:11,910
Need 40 more likes here, folks.
Sorry, 30 more likes here. Let's get to

4922
02:25:11,910 --> 02:25:11,920
Sorry, 30 more likes here. Let's get to
 

4923
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:43,190
Sorry, 30 more likes here. Let's get to
400.

4924
02:25:43,190 --> 02:25:43,200

 

4925
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,030

and they would do giveaways cuz I'm not

4926
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:45,040
and they would do giveaways cuz I'm not
 

4927
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:51,510
and they would do giveaways cuz I'm not
touching this rest of the day. Now,

4928
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:51,520

 

4929
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:53,030

this is just this is what I would call

4930
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:53,040
this is just this is what I would call
 

4931
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:56,150
this is just this is what I would call
sloppy. So, protected this, which is

4932
02:25:56,150 --> 02:25:56,160
sloppy. So, protected this, which is
 

4933
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:58,630
sloppy. So, protected this, which is
fine. That's why we cover into here. But

4934
02:25:58,630 --> 02:25:58,640
fine. That's why we cover into here. But
 

4935
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:00,150
fine. That's why we cover into here. But
the fact that this isn't protected and

4936
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:00,160
the fact that this isn't protected and
 

4937
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:02,309
the fact that this isn't protected and
we run straight through and this isn't

4938
02:26:02,309 --> 02:26:02,319
we run straight through and this isn't
 

4939
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:05,030
we run straight through and this isn't
protected and we run straight through,

4940
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:05,040
protected and we run straight through,
 

4941
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:08,150
protected and we run straight through,
that concerns me

4942
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,160
that concerns me
 

4943
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:10,710
that concerns me
of the lack of respect for levels and so

4944
02:26:10,710 --> 02:26:10,720
of the lack of respect for levels and so
 

4945
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,630
of the lack of respect for levels and so
I need to be very very careful. They've

4946
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:12,640
I need to be very very careful. They've
 

4947
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:16,309
I need to be very very careful. They've
clearly not got their exit.

4948
02:26:16,309 --> 02:26:16,319
clearly not got their exit.
 

4949
02:26:16,319 --> 02:26:18,870
clearly not got their exit.
Overall, we're bearish. Daily is right

4950
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:18,880
Overall, we're bearish. Daily is right
 

4951
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:21,190
Overall, we're bearish. Daily is right
on lower Ballinger band. We've extended

4952
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:21,200
on lower Ballinger band. We've extended
 

4953
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:22,550
on lower Ballinger band. We've extended
outside the lower Ballinger band a

4954
02:26:22,550 --> 02:26:22,560
outside the lower Ballinger band a
 

4955
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:24,230
outside the lower Ballinger band a
quarter bid, which makes sense. We don't

4956
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:24,240
quarter bid, which makes sense. We don't
 

4957
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,150
quarter bid, which makes sense. We don't
want to extend outside of that. It's

4958
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:26,160
want to extend outside of that. It's
 

4959
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:27,590
want to extend outside of that. It's
trying to hold up and let the market

4960
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:27,600
trying to hold up and let the market
 

4961
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:30,230
trying to hold up and let the market
catch up to it. But, uh, how we're

4962
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:30,240
catch up to it. But, uh, how we're
 

4963
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:32,790
catch up to it. But, uh, how we're
playing intraday, trading through stuff,

4964
02:26:32,790 --> 02:26:32,800
playing intraday, trading through stuff,
 

4965
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:34,630
playing intraday, trading through stuff,
that concerns me when we do stuff like

4966
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:34,640
that concerns me when we do stuff like
 

4967
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:38,790
that concerns me when we do stuff like
this. That really concerns me.

4968
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:38,800
this. That really concerns me.
 

4969
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,469
this. That really concerns me.
Five and 15 look ugly. Let's have a

4970
02:26:40,469 --> 02:26:40,479
Five and 15 look ugly. Let's have a
 

4971
02:26:40,479 --> 02:26:44,230
Five and 15 look ugly. Let's have a
look.

4972
02:26:44,230 --> 02:26:44,240

 

4973
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:46,630

Yeah, it's just straight bit up back to

4974
02:26:46,630 --> 02:26:46,640
Yeah, it's just straight bit up back to
 

4975
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:55,590
Yeah, it's just straight bit up back to
this level. Right, here's your gap.

4976
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:55,600

 

4977
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:59,670

There's your gap.

4978
02:26:59,670 --> 02:26:59,680

 

4979
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:01,670

Here's your supply.

4980
02:27:01,670 --> 02:27:01,680
Here's your supply.
 

4981
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:03,910
Here's your supply.
And they're trying to retest this. It's

4982
02:27:03,910 --> 02:27:03,920
And they're trying to retest this. It's
 

4983
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:06,150
And they're trying to retest this. It's
what they want to do. They're trying to

4984
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:06,160
what they want to do. They're trying to
 

4985
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:07,670
what they want to do. They're trying to
come into this, which they're already

4986
02:27:07,670 --> 02:27:07,680
come into this, which they're already
 

4987
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:09,190
come into this, which they're already
there's divergence because we're already

4988
02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:09,200
there's divergence because we're already
 

4989
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:12,389
there's divergence because we're already
into this in the ETF. This is just 615s

4990
02:27:12,389 --> 02:27:12,399
into this in the ETF. This is just 615s
 

4991
02:27:12,399 --> 02:27:15,990
into this in the ETF. This is just 615s
in the ETF.

4992
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:16,000

 

4993
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,349

It's why they keep getting stuck here

4994
02:27:17,349 --> 02:27:17,359
It's why they keep getting stuck here
 

4995
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:23,030
It's why they keep getting stuck here
every time.

4996
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:23,040

[\h__\h] hell. Trading View piss me off.
 

4999
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:29,270
[\h__\h] hell. Trading View piss me off.
There we go.

5000
02:27:29,270 --> 02:27:29,280
There we go.
 

5001
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:34,790
There we go.
Right back into that same level again.

5002
02:27:34,790 --> 02:27:34,800

 

5003
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:36,389

There you go. Just straight squeeze back

5004
02:27:36,389 --> 02:27:36,399
There you go. Just straight squeeze back
 

5005
02:27:36,399 --> 02:27:37,510
There you go. Just straight squeeze back
up. This is what I mean. They're not

5006
02:27:37,510 --> 02:27:37,520
up. This is what I mean. They're not
 

5007
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:40,469
up. This is what I mean. They're not
respecting levels. The sellers will will

5008
02:27:40,469 --> 02:27:40,479
respecting levels. The sellers will will
 

5009
02:27:40,479 --> 02:27:52,150
respecting levels. The sellers will will
not step in at the moment.

5010
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:52,160

 

5011
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:55,190

At least we got some

5012
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:55,200
At least we got some
 

5013
02:27:55,200 --> 02:28:00,309
At least we got some
three for three. But it was

5014
02:28:00,309 --> 02:28:00,319

 

5015
02:28:00,319 --> 02:28:05,270

this this

5016
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:05,280

 

5017
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:08,230

and this. But no follow through

5018
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,240
and this. But no follow through
 

5019
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:09,910
and this. But no follow through
unfortunately. At some point probably

5020
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:09,920
unfortunately. At some point probably
 

5021
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:12,309
unfortunately. At some point probably
when I'm off stream they probably do the

5022
02:28:12,309 --> 02:28:12,319
when I'm off stream they probably do the
 

5023
02:28:12,319 --> 02:28:15,030
when I'm off stream they probably do the
follow-through trade.

5024
02:28:15,030 --> 02:28:15,040
follow-through trade.
 

5025
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:17,110
follow-through trade.
Sods law, right? Well, probably when I'm

5026
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:17,120
Sods law, right? Well, probably when I'm
 

5027
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:18,870
Sods law, right? Well, probably when I'm
done with it, they probably give the

5028
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:18,880
done with it, they probably give the
 

5029
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:20,389
done with it, they probably give the
follow through when they're done messing

5030
02:28:20,389 --> 02:28:20,399
follow through when they're done messing
 

5031
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:24,870
follow through when they're done messing
about.

5032
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:24,880

 

5033
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:26,469

No. Well, I'm trying to I'm trying to

5034
02:28:26,469 --> 02:28:26,479
No. Well, I'm trying to I'm trying to
 

5035
02:28:26,479 --> 02:28:27,910
No. Well, I'm trying to I'm trying to
stick to the higher time frame, right?

5036
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:27,920
stick to the higher time frame, right?
 

5037
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:29,270
stick to the higher time frame, right?
I'm trying to stick to the higher time

5038
02:28:29,270 --> 02:28:29,280
I'm trying to stick to the higher time
 

5039
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:31,349
I'm trying to stick to the higher time
frame. So, that's why I'm trying to

5040
02:28:31,349 --> 02:28:31,359
frame. So, that's why I'm trying to
 

5041
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:33,510
frame. So, that's why I'm trying to
trade the extremes on the sell. I'm

5042
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:33,520
trade the extremes on the sell. I'm
 

5043
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:34,950
trade the extremes on the sell. I'm
trying to trade the protrend, which is

5044
02:28:34,950 --> 02:28:34,960
trying to trade the protrend, which is
 

5045
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:38,070
trying to trade the protrend, which is
in a cell. Trying to ignore the bid up.

5046
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,080
in a cell. Trying to ignore the bid up.
 

5047
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:39,990
in a cell. Trying to ignore the bid up.
It doesn't mean it can't go higher. It

5048
02:28:39,990 --> 02:28:40,000
It doesn't mean it can't go higher. It
 

5049
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,429
It doesn't mean it can't go higher. It
doesn't mean it's not a valid trade for

5050
02:28:41,429 --> 02:28:41,439
doesn't mean it's not a valid trade for
 

5051
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:45,349
doesn't mean it's not a valid trade for
you guys. But if, let me zoom this out.

5052
02:28:45,349 --> 02:28:45,359
you guys. But if, let me zoom this out.
 

5053
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:48,230
you guys. But if, let me zoom this out.
Right? If the main trade

02:28:48,230 --> 02:28:48,240
Right? If the main trade

Right? If the main trade
right now is

02:28:51,190 --> 02:28:51,200
right now is
 

5057
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:53,190
right now is
is leaving all of this, right, we've

5058
02:28:53,190 --> 02:28:53,200
is leaving all of this, right, we've
 

5059
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:55,990
is leaving all of this, right, we've
left four weeks worth of volume, right?

I want to sell this down into the next

02:28:58,230 --> 02:28:58,240
I want to sell this down into the next
 

5063
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:00,950
I want to sell this down into the next
block. The counter trend bid up is

5064
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:00,960
block. The counter trend bid up is
 

5065
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:03,270
block. The counter trend bid up is
possible, but I would rather wait for

5066
02:29:03,270 --> 02:29:03,280
possible, but I would rather wait for
 

5067
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:04,950
possible, but I would rather wait for
buyers to get stuck and sell it down,

5068
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:04,960
buyers to get stuck and sell it down,
 

5069
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:06,070
buyers to get stuck and sell it down,
which is what we're trying to time

5070
02:29:06,070 --> 02:29:06,080
which is what we're trying to time
 

5071
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:07,750
which is what we're trying to time
today. I don't want to play this this

5072
02:29:07,750 --> 02:29:07,760
today. I don't want to play this this
 

5073
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:11,030
today. I don't want to play this this
trade here, right? I'd rather lean on it

5074
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:11,040
trade here, right? I'd rather lean on it
 

5075
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:24,309
trade here, right? I'd rather lean on it
back down. It's a safer trade for me.

5076
02:29:24,309 --> 02:29:24,319

 

5077
02:29:24,319 --> 02:29:25,910

Hopefully that makes sense. That's the

5078
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:25,920
Hopefully that makes sense. That's the
 

5079
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:27,670
Hopefully that makes sense. That's the
only reason

5080
02:29:27,670 --> 02:29:27,680
only reason
 

5081
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:38,870
only reason
it's the higher time frame.

5082
02:29:38,870 --> 02:29:38,880

02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:41,670

02:33:35,439 --> 02:33:38,070
is there going to be follow through if
ever? Hopefully soon. Back down to

5156
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:38,080
ever? Hopefully soon. Back down to
 

5157
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:40,389
ever? Hopefully soon. Back down to
previous day value area high and point

5158
02:33:40,389 --> 02:33:40,399
previous day value area high and point
 

5159
02:33:40,399 --> 02:33:42,550
previous day value area high and point
of control. Now big node down here. If

5160
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:42,560
of control. Now big node down here. If
 

5161
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:43,990
of control. Now big node down here. If
we start losing this, do they rotate

5162
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:44,000
we start losing this, do they rotate
 

5163
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,230
we start losing this, do they rotate
again? Probably. But Alex is pretty much

5164
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:46,240
again? Probably. But Alex is pretty much
 

5165
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:48,230
again? Probably. But Alex is pretty much
exhausted from having a go too many

5166
02:33:48,230 --> 02:33:48,240
exhausted from having a go too many
 

5167
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:51,190
exhausted from having a go too many
times into lunch. So, is this the time

5168
02:33:51,190 --> 02:33:51,200
times into lunch. So, is this the time
 

5169
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:53,030
times into lunch. So, is this the time
when they do it? Like I said, it's

5170
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:53,040
when they do it? Like I said, it's
 

5171
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,950
when they do it? Like I said, it's
probably going to happen when I've had

5172
02:33:54,950 --> 02:33:54,960
probably going to happen when I've had
 

5173
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:56,710
probably going to happen when I've had
enough goes, right? It's probably going

5174
02:33:56,710 --> 02:33:56,720
enough goes, right? It's probably going
 

5175
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:58,070
enough goes, right? It's probably going
to happen when I've had enough goes.

5176
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:58,080
to happen when I've had enough goes.
 

5177
02:33:58,080 --> 02:33:59,190
to happen when I've had enough goes.
It's kind of what we're seeing at the

5178
02:33:59,190 --> 02:33:59,200
It's kind of what we're seeing at the
 

5179
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:02,150
It's kind of what we're seeing at the
moment.

5180
02:34:02,150 --> 02:34:02,160
moment.
 

5181
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:10,230
moment.
Certainly feels that way.

5182
02:34:10,230 --> 02:34:10,240

 

5183
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:11,830

If they reject this node, it's probably

5184
02:34:11,830 --> 02:34:11,840
If they reject this node, it's probably
 

5185
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:14,550
If they reject this node, it's probably
going to happen. I just uh yeah, I've

5186
02:34:14,550 --> 02:34:14,560
going to happen. I just uh yeah, I've
 

5187
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:16,630
going to happen. I just uh yeah, I've
had a few attempts here already, folks,

5188
02:34:16,630 --> 02:34:16,640
had a few attempts here already, folks,

haven't I? So, having to just say to
 

5191
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:20,630
haven't I? So, having to just say to
myself, hey, you've made good money.

5192
02:34:20,630 --> 02:34:20,640
myself, hey, you've made good money.
 

5193
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:22,710
myself, hey, you've made good money.
There's not been follow through. Do you

5194
02:34:22,710 --> 02:34:22,720
There's not been follow through. Do you
 

5195
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:25,030
There's not been follow through. Do you
really want to keep forcing?

5196
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,040
really want to keep forcing?
 

5197
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,630
really want to keep forcing?
You're going to really do it now when

You're going to really do it now when

If they flush this low of day,

5204
02:34:39,990 --> 02:34:40,000
If they flush this low of day,
 

5205
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,870
If they flush this low of day,
you are gonna see a grown man cry like a

from here. This is what we failed to
 

5239
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:51,110
from here. This is what we failed to
react off, right, each time. But they're

5240
02:35:51,110 --> 02:35:51,120
react off, right, each time. But they're
 

5241
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,309
react off, right, each time. But they're
flushing through again. If they don't

5242
02:35:52,309 --> 02:35:52,319
flushing through again. If they don't
 

5243
02:35:52,319 --> 02:35:54,550
flushing through again. If they don't
protect this low now, if they sell this

5244
02:35:54,550 --> 02:35:54,560
protect this low now, if they sell this
 

5245
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:55,830
protect this low now, if they sell this
and don't protect the low, they will

02:35:55,830 --> 02:35:55,840
and don't protect the low, they will
 

5247
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:59,429

collapse the the move today. There's lot
 

5249
02:35:59,439 --> 02:36:01,750
collapse the the move today. There's lot
lots of people keep trying to attempt to

02:36:01,750 --> 02:36:01,760
lots of people keep trying to attempt to
 

5251
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:04,070

5259
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:15,030
underneath but I think it's probably
coming. This is a big strong flush.

5260
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:15,040
coming. This is a big strong flush.

it. Like you're positioned for something
and it does it when you're not in it. Or

the move I was waiting for all day.
You're probably going to get it. I'd

02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:53,040
You're probably going to get it. I'd
 

5315
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,110
You're probably going to get it. I'd
watch point control into 330s. And if

5316
02:37:55,110 --> 02:37:55,120
watch point control into 330s. And if
 

5317
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:56,389
watch point control into 330s. And if
you lose that, it is good night,

5318
02:37:56,389 --> 02:37:56,399
you lose that, it is good night,
 

5319

sweetheart.
So, if you lose this down here, it is

5322
02:38:00,790 --> 02:38:00,800
So, if you lose this down here, it is
 

5323
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:01,910
So, if you lose this down here, it is
good night. You're going to get full

5324

rotation.
 

5327
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:05,590
rotation.
At least you can see it. It's uh at

5328
02:38:05,590 --> 02:38:05,600
At least you can see it. It's uh at
 

5329
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:07,190
At least you can see it. It's uh at
least you can see what we we were

5330
02:38:07,190 --> 02:38:07,200
least you can see what we we were
 

5331
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:08,870
least you can see what we we were
looking for each time. Well, we're three

5332
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:08,880
looking for each time. Well, we're three
 

5333
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:10,230
looking for each time. Well, we're three
for three. It's not like we've lost.

5334
02:38:10,230 --> 02:38:10,240
for three. It's not like we've lost.
 

5335
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:12,469
for three. It's not like we've lost.
It's just like if this does the follow

5336
02:38:12,469 --> 02:38:12,479
It's just like if this does the follow
 

5337
02:38:12,479 --> 02:38:14,230
It's just like if this does the follow
through where I would have made all the

5338
02:38:14,230 --> 02:38:14,240
through where I would have made all the
 

5339
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:22,389
through where I would have made all the
money.

5340
02:38:22,389 --> 02:38:22,399

 

5341
02:38:22,399 --> 02:38:31,910

What does that mean? Uh Matthew,

5342
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:31,920

 

5343
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:34,150

what's that?

5344
02:38:34,150 --> 02:38:34,160
what's that?
 

5345
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:44,710
what's that?
What does it mean?

5346
02:38:44,710 --> 02:38:44,720

 

5347
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:46,550

Yes, Victor Meldrew. I don't bloody

5348
02:38:46,550 --> 02:38:46,560
Yes, Victor Meldrew. I don't bloody
 

5349
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:48,630
Yes, Victor Meldrew. I don't bloody

5351
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:53,349
believe it. Yeah, I don't bloody believe
it. Showing our age there. Um, so I'll

5352
02:38:53,349 --> 02:38:53,359
it. Showing our age there. Um, so I'll
 

5353
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:55,270
it. Showing our age there. Um, so I'll
be watching for a rejection here. Either

5354
02:38:55,270 --> 02:38:55,280
be watching for a rejection here. Either
 

5355
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:58,950
be watching for a rejection here. Either
of this. This is literally is exactly

5356
02:38:58,950 --> 02:38:58,960
of this. This is literally is exactly
 

5357
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:00,630
of this. This is literally is exactly
what we're looking for earlier, right?

5358
02:39:00,630 --> 02:39:00,640
what we're looking for earlier, right?
 

5359
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:02,630
what we're looking for earlier, right?
Either here or here needs to reject full

5360
02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:02,640
Either here or here needs to reject full
 

5361
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:04,389
Either here or here needs to reject full
follow-through downside. That's what I

5362
02:39:04,389 --> 02:39:04,399
follow-through downside. That's what I
 

5363
02:39:04,399 --> 02:39:06,230
follow-through downside. That's what I
would be personally looking for. I'm not

5364
02:39:06,230 --> 02:39:06,240
would be personally looking for. I'm not
 

5365
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,510
would be personally looking for. I'm not
going to trade it now. I've had three

5366
02:39:07,510 --> 02:39:07,520
going to trade it now. I've had three
 

5367
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:11,590
going to trade it now. I've had three
attempts on the day.

5368
02:39:11,590 --> 02:39:11,600

 

5369
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:13,349

Ronaldo.

5370
02:39:13,349 --> 02:39:13,359
Ronaldo.
 

5371
02:39:13,359 --> 02:39:17,910
Ronaldo.
Ronaldo for me.

5372
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:17,920

 

5373
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:19,110

People will hate me for that, but

5374
02:39:19,110 --> 02:39:19,120
People will hate me for that, but
 

5375
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:24,309
People will hate me for that, but
Ronaldo Messi for me.

5376
02:39:24,309 --> 02:39:24,319

 

5377
02:39:24,319 --> 02:39:27,590

I did go and watch Messi last year

5378
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:27,600
I did go and watch Messi last year
 

5379
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:31,429
I did go and watch Messi last year
uh for into Miami against LAFC and

5380
02:39:31,429 --> 02:39:31,439
uh for into Miami against LAFC and
 

5381
02:39:31,439 --> 02:39:33,429
uh for into Miami against LAFC and
Suarez and all them lot. Right. So, here

5382
02:39:33,429 --> 02:39:33,439
Suarez and all them lot. Right. So, here
 

5383
02:39:33,439 --> 02:39:35,110
Suarez and all them lot. Right. So, here
you're going to get this retest. This is

5384
02:39:35,110 --> 02:39:35,120
you're going to get this retest. This is
 

5385
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:36,710
you're going to get this retest. This is
what's important.

5386
02:39:36,710 --> 02:39:36,720
what's important.
 

5387
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:44,630
what's important.
this retest here.

5388
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:44,640

 

5389
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:49,429

So 370 380s. Where's this edge? 380s.

5390
02:39:49,429 --> 02:39:49,439
So 370 380s. Where's this edge? 380s.
 

5391
02:39:49,439 --> 02:39:51,510
So 370 380s. Where's this edge? 380s.
So how we react here becomes key.

5392
02:39:51,510 --> 02:39:51,520
So how we react here becomes key.
 

5393
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:54,710
So how we react here becomes key.
Remember the last few times we simply

5394
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:54,720
Remember the last few times we simply
 

5395
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:56,870
Remember the last few times we simply
haven't reacted. We've traded straight

5396
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:56,880
haven't reacted. We've traded straight
 

5397
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:59,510
haven't reacted. We've traded straight
back through it. Which is why I'm not

5398
02:39:59,510 --> 02:39:59,520
back through it. Which is why I'm not
 

5399
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:01,830
back through it. Which is why I'm not
having a huge winning day because my

5400
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:01,840
having a huge winning day because my
 

5401
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:04,550
having a huge winning day because my
runners just won't go for me today. So,

5402
02:40:04,550 --> 02:40:04,560
runners just won't go for me today. So,
 

5403
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:05,670
runners just won't go for me today. So,
we're going to do the same thing.

5404
02:40:05,670 --> 02:40:05,680
we're going to do the same thing.
 

5405
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:06,950
we're going to do the same thing.
They're still trying to bid the same

5406
02:40:06,950 --> 02:40:06,960
They're still trying to bid the same
 

5407
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:08,870
They're still trying to bid the same
level.

5408
02:40:08,870 --> 02:40:08,880
level.
 

5409
02:40:08,880 --> 02:40:11,110
level.
And it's all depends whether they reject

5410
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:11,120
And it's all depends whether they reject
 

5411
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:13,030
And it's all depends whether they reject

action or do we trade straight back
 

5417
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:18,630

through it to the upside. I don't know,
 

5419

What was the zone for you this week? Uh
 

5465
02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:47,910
What was the zone for you this week? Uh
it was the old point of control

5466
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:47,920
it was the old point of control
 

5467
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:50,870
it was the old point of control
uh around 3

5468
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:50,880
uh around 3
 

5469
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:53,750
uh around 3
25 330s

5470
02:41:53,750 --> 02:41:53,760
25 330s
 

5471
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:55,990
25 330s
and looking to see if we find acceptance

5472
02:41:55,990 --> 02:41:56,000
and looking to see if we find acceptance
 

5473
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:59,349
and looking to see if we find acceptance
under underneath 25175. Right. So we

5474
02:41:59,349 --> 02:41:59,359
under underneath 25175. Right. So we
 

5475
02:41:59,359 --> 02:42:00,790
under underneath 25175. Right. So we
we're at the moment we're not finding

5476
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:00,800
we're at the moment we're not finding
 

5477
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:02,309
we're at the moment we're not finding
acceptance underneath which means

5478
02:42:02,309 --> 02:42:02,319
acceptance underneath which means
 

5479
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:05,270
acceptance underneath which means
potentially we're going to back test uh

5480
02:42:05,270 --> 02:42:05,280
potentially we're going to back test uh
 

5481
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:07,190
potentially we're going to back test uh
the edge of sort of balance. So all the

5482
02:42:07,190 --> 02:42:07,200
the edge of sort of balance. So all the
 

5483
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:11,510
the edge of sort of balance. So all the
way up to 25700 but 25500 25700 seeing

5484
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:11,520
way up to 25700 but 25500 25700 seeing
 

5485
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:13,670
way up to 25700 but 25500 25700 seeing
if sellers want to reject there for

5486
02:42:13,670 --> 02:42:13,680
if sellers want to reject there for
 

5487
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:15,990
if sellers want to reject there for
lower prices or not. The problem is

5488
02:42:15,990 --> 02:42:16,000
lower prices or not. The problem is
 

5489
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,670
lower prices or not. The problem is
because of the gap we're going to need

5490
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:17,680
because of the gap we're going to need
 

5491
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:19,910
because of the gap we're going to need
like a day or two of consolidation just

5492
02:42:19,910 --> 02:42:19,920
like a day or two of consolidation just
 

5493
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:22,790
like a day or two of consolidation just
for the Ballinger bands and SMAs to

5494
02:42:22,790 --> 02:42:22,800
for the Ballinger bands and SMAs to
 

5495
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:24,230
for the Ballinger bands and SMAs to
catch up. So are we going to trade

5496
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:24,240
catch up. So are we going to trade
 

5497
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:25,349
catch up. So are we going to trade
straight through this again? Am I going

5498
02:42:25,349 --> 02:42:25,359
straight through this again? Am I going
 

5499
02:42:25,359 --> 02:42:26,550
straight through this again? Am I going
to be happy that I didn't take this

5500
02:42:26,550 --> 02:42:26,560
to be happy that I didn't take this
 

5501
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:28,469
to be happy that I didn't take this
trade? If we trade straight through this

5502
02:42:28,469 --> 02:42:28,479
trade? If we trade straight through this
 

5503
02:42:28,479 --> 02:42:31,510
trade? If we trade straight through this
again, it is an awful This is awful.

5504
02:42:31,510 --> 02:42:31,520
again, it is an awful This is awful.
 

5505
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:34,469
again, it is an awful This is awful.
This is awful. It just doesn't care. It

5506
02:42:34,469 --> 02:42:34,479
This is awful. It just doesn't care. It
 

5507
02:42:34,479 --> 02:42:35,990
This is awful. It just doesn't care. It
doesn't care about the nodes right now

5508
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:36,000
doesn't care about the nodes right now
 

5509
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:42,150
doesn't care about the nodes right now
in Q.

5510
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:42,160

 

5511
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:55,750

I get annoyed fast at things.

5512
02:42:55,750 --> 02:42:55,760

 

5513
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:57,429

put you in my shoes right now, mate.

5514
02:42:57,429 --> 02:42:57,439
put you in my shoes right now, mate.
 

5515
02:42:57,439 --> 02:42:59,510
put you in my shoes right now, mate.
We'll see.

5516
02:42:59,510 --> 02:42:59,520
We'll see.
 

5517
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:02,790
We'll see.
You're lucky I'm even here, honestly.

5518
02:43:02,790 --> 02:43:02,800
You're lucky I'm even here, honestly.
 

5519
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:04,710
You're lucky I'm even here, honestly.
And that's not me being arrogant. If you

5520
02:43:04,710 --> 02:43:04,720
And that's not me being arrogant. If you
 

5521
02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:06,870
And that's not me being arrogant. If you
had going on in your life what I have

5522
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:06,880
had going on in your life what I have
 

5523
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:08,550
had going on in your life what I have
going on in my life, you probably

5524
02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:08,560
going on in my life, you probably
 

5525
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:22,070
going on in my life, you probably
wouldn't be here. So, how about you

5526
02:43:22,070 --> 02:43:22,080

 

5527
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:24,150

It takes a devil to drive out another

5528
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:24,160
It takes a devil to drive out another
 

5529
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:26,309
It takes a devil to drive out another
devil. That's a good one. Quite like

5530
02:43:26,309 --> 02:43:26,319
devil. That's a good one. Quite like
 

5531
02:43:26,319 --> 02:43:36,309
devil. That's a good one. Quite like
that.

5532
02:43:36,309 --> 02:43:36,319

 

5533
02:43:36,319 --> 02:43:38,230

Look at these washes, man. This is

5534
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:38,240
Look at these washes, man. This is
 

5535
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:42,389
Look at these washes, man. This is
crazy.

5536
02:43:42,389 --> 02:43:42,399

 

5537
02:43:42,399 --> 02:43:44,150

Crazy market. Back to point of control

5538
02:43:44,150 --> 02:43:44,160
Crazy market. Back to point of control
 

5539
02:43:44,160 --> 02:43:47,030
Crazy market. Back to point of control
again. Look at this. Wash up, wash down,

5540
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:47,040
again. Look at this. Wash up, wash down,
 

5541
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:50,469
again. Look at this. Wash up, wash down,
wash up, wash down.

5542
02:43:50,469 --> 02:43:50,479
wash up, wash down.
 

5543
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:54,230
wash up, wash down.
Volatility still pretty high.

5544
02:43:54,230 --> 02:43:54,240
Volatility still pretty high.
 

5545
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:56,150
Volatility still pretty high.
Well, that's it, Adam. That that that's

5546
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,160
Well, that's it, Adam. That that that's
 

5547
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:58,230
Well, that's it, Adam. That that that's
that's the problem. We're not respecting

5548
02:43:58,230 --> 02:43:58,240
that's the problem. We're not respecting
 

5549
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:01,510
that's the problem. We're not respecting
enough well enough. My bias is downside,

5550
02:44:01,510 --> 02:44:01,520
enough well enough. My bias is downside,
 

5551
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:02,950
enough well enough. My bias is downside,
but we're just not respecting. So, it

5552
02:44:02,950 --> 02:44:02,960
but we're just not respecting. So, it
 

5553
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:05,510
but we're just not respecting. So, it
makes it very hard to position against

5554
02:44:05,510 --> 02:44:05,520
makes it very hard to position against
 

5555
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:07,030
makes it very hard to position against
stuff when they keep doing these. And

5556
02:44:07,030 --> 02:44:07,040
stuff when they keep doing these. And
 

5557
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:14,389
stuff when they keep doing these. And
now it's going to go. Is it mate?

5558
02:44:14,389 --> 02:44:14,399

 

5559
02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:20,710

It's crazy, isn't it?

5560
02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:20,720

 

5561
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:22,309

Feels heavy to me. I tell you that. It

5562
02:44:22,309 --> 02:44:22,319
Feels heavy to me. I tell you that. It
 

5563
02:44:22,319 --> 02:44:25,030
Feels heavy to me. I tell you that. It
feels like it wants to move lower.

5564
02:44:25,030 --> 02:44:25,040
feels like it wants to move lower.
 

5565
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:26,710
feels like it wants to move lower.
Starting to look like a little bit toppy

5566
02:44:26,710 --> 02:44:26,720
Starting to look like a little bit toppy
 

5567
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:39,110
Starting to look like a little bit toppy
in my mind.

5568
02:44:39,110 --> 02:44:39,120

 

5569
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:43,190

This is still the key level. Same levels

5570
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:43,200
This is still the key level. Same levels
 

5571
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:45,590
This is still the key level. Same levels
node here at 40.

5572
02:44:45,590 --> 02:44:45,600
node here at 40.
 

5573
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:47,110
node here at 40.
I think there's a drift back down into

5574
02:44:47,110 --> 02:44:47,120
I think there's a drift back down into
 

5575
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:49,510
I think there's a drift back down into
these at the very least. And I think

5576
02:44:49,510 --> 02:44:49,520
these at the very least. And I think
 

5577
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:51,990
these at the very least. And I think
really if you see weakness, you might

5578
02:44:51,990 --> 02:44:52,000
really if you see weakness, you might
 

5579
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,910
really if you see weakness, you might
see this come all the way back down. Y

5580
02:44:53,910 --> 02:44:53,920
see this come all the way back down. Y
 

5581
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:58,550
see this come all the way back down. Y
it's very very very possible

5582
02:44:58,550 --> 02:44:58,560

 

5583
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:00,790

if that buyer who's been in all day

5584
02:45:00,790 --> 02:45:00,800
if that buyer who's been in all day
 

5585

if that buyer who's been in all day

it's just trapped participants, right?

5624
02:46:12,150 --> 02:46:12,160
it's just trapped participants, right?
 

5625
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:13,429
it's just trapped participants, right?
So anything that's driving higher,

5626
02:46:13,429 --> 02:46:13,439
So anything that's driving higher,
 

5627
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:14,630
So anything that's driving higher,
you're just waiting for it to come into

5628
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:14,640
you're just waiting for it to come into
 

5629
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:17,510
you're just waiting for it to come into
a level where participants are trapped,

5630
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:17,520
a level where participants are trapped,
 

5631
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:19,030
a level where participants are trapped,
which is what we have here. If we zoom

5632
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:19,040
which is what we have here. If we zoom
 

5633
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,269
which is what we have here. If we zoom
out here, right? What's the level where

5634
02:46:21,269 --> 02:46:21,279
out here, right? What's the level where
 

5635
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:24,309
out here, right? What's the level where
participants are trapped?

5636
02:46:24,309 --> 02:46:24,319
participants are trapped?
 

5637
02:46:24,319 --> 02:46:28,469
participants are trapped?
It's here.

5638
02:46:28,469 --> 02:46:28,479

 

5639
02:46:28,479 --> 02:46:30,710

It's here, right? This right here. If we

5640
02:46:30,710 --> 02:46:30,720
It's here, right? This right here. If we
 

5641
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:33,670
It's here, right? This right here. If we
go QQQ,

5642
02:46:33,670 --> 02:46:33,680
go QQQ,
 

5643
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:35,030
go QQQ,
why do you think we keep rejecting up

5644
02:46:35,030 --> 02:46:35,040
why do you think we keep rejecting up
 

5645
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:36,550
why do you think we keep rejecting up
there? It's a big pivot, right? That's

5646
02:46:36,550 --> 02:46:36,560
there? It's a big pivot, right? That's
 

5647
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:39,910
there? It's a big pivot, right? That's
why I said 15s and above. Big pivot. We

5648
02:46:39,910 --> 02:46:39,920
why I said 15s and above. Big pivot. We
 

5649
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:48,790
why I said 15s and above. Big pivot. We
keep rejecting it.

5650
02:46:48,790 --> 02:46:48,800

 

5651
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:50,389

It's not rocket science. It's just

5652
02:46:50,389 --> 02:46:50,399
It's not rocket science. It's just
 

5653

I mean, I got caught in it. Not for a
for a uh not here here but covered most.

5714

Was it this one or this? I can't

5716
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:00,800
Was it this one or this? I can't
 

5717
02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:03,990
Was it this one or this? I can't
remember. Or both. But runners got taken

5718
02:50:03,990 --> 02:50:04,000
remember. Or both. But runners got taken
 

5719
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,309
remember. Or both. But runners got taken
out both times. Was so well positioned

5720
02:50:06,309 --> 02:50:06,319
out both times. Was so well positioned
 

5721
02:50:06,319 --> 02:50:08,070
out both times. Was so well positioned
for those runners to work. But look, we

5722
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:08,080
for those runners to work. But look, we
 

5723
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:10,550
for those runners to work. But look, we
made like 50 plus points. Just I'm

5724
02:50:10,550 --> 02:50:10,560
made like 50 plus points. Just I'm
 

5725
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:11,830
made like 50 plus points. Just I'm
trying to get all the way down here. I

5726
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:11,840
trying to get all the way down here. I
 

5727
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:13,590
trying to get all the way down here. I
think there's a 200 plus point trade in

5728
02:50:13,590 --> 02:50:13,600
think there's a 200 plus point trade in
 

5729
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:15,670
think there's a 200 plus point trade in
here. Just

5730
02:50:15,670 --> 02:50:15,680
here. Just
 

5731
02:50:15,680 --> 02:50:17,830
here. Just
do they need to come up for this first?

5732
02:50:17,830 --> 02:50:17,840
do they need to come up for this first?
 

5733
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:21,030
do they need to come up for this first?
Do they really want to get into here?

5734
02:50:21,030 --> 02:50:21,040
Do they really want to get into here?
 

5735
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:25,750
Do they really want to get into here?
It's a hell of a move. If they do,

5736
02:50:25,750 --> 02:50:25,760

 

5737
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:29,510

5739
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:32,070
we'll see. We'll see.

I am not convinced I'm loving this right

5800
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:55,120
I am not convinced I'm loving this right

I am not convinced I'm loving this right

now. Um,
 

5803
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:00,790

We are in a cell. Believe it or not,

5811
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:13,269

every popup into this block is getting

5812
02:52:13,269 --> 02:52:13,279
every popup into this block is getting
 

5813
02:52:13,279 --> 02:52:15,830
every popup into this block is getting
sold into. We're just not seeing this

5814
02:52:15,830 --> 02:52:15,840
sold into. We're just not seeing this
 

5815
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:17,269
sold into. We're just not seeing this
follow through, which is what I would

5816
02:52:17,269 --> 02:52:17,279
follow through, which is what I would
 

5817
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:20,150
follow through, which is what I would
really like to see. Uh the reason I want

5818
02:52:20,150 --> 02:52:20,160
really like to see. Uh the reason I want
 

5819
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:22,150
really like to see. Uh the reason I want
to see that follow through is if we look

5820
02:52:22,150 --> 02:52:22,160
to see that follow through is if we look
 

5821
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:23,590
to see that follow through is if we look
at this on the hour, so this is setting

5822
02:52:23,590 --> 02:52:23,600
at this on the hour, so this is setting
 

5823
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:27,670
at this on the hour, so this is setting
you up for later in the day or tomorrow.

5824
02:52:27,670 --> 02:52:27,680
you up for later in the day or tomorrow.
 

5825
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:30,469
you up for later in the day or tomorrow.
If we look at this hourly chart, right,

5826
02:52:30,469 --> 02:52:30,479
If we look at this hourly chart, right,
 

5827
02:52:30,479 --> 02:52:34,150
If we look at this hourly chart, right,
we cannot find acceptance so far

5828
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:34,160
we cannot find acceptance so far
 

5829
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:36,630
we cannot find acceptance so far
underneath here and we're trading to an

5830
02:52:36,630 --> 02:52:36,640
underneath here and we're trading to an
 

5831
02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:40,790
underneath here and we're trading to an
extreme of this. Okay, I want to sell

5832
02:52:40,790 --> 02:52:40,800
extreme of this. Okay, I want to sell
 

5833
02:52:40,800 --> 02:52:43,830
extreme of this. Okay, I want to sell
this back down to here, right? Cuz we

5834
02:52:43,830 --> 02:52:43,840
this back down to here, right? Cuz we
 

5835
02:52:43,840 --> 02:52:45,269
this back down to here, right? Cuz we
haven't retested this in a New York

5836
02:52:45,269 --> 02:52:45,279
haven't retested this in a New York
 

5837
02:52:45,279 --> 02:52:47,110
haven't retested this in a New York
session. So, I would like to sell

5838
02:52:47,110 --> 02:52:47,120
session. So, I would like to sell
 

5839
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:49,349
session. So, I would like to sell
somewhere up here back down for this

5840
02:52:49,349 --> 02:52:49,359
somewhere up here back down for this
 

5841
02:52:49,359 --> 02:52:51,990
somewhere up here back down for this
retest. If we stay heavy under here,

5842
02:52:51,990 --> 02:52:52,000
retest. If we stay heavy under here,
 

5843
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,670
retest. If we stay heavy under here,
then I think the market gets very very

5844
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:53,680
then I think the market gets very very
 

5845
02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:55,590
then I think the market gets very very
weak. The reason being is if we start

5846
02:52:55,590 --> 02:52:55,600
weak. The reason being is if we start
 

5847
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:58,389
weak. The reason being is if we start
zooming out, right, we're going to leave

5848
02:52:58,389 --> 02:52:58,399
zooming out, right, we're going to leave
 

5849
02:52:58,399 --> 02:53:01,030
zooming out, right, we're going to leave
all of these players trapped

5850
02:53:01,030 --> 02:53:01,040
all of these players trapped
 

5851
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:03,269
all of these players trapped
and likely use these stops, which means

5852
02:53:03,269 --> 02:53:03,279
and likely use these stops, which means
 

5853
02:53:03,279 --> 02:53:05,349
and likely use these stops, which means
everyone here is now out of the money.

5854
02:53:05,349 --> 02:53:05,359
everyone here is now out of the money.
 

5855
02:53:05,359 --> 02:53:07,030
everyone here is now out of the money.
And it's at this point that you've

5856
02:53:07,030 --> 02:53:07,040
And it's at this point that you've
 

5857
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:08,630
And it's at this point that you've
really got to think it's night night

5858
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:08,640
really got to think it's night night
 

5859
02:53:08,640 --> 02:53:10,389
really got to think it's night night
because this is all on the new contract.

5860
02:53:10,389 --> 02:53:10,399
because this is all on the new contract.
 

5861
02:53:10,399 --> 02:53:13,030
because this is all on the new contract.
We'll be under the new contract lows and

5862
02:53:13,030 --> 02:53:13,040
We'll be under the new contract lows and
 

5863
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:15,110
We'll be under the new contract lows and
it means, you know, we can start really

5864
02:53:15,110 --> 02:53:15,120
it means, you know, we can start really
 

5865
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:18,469
it means, you know, we can start really
getting aggressive under 24.88 and start

5866
02:53:18,469 --> 02:53:18,479
getting aggressive under 24.88 and start
 

5867
02:53:18,479 --> 02:53:21,110
getting aggressive under 24.88 and start
diving back down for a retest into the

5868
02:53:21,110 --> 02:53:21,120
diving back down for a retest into the
 

5869
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:23,349
diving back down for a retest into the
24500s and below. All right. So, that's

5870
02:53:23,349 --> 02:53:23,359
24500s and below. All right. So, that's
 

5871
02:53:23,359 --> 02:53:25,349
24500s and below. All right. So, that's
that's what I'm looking for with this

5872
02:53:25,349 --> 02:53:25,359
that's what I'm looking for with this
 

5873
02:53:25,359 --> 02:53:27,269
that's what I'm looking for with this
market. Um, if we reclaim this old

5874
02:53:27,269 --> 02:53:27,279
market. Um, if we reclaim this old
 

5875
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:29,190
market. Um, if we reclaim this old
balance, if for whatever reason it wants

5876
02:53:29,190 --> 02:53:29,200
balance, if for whatever reason it wants
 

5877
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:30,710
balance, if for whatever reason it wants
to reclaim this old balance, then I'll

5878
02:53:30,710 --> 02:53:30,720
to reclaim this old balance, then I'll
 

5879
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:33,750
to reclaim this old balance, then I'll
respect it. But this is a area where

5880
02:53:33,750 --> 02:53:33,760
respect it. But this is a area where
 

5881
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:36,389
respect it. But this is a area where
we've now left balance. All right? I

5882
02:53:36,389 --> 02:53:36,399
we've now left balance. All right? I
 

5883
02:53:36,399 --> 02:53:38,469
we've now left balance. All right? I
cannot stress that to you enough why

5884
02:53:38,469 --> 02:53:38,479
cannot stress that to you enough why
 

5885
02:53:38,479 --> 02:53:42,790
cannot stress that to you enough why
this is important. 1 2 3 4 5 weeks of

5886
02:53:42,790 --> 02:53:42,800
this is important. 1 2 3 4 5 weeks of
 

5887
02:53:42,800 --> 02:53:44,550
this is important. 1 2 3 4 5 weeks of
balance

5888
02:53:44,550 --> 02:53:44,560
balance
 

5889
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:47,990
balance
in here. Think about all the buyers in

5890
02:53:47,990 --> 02:53:48,000
in here. Think about all the buyers in
 

5891
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,150
in here. Think about all the buyers in
here who are stuck. We're under their

5892
02:53:50,150 --> 02:53:50,160
here who are stuck. We're under their
 

5893
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:51,830
here who are stuck. We're under their
pain point. We want to try and sell

5894
02:53:51,830 --> 02:53:51,840
pain point. We want to try and sell
 

5895
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:53,830
pain point. We want to try and sell
their point pain point for downside

5896
02:53:53,830 --> 02:53:53,840
their point pain point for downside
 

5897
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:56,469
their point pain point for downside
pressure, right? But we have to respect

5898
02:53:56,469 --> 02:53:56,479
pressure, right? But we have to respect
 

5899
02:53:56,479 --> 02:53:58,550
pressure, right? But we have to respect
this one here.

5900
02:53:58,550 --> 02:53:58,560
this one here.
 

5901
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:00,150
this one here.
So, we're selling pain down to here. If

5902
02:54:00,150 --> 02:54:00,160
So, we're selling pain down to here. If
 

5903
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:01,990
So, we're selling pain down to here. If
we get acceptance under it, we're going

5904
02:54:01,990 --> 02:54:02,000
we get acceptance under it, we're going
 

5905
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,469
we get acceptance under it, we're going
to look for new value probably down into

5906
02:54:04,469 --> 02:54:04,479
to look for new value probably down into
 

5907
02:54:04,479 --> 02:54:06,790
to look for new value probably down into
here somewhere and below. That's why I'm

5908
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:06,800
here somewhere and below. That's why I'm
 

5909
02:54:06,800 --> 02:54:09,349
here somewhere and below. That's why I'm
focused short side right now. If we

5910
02:54:09,349 --> 02:54:09,359
focused short side right now. If we
 

5911
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:11,830
focused short side right now. If we
reclaim this, fair enough. But if we

5912
02:54:11,830 --> 02:54:11,840
reclaim this, fair enough. But if we
 

5913
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:13,510
reclaim this, fair enough. But if we
come up here and fail, I'll still be

5914
02:54:13,510 --> 02:54:13,520
come up here and fail, I'll still be
 

5915
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:14,950
come up here and fail, I'll still be
looking to sell it. I'm not going to get

5916
02:54:14,950 --> 02:54:14,960
looking to sell it. I'm not going to get
 

5917
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:17,429
looking to sell it. I'm not going to get
long unless we reclaim all of this and

5918
02:54:17,429 --> 02:54:17,439
long unless we reclaim all of this and
 

5919
02:54:17,439 --> 02:54:19,990
long unless we reclaim all of this and
start to base for a rotation. Okay.

5920
02:54:19,990 --> 02:54:20,000
start to base for a rotation. Okay.
 

5921
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,230
start to base for a rotation. Okay.
Okay, so there's my sort of bias for the

5922
02:54:22,230 --> 02:54:22,240
Okay, so there's my sort of bias for the
 

5923
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:24,469
Okay, so there's my sort of bias for the
week. Hopefully that kind of helps you

5924
02:54:24,469 --> 02:54:24,479
week. Hopefully that kind of helps you
 

5925
02:54:24,479 --> 02:54:26,070
week. Hopefully that kind of helps you
make sense of why I'm trying to fade

5926
02:54:26,070 --> 02:54:26,080
make sense of why I'm trying to fade
 

5927
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:27,510
make sense of why I'm trying to fade
pops right now. Why I'm looking for

5928
02:54:27,510 --> 02:54:27,520
pops right now. Why I'm looking for
 

5929
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:29,349
pops right now. Why I'm looking for
buyers to get stuck at highs is because

5930
02:54:29,349 --> 02:54:29,359
buyers to get stuck at highs is because
 

5931
02:54:29,359 --> 02:54:31,349
buyers to get stuck at highs is because
I know the higher time frame has a lot

5932
02:54:31,349 --> 02:54:31,359

02:58:51,510 --> 02:58:51,520

 

6101
02:58:51,520 --> 02:58:53,590

How much adverse range do you allow per

6102
02:58:53,590 --> 02:58:53,600
How much adverse range do you allow per
 

6103
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:55,190
How much adverse range do you allow per
trade? How do you size your position

6104
02:58:55,190 --> 02:58:55,200
trade? How do you size your position
 

6105
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:57,510
trade? How do you size your position
around it? Uh I size based on the swing

6106
02:58:57,510 --> 02:58:57,520
around it? Uh I size based on the swing
 

6107
02:58:57,520 --> 02:58:59,510
around it? Uh I size based on the swing
points, right? Based on ATR and swing

6108
02:58:59,510 --> 02:58:59,520
points, right? Based on ATR and swing
 

6109
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:01,910
points, right? Based on ATR and swing
points. So this is also one of the

6110
02:59:01,910 --> 02:59:01,920
points. So this is also one of the
 

6111
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:05,349
points. So this is also one of the
problems today. So the ATR gets tight,

6112
02:59:05,349 --> 02:59:05,359
problems today. So the ATR gets tight,
 

6113
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:06,469
problems today. So the ATR gets tight,
tight, tight, tight, tight, and then

6114
02:59:06,469 --> 02:59:06,479
tight, tight, tight, tight, and then
 

6115
02:59:06,479 --> 02:59:08,230
tight, tight, tight, tight, and then
we're having these huge candle rippers.

6116
02:59:08,230 --> 02:59:08,240
we're having these huge candle rippers.
 

6117
02:59:08,240 --> 02:59:10,469
we're having these huge candle rippers.
Um ATR was pretty volatile this morning.

6118
02:59:10,469 --> 02:59:10,479
Um ATR was pretty volatile this morning.
 

6119
02:59:10,479 --> 02:59:13,910
Um ATR was pretty volatile this morning.
But I size based on swings. So if I'm

6120
02:59:13,910 --> 02:59:13,920
But I size based on swings. So if I'm
 

6121
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:15,910
But I size based on swings. So if I'm
where was I a breakdown? If I'm short

6122
02:59:15,910 --> 02:59:15,920
where was I a breakdown? If I'm short
 

6123
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:18,870
where was I a breakdown? If I'm short
here for this breakdown, I'm risking up

6124
02:59:18,870 --> 02:59:18,880
here for this breakdown, I'm risking up
 

6125
02:59:18,880 --> 02:59:21,590
here for this breakdown, I'm risking up
here. I have to risk the other side of

6126
02:59:21,590 --> 02:59:21,600
here. I have to risk the other side of
 

6127
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:25,190
here. I have to risk the other side of
this

6128
02:59:25,190 --> 02:59:25,200

 

6129
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:29,110

And then depending on my account size,

6130
02:59:29,110 --> 02:59:29,120
And then depending on my account size,
 

6131
02:59:29,120 --> 02:59:31,110
And then depending on my account size,
right? If I'm short here, I have to be

6132
02:59:31,110 --> 02:59:31,120
right? If I'm short here, I have to be
 

6133
02:59:31,120 --> 02:59:32,630
right? If I'm short here, I have to be
willing to risk the other side of that

6134
02:59:32,630 --> 02:59:32,640
willing to risk the other side of that
 

6135
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:35,750
willing to risk the other side of that
node. TP1 is into VWAP. And then TP2 was

6136
02:59:35,750 --> 02:59:35,760
node. TP1 is into VWAP. And then TP2 was
 

6137
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:37,670
node. TP1 is into VWAP. And then TP2 was
down into here, which what I was hoping

6138
02:59:37,670 --> 02:59:37,680
down into here, which what I was hoping
 

6139
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:41,030
down into here, which what I was hoping
to get a 7 and a half trade, 7.5 trade.

6140
02:59:41,030 --> 02:59:41,040
to get a 7 and a half trade, 7.5 trade.
 

6141
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:42,389
to get a 7 and a half trade, 7.5 trade.
Didn't get it. We didn't get it. It's

6142
02:59:42,389 --> 02:59:42,399
Didn't get it. We didn't get it. It's
 

6143
02:59:42,399 --> 02:59:44,070
Didn't get it. We didn't get it. It's
okay. 150 point trade that would have

6144
02:59:44,070 --> 02:59:44,080
okay. 150 point trade that would have
 

6145
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:46,550
okay. 150 point trade that would have
been. So it's all my sizing is always

6146
02:59:46,550 --> 02:59:46,560
been. So it's all my sizing is always
 

6147
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:48,230
been. So it's all my sizing is always
based on where my stop is. My stop's

6148
02:59:48,230 --> 02:59:48,240
based on where my stop is. My stop's
 

6149
02:59:48,240 --> 02:59:50,309
based on where my stop is. My stop's
based on the technicals, right? Stop has

6150
02:59:50,309 --> 02:59:50,319
based on the technicals, right? Stop has
 

6151
02:59:50,319 --> 02:59:51,750
based on the technicals, right? Stop has
to be based on technicals. You can't

6152
02:59:51,750 --> 02:59:51,760
to be based on technicals. You can't
 

6153
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:53,269
to be based on technicals. You can't
just do a 20 point stop cuz you feel

6154
02:59:53,269 --> 02:59:53,279
just do a 20 point stop cuz you feel
 

6155
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:56,150
just do a 20 point stop cuz you feel
like it. If the ATR per 1 minute candle

6156
02:59:56,150 --> 02:59:56,160
like it. If the ATR per 1 minute candle
 

6157
02:59:56,160 --> 02:59:58,469
like it. If the ATR per 1 minute candle
is 20 or 30 or 40 points, then your 20

6158
02:59:58,469 --> 02:59:58,479
is 20 or 30 or 40 points, then your 20
 

6159
02:59:58,479 --> 03:00:02,389
is 20 or 30 or 40 points, then your 20
point stop doesn't mean anything.

6160
03:00:02,389 --> 03:00:02,399
point stop doesn't mean anything.
 

6161
03:00:02,399 --> 03:00:04,389
point stop doesn't mean anything.

This is the game that I think's been
played at the moment. Let's say

6396
03:05:31,750 --> 03:05:31,760

 

6397
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:33,429

some funds have been caught a little bit

6398
03:05:33,429 --> 03:05:33,439
some funds have been caught a little bit
 

6399
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:37,269
some funds have been caught a little bit
offside here. Right. Let's say that what

6400
03:05:37,269 --> 03:05:37,279
offside here. Right. Let's say that what
 

6401
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:38,870
offside here. Right. Let's say that what
what do they need to do? They need to

6402
03:05:38,870 --> 03:05:38,880
what do they need to do? They need to
 

6403
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:41,830
what do they need to do? They need to
get price back into here, right? So that

6404
03:05:41,830 --> 03:05:41,840
get price back into here, right? So that
 

6405
03:05:41,840 --> 03:05:43,429
get price back into here, right? So that
they can get out flat. So how do they do

6406
03:05:43,429 --> 03:05:43,439
they can get out flat. So how do they do
 

6407
03:05:43,439 --> 03:05:45,990
they can get out flat. So how do they do
that? They bid the tape up relentlessly

6408
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:46,000
that? They bid the tape up relentlessly
 

6409
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,070
that? They bid the tape up relentlessly
and then they unload their position and

6410
03:05:48,070 --> 03:05:48,080
and then they unload their position and
 

6411
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:49,590
and then they unload their position and
then next time it comes down here when

6412
03:05:49,590 --> 03:05:49,600
then next time it comes down here when
 

6413
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:51,590
then next time it comes down here when
people expect there to be support, they

6414
03:05:51,590 --> 03:05:51,600
people expect there to be support, they
 

6415
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:53,190
people expect there to be support, they
won't be because the guys that were

6416
03:05:53,190 --> 03:05:53,200
won't be because the guys that were
 

6417
03:05:53,200 --> 03:05:54,790
won't be because the guys that were
propping it were just looking for an

6418
03:05:54,790 --> 03:05:54,800
propping it were just looking for an
 

6419
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:58,469
propping it were just looking for an
exit. That's how I feel about this

6420
03:05:58,469 --> 03:05:58,479
exit. That's how I feel about this
 

6421
03:05:58,479 --> 03:05:59,990
exit. That's how I feel about this
market right now. I think people are

6422
03:05:59,990 --> 03:06:00,000
market right now. I think people are
 

6423
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:01,510
market right now. I think people are
just looking for an exit. I think this

6424
03:06:01,510 --> 03:06:01,520
just looking for an exit. I think this
 

6425
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:03,510
just looking for an exit. I think this
will be sold. I think this gap will

6426
03:06:03,510 --> 03:06:03,520
will be sold. I think this gap will
 

6427
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:05,590
will be sold. I think this gap will
probably remain open unless something

6428
03:06:05,590 --> 03:06:05,600
probably remain open unless something
 

6429
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:08,630
probably remain open unless something
drastically changes. I can't really see

6430
03:06:08,630 --> 03:06:08,640
drastically changes. I can't really see
 

6431
03:06:08,640 --> 03:06:10,469
drastically changes. I can't really see
us doing this. And if we do, that will

6432
03:06:10,469 --> 03:06:10,479
us doing this. And if we do, that will
 

6433
03:06:10,479 --> 03:06:14,309
us doing this. And if we do, that will
be sold. This will just still be

6434
03:06:14,309 --> 03:06:14,319
be sold. This will just still be
 

6435
03:06:14,319 --> 03:06:17,590
be sold. This will just still be
protrend, right? Because we've left

6436
03:06:17,590 --> 03:06:17,600
protrend, right? Because we've left
 

6437
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:30,150
protrend, right? Because we've left
the value.

6438
03:06:30,150 --> 03:06:30,160

 

6439
03:06:30,160 --> 03:06:31,830

or is the win rate of your indicator

6440
03:06:31,830 --> 03:06:31,840
or is the win rate of your indicator
 

6441
03:06:31,840 --> 03:06:34,550
or is the win rate of your indicator
setup? I wouldn't know actually. Uh you

6442
03:06:34,550 --> 03:06:34,560
setup? I wouldn't know actually. Uh you
 

6443
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:36,469
setup? I wouldn't know actually. Uh you
have to ask someone who just trades the

6444
03:06:36,469 --> 03:06:36,479
have to ask someone who just trades the
 

6445
03:06:36,479 --> 03:06:38,230
have to ask someone who just trades the
indicator alone. I I wouldn't be able to

6446
03:06:38,230 --> 03:06:38,240
indicator alone. I I wouldn't be able to
 

6447
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:39,830
indicator alone. I I wouldn't be able to
tell you because I don't use it just by

6448
03:06:39,830 --> 03:06:39,840
tell you because I don't use it just by
 

6449
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:41,910
tell you because I don't use it just by
itself. Not being a dick, I just

6450
03:06:41,910 --> 03:06:41,920
itself. Not being a dick, I just
 

6451
03:06:41,920 --> 03:06:43,510
itself. Not being a dick, I just
wouldn't be able to tell you. Probably

6452
03:06:43,510 --> 03:06:43,520
wouldn't be able to tell you. Probably
 

6453
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:45,590
wouldn't be able to tell you. Probably
pretty decent other than in choppy days

6454
03:06:45,590 --> 03:06:45,600
pretty decent other than in choppy days
 

6455
03:06:45,600 --> 03:06:49,750
pretty decent other than in choppy days
it will struggle.

6456
03:06:49,750 --> 03:06:49,760

 

6457
03:06:49,760 --> 03:06:52,070

When you go flat, you don't want to you

6458
03:06:52,070 --> 03:06:52,080
When you go flat, you don't want to you
 

6459
03:06:52,080 --> 03:06:55,990
When you go flat, you don't want to you
don't want to use it.

6460
03:06:55,990 --> 03:06:56,000

 

6461
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,389

Can't find AP. Uh it's not an indicator.

6462
03:06:58,389 --> 03:06:58,399
Can't find AP. Uh it's not an indicator.
 

6463
03:06:58,399 --> 03:07:02,950
Can't find AP. Uh it's not an indicator.
down here in this one

6464
03:07:02,950 --> 03:07:02,960
down here in this one
 

6465
03:07:02,960 --> 03:07:06,550
down here in this one
volume based right. So in projections

6466
03:07:06,550 --> 03:07:06,560
volume based right. So in projections
 

6467
03:07:06,560 --> 03:07:13,990
volume based right. So in projections
uh anchored volume profile.

6468
03:07:13,990 --> 03:07:14,000

 

6469
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,070

Stoic traders helped me a lot this year.

6470
03:07:16,070 --> 03:07:16,080
Stoic traders helped me a lot this year.
 

6471
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:19,269
Stoic traders helped me a lot this year.
Yeah, Stoic's good. Sometimes I think

6472
03:07:19,269 --> 03:07:19,279
Yeah, Stoic's good. Sometimes I think
 

6473
03:07:19,279 --> 03:07:21,269
Yeah, Stoic's good. Sometimes I think
some of his reads are are off, but I

6474
03:07:21,269 --> 03:07:21,279
some of his reads are are off, but I
 

6475
03:07:21,279 --> 03:07:24,469
some of his reads are are off, but I
think he is good. He trades

6476
03:07:24,469 --> 03:07:24,479
think he is good. He trades
 

6477
03:07:24,479 --> 03:07:27,349
think he is good. He trades
What's his model? His model was

6478
03:07:27,349 --> 03:07:27,359
What's his model? His model was
 

6479
03:07:27,359 --> 03:07:31,269
What's his model? His model was
something like

6480
03:07:31,269 --> 03:07:31,279

 

6481
03:07:31,279 --> 03:07:34,710

I don't know how we do it.

6482
03:07:34,710 --> 03:07:34,720
I don't know how we do it.
 

6483
03:07:34,720 --> 03:07:36,950
I don't know how we do it.
Something like that, isn't it? It's

6484
03:07:36,950 --> 03:07:36,960
Something like that, isn't it? It's
 

6485
03:07:36,960 --> 03:07:42,230
Something like that, isn't it? It's
basically a two-leg to be rebid

6486
03:07:42,230 --> 03:07:42,240

 

6487
03:07:42,240 --> 03:07:46,389

or it might be like

6488
03:07:46,389 --> 03:07:46,399

 

6489
03:07:46,399 --> 03:07:50,790

something like that.

6490
03:07:50,790 --> 03:07:50,800

 

6491
03:07:50,800 --> 03:07:53,830

What does he use? Uh like a 21 and 200.

6492
03:07:53,830 --> 03:07:53,840
What does he use? Uh like a 21 and 200.
 

6493
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:55,750
What does he use? Uh like a 21 and 200.
So like this

6494
03:07:55,750 --> 03:07:55,760
So like this
 

6495
03:07:55,760 --> 03:07:57,750
So like this
and this. I guess he'd be long from

6496
03:07:57,750 --> 03:07:57,760
and this. I guess he'd be long from
 

6497
03:07:57,760 --> 03:08:01,750
and this. I guess he'd be long from
there. So maybe he was maybe this would

6498
03:08:01,750 --> 03:08:01,760
there. So maybe he was maybe this would
 

6499
03:08:01,760 --> 03:08:05,750
there. So maybe he was maybe this would
be his model. Uh

6500
03:08:05,750 --> 03:08:05,760
be his model. Uh
 

6501
03:08:05,760 --> 03:08:07,030
be his model. Uh
is it in the New York session? This

6502
03:08:07,030 --> 03:08:07,040
is it in the New York session? This
 

6503
03:08:07,040 --> 03:08:11,190
is it in the New York session? This
might be his model.

6504
03:08:11,190 --> 03:08:11,200

 

6505
03:08:11,200 --> 03:08:14,070

One, two, two leg down. Sweep. Go.

6506
03:08:14,070 --> 03:08:14,080
One, two, two leg down. Sweep. Go.
 

6507
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:15,269
One, two, two leg down. Sweep. Go.
That's probably his model. Something

6508
03:08:15,269 --> 03:08:15,279
That's probably his model. Something
 

6509
03:08:15,279 --> 03:08:23,429
That's probably his model. Something
like that.

6510
03:08:23,429 --> 03:08:23,439

 

6511
03:08:23,439 --> 03:08:25,110

previous day high and low. You've told

6512
03:08:25,110 --> 03:08:25,120
previous day high and low. You've told
 

6513
03:08:25,120 --> 03:08:26,550
previous day high and low. You've told
me to plot daily. Do I also plot

6514
03:08:26,550 --> 03:08:26,560
me to plot daily. Do I also plot
 

6515
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:29,269
me to plot daily. Do I also plot
previous day point control? I do. Yeah,

6516
03:08:29,269 --> 03:08:29,279
previous day point control? I do. Yeah,
 

6517
03:08:29,279 --> 03:08:36,469
previous day point control? I do. Yeah,
it's right here. It's just hard to see.

6518
03:08:36,469 --> 03:08:36,479

 

6519
03:08:36,479 --> 03:08:37,990

All right, last few questions, guys, and

6520
03:08:37,990 --> 03:08:38,000
All right, last few questions, guys, and
 

6521
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:42,710
All right, last few questions, guys, and
I'm going to get out of here after that.

6522
03:08:42,710 --> 03:08:42,720

 

6523
03:08:42,720 --> 03:08:58,950

No worries, John.

6524
03:08:58,950 --> 03:08:58,960

 

6525
03:08:58,960 --> 03:09:01,030

uh Rocket. Um if you're using Bookmap,

6526
03:09:01,030 --> 03:09:01,040
uh Rocket. Um if you're using Bookmap,
 

6527
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:03,830
uh Rocket. Um if you're using Bookmap,
you will need a data feed. Um some

6528
03:09:03,830 --> 03:09:03,840
you will need a data feed. Um some
 

6529
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:06,870
you will need a data feed. Um some
people on here might use it with data

6530
03:09:06,870 --> 03:09:06,880
people on here might use it with data
 

6531
03:09:06,880 --> 03:09:08,710
people on here might use it with data
from one of the prop firms if you're

6532
03:09:08,710 --> 03:09:08,720
from one of the prop firms if you're
 

6533
03:09:08,720 --> 03:09:10,550
from one of the prop firms if you're
using a prop firm. Otherwise, you'll

6534
03:09:10,550 --> 03:09:10,560
using a prop firm. Otherwise, you'll
 

6535
03:09:10,560 --> 03:09:16,950
using a prop firm. Otherwise, you'll
need to pay for it. I pay for it.

6536
03:09:16,950 --> 03:09:16,960

 

6537
03:09:16,960 --> 03:09:19,349

What's my name? Alex.

6538
03:09:19,349 --> 03:09:19,359
What's my name? Alex.
 

6539
03:09:19,359 --> 03:09:22,469
What's my name? Alex.
What about initial balance?

6540
03:09:22,469 --> 03:09:22,479
What about initial balance?
 

6541
03:09:22,479 --> 03:09:38,870
What about initial balance?
Yeah, it's these purple lines. OB.

6542
03:09:38,870 --> 03:09:38,880

 

6543
03:09:38,880 --> 03:09:44,389

What are the ribbons? Uh 13 21

6544
03:09:44,389 --> 03:09:44,399
What are the ribbons? Uh 13 21
 

6545
03:09:44,399 --> 03:09:47,349
What are the ribbons? Uh 13 21
34

6546
03:09:47,349 --> 03:09:47,359
34
 

6547
03:09:47,359 --> 03:09:49,349
34
7289.

6548
03:09:49,349 --> 03:09:49,359
7289.
 

6549
03:09:49,359 --> 03:09:55,030
7289.
Is that right? Or is it 21 21 34 45

6550
03:09:55,030 --> 03:09:55,040
Is that right? Or is it 21 21 34 45
 

6551
03:09:55,040 --> 03:09:57,750
Is that right? Or is it 21 21 34 45
7289? God, my brain's not working. Those

6552
03:09:57,750 --> 03:09:57,760
7289? God, my brain's not working. Those
 

6553
03:09:57,760 --> 03:10:00,389
7289? God, my brain's not working. Those
are the main ribbons. Rolling Fibonacci.

6554
03:10:00,389 --> 03:10:00,399
are the main ribbons. Rolling Fibonacci.
 

6555
03:10:00,399 --> 03:10:04,870
are the main ribbons. Rolling Fibonacci.
That's why.

6556
03:10:04,870 --> 03:10:04,880

 

6557
03:10:04,880 --> 03:10:06,070

But I mean, if you want to make it

6558
03:10:06,070 --> 03:10:06,080
But I mean, if you want to make it
 

6559
03:10:06,080 --> 03:10:14,469
But I mean, if you want to make it
easier, just just use this indicator.

6560
03:10:14,469 --> 03:10:14,479

 

6561
03:10:14,479 --> 03:10:16,070

This is probably it. The model here is

6562
03:10:16,070 --> 03:10:16,080
This is probably it. The model here is
 

6563
03:10:16,080 --> 03:10:21,910
This is probably it. The model here is
it um JD

6564
03:10:21,910 --> 03:10:21,920

 

6565
03:10:21,920 --> 03:10:26,710

21 200 two leg breaker structure upside.

6566
03:10:26,710 --> 03:10:26,720
21 200 two leg breaker structure upside.
 

6567
03:10:26,720 --> 03:10:28,950
21 200 two leg breaker structure upside.
That's probably the model. I'm assuming

6568
03:10:28,950 --> 03:10:28,960
That's probably the model. I'm assuming
 

6569
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:37,030
That's probably the model. I'm assuming
it's something like that. Anyway,

6570
03:10:37,030 --> 03:10:37,040

 

6571
03:10:37,040 --> 03:10:41,590

what a absolute mess.

6572
03:10:41,590 --> 03:10:41,600

 

6573
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:43,830

I think it will go down as soon as I

6574
03:10:43,830 --> 03:10:43,840
I think it will go down as soon as I
 

6575
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:45,349
I think it will go down as soon as I
leave the desk. I think is exactly what

6576
03:10:45,349 --> 03:10:45,359
leave the desk. I think is exactly what
 

6577
03:10:45,359 --> 03:10:48,630
leave the desk. I think is exactly what
it's going to do. It's literally exactly

6578
03:10:48,630 --> 03:10:48,640
it's going to do. It's literally exactly
 

6579
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:51,670
it's going to do. It's literally exactly
what it's going to do cuz the market

6580
03:10:51,670 --> 03:10:51,680
what it's going to do cuz the market
 

6581
03:10:51,680 --> 03:10:59,990
what it's going to do cuz the market
is annoying.

6582
03:10:59,990 --> 03:11:00,000

 

6583
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:03,910

Oh, it said book. Okay. Ryan Holiday.

6584
03:11:03,910 --> 03:11:03,920
Oh, it said book. Okay. Ryan Holiday.
 

6585
03:11:03,920 --> 03:11:05,030
Oh, it said book. Okay. Ryan Holiday.
I'm going to look that up. Thank you,

6586
03:11:05,030 --> 03:11:05,040
I'm going to look that up. Thank you,
 

6587
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:06,630
I'm going to look that up. Thank you,
mate. I didn't know you were referring

6588
03:11:06,630 --> 03:11:06,640
mate. I didn't know you were referring
 

6589
03:11:06,640 --> 03:11:08,150
mate. I didn't know you were referring
to a book. I thought you referring to

6590
03:11:08,150 --> 03:11:08,160
to a book. I thought you referring to
 

6591
03:11:08,160 --> 03:11:13,590
to a book. I thought you referring to
the trader.

6592
03:11:13,590 --> 03:11:13,600

 

6593
03:11:13,600 --> 03:11:14,870

All right, folks. I'm going to get out

6594
03:11:14,870 --> 03:11:14,880
All right, folks. I'm going to get out
 

6595
03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:17,030
All right, folks. I'm going to get out
of here. Um,

6596
03:11:17,030 --> 03:11:17,040
of here. Um,
 

6597
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:18,790
of here. Um,
I would set price alerts, guys. Set

6598
03:11:18,790 --> 03:11:18,800
I would set price alerts, guys. Set
 

6599
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:20,550
I would set price alerts, guys. Set
price alerts for the key levels,

6600
03:11:20,550 --> 03:11:20,560
price alerts for the key levels,
 

6601
03:11:20,560 --> 03:11:22,630
price alerts for the key levels,
especially for this level on VIX. All

6602
03:11:22,630 --> 03:11:22,640
especially for this level on VIX. All
 

6603
03:11:22,640 --> 03:11:25,670
especially for this level on VIX. All
right. If you want to help your bias,

6604
03:11:25,670 --> 03:11:25,680
right. If you want to help your bias,
 

6605
03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:27,990
right. If you want to help your bias,
this level on VIX where we keep

6606
03:11:27,990 --> 03:11:28,000
this level on VIX where we keep
 

6607
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:31,349
this level on VIX where we keep
rejecting is key. All right, this is

6608
03:11:31,349 --> 03:11:31,359
rejecting is key. All right, this is
 

6609
03:11:31,359 --> 03:11:32,550
rejecting is key. All right, this is
what I was talking about earlier. Look

6610
03:11:32,550 --> 03:11:32,560
what I was talking about earlier. Look
 

6611
03:11:32,560 --> 03:11:37,030
what I was talking about earlier. Look
at the same kind of setup.

6612
03:11:37,030 --> 03:11:37,040

 

6613
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:40,630

If VIX gets through this level

6614
03:11:40,630 --> 03:11:40,640
If VIX gets through this level
 

6615
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:43,429
If VIX gets through this level
and VIX starts to squeeze, right, you're

6616
03:11:43,429 --> 03:11:43,439
and VIX starts to squeeze, right, you're
 

6617
03:11:43,439 --> 03:11:45,510
and VIX starts to squeeze, right, you're
going to see downside pressure in the ES

6618
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:45,520
going to see downside pressure in the ES
 

6619
03:11:45,520 --> 03:11:47,510
going to see downside pressure in the ES
and hopefully that broader market

6620
03:11:47,510 --> 03:11:47,520
and hopefully that broader market
 

6621
03:11:47,520 --> 03:11:49,269
and hopefully that broader market
pressure will come into ENQ. All right,

6622
03:11:49,269 --> 03:11:49,279
pressure will come into ENQ. All right,
 

6623
03:11:49,279 --> 03:11:51,030
pressure will come into ENQ. All right,
we're finding a bid on this level. This

6624
03:11:51,030 --> 03:11:51,040
we're finding a bid on this level. This
 

6625
03:11:51,040 --> 03:11:52,710
we're finding a bid on this level. This
is an old resistance level which

6626
03:11:52,710 --> 03:11:52,720
is an old resistance level which
 

6627
03:11:52,720 --> 03:11:55,110
is an old resistance level which
surprise surprise is now support. Okay.

6628
03:11:55,110 --> 03:11:55,120
surprise surprise is now support. Okay.
 

6629
03:11:55,120 --> 03:11:57,190
surprise surprise is now support. Okay.
So I'd be watching VIX to see if it can

6630
03:11:57,190 --> 03:11:57,200
So I'd be watching VIX to see if it can
 

6631
03:11:57,200 --> 03:11:59,269
So I'd be watching VIX to see if it can
break through 1925. That's when you're

6632
03:11:59,269 --> 03:11:59,279
break through 1925. That's when you're
 

6633
03:11:59,279 --> 03:12:01,269
break through 1925. That's when you're
going to see much much more follow

6634
03:12:01,269 --> 03:12:01,279
going to see much much more follow
 

6635
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:14,070
going to see much much more follow
through. Much much more follow through.

6636
03:12:14,070 --> 03:12:14,080
