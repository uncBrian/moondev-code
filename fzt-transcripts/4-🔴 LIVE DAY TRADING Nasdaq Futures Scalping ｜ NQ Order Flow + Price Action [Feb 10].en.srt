are we doing chat? Hope you had a good
day yesterday. Uh I think we caught the

6
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
day yesterday. Uh I think we caught the
 

7
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,870
day yesterday. Uh I think we caught the
best moves in the morning. Probably

8
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
best moves in the morning. Probably
 

9
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,110
best moves in the morning. Probably
could have held those longs yesterday a

10
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
could have held those longs yesterday a
 

11
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,150
could have held those longs yesterday a
little bit longer, couldn't we? Could

12
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
little bit longer, couldn't we? Could
 

13
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,030
little bit longer, couldn't we? Could
have, would have, should have, but a

14
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
have, would have, should have, but a
 

15
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,510
have, would have, should have, but a
couple 100 point trades and as ever as

16
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
couple 100 point trades and as ever as
 

17
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,870
couple 100 point trades and as ever as
soon as I got off stream, the wash came

18
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
soon as I got off stream, the wash came
 

19
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,710
soon as I got off stream, the wash came
in. All right, we got that big wash

20
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
in. All right, we got that big wash
 

21
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,150
in. All right, we got that big wash
yesterday that I was looking for off

22
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
yesterday that I was looking for off
 

23
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,909
yesterday that I was looking for off
those highs which was then the

24
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
those highs which was then the
 

25
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,870
those highs which was then the
reaccumulation long moment and today we

26
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
reaccumulation long moment and today we
 

27
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,710
reaccumulation long moment and today we
are opening up with an inside bar. All

28
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
are opening up with an inside bar. All
 

29
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,270
are opening up with an inside bar. All
right, so we've had three drives so far

30
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
right, so we've had three drives so far
 

31
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,030
right, so we've had three drives so far
off the low. We can see this 200 day

32
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,040
off the low. We can see this 200 day
 

33
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,230
off the low. We can see this 200 day
moving average which we found a bid on.

34
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
moving average which we found a bid on.
 

35
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,430
moving average which we found a bid on.
All right, we came all the way to the

36
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
All right, we came all the way to the
 

37
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,270
All right, we came all the way to the
upside, closed inside on that week,

38
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
upside, closed inside on that week,
 

39
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,950
upside, closed inside on that week,
dipped down yesterday which held for

40
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
dipped down yesterday which held for
 

41
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,550
dipped down yesterday which held for
that expansion up and we are going to

42
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
that expansion up and we are going to
 

43
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,990
that expansion up and we are going to
respect this today. All right, we're

44
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
respect this today. All right, we're
 

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,230
respect this today. All right, we're
creating an inside bar. Right, we do

46
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
creating an inside bar. Right, we do
 

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,150
creating an inside bar. Right, we do
have some targets above if they do want

48
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
have some targets above if they do want
 

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,390
have some targets above if they do want
to continue to keep going. Now, if it is

50
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
to continue to keep going. Now, if it is
 

51
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,469
to continue to keep going. Now, if it is
a full mean reversion, as we know, it

52
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
a full mean reversion, as we know, it
 

53
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,350
a full mean reversion, as we know, it
will be the lower bowl to the 20-day.

54
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
will be the lower bowl to the 20-day.
 

55
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,350
will be the lower bowl to the 20-day.
I'm just having a look across right now

56
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm just having a look across right now
 

57
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,150
I'm just having a look across right now
to just make sure, have we already done

58
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
to just make sure, have we already done
 

59
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,909
to just make sure, have we already done
that on uh the QQQ? No, we haven't.

60
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
that on uh the QQQ? No, we haven't.
 

61
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,310
that on uh the QQQ? No, we haven't.
Okay, so that's still an available uh

62
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
Okay, so that's still an available uh
 

63
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,749
Okay, so that's still an available uh
shot. We have relative strength in uh

64
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
shot. We have relative strength in uh
 

65
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,310
shot. We have relative strength in uh
the spiders and ES with a spy opening up

66
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
the spiders and ES with a spy opening up
 

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,469
the spiders and ES with a spy opening up
at alltime highs right now. All right.

68
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
at alltime highs right now. All right.
 

69
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,909
at alltime highs right now. All right.
So, we have this shot if we're going to

70
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
So, we have this shot if we're going to
 

71
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,310
So, we have this shot if we're going to
do an outside bar break. We have the 200

72
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
do an outside bar break. We have the 200
 

73
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,070
do an outside bar break. We have the 200
day and we have this shelf here. All

74
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
day and we have this shelf here. All
 

75
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,350
day and we have this shelf here. All
right. In towards 600s and then 660 is

76
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
right. In towards 600s and then 660 is
 

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,270
right. In towards 600s and then 660 is
this gray box across. All right. This is

78
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
this gray box across. All right. This is
 

79
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,430
this gray box across. All right. This is
from the most recent high. If we go from

80
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
from the most recent high. If we go from
 

81
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,510
from the most recent high. If we go from
the last year, right, we will see the

82
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
the last year, right, we will see the
 

83
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,189
the last year, right, we will see the
same kind of shelf as we get into the

84
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
same kind of shelf as we get into the
 

85
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,270
same kind of shelf as we get into the
600. So, there's 600 and then through

86
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
600. So, there's 600 and then through
 

87
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,629
600. So, there's 600 and then through
600 we get thin up to 677 or 700. So,

88
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
600 we get thin up to 677 or 700. So,
 

89
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,110
600 we get thin up to 677 or 700. So,
you might want to mark that out. As we

90
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
you might want to mark that out. As we
 

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,029
you might want to mark that out. As we
move into the hourlys, we can get a clue

92
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
move into the hourlys, we can get a clue
 

93
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,390
move into the hourlys, we can get a clue
of what we're looking at as we've been

94
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
of what we're looking at as we've been
 

95
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,550
of what we're looking at as we've been
developing a range all the way through

96
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
developing a range all the way through
 

97
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,629
developing a range all the way through
yesterday's afternoon and overnight

98
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
yesterday's afternoon and overnight
 

99
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,469
yesterday's afternoon and overnight
here. So, we had a P-shape profile

100
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
here. So, we had a P-shape profile
 

101
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,110
here. So, we had a P-shape profile
yesterday and we're now developing a

102
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
yesterday and we're now developing a
 

103
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,029
yesterday and we're now developing a
range, right? So, you can see this

104
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
range, right? So, you can see this
 

105
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,189
range, right? So, you can see this
P-shaped profile, right, also being

106
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
P-shaped profile, right, also being
 

107
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,629
P-shaped profile, right, also being
developed on the current developing

108
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
developed on the current developing
 

109
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,909
developed on the current developing
week. Remember, this is our current

110
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
week. Remember, this is our current
 

111
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,230
week. Remember, this is our current
developing week value area. So, we found

112
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
developing week value area. So, we found
 

113
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,550
developing week value area. So, we found
a bid yesterday, we've ripped up, and

114
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
a bid yesterday, we've ripped up, and
 

115
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,350
a bid yesterday, we've ripped up, and
we've now developed a lot of volume up

116
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
we've now developed a lot of volume up
 

117
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,510
we've now developed a lot of volume up
here, right? So, the edge of this volume

118
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
here, right? So, the edge of this volume
 

119
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,189
here, right? So, the edge of this volume
really that we're looking at right now

120
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
really that we're looking at right now
 

121
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,110
really that we're looking at right now
is

122
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
is
 

123
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,749
is
uh I'd say I'm watching the sort of the

124
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
uh I'd say I'm watching the sort of the
 

125
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,189
uh I'd say I'm watching the sort of the
330s, 300s, um all the way into this

126
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
330s, 300s, um all the way into this
 

127
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,790
330s, 300s, um all the way into this
high. And uh right now we are holding

128
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
high. And uh right now we are holding
 

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,590
high. And uh right now we are holding
dips. Okay, we're holding dips. We want

130
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:51,600
dips. Okay, we're holding dips. We want
 

131
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,430
dips. Okay, we're holding dips. We want
to be careful. This is a big supply

132
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
to be careful. This is a big supply
 

133
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,110
to be careful. This is a big supply
level right here into previous week

134
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
level right here into previous week
 

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,029
level right here into previous week
value area high. Not just from the value

136
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
value area high. Not just from the value
 

137
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,950
value area high. Not just from the value
week, but if we just look back and see

138
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
week, but if we just look back and see
 

139
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,029
week, but if we just look back and see
what a key pivot this was, this area,

140
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
what a key pivot this was, this area,
 

141
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,510
what a key pivot this was, this area,

pressure over, dip, pressure. Okay, you

156
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
pressure over, dip, pressure. Okay, you
 

157
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,550
pressure over, dip, pressure. Okay, you
get the point. In here, massive level.

158
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
get the point. In here, massive level.
 

159
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,270
get the point. In here, massive level.
All right. Massive, massive, massive

160
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
All right. Massive, massive, massive
 

161
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,070
All right. Massive, massive, massive
level in here. So, we need to be aware

162
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
level in here. So, we need to be aware
 

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,469
level in here. So, we need to be aware
of this level. We have to be aware of

164
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
of this level. We have to be aware of
 

165
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,390
of this level. We have to be aware of
this level, which means two things can

166
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
this level, which means two things can
 

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,469
this level, which means two things can
happen. We can either set a bull trap

168
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
happen. We can either set a bull trap
 

169
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,870
happen. We can either set a bull trap
over it or we can reclaim it and look

170
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
over it or we can reclaim it and look
 

171
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,550
over it or we can reclaim it and look
for a bigger move higher. All right. So,

172
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
for a bigger move higher. All right. So,
 

173
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,550
for a bigger move higher. All right. So,
what I'm watching here today is in these

174
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
what I'm watching here today is in these
 

175
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,390
what I'm watching here today is in these
levels in and around previous day value

176
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
levels in and around previous day value
 

177
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,990
levels in and around previous day value
area high, previous week value area

178
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
area high, previous week value area
 

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,909
area high, previous week value area
high, even this pivot up here. We want

180
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
high, even this pivot up here. We want
 

181
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,629
high, even this pivot up here. We want
to watch how we act into these nodes. If

182
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
to watch how we act into these nodes. If
 

183
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,430
to watch how we act into these nodes. If
the market right drives out and turns

184
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
the market right drives out and turns
 

185
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,830
the market right drives out and turns
this effectively into demand and is able

186
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
this effectively into demand and is able
 

187
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,950
this effectively into demand and is able
to hold, we can think about a drive all

188
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
to hold, we can think about a drive all
 

189
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,790
to hold, we can think about a drive all
the way up to the up to here for a

190
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
the way up to the up to here for a
 

191
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,430
the way up to the up to here for a
retest. Right, we have an old point of

192
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
retest. Right, we have an old point of
 

193
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,469
retest. Right, we have an old point of
control up here into 800. I want to be

194
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
control up here into 800. I want to be
 

195
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,550
control up here into 800. I want to be
very aware of a bull trap living in this

196
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
very aware of a bull trap living in this
 

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,869
very aware of a bull trap living in this
area here. Why? Because I've just shown

198
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
area here. Why? Because I've just shown
 

199
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,950
area here. Why? Because I've just shown
you, we like to do bull traps in this

200
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
you, we like to do bull traps in this
 

201
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,150
you, we like to do bull traps in this
area. If we drove out, took these stops,

202
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
area. If we drove out, took these stops,
 

203
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,070
area. If we drove out, took these stops,
came back under, and did this. Well,

204
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
came back under, and did this. Well,
 

205
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,469
came back under, and did this. Well,
that would be somewhat dangerous for a

206
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
that would be somewhat dangerous for a
 

207
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,469
that would be somewhat dangerous for a
rotation back down. So, we will respect

208
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
rotation back down. So, we will respect
 

209
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,950
rotation back down. So, we will respect
this volume as we start to build it out.

210
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
this volume as we start to build it out.
 

211
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,110
this volume as we start to build it out.
But if we drive and we get stuck, there

212
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
But if we drive and we get stuck, there
 

213
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,589
But if we drive and we get stuck, there
is a short back in here. And then if

214
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
is a short back in here. And then if
 

215
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,110
is a short back in here. And then if
they keep selling through, we'll

216
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
they keep selling through, we'll
 

217
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,029
they keep selling through, we'll
collapse this move back down. All right?

218
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
collapse this move back down. All right?
 

219
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,790
collapse this move back down. All right?
So, I want to be aware of bull traps in

220
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
So, I want to be aware of bull traps in
 

221
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,070
So, I want to be aware of bull traps in
here. If, however, we drive

222
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
here. If, however, we drive
 

223
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,790
here. If, however, we drive
and we hold, there is room for this

224
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
and we hold, there is room for this
 

225
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,630
and we hold, there is room for this
drive higher. If we're going to go into

226
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
drive higher. If we're going to go into
 

227
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,870
drive higher. If we're going to go into
more of a rotation, then I think we're

228
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
more of a rotation, then I think we're
 

229
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,269
more of a rotation, then I think we're
going to be somewhat pinned in this same

230
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
going to be somewhat pinned in this same
 

231
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,670
going to be somewhat pinned in this same
area. Maybe we expand that area a little

232
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
area. Maybe we expand that area a little
 

233
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,590
area. Maybe we expand that area a little
bit. The rotation might look something

234
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
bit. The rotation might look something
 

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,310
bit. The rotation might look something
like this. All right. It might just be

236
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
like this. All right. It might just be
 

237
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,310
like this. All right. It might just be
one of these starting to develop. Okay.

238
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
one of these starting to develop. Okay.
 

239
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,990
one of these starting to develop. Okay.
And we can watch previous days value

240
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
And we can watch previous days value
 

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,350
And we can watch previous days value
area. Um I don't see weakness uh

242
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
area. Um I don't see weakness uh
 

243
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,310
area. Um I don't see weakness uh
particularly coming in here right now

244
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
particularly coming in here right now
 

245
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,470
particularly coming in here right now
until we start collapsing under this and

246
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
until we start collapsing under this and
 

247
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,710
until we start collapsing under this and
seeing us lose a bid back down to the

248
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
seeing us lose a bid back down to the
 

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,350
seeing us lose a bid back down to the
25,000. So, we can watch that for sure.

250
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
25,000. So, we can watch that for sure.
 

251
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,070
25,000. So, we can watch that for sure.
We can watch 300s or if we start to lose

252
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
We can watch 300s or if we start to lose
 

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,630
We can watch 300s or if we start to lose
a bit under 300s and reject 300s, we can

254
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
a bit under 300s and reject 300s, we can
 

255
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,310
a bit under 300s and reject 300s, we can
use this trap volume for that rotation

256
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
use this trap volume for that rotation
 

257
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,030
use this trap volume for that rotation
back down to 191s and then maybe even

258
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
back down to 191s and then maybe even
 

259
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,350
back down to 191s and then maybe even
the 100s. It's possible, but I think I'm

260
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
the 100s. It's possible, but I think I'm
 

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,710
the 100s. It's possible, but I think I'm
more interested in what happens up here

262
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
more interested in what happens up here
 

263
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,829
more interested in what happens up here
this morning. Unless we get a big

264
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
this morning. Unless we get a big
 

265
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,829
this morning. Unless we get a big
morning flush. Unless we get a big

266
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
morning flush. Unless we get a big
 

267
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,470
morning flush. Unless we get a big
morning flush. Okay, moving up lower

268
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
morning flush. Okay, moving up lower
 

269
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,870
morning flush. Okay, moving up lower
time frame. You can see how we've acted.

270
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
time frame. You can see how we've acted.
 

271
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,190
time frame. You can see how we've acted.
Just chop sideways since yesterday. Same

272
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
Just chop sideways since yesterday. Same
 

273
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,710
Just chop sideways since yesterday. Same
thing. Just pinned in. All right, since

274
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
thing. Just pinned in. All right, since
 

275
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,550
thing. Just pinned in. All right, since
yesterday. There's your sideways chop.

276
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
yesterday. There's your sideways chop.

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,949
yesterday. There's your sideways chop.
So, we're boxed in. So, we're trading

278
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
So, we're boxed in. So, we're trading
 

279
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,750
So, we're boxed in. So, we're trading
edges in this box and failed breakouts

280
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
edges in this box and failed breakouts
 

281
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,750

283
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,710
of this box unless we break and hold
above. Okay, very very simple. Make it

284
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
above. Okay, very very simple. Make it
 

285
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,630

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
simple. I do not want to execute in the
 

287
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,310
simple. I do not want to execute in the
middle of this box. Right? I need to be

288
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
middle of this box. Right? I need to be
 

289
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,910
middle of this box. Right? I need to be
looking at the edges and how we act at

290
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
looking at the edges and how we act at
 

291
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,990
looking at the edges and how we act at
the edges. If you execute in the edges

292
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
the edges. If you execute in the edges
 

293
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,509
the edges. If you execute in the edges
in in the edges, you might have some

in in the edges, you might have some
 

295
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,590
in in the edges, you might have some
edge. If you don't, you're going to get

00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
edge. If you don't, you're going to get
 

297
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,350

the spiders, which is already at

308
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
the spiders, which is already at
 

309
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,590
the spiders, which is already at
all-time highs pretty much. All right,

310
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
all-time highs pretty much. All right,
 

311
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,829
all-time highs pretty much. All right,
so we're opening up at 64s. Not quite

312
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
so we're opening up at 64s. Not quite
 

313
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,990
so we're opening up at 64s. Not quite
there, but we need to take out 97s and

314
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
there, but we need to take out 97s and
 

315
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,910
there, but we need to take out 97s and
then we're there. So spy very, very

316
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
then we're there. So spy very, very
 

317
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,670
then we're there. So spy very, very
close. Uh just know that every time we

318
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
close. Uh just know that every time we
 

319
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,829
close. Uh just know that every time we
get up here, we have failed to see

320
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
get up here, we have failed to see
 

321
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,350
get up here, we have failed to see
follow through. What will spy need to

322
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
follow through. What will spy need to
 

323
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,790
follow through. What will spy need to
really get going? It's going to need one

324
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
really get going? It's going to need one
 

325
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,310
really get going? It's going to need one
of these. All right, if this undercut

326
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
of these. All right, if this undercut
 

327
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,190
of these. All right, if this undercut
was enough, it's going to need to break

328
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
was enough, it's going to need to break
 

329
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,870
was enough, it's going to need to break
out and hold above for that move. Uh we

330
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
out and hold above for that move. Uh we
 

331
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,710
out and hold above for that move. Uh we
can go lower time frame. Have a quick

332
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
can go lower time frame. Have a quick
 

333
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,470
can go lower time frame. Have a quick
look at the spiders. All right. So

334
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
look at the spiders. All right. So
 

335
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,990
look at the spiders. All right. So
opening up with a bit of a gap up. Same

336
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
opening up with a bit of a gap up. Same
 

337
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,150
opening up with a bit of a gap up. Same
kind of story. We're in a range here.

338
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
kind of story. We're in a range here.
 

339
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,910
kind of story. We're in a range here.
You just want to be careful. If you lose

340
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
You just want to be careful. If you lose
 

341
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,310
You just want to be careful. If you lose
pre-market low, all right, and they back

342
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
pre-market low, all right, and they back
 

343
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,150
pre-market low, all right, and they back
test and stay heavy, they will rotate

344
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
test and stay heavy, they will rotate
 

345
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,990
test and stay heavy, they will rotate
down into this cluster again. That's all

346
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
down into this cluster again. That's all
 

347
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,590
down into this cluster again. That's all
you need to be aware of. All the time

348
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
you need to be aware of. All the time
 

349
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,269
you need to be aware of. All the time
we're doing this though, any reclaim,

350
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
we're doing this though, any reclaim,
 

351
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,590
we're doing this though, any reclaim,
that would be the trap to go higher.

352
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
that would be the trap to go higher.
 

353
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,670
that would be the trap to go higher.
Okay, Dixie still losing a bid. All

354
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
Okay, Dixie still losing a bid. All
 

355
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,430
Okay, Dixie still losing a bid. All
right, this is still losing a bid. We

356
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
right, this is still losing a bid. We
 

357
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,870
right, this is still losing a bid. We
are still seeing weakness. We will

358
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
are still seeing weakness. We will
 

359
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,550
are still seeing weakness. We will
continue to see a rotation back into

360
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
continue to see a rotation back into
 

361
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,230
continue to see a rotation back into
gold all the time this happens. I would

362
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
gold all the time this happens. I would
 

363
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,670
gold all the time this happens. I would
leave silver alone. Those of you who are

364
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
leave silver alone. Those of you who are
 

365
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,069
leave silver alone. Those of you who are
looking for more upside, gold is the one

366
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
looking for more upside, gold is the one
 

367
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,990
looking for more upside, gold is the one
which is a hedge right now to the Dixie.

368
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
which is a hedge right now to the Dixie.
 

369
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,230
which is a hedge right now to the Dixie.
So, we have to watch into here. All

370
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
So, we have to watch into here. All
 

371
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,310
So, we have to watch into here. All
right. If this finds a bid here, this

372
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
right. If this finds a bid here, this
 

373
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,230
right. If this finds a bid here, this
can get going. Gold will start to sell.

374
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
can get going. Gold will start to sell.
 

375
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,310
can get going. Gold will start to sell.
If this starts to collapse under here

376
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
If this starts to collapse under here
 

377
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,389
If this starts to collapse under here
and we use this liquidity to go lower,

378
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
and we use this liquidity to go lower,
 

379
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,590
and we use this liquidity to go lower,
we will see weakness in the dollar.

380
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
we will see weakness in the dollar.
 

381
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,190
we will see weakness in the dollar.
Uh D Mr. VIX, you can see where Mr. VIX

382
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
Uh D Mr. VIX, you can see where Mr. VIX
 

383
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,949
Uh D Mr. VIX, you can see where Mr. VIX
is. All right. Still in this uptrending

384
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
is. All right. Still in this uptrending
 

385
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,790
is. All right. Still in this uptrending
channel, right? But broke out,

386
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
channel, right? But broke out,
 

387
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,030
channel, right? But broke out,
collapsing back in. You know, if we

388
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
collapsing back in. You know, if we
 

389
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,190
collapsing back in. You know, if we
start losing 18s and 17s for that

390
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
start losing 18s and 17s for that
 

391
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,430
start losing 18s and 17s for that
rotation to 16s, that will help the spy

392
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
rotation to 16s, that will help the spy
 

393
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,350
rotation to 16s, that will help the spy
start to look for those alltime highs.

394
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
start to look for those alltime highs.
 

395
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,750
start to look for those alltime highs.
Right. Quick look at the mag.

396
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760

 

397
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,710

So, sideways here in Apple facing out

398
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
So, sideways here in Apple facing out
 

399
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,470
So, sideways here in Apple facing out
down here. Remember, it's been very,

400
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
down here. Remember, it's been very,
 

401
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,550
down here. Remember, it's been very,
very strong, right? It might just be a

402
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
very strong, right? It might just be a
 

403
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,470
very strong, right? It might just be a
back test of this. It's potential. You

404
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
back test of this. It's potential. You
 

405
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,990
back test of this. It's potential. You
could argue it's backside right here,

406
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
could argue it's backside right here,
 

407
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,389
could argue it's backside right here,
but I think until we start taking this

408
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
but I think until we start taking this
 

409
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,990
but I think until we start taking this
out, you want to be very, very cautious.

410
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
out, you want to be very, very cautious.
 

411
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,910
out, you want to be very, very cautious.
If we start losing that, that's a weak

412
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
If we start losing that, that's a weak
 

413
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,230
If we start losing that, that's a weak
sign for the market. So, right now,

414
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
sign for the market. So, right now,
 

415
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,110
sign for the market. So, right now,
opening up slight gap down, but inside

416
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
opening up slight gap down, but inside
 

417
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,949
opening up slight gap down, but inside
yesterday's range. So, no follow

418
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
yesterday's range. So, no follow
 

419
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,430
yesterday's range. So, no follow
through. Amazon

420
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
through. Amazon
 

421
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,710
through. Amazon
slight gap up.

422
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
slight gap up.
 

423
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,710
slight gap up.
What happens next in Amazon's key? I'd

424
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
What happens next in Amazon's key? I'd
 

425
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,949
What happens next in Amazon's key? I'd
be watching it into here and do they

426
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
be watching it into here and do they
 

427
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,550
be watching it into here and do they
resell that back down? And then what

428
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
resell that back down? And then what
 

429
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,150
resell that back down? And then what
happens in here? So, if that's the big

430
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
happens in here? So, if that's the big
 

431
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,389
happens in here? So, if that's the big
flush and this is your first B bounce

432
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
flush and this is your first B bounce
 

433
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,310
flush and this is your first B bounce
moment, do they resell that and do they

434
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
moment, do they resell that and do they
 

435
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,389
moment, do they resell that and do they
find a bid there or do we get follow

436
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
find a bid there or do we get follow
 

437
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,949
find a bid there or do we get follow
through downside? So, Amazon waking up.

438
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
through downside? So, Amazon waking up.
 

439
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,710
through downside? So, Amazon waking up.
It's a bit of a no touch for me down

440
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
It's a bit of a no touch for me down
 

441
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,750
It's a bit of a no touch for me down
here. It's got to either flush and hold

442
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
here. It's got to either flush and hold
 

443
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,310
here. It's got to either flush and hold
or drive up and reject or drive up and

444
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
or drive up and reject or drive up and
 

445
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,550
or drive up and reject or drive up and
reclaim. Otherwise, not much of a play.

446
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
reclaim. Otherwise, not much of a play.
 

447
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,629
reclaim. Otherwise, not much of a play.
Guess a bit like the cues right now.

448
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
Guess a bit like the cues right now.
 

449
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,389
Guess a bit like the cues right now.
Goo. Are we going to get a chart here?

450
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
Goo. Are we going to get a chart here?
 

451
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,870
Goo. Are we going to get a chart here?
Goo. There we go. All right. Goo opening

452
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
Goo. There we go. All right. Goo opening
 

453
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,110
Goo. There we go. All right. Goo opening
up inside yesterday's range. That is

454
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
up inside yesterday's range. That is
 

455
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,870
up inside yesterday's range. That is
looking pretty ugly right now. All

456
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
looking pretty ugly right now. All
 

457
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,110
looking pretty ugly right now. All
right. You're getting one of these. Not

458
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
right. You're getting one of these. Not
 

459
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,509
right. You're getting one of these. Not
very nice. That's a leave alone chart.

460
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
very nice. That's a leave alone chart.
 

461
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,150
very nice. That's a leave alone chart.
Meta back up to this pivot we talked

462
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
Meta back up to this pivot we talked
 

463
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,269
Meta back up to this pivot we talked
about. You can see we talked about that

464
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
about. You can see we talked about that
 

465
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,190
about. You can see we talked about that
the other day, right? The drive down

466
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
the other day, right? The drive down
 

467
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,670
the other day, right? The drive down
wash failed to break lower. Shorts get

468
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
wash failed to break lower. Shorts get
 

469
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,990
wash failed to break lower. Shorts get
trapped. We've now taken out that pivot.

470
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
trapped. We've now taken out that pivot.
 

471
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,550
trapped. We've now taken out that pivot.
Do we hold some form of higher low here

472
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
Do we hold some form of higher low here
 

473
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,629
Do we hold some form of higher low here
to get going? Big question for Meta, but

474
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
to get going? Big question for Meta, but
 

475
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,310
to get going? Big question for Meta, but
it's very very possible if they do want

476
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
it's very very possible if they do want
 

477
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,670
it's very very possible if they do want
to do that. Depends on the strength of

478
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
to do that. Depends on the strength of
 

479
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,949
to do that. Depends on the strength of
the broader market.

480
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
the broader market.
 

481
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,110
the broader market.
Microsoft, look at that. Absolute

482
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
Microsoft, look at that. Absolute
 

483
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,350
Microsoft, look at that. Absolute
killer. Beautiful. So, we talked about

484
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
killer. Beautiful. So, we talked about
 

485
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,350
killer. Beautiful. So, we talked about
this range being reclaimed down here.

486
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
this range being reclaimed down here.
 

487
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,470
this range being reclaimed down here.
You can see where I've drawn this out.

488
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
You can see where I've drawn this out.
 

489
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,710
You can see where I've drawn this out.
Here's the old range. We break down from

490
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
Here's the old range. We break down from
 

491
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,629
Here's the old range. We break down from
that range. First bounce like we talked

492
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
that range. First bounce like we talked
 

493
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,110
that range. First bounce like we talked
about. We reject a trade back inside. We

494
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
about. We reject a trade back inside. We
 

495
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,190
about. We reject a trade back inside. We
trade lower and then shorts fail to

496
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
trade lower and then shorts fail to
 

497
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,030
trade lower and then shorts fail to
break down at the low. This is your long

498
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
break down at the low. This is your long
 

499
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,949
break down at the low. This is your long
trigger. They fail to break down and we

500
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
trigger. They fail to break down and we
 

501
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,310
trigger. They fail to break down and we
go all the way back up running these

502
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
go all the way back up running these
 

503
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,470
go all the way back up running these
stops. And we're now looking to take out

504
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
stops. And we're now looking to take out
 

505
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,750
stops. And we're now looking to take out
this high at 2020 for 2020. I would

506
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
this high at 2020 for 2020. I would
 

507
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,430
this high at 2020 for 2020. I would
imagine they will want to build some

508
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
imagine they will want to build some
 

509
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,069
imagine they will want to build some
liquidity here for a moment if possible.

510
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
liquidity here for a moment if possible.
 

511
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,509
liquidity here for a moment if possible.
And then once they break that, they'll

512
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
And then once they break that, they'll
 

513
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,750
And then once they break that, they'll
be looking for a retest at 22s. This is

514
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
be looking for a retest at 22s. This is
 

515
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,509
be looking for a retest at 22s. This is
the big level right now. the first big

516
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
the big level right now. the first big
 

517
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,310
the big level right now. the first big
levels into 22s here. And if they start

518
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
levels into 22s here. And if they start
 

519
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,509
levels into 22s here. And if they start
reclaiming that, then they're going to

520
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
reclaiming that, then they're going to
 

521
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,350
reclaiming that, then they're going to
just keep looking to trade higher and

522
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
just keep looking to trade higher and
 

523
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,829
just keep looking to trade higher and
higher and higher and repric this, which

524
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
higher and higher and repric this, which
 

525
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,069
higher and higher and repric this, which
is pretty thin up there. I'm going to

526
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
is pretty thin up there. I'm going to
 

527
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,590
is pretty thin up there. I'm going to
assume that was their earnings. Yeah, it

528
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
assume that was their earnings. Yeah, it
 

529
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,030
assume that was their earnings. Yeah, it
is. So, we're going to come back to the

530
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
is. So, we're going to come back to the
 

531
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,350
is. So, we're going to come back to the
bottom of earnings. Probably 22. So,

532
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
bottom of earnings. Probably 22. So,
 

533
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,350
bottom of earnings. Probably 22. So,
I'll be watching 22s to see how we act

534
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
I'll be watching 22s to see how we act
 

535
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,629
I'll be watching 22s to see how we act
there on Softy.

536
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
there on Softy.
 

537
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,150
there on Softy.
Just clean that up so next time I look

538
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
Just clean that up so next time I look
 

539
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,910
Just clean that up so next time I look
at it, it is okay. Uh Nvidia,

540
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
at it, it is okay. Uh Nvidia,
 

541
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,069
at it, it is okay. Uh Nvidia,
wow. So big pump yesterday trying to

542
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
wow. So big pump yesterday trying to
 

543
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,230
wow. So big pump yesterday trying to
reclaim some of its old range. Chip

544
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
reclaim some of its old range. Chip
 

545
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,509
reclaim some of its old range. Chip
starting to get going with that news

546
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
starting to get going with that news
 

547
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,990
starting to get going with that news
that we had in Asia like we talked about

548
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
that we had in Asia like we talked about
 

549
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,110
that we had in Asia like we talked about
in Sunday and saw the top side of this

550
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
in Sunday and saw the top side of this
 

551
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,030
in Sunday and saw the top side of this
range right now. All right, so Nvidia

552
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
range right now. All right, so Nvidia
 

553
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,910
range right now. All right, so Nvidia
holding 70 to 90 acceptance over here

554
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
holding 70 to 90 acceptance over here
 

555
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,750
holding 70 to 90 acceptance over here
and we will get going and we will start

556
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
and we will get going and we will start
 

557
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,350
and we will get going and we will start
trying to get back up to alltime highs.

558
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
trying to get back up to alltime highs.
 

559
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,030
trying to get back up to alltime highs.
So it doesn't look too bad. It's all

560
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
So it doesn't look too bad. It's all
 

561
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,870
So it doesn't look too bad. It's all
depends what happens here. But again, if

562
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
depends what happens here. But again, if
 

563
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,230
depends what happens here. But again, if
you're a range trader, you're probably

564
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
you're a range trader, you're probably
 

565
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,670
you're a range trader, you're probably
looking to fade that. I would be

566
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
looking to fade that. I would be
 

567
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,949
looking to fade that. I would be
somewhat cautious today. If we do this,

568
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
somewhat cautious today. If we do this,
 

569
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,389
somewhat cautious today. If we do this,
that thing can get going. We've been

570
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
that thing can get going. We've been
 

571
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,310
that thing can get going. We've been
here a few times. There's lots of stops

572
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
here a few times. There's lots of stops
 

573
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,550
here a few times. There's lots of stops
to get taken out. Tesla,

574
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
to get taken out. Tesla,
 

575
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,230
to get taken out. Tesla,
it's just an awful looking chart. All

576
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
it's just an awful looking chart. All
 

577
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,710
it's just an awful looking chart. All
right, there's your bid drive up on the

578
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
right, there's your bid drive up on the
 

579
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,470
right, there's your bid drive up on the
hourly. We've come back down to that

580
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
hourly. We've come back down to that
 

581
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,870
hourly. We've come back down to that
same area. We haven't undercut it. All

582
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
same area. We haven't undercut it. All
 

583
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,310
same area. We haven't undercut it. All
right, that's always a bit of a worry,

584
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
right, that's always a bit of a worry,
 

585
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,910
right, that's always a bit of a worry,
but they are holding firm in that bid

586
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
but they are holding firm in that bid
 

587
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,629
but they are holding firm in that bid
right now. Uh, zoom this out a little

588
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
right now. Uh, zoom this out a little
 

589
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,150
right now. Uh, zoom this out a little
bit. Same kind of story as we've just

590
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
bit. Same kind of story as we've just
 

591
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,230
bit. Same kind of story as we've just
seen. There's the breakdown, right?

592
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
seen. There's the breakdown, right?
 

593
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,750
seen. There's the breakdown, right?
Here's all the liquidity being built.

594
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
Here's all the liquidity being built.
 

595
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,430
Here's all the liquidity being built.
There's the breakdown. There's the

596
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
There's the breakdown. There's the
 

597
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,269
There's the breakdown. There's the
failure to trade lower. There's the bid

598
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
failure to trade lower. There's the bid
 

599
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,110
failure to trade lower. There's the bid
up, back up. So, what happens in here?

600
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
up, back up. So, what happens in here?
 

601
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,590
up, back up. So, what happens in here?
420 becomes key that are they able to

602
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
420 becomes key that are they able to
 

603
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,509
420 becomes key that are they able to
hold a bid and get going and run all

604
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
hold a bid and get going and run all
 

605
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,590
hold a bid and get going and run all
these stops out now? Big question mark

606
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
these stops out now? Big question mark
 

607
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,430
these stops out now? Big question mark
over that. It's our first attempt back

608
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
over that. It's our first attempt back
 

609
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,230
over that. It's our first attempt back
in since the 4th of Feb. So, we'd be

610
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,240
in since the 4th of Feb. So, we'd be
 

611
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,030
in since the 4th of Feb. So, we'd be
watching that area. Now, uh equally

612
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
watching that area. Now, uh equally
 

613
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,310
watching that area. Now, uh equally
weighted. Let's have a quick look at the

614
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
weighted. Let's have a quick look at the
 

615
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,710
weighted. Let's have a quick look at the
equally weighted mag.

616
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720

 

617
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,189

No undercut on the equally weighted. And

618
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
No undercut on the equally weighted. And
 

619
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,750
No undercut on the equally weighted. And
what we doing?

620
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:47,760
what we doing?
 

621
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,430
what we doing?
Same kind of story we've seen on a lot

with a failure to break lower, but we're

628
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
with a failure to break lower, but we're
 

629
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,550
with a failure to break lower, but we're
coming into key pivot. So, location not

00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
coming into key pivot. So, location not
 

631
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,350

ideally up here to see if they're going
 

707
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,710
ideally up here to see if they're going
to fade this edge or to see if we flip

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
to fade this edge or to see if we flip
 

709

to fade this edge or to see if we flip
this and turn it bullish

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,789
early. Right now we're trading right in
the middle of that P shape we developed

926
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
the middle of that P shape we developed
 

927
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,710
the middle of that P shape we developed
this week. Right? So since this Sunday

928
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
this week. Right? So since this Sunday
 

929
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,549
this week. Right? So since this Sunday
open,

930
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
open,
 

931
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,909
open,
we're just trading right in the middle

932
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
we're just trading right in the middle
 

933
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,029
we're just trading right in the middle
of this. We think about this.

934
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
of this. We think about this.
 

935
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,750
of this. We think about this.
Here's your your rip. That was what we

936
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
Here's your your rip. That was what we
 

937
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,590
Here's your your rip. That was what we
developed and we're trading right here.

938
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
developed and we're trading right here.
 

939
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,270
developed and we're trading right here.
There's no edge here, right? We want to

940
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
There's no edge here, right? We want to
 

941
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,270
There's no edge here, right? We want to
be at an edge. So we can think about a

942
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
be at an edge. So we can think about a
 

943
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,909
be at an edge. So we can think about a
fail breakout or a break and hold. bail

944
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
fail breakout or a break and hold. bail
 

945
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,070
fail breakout or a break and hold. bail
breakout or a break and hold. We don't

946
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,080
breakout or a break and hold. We don't
 

947
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,149
breakout or a break and hold. We don't
want to really execute in here. It's not

948
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
want to really execute in here. It's not
 

949
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,230
want to really execute in here. It's not
the best setup in there. Very, very

950
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,240
the best setup in there. Very, very
 

951
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,270
the best setup in there. Very, very
risky.

952
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280

 

953
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,990

So, bidding off that gap.

954
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000
So, bidding off that gap.
 

955
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,590
So, bidding off that gap.
Market starting to go green here other

956
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
Market starting to go green here other
 

957
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,149
Market starting to go green here other
than Google. So, Apple and Amazon

958
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
than Google. So, Apple and Amazon
 

959
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,549
than Google. So, Apple and Amazon
starting to claw back, fill their gaps.

960
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559

 

961
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,230

ES looks like it wants to get going

962
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,240
ES looks like it wants to get going
 

963
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,990
ES looks like it wants to get going
here. Not quite through

964
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
here. Not quite through
 

965
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,870
here. Not quite through
uh GlobeEx yet. It keeps trying. That

966
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
uh GlobeEx yet. It keeps trying. That
 

967
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,630
uh GlobeEx yet. It keeps trying. That
7,000 level is probably going to be

968
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640
7,000 level is probably going to be
 

969
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,830
7,000 level is probably going to be
massive, I would assume, on ES.

970
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
massive, I would assume, on ES.
 

971
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,149
massive, I would assume, on ES.
Uh same on SPX. Got a little while to go

Today, a short day. Today, a range

976
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
Today, a short day. Today, a range
 

977
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,470
Today, a short day. Today, a range
rotation day. It might end up being a

978
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
rotation day. It might end up being a
 

979
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,230
rotation day. It might end up being a
short day.

980
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
short day.
 

981
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,070
short day.
All we've That's the only edge yet. I

982
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
All we've That's the only edge yet. I
 

983
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,230
All we've That's the only edge yet. I
would like to see a clear out up here.

984
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
would like to see a clear out up here.
 

985
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,510
would like to see a clear out up here.
If we're going to if we're going to fade

986
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
If we're going to if we're going to fade
 

987
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,149
If we're going to if we're going to fade
it, I'd prefer to see them steal some

988
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
it, I'd prefer to see them steal some
 

989
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,950
it, I'd prefer to see them steal some
liquidity and then dump back inside and

990
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
liquidity and then dump back inside and
 

991
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,470
liquidity and then dump back inside and
give us something to risk off for a

992
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
give us something to risk off for a
 

993
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,549
give us something to risk off for a
range rotation fade. I don't really want

994
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
range rotation fade. I don't really want
 

995
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,190
range rotation fade. I don't really want
to be fading that opening drive in. It's

996
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
to be fading that opening drive in. It's
 

997
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,310
to be fading that opening drive in. It's
a bit risky. Um, where could we fade it

998
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
a bit risky. Um, where could we fade it
 

999
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,029
a bit risky. Um, where could we fade it
down to? Well, potentially down to these

1000
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
down to? Well, potentially down to these
 

1001
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,870
down to? Well, potentially down to these
gray boxes, right? And we need to see

1002
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
gray boxes, right? And we need to see
 

1003
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,950
gray boxes, right? And we need to see
underneath this

1004
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
underneath this
 

1005
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,110
underneath this
underneath this level here. So, they

1006
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
underneath this level here. So, they
 

1007
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,430
underneath this level here. So, they
will need to make a decision of if they

1008
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
will need to make a decision of if they
 

1009
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,070
will need to make a decision of if they
trap or if they want to wash. But in

1010
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
trap or if they want to wash. But in
 

1011
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,830
trap or if they want to wash. But in
here, I don't want to trade. We talked

1012
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
here, I don't want to trade. We talked
 

1013
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,789
here, I don't want to trade. We talked
about this in the uh first 15 minutes of

1014
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
about this in the uh first 15 minutes of
 

1015
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,310
about this in the uh first 15 minutes of
today's stream. I'm trying to avoid

1016
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
today's stream. I'm trying to avoid
 

1017
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,909
today's stream. I'm trying to avoid
trading in the middle of this range.

1018
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
trading in the middle of this range.
 

1019
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,950
trading in the middle of this range.
This is where you'll get chopped up.

1020

1021
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,870

How do I determine how wide to make the

How do I determine how wide to make the
 

1023
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,190
How do I determine how wide to make the
gray box? just based on the nodes, based

1024
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
gray box? just based on the nodes, based
 

1025

Do we come into this next level and then
 

1121
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,549
Do we come into this next level and then
how we act at these 300s becomes key.

1122
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
how we act at these 300s becomes key.

They can set a bear trap here. We can do

1124
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
They can set a bear trap here. We can do
 

1125
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,310
They can set a bear trap here. We can do
this is coming to sort of the edge of

1126
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
this is coming to sort of the edge of
 

1127
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,310
this is coming to sort of the edge of
the range here to here. So, do they set

1128
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
the range here to here. So, do they set
 

1129
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,990
the range here to here. So, do they set
bear traps down here is the question I

1130
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
bear traps down here is the question I
 

1131
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,190
bear traps down here is the question I
have right now.

1132
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
have right now.

If not, what's that? Globeex 280s. 280s
maybe somewhere down there.

1136
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
maybe somewhere down there.
 

1137
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,070
maybe somewhere down there.
So, we'll see if we lose this range.

1138
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
So, we'll see if we lose this range.
 

1139

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
under 300. Under 300, we can get back to
 

1143
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,630
under 300. Under 300, we can get back to
200 very quickly. So, we're watching

1144
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
200 very quickly. So, we're watching
 

1145
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,470
200 very quickly. So, we're watching
this now to see, do they set a trap

1146
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
this now to see, do they set a trap
 

1147

This is coming towards the edge of the
 

1151
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,310
This is coming towards the edge of the
range. Do we trap bears down here and

1152
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,320
range. Do we trap bears down here and
 

1153
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,549
range. Do we trap bears down here and
rip back into the inside of the range or

00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:46,559
rip back into the inside of the range or
 

1155
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,909

1251
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,110
Moving my stop break even because it is
nothing more than a squeeze. I would

1252
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,120
nothing more than a squeeze. I would
 

1253
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,430
nothing more than a squeeze. I would

I've seen a big buyer come on the tape
 

1267
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,230
I've seen a big buyer come on the tape
there at 22s. Can we hold this force

1268
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,240
there at 22s. Can we hold this force
 

1269
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,230
there at 22s. Can we hold this force
through

1270

1271
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,789

22s? 22s. 22s. Any flush of 22s? I'm

1272
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
22s? 22s. 22s. Any flush of 22s? I'm

out.

1274
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
out.
 

1275
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,870
out.
They're trying to defend it. They're

1276
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:14,880
They're trying to defend it. They're
 

1277
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,630
They're trying to defend it. They're
offer. They're bidding 15s which I don't

1278
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
offer. They're bidding 15s which I don't
 

1279
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,549
offer. They're bidding 15s which I don't
like. On that bid step up from 15s.

1280
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559
like. On that bid step up from 15s.
 

1281
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,110
like. On that bid step up from 15s.
Out. Out on that. They might retract and

1282
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,120
Out. Out on that. They might retract and
 

1283
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,029
Out. Out on that. They might retract and
go, "I'm out."

1284
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:27,039

 

1285
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,630

They do it the moment I said it.

1286
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,640

 

1287
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,310

Okay. Shelf developed down here. You can

1288
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
Okay. Shelf developed down here. You can
 

1289
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,909
Okay. Shelf developed down here. You can
see the shelf being developed. So, once

1290
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919
see the shelf being developed. So, once
 

1291
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,269
see the shelf being developed. So, once
we got through these twelves here, there

1292
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:37,279
we got through these twelves here, there
 

1293
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,590
we got through these twelves here, there
was a rip up that squeeze back up. We

1294
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
was a rip up that squeeze back up. We
 

1295
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,310
was a rip up that squeeze back up. We
said we might well trap bears down here.

1296
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
said we might well trap bears down here.
 

1297
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,310
said we might well trap bears down here.
Not convinced that it's done yet, but

1298
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
Not convinced that it's done yet, but
 

1299
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,389
Not convinced that it's done yet, but
the low of day auction into 300 was

1300
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,399
the low of day auction into 300 was
 

1301
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,710
the low of day auction into 300 was
really good. Right. to this level down

1302
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
really good. Right. to this level down
 

1303
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,389
really good. Right. to this level down
here. We've started to see bears get

1304
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
here. We've started to see bears get
 

1305
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,110
here. We've started to see bears get
trapped down at these lows right now,

1306
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
trapped down at these lows right now,
 

1307
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,029
trapped down at these lows right now,
but they're going to have to defend 12.

1308
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
but they're going to have to defend 12.
 

1309
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,190
but they're going to have to defend 12.
So that's that was the pivot. This level

1310
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,200
So that's that was the pivot. This level
 

1311
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,190
So that's that was the pivot. This level
there now that we're coming into this

1312
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
there now that we're coming into this
 

1313
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,269
there now that we're coming into this
node here, they need to defend this the

1314
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279
node here, they need to defend this the
 

1315
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,029
node here, they need to defend this the
buyers otherwise it will be a new low of

1316
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
buyers otherwise it will be a new low of
 

1317
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,710
buyers otherwise it will be a new low of
day probably.

1318
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720

 

1319
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:16,950

Maybe one more flush lower.

1320
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:16,960

 

1321
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,470

Dropping more sellers at that low of

1322
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
Dropping more sellers at that low of
 

1323
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,430
Dropping more sellers at that low of
day. They should flush lower here. Here

1324
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:21,440
day. They should flush lower here. Here
 

1325
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,029
day. They should flush lower here. Here
we go. So, they're coming for GlobeEx,

1326
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
we go. So, they're coming for GlobeEx,
 

1327
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,310
we go. So, they're coming for GlobeEx,
the orange line. Okay. If we stay heavy

1328
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,320
the orange line. Okay. If we stay heavy
 

1329
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,269
the orange line. Okay. If we stay heavy
under here, we have a move down to this.

1330
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
under here, we have a move down to this.
 

1331
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,029
under here, we have a move down to this.
All right. Big. This is the big level

1332
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
All right. Big. This is the big level
 

1333
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,230
All right. Big. This is the big level
where they either trap or we say no, no

1334
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
where they either trap or we say no, no
 

1335
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,669
where they either trap or we say no, no
acceptance. So, we're either going to do

1336
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
acceptance. So, we're either going to do
 

1337
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,669
acceptance. So, we're either going to do
this or we're going to do one of these

1338
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:37,679
this or we're going to do one of these
 

1339
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,269
this or we're going to do one of these
back up for the day and come to the

1340
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,279
back up for the day and come to the
 

1341
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,590
back up for the day and come to the
other side of the range up here. These

1342
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
other side of the range up here. These
 

1343
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,789
other side of the range up here. These
are the things you need to be aware of.

1344
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:42,799
are the things you need to be aware of.
 

1345
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,630
are the things you need to be aware of.
This why this level interests me down

1346
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
This why this level interests me down
 

1347
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,310
This why this level interests me down
here. Both both sides.

1348
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,320
here. Both both sides.
 

1349
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,990
here. Both both sides.
See if there's liquidity much lower on

1350
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
See if there's liquidity much lower on
 

1351
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:03,510
See if there's liquidity much lower on
the book. 200s is there.

1352
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:03,520

 

1353
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,990

So Tesla the strong one today 1 point

1354
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
So Tesla the strong one today 1 point
 

1355
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,950
So Tesla the strong one today 1 point
uh4% up. Microsoft over half% up. Rest

1356
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:08,960
uh4% up. Microsoft over half% up. Rest
 

1357
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,310
uh4% up. Microsoft over half% up. Rest
of the market's gone red. We are

1358
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
of the market's gone red. We are
 

1359
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,149
of the market's gone red. We are
bleeding back down giving away some of

1360
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
bleeding back down giving away some of
 

1361
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,909
bleeding back down giving away some of
yesterday's gains. Coming into some key

1362
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
yesterday's gains. Coming into some key
 

1363
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,149
yesterday's gains. Coming into some key
pivots here though. Coming into some key

1364
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
pivots here though. Coming into some key
 

1365
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,870
pivots here though. Coming into some key
pivots on the hourly.

1366
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:18,880
pivots on the hourly.
 

1367
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,430
pivots on the hourly.
And we are going we are now undercutting

1368
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,440
And we are going we are now undercutting
 

1369
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,950
And we are going we are now undercutting
yesterday's levels. They make the

1370
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960
yesterday's levels. They make the
 

1371
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,950
yesterday's levels. They make the
decision here. Right here right now.

1372
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
decision here. Right here right now.
 

1373
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,389
decision here. Right here right now.
Either we're going to value or they're

1374
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:26,399
Either we're going to value or they're
 

1375
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,310
Either we're going to value or they're
going to trap right now. They have to

1376
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
going to trap right now. They have to
 

1377
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,630
going to trap right now. They have to
make a decision. So far, we're staying

1378
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
make a decision. So far, we're staying
 

1379
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,710
make a decision. So far, we're staying
heavy, but there's lots of selling

1380
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720
heavy, but there's lots of selling
 

1381
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,710
heavy, but there's lots of selling
coming in down here. They need to break

1382
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
coming in down here. They need to break
 

1383
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,909
coming in down here. They need to break
lower and soon. Here we go. 70s. So, can

1384
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
lower and soon. Here we go. 70s. So, can
 

1385
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,750
lower and soon. Here we go. 70s. So, can
we get all the way down to 18s now and

1386
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:39,760
we get all the way down to 18s now and
 

1387
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,590
we get all the way down to 18s now and
20s? We have lots of imbalances down

1388
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:41,600
20s? We have lots of imbalances down
 

1389
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,669
20s? We have lots of imbalances down
there. Previous week closed, by the way,

1390
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:43,679
there. Previous week closed, by the way,
 

1391
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,389
there. Previous week closed, by the way,
is not out of the question. So, sellside

1392
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
is not out of the question. So, sellside
 

1393
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,789
is not out of the question. So, sellside
staying heavy and this will be the

1394
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799
staying heavy and this will be the
 

1395
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,470
staying heavy and this will be the
target down here now

1396
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:52,480
target down here now
 

1397
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,389
target down here now
unless they do a trap in the midpoint of

1398
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399
unless they do a trap in the midpoint of
 

1399
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,710
unless they do a trap in the midpoint of
it, which will be gross. Pivot to pivot.

1400
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
it, which will be gross. Pivot to pivot.
 

1401
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,909
it, which will be gross. Pivot to pivot.
If we look at the hourly,

1402
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919
If we look at the hourly,
 

1403
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,669
If we look at the hourly,
all right, this is the undercut of this.

1404
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
all right, this is the undercut of this.
 

1405
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,990
all right, this is the undercut of this.
This is an hourly pivot. This is an

1406
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
This is an hourly pivot. This is an
 

1407
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,669
This is an hourly pivot. This is an
imbalance.

1408
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
imbalance.
 

1409
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,430
imbalance.
We can still do this. It can afford to

1410
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
We can still do this. It can afford to
 

1411
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,870
We can still do this. It can afford to
come right back here and still bid up

1412
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
come right back here and still bid up
 

1413
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,470
come right back here and still bid up
off it. All right. Need to be aware of

1414
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
off it. All right. Need to be aware of
 

1415
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:24,310
off it. All right. Need to be aware of
that.

1416
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320

 

1417
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,830

Sellers coming in aggressive at those

1418
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
Sellers coming in aggressive at those
 

1419
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,549
Sellers coming in aggressive at those
lows under 86es right now.

1420
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559

 

1421
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,430

Come on.

1422
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440

 

1423
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,110

Do they trap here?

1424
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,120

 

1425
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,430

Imagine they'd go a bit deeper than trap

1426
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,440
Imagine they'd go a bit deeper than trap
 

1427
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,630
Imagine they'd go a bit deeper than trap
down here. They should have either saved

1428
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
down here. They should have either saved
 

1429
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,389
down here. They should have either saved
it or gone deeper. Imagine this is a

1430
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:46,399
it or gone deeper. Imagine this is a
 

1431
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,990
it or gone deeper. Imagine this is a
little bit no man's land, but we'll see

1432
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
little bit no man's land, but we'll see
 

1433
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,350
little bit no man's land, but we'll see
on a reclaim. Watching sort of 300s and

1434
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
on a reclaim. Watching sort of 300s and
 

1435
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,070
on a reclaim. Watching sort of 300s and
310s again. Same kind of level. Here's

1436
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
310s again. Same kind of level. Here's
 

1437
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,870
310s again. Same kind of level. Here's
the 300s. Straight to 310. Watching this

1438
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
the 300s. Straight to 310. Watching this
 

1439
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,190
the 300s. Straight to 310. Watching this
now if we base over it or not. That's

1440
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
now if we base over it or not. That's
 

1441
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,789
now if we base over it or not. That's
where those buyers came in last time.

1442
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
where those buyers came in last time.
 

1443
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,590
where those buyers came in last time.
Right, this sh rejection of 310. So far,

1444
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600
Right, this sh rejection of 310. So far,
 

1445
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,029
Right, this sh rejection of 310. So far,
if we base over that, I will be looking

1446
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:05,039
if we base over that, I will be looking
 

1447
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:12,470
if we base over that, I will be looking
for a short squeeze.

1448
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:12,480

 

1449
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,230

Got to get back above those three tens

1450
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,240
Got to get back above those three tens
 

1451
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,710
Got to get back above those three tens
for me to be really interested.

1452
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
for me to be really interested.
 

1453
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,190
for me to be really interested.
We have trap sellers under 85 right now.

1454
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
We have trap sellers under 85 right now.
 

1455
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,630
We have trap sellers under 85 right now.
Here's the tens. Little imbalance to 99

1456
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:22,640
Here's the tens. Little imbalance to 99
 

1457
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,190
Here's the tens. Little imbalance to 99
which they could hold. There's the

1458
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,200
which they could hold. There's the
 

1459
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,029
which they could hold. There's the
imbalance. Do they hold this?

1460
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,039
imbalance. Do they hold this?
 

1461
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,029
imbalance. Do they hold this?
They're trying.

1462
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
They're trying.
 

1463
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,710
They're trying.
It's tempting. It's not enough for me

1464
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
It's tempting. It's not enough for me
 

1465
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,710
It's tempting. It's not enough for me
yet. They are holding that imbalance.

1466
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,720
yet. They are holding that imbalance.
 

1467
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,149
yet. They are holding that imbalance.
They need a break through tens and base

1468
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
They need a break through tens and base
 

1469
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:44,070
They need a break through tens and base
above 10. I'm interested long.

1470
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,080

 

1471
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,029

Here they go. Swipe to 10. Can we

1472
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:47,039
Here they go. Swipe to 10. Can we
 

1473
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,630
Here they go. Swipe to 10. Can we
reclaim and hold now?

1474
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640
reclaim and hold now?
 

1475
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,149
reclaim and hold now?
Watching this for a trigger long here. I

1476
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:52,159
Watching this for a trigger long here. I
 

1477
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:59,990
Watching this for a trigger long here. I
want to be very careful.

1478
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000

 

1479
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,830

Got liquidity up to 40 if they want to

1480
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
Got liquidity up to 40 if they want to
 

1481
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,430
Got liquidity up to 40 if they want to
go and attack it. There's a dip down to

1482
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
go and attack it. There's a dip down to
 

1483
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,070
go and attack it. There's a dip down to
95 possible here as well. Right at that

1484
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
95 possible here as well. Right at that
 

1485
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,430
95 possible here as well. Right at that
level. I'm interested. I'm really

1486
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,440
level. I'm interested. I'm really
 

1487
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,669
level. I'm interested. I'm really
interested here. Not pulling the trigger

1488
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:09,679
interested here. Not pulling the trigger
 

1489
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,950
interested here. Not pulling the trigger
yet. I just want to see something on the

1490
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:10,960
yet. I just want to see something on the
 

1491
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,909
yet. I just want to see something on the
tape. Show me that they're trapped.

1492
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
tape. Show me that they're trapped.
 

1493
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,750
tape. Show me that they're trapped.
We have definitely have sellers stuck at

1494
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
We have definitely have sellers stuck at
 

1495
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,750
We have definitely have sellers stuck at
the lows. I can show you this. We have

1496
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
the lows. I can show you this. We have
 

1497
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,869
the lows. I can show you this. We have
some sellers stuck down here right now

1498
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
some sellers stuck down here right now
 

1499
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,109
some sellers stuck down here right now
under 83. This is the shelf at 10s that

1500
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
under 83. This is the shelf at 10s that
 

1501
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,389
under 83. This is the shelf at 10s that
I'm watching. All right. They would need

1502
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:24,399
I'm watching. All right. They would need
 

1503
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,069
I'm watching. All right. They would need
to reclaim this for the squeeze.

1504
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:30,079

 

1505
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,470

They're trying.

1506
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:32,480
They're trying.
 

1507
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,510
They're trying.
They are trying.

1508
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
They are trying.
 

1509
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,349
They are trying.
What's the time here? 42.

1510
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:41,359

 

1511
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,669

Will I short? Uh, yeah. If there's a if

1512
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
Will I short? Uh, yeah. If there's a if
 

1513
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,750
Will I short? Uh, yeah. If there's a if
if I see buyers get stuck, like if they

1514
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:45,760
if I see buyers get stuck, like if they
 

1515
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,310
if I see buyers get stuck, like if they
defend tens, then I'm we could take a

1516
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,320
defend tens, then I'm we could take a
 

1517
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,470
defend tens, then I'm we could take a
short from 10 down to here. It's

1518
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
short from 10 down to here. It's
 

1519
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,950
short from 10 down to here. It's
possible. I'm willing to play both ways

1520
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:52,960
possible. I'm willing to play both ways
 

1521
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:09,990
possible. I'm willing to play both ways
in this right now.

1522
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,000

 

1523
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,670

We're just basing out down here at the

1524
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,680
We're just basing out down here at the
 

1525
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,310
We're just basing out down here at the
moment. We're right at the edge of the

1526
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,320
moment. We're right at the edge of the
 

1527
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,349
moment. We're right at the edge of the
developing weeks like

1528
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
developing weeks like
 

1529
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,310
developing weeks like
Dshape, let's say. We're still inside.

1530
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,320
Dshape, let's say. We're still inside.
 

1531
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,230
Dshape, let's say. We're still inside.
Remember, we're still inside yesterday,

1532
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
Remember, we're still inside yesterday,
 

1533
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,550
Remember, we're still inside yesterday,
right? Yesterday's value area high,

1534
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:24,560
right? Yesterday's value area high,
 

1535
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,310
right? Yesterday's value area high,
yesterday's value area low. We're in a

1536
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
yesterday's value area low. We're in a
 

1537
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,630
yesterday's value area low. We're in a
rotation in here. We failed to take I

1538
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
rotation in here. We failed to take I
 

1539
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,470
rotation in here. We failed to take I
would have taken the short if we did

1540
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
would have taken the short if we did
 

1541
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,030
would have taken the short if we did
this down to here. I'd be a partial out

1542
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,040
this down to here. I'd be a partial out
 

1543
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,710
this down to here. I'd be a partial out
in the midpoint. Um, this can come down

1544
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,720
in the midpoint. Um, this can come down
 

1545
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,230
in the midpoint. Um, this can come down
here, but you're getting risky. You're

1546
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,240
here, but you're getting risky. You're
 

1547
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,589
here, but you're getting risky. You're
getting risky. It's a midpoint of the

1548
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
getting risky. It's a midpoint of the
 

1549
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,150
getting risky. It's a midpoint of the
range really.

1550
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160

 

1551
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,670

We're just trading inside yesterday's

1552
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
We're just trading inside yesterday's
 

1553
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,430
We're just trading inside yesterday's
value. We expect rotation inside

1554
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,440
value. We expect rotation inside
 

1555
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,750
value. We expect rotation inside
yesterday's value.

1556
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
yesterday's value.
 

1557
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,670
yesterday's value.
All right, SPY now filled its gap,

1558
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:51,680
All right, SPY now filled its gap,
 

1559
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,230
All right, SPY now filled its gap,
drifting a little bit underneath it.

1560
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
drifting a little bit underneath it.
 

1561
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,349
drifting a little bit underneath it.
Just trying to find a bid. Watching

1562
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:55,359
Just trying to find a bid. Watching
 

1563
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,950
Just trying to find a bid. Watching
these tens again for this explosion

1564
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:56,960
these tens again for this explosion
 

1565
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,990
these tens again for this explosion
through it. If they're going to get

1566
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
through it. If they're going to get
 

1567
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,190
through it. If they're going to get
going, they're going to have to get over

1568
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
going, they're going to have to get over
 

1569
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,430
going, they're going to have to get over
tens. Otherwise, there's no trade for me

1570
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
tens. Otherwise, there's no trade for me
 

1571
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,349
tens. Otherwise, there's no trade for me
to get long into

1572
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359

 

1573
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,109

that drive up again. We're building a

1574
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:07,119
that drive up again. We're building a
 

1575
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,069
that drive up again. We're building a
big shelf up there into 10, this shelf

1576
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:10,079
big shelf up there into 10, this shelf
 

1577
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,990
big shelf up there into 10, this shelf
here. And it's mainly buyers. So, I'd

1578
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
here. And it's mainly buyers. So, I'd
 

1579
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,109
here. And it's mainly buyers. So, I'd
say buyers at 08s and 12s. So, unless

1580
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:15,119
say buyers at 08s and 12s. So, unless
 

1581
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,670
say buyers at 08s and 12s. So, unless
we're above 08s and 12, there's no long

1582
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:17,680
we're above 08s and 12, there's no long
 

1583
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,109
we're above 08s and 12, there's no long
because they keep getting stuck. If we

1584
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
because they keep getting stuck. If we
 

1585
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,030
because they keep getting stuck. If we
get above that level, then there's

1586
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
get above that level, then there's
 

1587
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,510
get above that level, then there's
probably some relief.

1588
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
probably some relief.
 

1589
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,950
probably some relief.
Not until we get up there. If we keep

1590
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
Not until we get up there. If we keep
 

1591
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,550
Not until we get up there. If we keep
rejecting it, there's an argument to

1592
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,560
rejecting it, there's an argument to
 

1593
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,790
rejecting it, there's an argument to
play a short down here. We've got point

1594
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:28,800
play a short down here. We've got point
 

1595
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,990
play a short down here. We've got point
control down here now. Big big volume

1596
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,000
control down here now. Big big volume
 

1597
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:43,109
control down here now. Big big volume
area.

1598
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119

 

1599
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,510

Do they come all the way back down here?

1600
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,520
Do they come all the way back down here?
 

1601
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,790
Do they come all the way back down here?
Getting 85s, 65s, 55s. It's the edge.

1602
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:52,800
Getting 85s, 65s, 55s. It's the edge.
 

1603
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,030
Getting 85s, 65s, 55s. It's the edge.
So, still rejecting possible short here

1604
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
So, still rejecting possible short here
 

1605
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,310
So, still rejecting possible short here
down to this if they're going to be

1606
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,320
down to this if they're going to be
 

1607
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,790
down to this if they're going to be
aggressive. Sellers again coming

1608
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
aggressive. Sellers again coming
 

1609
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,150
aggressive. Sellers again coming
aggressive at these lows. We are

1610
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,160
aggressive at these lows. We are
 

1611
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,030
aggressive at these lows. We are
developing a big big big node down here

1612
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,040
developing a big big big node down here
 

1613
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,589
developing a big big big node down here
soon. Sellers coming flying in there at

1614
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
soon. Sellers coming flying in there at
 

1615
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,550
soon. Sellers coming flying in there at
85s. Again,

1616
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:08,560
85s. Again,
 

1617
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,390
85s. Again,
they cannot make their mind up if they

1618
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:10,400
they cannot make their mind up if they
 

1619
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,390
they cannot make their mind up if they
want to save it here or not. At the

1620
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,400
want to save it here or not. At the
 

1621
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,150
want to save it here or not. At the
moment,

1622
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160

 

1623
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,589

it's the opening range low. They're

1624
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:19,599
it's the opening range low. They're
 

1625
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:27,109
it's the opening range low. They're
bidding 100 lot 55 right now.

1626
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:27,119

 

1627
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,630

where sellers last came in in this

1628
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
where sellers last came in in this
 

1629
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,310
where sellers last came in in this
balance. Still waiting to get over 10

1630
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:30,320
balance. Still waiting to get over 10
 

1631
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,630
balance. Still waiting to get over 10
for a trigger for me.

1632
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:34,640

 

1633
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,990

Right back up to the 300s.

1634
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000

 

1635
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,750

Watching this again now in case they do

1636
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
Watching this again now in case they do
 

1637
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,589
Watching this again now in case they do
a failed break of the low here and then

1638
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:43,599
a failed break of the low here and then
 

1639
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,190
a failed break of the low here and then
we go back above the 10ens and I can

1640
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,200
we go back above the 10ens and I can
 

1641
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,910
we go back above the 10ens and I can
look long.

1642
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
look long.
 

1643
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,069
look long.
Sure. I love the short hair even though

1644
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,079
Sure. I love the short hair even though
 

1645
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,950
Sure. I love the short hair even though
I seem to be caught at those tens. I'd

1646
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960
I seem to be caught at those tens. I'd
 

1647
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,390
I seem to be caught at those tens. I'd
almost rather sit out the short and

1648
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:54,400
almost rather sit out the short and
 

1649
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,349
almost rather sit out the short and
wait. I think

1650
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359

 

1651
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:14,470

what are we doing?

1652
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:14,480

 

1653
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,470

65 55. flush down sellers at these lows

1654
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
65 55. flush down sellers at these lows
 

1655
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,990
65 55. flush down sellers at these lows
again. They're trying to fill this 55.

1656
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,000
again. They're trying to fill this 55.
 

1657
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,030
again. They're trying to fill this 55.
It's 100 lot 55.

1658
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
It's 100 lot 55.
 

1659
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,550
It's 100 lot 55.
Some absorption there. It's kind of a

1660
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
Some absorption there. It's kind of a
 

1661
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,310
Some absorption there. It's kind of a
weird area to absorb. I'm not really

1662
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
weird area to absorb. I'm not really
 

1663
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,069
weird area to absorb. I'm not really
sure what they're trying to pivot off

1664
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
sure what they're trying to pivot off
 

1665
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,510
sure what they're trying to pivot off
other than the hourly. Um this can fill

1666
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,520
other than the hourly. Um this can fill
 

1667
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,589
other than the hourly. Um this can fill
that hole imbalance down to 96s at this

1668
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
that hole imbalance down to 96s at this
 

1669
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,510
that hole imbalance down to 96s at this
point, but you've just seen another 55

1670
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
point, but you've just seen another 55
 

1671
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,109
point, but you've just seen another 55
lot get stuck down here at the lows.

1672
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
lot get stuck down here at the lows.
 

1673
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,349
lot get stuck down here at the lows.
They should trade lower, but they are

1674
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
They should trade lower, but they are
 

1675
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,349
They should trade lower, but they are
starting to be very aggressive down here

1676
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,359
starting to be very aggressive down here
 

1677
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,430
starting to be very aggressive down here
and we're not moving lower. It's worth

1678
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:43,440
and we're not moving lower. It's worth
 

1679
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,950
and we're not moving lower. It's worth
noting,

1680
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:44,960
noting,
 

1681
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,550
noting,
right? They're being very aggressive

1682
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,560
right? They're being very aggressive
 

1683
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,710
right? They're being very aggressive
down here and we're not able to move

1684
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
down here and we're not able to move
 

1685
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,950
down here and we're not able to move
lower. We can see this is all red. All

1686
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:50,960
lower. We can see this is all red. All
 

1687
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,270
lower. We can see this is all red. All
this paint is red. It's all sellers. We

1688
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,280
this paint is red. It's all sellers. We
 

1689
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,630
this paint is red. It's all sellers. We
keep absorbing this, they're going to

1690
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:54,640
keep absorbing this, they're going to
 

1691
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,750
keep absorbing this, they're going to
get themselves caught.

1692
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
get themselves caught.
 

1693
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,870
get themselves caught.
Their target will be 220s right now.

1694
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:00,880
Their target will be 220s right now.
 

1695

It's the 50s again. They're trying to

1698
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:05,520
It's the 50s again. They're trying to
 

1699
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,870
It's the 50s again. They're trying to

Big sellers getting caught down there so
 

1707
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,349
Big sellers getting caught down there so
far. More absorption. So we will be

1708
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:21,359
far. More absorption. So we will be
 

1709
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,670
far. More absorption. So we will be
watching now 90s and then same levels

1710
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
watching now 90s and then same levels
 

1711

1729
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,030
far, rejecting just into this little
shelf here. If we get above this and

1730
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,040
shelf here. If we get above this and
 

1731
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,190
shelf here. If we get above this and
hold, I will add long for a squeeze up.

1732
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,200
hold, I will add long for a squeeze up.
 

1733

Point of control is now shifted up here
 

1747
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,109
Point of control is now shifted up here
as well. So, we need to hold a bid here

1748
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
as well. So, we need to hold a bid here
 

1749
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,910
as well. So, we need to hold a bid here
or I'm going to trim 90% of this. I want

1750
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
or I'm going to trim 90% of this. I want
 

1751
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,190
or I'm going to trim 90% of this. I want
to hold versus 300. Now,

1752
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,200
to hold versus 300. Now,
 

1753
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,030
to hold versus 300. Now,
we can fill all the way up to 50 here.

peeling some off here and trying to get
 

1785
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,270
peeling some off here and trying to get
a runner to go now to see if we can get

1786
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,280
a runner to go now to see if we can get
 

1787
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,190
a runner to go now to see if we can get
up to 40s and 50s and then all the way

1788
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,200
up to 40s and 50s and then all the way
 

1789
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,670
up to 40s and 50s and then all the way
up here into 60s. And if we get through

1790
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:05,680
up here into 60s. And if we get through
 

1791
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,270
up here into 60s. And if we get through
point of control from yesterday, I'll be

1792
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,280
point of control from yesterday, I'll be
 

1793
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,589
point of control from yesterday, I'll be
looking for value area high. Already

1794
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:09,599
looking for value area high. Already
 

1795
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,069
looking for value area high. Already
trimming a lot off there, folks. Here we

1796
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:12,079
trimming a lot off there, folks. Here we
 

1797
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,230
trimming a lot off there, folks. Here we
go. So, looking for those shorts down in

1798
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,240
go. So, looking for those shorts down in
 

1799
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,630
go. So, looking for those shorts down in
that level. Uh shorts to get stuck down

1800
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
that level. Uh shorts to get stuck down
 

1801
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,309
that level. Uh shorts to get stuck down
in that level like we talked about. We

1802
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
in that level like we talked about. We
 

1803
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,710
in that level like we talked about. We
saw shorts get stuck on the tape right

1804
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
saw shorts get stuck on the tape right
 

1805
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,550
saw shorts get stuck on the tape right
down here at these lows. They got very

1806
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
down here at these lows. They got very
 

1807
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,670
down here at these lows. They got very
aggressive. Kept saying they're getting

1808
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:23,680
aggressive. Kept saying they're getting
 

1809
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,190
aggressive. Kept saying they're getting
very aggressive down here. There's the

1810
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,200
very aggressive down here. There's the
 

1811
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,030
very aggressive down here. There's the
turnaround in delta. There's them

1812
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
turnaround in delta. There's them
 

1813
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,550
turnaround in delta. There's them
getting trapped on the expansion. That's

1814
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,560
getting trapped on the expansion. That's
 

1815
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,910
getting trapped on the expansion. That's
what I was looking for. We use their

1816
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:29,920
what I was looking for. We use their
 

1817
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,230
what I was looking for. We use their
pain to move higher. We trim some now.

1818
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
pain to move higher. We trim some now.
 

1819
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,910
pain to move higher. We trim some now.
We trim a lot now. And we wait and see

1820
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
We trim a lot now. And we wait and see
 

1821
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,270
We trim a lot now. And we wait and see
now if we're really going to get going.

1822
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,280
now if we're really going to get going.
 

1823
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,870
now if we're really going to get going.
We're in a range rotation. It's why I

1824
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
We're in a range rotation. It's why I
 

1825
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,150
We're in a range rotation. It's why I
didn't want to short down here. We're in

1826
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
didn't want to short down here. We're in
 

1827
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,670
didn't want to short down here. We're in
a range rotation. They could have

1828
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
a range rotation. They could have
 

1829
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,430
a range rotation. They could have
technically come all the way down here

1830
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
technically come all the way down here
 

1831
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,950
technically come all the way down here
and bid down here. And we could have

1832
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:42,960
and bid down here. And we could have
 

1833
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,390
and bid down here. And we could have
faded if they got up to there. We

1834
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:44,400
faded if they got up to there. We
 

1835
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,870
faded if they got up to there. We
couldn't quite get up into there. Do not

1836
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:46,880
couldn't quite get up into there. Do not
 

1837
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,630
couldn't quite get up into there. Do not
be entering a new money long in the

1838
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
be entering a new money long in the
 

1839
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,230
be entering a new money long in the
midpoint of this range. If we think

1840
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
midpoint of this range. If we think
 

1841
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,990
midpoint of this range. If we think
about yesterday's value, right, low to

1842
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
about yesterday's value, right, low to
 

1843
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,069
about yesterday's value, right, low to
high, do not be starting to try and get

1844
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
high, do not be starting to try and get
 

1845
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,670
high, do not be starting to try and get
a new position here. You're right at the

1846
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680
a new position here. You're right at the
 

1847
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,990
a new position here. You're right at the
midpoint, right? We're runners only.

1848
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
midpoint, right? We're runners only.
 

1849
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,470
midpoint, right? We're runners only.
Now, if we hold this node, great. If we

1850
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,480
Now, if we hold this node, great. If we
 

1851
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,910
Now, if we hold this node, great. If we
don't hold this node, out on the

1852
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
don't hold this node, out on the
 

1853
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,190
don't hold this node, out on the
runners.

1854
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200

 

1855
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,270

No, I can't. Sh. Like, you've got to

1856
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,280
No, I can't. Sh. Like, you've got to
 

1857
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,270
No, I can't. Sh. Like, you've got to
understand,

1858
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:13,280
understand,
 

1859
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,589
understand,
guys. You've got to understand when I

1860
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:15,599
guys. You've got to understand when I
 

1861
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,390
guys. You've got to understand when I
enter off a trap, when I see it, I just

1862
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:18,400
enter off a trap, when I see it, I just
 

1863
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,150
enter off a trap, when I see it, I just
have to get in. I can't say the price. I

1864
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
have to get in. I can't say the price. I
 

1865
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,910
have to get in. I can't say the price. I
don't have [\h__\h] time. It's not that I

1866
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:23,920
don't have [\h__\h] time. It's not that I
 

1867
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,910
don't have [\h__\h] time. It's not that I
don't want to. This is very different to

1868
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
don't want to. This is very different to
 

1869
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,309
don't want to. This is very different to
like I'm waiting for a pullback and a

1870
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,319
like I'm waiting for a pullback and a
 

1871
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,670
like I'm waiting for a pullback and a
hold. If I tell you if we break 90, I'm

1872
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
hold. If I tell you if we break 90, I'm
 

1873
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,390
hold. If I tell you if we break 90, I'm
looking to get in. If we base over 10,

1874
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,400
looking to get in. If we base over 10,
 

1875
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,069
looking to get in. If we base over 10,
I'm looking to add. That's me telling

1876
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
I'm looking to add. That's me telling
 

1877
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,390
I'm looking to add. That's me telling
you where I'm trying to get in. But here

1878
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,400
you where I'm trying to get in. But here
 

1879
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,950
you where I'm trying to get in. But here
we go, folks.

1880
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:40,960
we go, folks.
 

1881
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,870
we go, folks.
What a beauty. All right, let's see. So,

1882
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:42,880
What a beauty. All right, let's see. So,
 

1883
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,990
What a beauty. All right, let's see. So,
we're going to try and peel a little bit

1884
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
we're going to try and peel a little bit
 

1885
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,230
we're going to try and peel a little bit
off now into here with VWAP and previous

1886
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,240
off now into here with VWAP and previous
 

1887
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,950
off now into here with VWAP and previous
day close. This level here is huge,

1888
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:48,960
day close. This level here is huge,
 

1889
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,630
day close. This level here is huge,
right? This is current developing fair

1890
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
right? This is current developing fair
 

1891
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,870
right? This is current developing fair
value and previous day, right? If we get

1892
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880
value and previous day, right? If we get
 

1893
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,950
value and previous day, right? If we get
through that, I think we can get up into

1894
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
through that, I think we can get up into
 

1895
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,190
through that, I think we can get up into
here.

1896
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,200

 

1897
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,550

I wish I could tell you all the time,

1898
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
I wish I could tell you all the time,
 

1899
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,150
I wish I could tell you all the time,
sharers, it's it's just like when I'm

1900
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,160
sharers, it's it's just like when I'm
 

1901
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,910
sharers, it's it's just like when I'm
watching the tape move, I'm literally

1902
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:03,920
watching the tape move, I'm literally
 

1903
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,230
watching the tape move, I'm literally
having to play of people's pain right

1904
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
having to play of people's pain right
 

1905
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,550
having to play of people's pain right
now. Right. I'm looking for this and

1906
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:08,560
now. Right. I'm looking for this and
 

1907
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,710
now. Right. I'm looking for this and
ultimately up here if we can get it. All

1908
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:10,720
ultimately up here if we can get it. All
 

1909
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,550
ultimately up here if we can get it. All
right. That would be I don't know how

1910
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:12,560
right. That would be I don't know how
 

1911
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,910
right. That would be I don't know how
many points that is. Did it just tell

1912
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:13,920
many points that is. Did it just tell
 

1913
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,630
many points that is. Did it just tell
me? 144. But we're looking gap. So the

1914
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:16,640
me? 144. But we're looking gap. So the
 

1915
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,150
me? 144. But we're looking gap. So the
gap is here. We're looking I'm going to

1916
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,160
gap is here. We're looking I'm going to
 

1917
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,870
gap is here. We're looking I'm going to
trim a lot off here into 60s and 70s. A

1918
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:20,880
trim a lot off here into 60s and 70s. A
 

1919
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,309
trim a lot off here into 60s and 70s. A
lot off here.

1920
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319

 

1921
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,630

Don't want to get caught in a refresh. I

1922
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:26,640
Don't want to get caught in a refresh. I
 

1923
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,829
Don't want to get caught in a refresh. I
tell you what, I'm going to remove this

1924
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
tell you what, I'm going to remove this
 

1925
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,910
tell you what, I'm going to remove this
gray box now because we traded under and

1926
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:29,920
gray box now because we traded under and
 

1927
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,069
gray box now because we traded under and
over it. So here. And then if we get

1928
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:32,079
over it. So here. And then if we get
 

1929
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,750
over it. So here. And then if we get
really lucky, we'll get up here, folks.

1930
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
really lucky, we'll get up here, folks.
 

1931
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,349
really lucky, we'll get up here, folks.
But this this is a good area to be

1932
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:35,359
But this this is a good area to be
 

1933
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,950
But this this is a good area to be
peeling some off. We can look at this

1934
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:36,960
peeling some off. We can look at this
 

1935
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,510
peeling some off. We can look at this
node. All right. This is where buyers

1936
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:39,520
node. All right. This is where buyers
 

1937
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,349
node. All right. This is where buyers
got stuck this morning. We're repricing

1938
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:41,359
got stuck this morning. We're repricing
 

1939
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,510
got stuck this morning. We're repricing
to that. We're in thin volume. If we get

1940
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:43,520
to that. We're in thin volume. If we get
 

1941
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,030
to that. We're in thin volume. If we get
over that and find acceptance, we're

1942
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
over that and find acceptance, we're
 

1943
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:53,190
over that and find acceptance, we're
going to come up for previous day.

1944
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,200

 

1945
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,109

Here we go, folks. Getting ready to

1946
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
Here we go, folks. Getting ready to
 

1947
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,349
Here we go, folks. Getting ready to
peel.

1948
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:01,359

 

1949
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,670

Refresh setting here.

1950
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
Refresh setting here.
 

1951
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,750
Refresh setting here.
Nice on ES. Really good.

1952
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:07,760
Nice on ES. Really good.
 

1953
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,190
Nice on ES. Really good.
ES can take out the highs. That would be

1954
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,200
ES can take out the highs. That would be
 

1955
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,030
ES can take out the highs. That would be
good. Here we go, folks.

1956
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040

 

1957
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,030

TP. All right, runners. Now, let's see

1958
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,040
TP. All right, runners. Now, let's see
 

1959
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,270
TP. All right, runners. Now, let's see
if we can go to value high from previous

1960
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
if we can go to value high from previous
 

1961
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,030
if we can go to value high from previous
day. All right, so this was our main TP.

1962
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,040
day. All right, so this was our main TP.
 

1963
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,950
day. All right, so this was our main TP.
Like I said, previous day point of

1964
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:20,960
Like I said, previous day point of
 

1965
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,710
Like I said, previous day point of
control, current developing point of

1966
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:22,720
control, current developing point of
 

1967
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,069
control, current developing point of
control. If we're lucky, we're going to

1968
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
control. If we're lucky, we're going to
 

1969
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,230
control. If we're lucky, we're going to
get over here, up to here. If we get

1970
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,240
get over here, up to here. If we get
 

1971
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,309
get over here, up to here. If we get
acceptance over this, we can look for a

1972
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
acceptance over this, we can look for a
 

1973
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,550
acceptance over this, we can look for a
squeeze up. There might well be a bull

1974
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:30,560
squeeze up. There might well be a bull
 

1975
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,150
squeeze up. There might well be a bull
trap up here. So, I want to be careful

1976
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
trap up here. So, I want to be careful
 

1977
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:41,990
trap up here. So, I want to be careful
about that move.

1978
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000

 

1979
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,349

to get a monster here. All right, we're
 

1999
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,630
to get a monster here. All right, we're
looking for up here for an XTP. We might

2000
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:00,640
looking for up here for an XTP. We might
 

2001
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,710
looking for up here for an XTP. We might
as well hold a little piece past this.

2002
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:02,720
as well hold a little piece past this.
 

2003
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,270
as well hold a little piece past this.
But if we can get up here into 420s,

2004
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
But if we can get up here into 420s,
 

2005
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,870
But if we can get up here into 420s,
previous day value area high, previous

2006
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
previous day value area high, previous
 

2007
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,510
previous day value area high, previous
week value area high, we want to be, I

2008
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
week value area high, we want to be, I
 

2009
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,030
week value area high, we want to be, I
would say, at least 80% out into here.

2010
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,040
would say, at least 80% out into here.
 

2011
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,349
would say, at least 80% out into here.
And we can read if they base above.

2012
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:15,359
And we can read if they base above.
 

2013
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,510
And we can read if they base above.
Okay. But we can they can set they can

2014
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
Okay. But we can they can set they can
 

2015
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,589
Okay. But we can they can set they can
set a bull trap in this area, which I'm

2016
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:19,599
set a bull trap in this area, which I'm
 

2017
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,230
set a bull trap in this area, which I'm
very very aware of.

2018
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:24,240

 

2019
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,550

stepped on the tape. We should trade him
 

2025
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,390
stepped on the tape. We should trade him
through him really, but you can peel

2026
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:34,400
through him really, but you can peel
 

2027
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,550
through him really, but you can peel
some here. I'm looking for 420 now.

2028
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:40,560

 

2029
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,230

2035
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,550
high. Spying to previous day high. So,
we're looking for them to spike above.

00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:10,960
Buy is definitely getting a little bit
 

2059
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,309
Buy is definitely getting a little bit
caught here at 400. We need to see

caught here at 400. We need to see
 

2061

expansion through 400. We can see on the

2062
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
expansion through 400. We can see on the
 

2063
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,829
expansion through 400. We can see on the
tape here. There are some buyers caught

2064
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
tape here. There are some buyers caught
 

2065
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,470
tape here. There are some buyers caught
up here. We have a spike here. We need

00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,480
up here. We have a spike here. We need
 

2067
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,390

to get over this spike here. This 400.
 

2069
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,670
to get over this spike here. This 400.
It's where the buyers are caught over

2070
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:21,680
It's where the buyers are caught over
 

2071
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,630
It's where the buyers are caught over
400. We can come and take out 420, 425,

2072
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:24,640
400. We can come and take out 420, 425,
 

2073
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,710

getting caught up here right now. We do
 

2077
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,630
getting caught up here right now. We do
not add up here, right? The ad was over

2078
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:30,640
not add up here, right? The ad was over
 

2079
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,309
not add up here, right? The ad was over
tens, whatever I said it was, tens or

2080
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:32,319
tens, whatever I said it was, tens or
 

2081
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,550
tens, whatever I said it was, tens or
twelves. That was the ad. So, we were

2082
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:34,560
twelves. That was the ad. So, we were
 

2083
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,190
twelves. That was the ad. So, we were
long, we were adding, and we are selling

2084
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,200
long, we were adding, and we are selling
 

2085
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,349
long, we were adding, and we are selling
and selling and selling and selling. And

and selling and selling and selling. And
 

2087
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,190
and selling and selling and selling. And
then hopefully we get up into here with

2088
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
then hopefully we get up into here with
 

2089
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,950
then hopefully we get up into here with
a runner. Here we go. Four. Here we go.

Let's get the 420s.

2092
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,200
Let's get the 420s.
 

2093
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,270
Let's get the 420s.
Come on, baby. Don't get trapped here at

Come on, baby. Don't get trapped here at
 

2095
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,390
Come on, baby. Don't get trapped here at
400. We've taken out that 100 lot. 400.

2096
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:50,400
400. We've taken out that 100 lot. 400.

400. We've taken out that 100 lot. 400.
177 lot, actually, to be exact. We need

2098
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:53,599
177 lot, actually, to be exact. We need
 

2099
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,829
177 lot, actually, to be exact. We need
to get over that player.

2100
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
to get over that player.
 

2101
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,030
to get over that player.
We need to get over that player

We need to get over that player
 

2103
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,309
We need to get over that player
otherwise this buyer up here is going to

2104
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:58,319
otherwise this buyer up here is going to
 

2105
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:05,829
otherwise this buyer up here is going to
get himself hurt.

2106
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:05,839

 

2107
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,990

Any new long entry from here? Um I would

2108
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
Any new long entry from here? Um I would
 

2109
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,910
Any new long entry from here? Um I would
say no. Uh I would say no. I would say

2110
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:09,920
say no. Uh I would say no. I would say
 

2111
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,150
say no. Uh I would say no. I would say
the only long entry confirmation now

2112
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,160
the only long entry confirmation now
 

2113
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,309
the only long entry confirmation now
right would be if we got above all of

2114
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
right would be if we got above all of
 

2115
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,390
right would be if we got above all of
this and we turned this into some form

2116
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
this and we turned this into some form
 

2117
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,950
this and we turned this into some form
of demand for that reach up all the way

2118
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:18,960
of demand for that reach up all the way
 

2119
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,910
of demand for that reach up all the way
up to 800. You must know that this area

2120
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:21,920
up to 800. You must know that this area
 

2121
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,790
up to 800. You must know that this area
here is a prime position for them to set

2122
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
here is a prime position for them to set
 

2123
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,190
here is a prime position for them to set
a bull trap, right? It is a prime bull

2124
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:27,200
a bull trap, right? It is a prime bull
 

2125
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,230
a bull trap, right? It is a prime bull
bull trap position. So, or I would

2126
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,240
bull trap position. So, or I would
 

2127
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,550
bull trap position. So, or I would
manage that accordingly. Why? You might

2128
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:32,560
manage that accordingly. Why? You might
 

2129
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,069
manage that accordingly. Why? You might
ask why. We talked about it in the

2130
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,079
ask why. We talked about it in the
 

2131
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,190
ask why. We talked about it in the
morning show if you were here early

2132
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
morning show if you were here early
 

2133
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,750
morning show if you were here early
enough. We think about the hourly. All

2134
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:37,760
enough. We think about the hourly. All
 

2135
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,430
enough. We think about the hourly. All
right, if you have swing stops here,

2136
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:39,440
right, if you have swing stops here,
 

2137
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,870
right, if you have swing stops here,
which is probably what we want to try

2138
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:40,880
which is probably what we want to try
 

2139
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,790
which is probably what we want to try
and attack if possible. This was the

2140
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:42,800
and attack if possible. This was the
 

2141
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,230
and attack if possible. This was the
pullback. All right, here's the move.

2142
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,240
pullback. All right, here's the move.
 

2143
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,550
pullback. All right, here's the move.
Doom doom doom. Here's the second leg

2144
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:46,560
Doom doom doom. Here's the second leg
 

2145
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,790
Doom doom doom. Here's the second leg
pullback and undercut trap under there

2146
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:48,800
pullback and undercut trap under there
 

2147
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,270
pullback and undercut trap under there

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
here. It could have been here between
 

2223
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,430

these gray boxes. It will ended up being

00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:19,440
these gray boxes. It will ended up being
 

2225
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,510
these gray boxes. It will ended up being
there. I risk according to where I'm

2226
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:21,520
there. I risk according to where I'm
 

2227
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,270
there. I risk according to where I'm
wrong. So, if I'm long here, I have to

2228
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280

2229
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,750

00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:25,760
risk there. And I'm adding here because
 

2231

now I know I've been proven right

2233
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,950
now I know I've been proven right
because now they're all caught and I'm

00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:28,960
because now they're all caught and I'm

right. So, your risk is about the size

2238
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:33,359
right. So, your risk is about the size
 

2239
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,390
right. So, your risk is about the size
of where that trade is no longer valid.

2240
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,400
of where that trade is no longer valid.

2263
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,670

2264
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
to be refreshed.
 

2265
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,349

Okay. So, now you'd be looking for a

2266
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
Okay. So, now you'd be looking for a
 

2267
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,109
Okay. So, now you'd be looking for a
hold over 70s. I'm probably going to cut

2268
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:11,119
hold over 70s. I'm probably going to cut
 

2269
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,030
hold over 70s. I'm probably going to cut
the runner here if it doesn't help this.

2270
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,040
the runner here if it doesn't help this.
 

2271
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,030
the runner here if it doesn't help this.
So, if they're going to complete this

2272
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
So, if they're going to complete this
 

2273
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,790
So, if they're going to complete this
move, ES, by the way, like we said, ES

2274
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
move, ES, by the way, like we said, ES
 

2275
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,230
move, ES, by the way, like we said, ES
and SPY took previous day high and

2276
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
and SPY took previous day high and
 

2277
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,309
and SPY took previous day high and
failed. So, they did the liquidity take.

2278
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:20,319
failed. So, they did the liquidity take.
 

2279
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,710
failed. So, they did the liquidity take.
We are looking for this. ES has done

2280
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:22,720
We are looking for this. ES has done
 

2281
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,950
We are looking for this. ES has done
this and failed. So, ES took that

2282
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
this and failed. So, ES took that
 

2283
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,030
this and failed. So, ES took that
liquidity like we said. It might well

2284
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:27,040
liquidity like we said. It might well
 

2285
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,390
liquidity like we said. It might well
take out the highs and pull back

2286
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:28,400
take out the highs and pull back
 

2287
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,790
take out the highs and pull back
afterwards. Run the stops.

2288
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:30,800
afterwards. Run the stops.
 

2289
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,349
afterwards. Run the stops.
So, we need to hold this now for a

2290
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
So, we need to hold this now for a
 

2291
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,549
So, we need to hold this now for a
chance back up. Otherwise, there's a

2292
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:34,559
chance back up. Otherwise, there's a
 

2293
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:35,910
chance back up. Otherwise, there's a
full collapse in here and I will not

2294
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:35,920
full collapse in here and I will not
 

2295
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,349
full collapse in here and I will not
hold for that full collapse. We'll just

2296
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:37,359
hold for that full collapse. We'll just
 

2297
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:47,829
hold for that full collapse. We'll just
lock in.

2298
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:47,839

 

2299
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,270

You know you're doing right when your

2377
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,510
Well, one would be the minimum. Um, it
all depends on the monitor size, right?

2378
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,520
all depends on the monitor size, right?
 

2379

2396
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
my second day watching you. Yeah, I
 

2397
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,710
my second day watching you. Yeah, I
mean, that's kind of what we were

2398
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
mean, that's kind of what we were
 

2399
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,549
mean, that's kind of what we were
looking at down here, right? If you

2400
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
looking at down here, right? If you
 

2401
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,390
looking at down here, right? If you
think of what we did into GlobeEx, this

2402
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:48,400
think of what we did into GlobeEx, this
 

2403
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,910
think of what we did into GlobeEx, this
this pivot down here, where did they

2404
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
this pivot down here, where did they
 

2405
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,349
this pivot down here, where did they
trap the shorts? Where did breakout

2406
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
trap the shorts? Where did breakout
 

2407
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,670
trap the shorts? Where did breakout
shorts come in? Breakout shorts came in

2408
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680
shorts come in? Breakout shorts came in
 

2409
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,109
shorts come in? Breakout shorts came in
here. So everyone tried to sell the

2410
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
here. So everyone tried to sell the
 

2411
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,950
here. So everyone tried to sell the
market there. They got caught. We used

2412
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:56,960
market there. They got caught. We used
 

2413
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,710
market there. They got caught. We used
them to go back upside. Why have we got

2414
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:58,720
them to go back upside. Why have we got
 

2415
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,309
them to go back upside. Why have we got
stuck up here? Well, if we look at the

2416
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:00,319
stuck up here? Well, if we look at the
 

2417
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,030
stuck up here? Well, if we look at the
spy and ES, all right, they've taken the

2418
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
spy and ES, all right, they've taken the
 

2419
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,430
spy and ES, all right, they've taken the
liquidity of the high and then failed.

2420
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:05,440
liquidity of the high and then failed.
 

2421
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,670
liquidity of the high and then failed.
So here is previous day high. They snap

2422
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:07,680
So here is previous day high. They snap
 

2423
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,109
So here is previous day high. They snap
it and they come back down. All right,

2424
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
it and they come back down. All right,
 

2425
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,069
it and they come back down. All right,
trade inside unless they catch a bid.

2426
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:12,079
trade inside unless they catch a bid.
 

2427
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,829
trade inside unless they catch a bid.
So it's kind of what we're doing. Um,

2428
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:13,839
So it's kind of what we're doing. Um,
 

2429
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:17,190
So it's kind of what we're doing. Um,
but we are aware of uh levels beyond

2430
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
but we are aware of uh levels beyond
 

2431
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,349
but we are aware of uh levels beyond
those pivots of just highs and lows. We

2432
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:19,359
those pivots of just highs and lows. We
 

2433
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,270
those pivots of just highs and lows. We
have to also be aware of where volume

2434
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:21,280
have to also be aware of where volume
 

2435
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,349
have to also be aware of where volume
is. We're basing out all right here. We

2436
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:23,359
is. We're basing out all right here. We
 

2437
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:24,790
is. We're basing out all right here. We
just need to hold this. I'd say any

2438
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
just need to hold this. I'd say any
 

2439
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,190
just need to hold this. I'd say any
break underneath 85, I'm not interested

2440
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
break underneath 85, I'm not interested
 

2441
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,589
break underneath 85, I'm not interested
anymore, right? If they because I don't

2442
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
anymore, right? If they because I don't
 

2443
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,910
anymore, right? If they because I don't
want to give back to 60s and then 50s

2444
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:31,920
want to give back to 60s and then 50s
 

2445
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,190
want to give back to 60s and then 50s
and then maybe the whole thing back

2446
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200
and then maybe the whole thing back
 

2447
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,710
and then maybe the whole thing back
because this is a giant squeeze. So, we

2448
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:34,720
because this is a giant squeeze. So, we
 

2449
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,190
because this is a giant squeeze. So, we
just missed here. We I reckon we take

2450
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,200
just missed here. We I reckon we take
 

2451
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,630

2452
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:38,640

2453
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,270
this out. It's just Do they need a
deeper pullback first? I reckon we will

2454
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,280
deeper pullback first? I reckon we will
 

2455
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:52,790
deeper pullback first? I reckon we will
take all this out.

2456
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800

 

2457
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,309

Uh, sorry guys, trying to catch up with

2458
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:54,319
Uh, sorry guys, trying to catch up with
 

2459
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,510
Uh, sorry guys, trying to catch up with
what you're saying. Have you ever

2460
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:55,520
what you're saying. Have you ever
 

2461
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,510
what you're saying. Have you ever
thought over short-term participants and

2462
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:57,520
thought over short-term participants and
 

2463
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,190
thought over short-term participants and
long-term participants that might not

2464
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,200
long-term participants that might not
 

2465
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,150
long-term participants that might not
care about all the traps? Uh, everyone

2466
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,160
care about all the traps? Uh, everyone
 

2467
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,710
care about all the traps? Uh, everyone
cares about traps, especially

2468
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:04,720
cares about traps, especially
 

2469
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,030
cares about traps, especially
uh big participants, and that's all that

2470
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,040
uh big participants, and that's all that
 

2471
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,390
uh big participants, and that's all that
really matters. It doesn't matter if

2472
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:08,400
really matters. It doesn't matter if
 

2473
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,870
really matters. It doesn't matter if
it's the time frame it's on. The big

2474
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:10,880
it's the time frame it's on. The big
 

2475
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,950
it's the time frame it's on. The big
participants need the traps to get their

2476
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
participants need the traps to get their
 

2477
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,630
participants need the traps to get their
liquidity into the market. Otherwise,

2478
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:14,640
liquidity into the market. Otherwise,
 

2479
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,069
liquidity into the market. Otherwise,
they can't get their liquidity into the

2480
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
they can't get their liquidity into the
 

2481
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,990
they can't get their liquidity into the
market because they're too big, right?

2482
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,000
market because they're too big, right?
 

2483
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,430
market because they're too big, right?
So, they need someone the other side of

2484
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:19,440
So, they need someone the other side of
 

2485
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,030
So, they need someone the other side of
it. So, that it does it really does

2486
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040
it. So, that it does it really does
 

2487
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,950
it. So, that it does it really does
matter. That's what why and how the

2488
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960
matter. That's what why and how the
 

2489
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,990
matter. That's what why and how the
market moves. Do you ever take your I

2490
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,000
market moves. Do you ever take your I
 

2491
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,270
market moves. Do you ever take your I
don't miss that. Ever take your flow

2492
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:27,280
don't miss that. Ever take your flow
 

2493
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,589
don't miss that. Ever take your flow
zone indicator into account? Yeah, I do

00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:29,599
zone indicator into account? Yeah, I do
 

2495
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,190
zone indicator into account? Yeah, I do
when we're in a trending day. Right now,

2496
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200
when we're in a trending day. Right now,
 

2497
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,549
when we're in a trending day. Right now,
we're in a ranging date. So, it offered

2498
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
we're in a ranging date. So, it offered
 

2499
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,750
we're in a ranging date. So, it offered
you a great sell there, but when we are

2500
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:35,760
you a great sell there, but when we are
 

2501
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,910
you a great sell there, but when we are
going sideways like this, okay, you can

2502
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:37,920
going sideways like this, okay, you can
 

2503
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,910
going sideways like this, okay, you can
scalp some of these moves, but this is a

2504
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:39,920
scalp some of these moves, but this is a
 

2505
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,549
scalp some of these moves, but this is a
sideways moving market. The flow zones

2506
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
sideways moving market. The flow zones
 

2507
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,109
sideways moving market. The flow zones
come into real good use when we're in an

2508
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
come into real good use when we're in an
 

2509
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,710
come into real good use when we're in an
expansive market. All right, like

2510
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:46,720
expansive market. All right, like
 

2511
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,349
expansive market. All right, like
yesterday should have just stuck all the

2512
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:49,359
yesterday should have just stuck all the
 

2513
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,630
yesterday should have just stuck all the
way up. There's your first sell. There's

2514
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:50,640
way up. There's your first sell. There's
 

2515
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,549
way up. There's your first sell. There's
the buyback. This is a nice market out

2516
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
the buyback. This is a nice market out
 

2517
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,030
the buyback. This is a nice market out
of range. This is a market in range.

2518
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,040
of range. This is a market in range.
 

2519
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,190
of range. This is a market in range.
This will just chop. So, I would say if

2520
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
This will just chop. So, I would say if
 

2521
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,549
This will just chop. So, I would say if
you take the indicators on this,

2522
00:54:58,549 --> 00:54:58,559
you take the indicators on this,
 

2523
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,670
you take the indicators on this,
sometimes you might be too late.

2524
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:01,680
sometimes you might be too late.
 

2525
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,670
sometimes you might be too late.
We're in a rotation, right?

2526
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:07,680

 

2527
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,670

What about the triangle signals buy and

2528
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:09,680
What about the triangle signals buy and
 

2529
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,870
What about the triangle signals buy and
sell on the chart? That's the same

2530
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
sell on the chart? That's the same
 

2531
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,150
sell on the chart? That's the same
thing. But the buy is going to come

2532
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:12,160
thing. But the buy is going to come
 

2533
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,349
thing. But the buy is going to come
late. Now, this is what I'm saying.

2534
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:13,359
late. Now, this is what I'm saying.
 

2535
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,349
late. Now, this is what I'm saying.
Because we're in a ranging market, it's

00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:21,829
Because we're in a ranging market, it's
going to come late.

think about now whether we base and hold
 

2597
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,109

will look something like this. A trap

2665
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,309

I started using VWAP. Would you say it's

2666
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:06,319
I started using VWAP. Would you say it's
 

2667
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,910
I started using VWAP. Would you say it's
likely to come back to that is what I'm

2668
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:07,920
likely to come back to that is what I'm
 

2669
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,270
likely to come back to that is what I'm
thinking. Uh if we do the initial

2670
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:09,280
thinking. Uh if we do the initial
 

2671
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,950
thinking. Uh if we do the initial
balance trade maybe. We'll see.

2672
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960

 

2673
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,150

We'll see.

2674
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,160
We'll see.

Tempted to add short here. I wouldn't be
 

2677

Is my previous day value high based on

2686
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,040
Is my previous day value high based on
 

2687
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,710
Is my previous day value high based on
the New York session? Yes, just New York

2688
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:30,720
the New York session? Yes, just New York

2690
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,480
session, mate. Any spoofers? Uh no, not
 

2691
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,870
session, mate. Any spoofers? Uh no, not
yet. Everyone's been getting filled. We

2692
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:36,880
yet. Everyone's been getting filled. We
 

2693
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,950
yet. Everyone's been getting filled. We
did just hit a very, very big key level.

2694
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:38,960
did just hit a very, very big key level.
 

2695
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,710
did just hit a very, very big key level.
So, it's possible. I'm out of this now,

2696
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:40,720
So, it's possible. I'm out of this now,
 

2697
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,230
So, it's possible. I'm out of this now,
folks. It's possible they want to

2698
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
folks. It's possible they want to
 

2699
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,150
folks. It's possible they want to
revisit this. This is thin. Possible

2700
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:44,160
revisit this. This is thin. Possible
 

2701
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,829
revisit this. This is thin. Possible
they want to come back down here and

2702
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:45,839
they want to come back down here and
 

2703
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,270
they want to come back down here and
then make their decision. But we did

2704
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
then make their decision. But we did
 

2705
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,030
then make their decision. But we did
just take all that liquidity. How we act

2706
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:49,040
just take all that liquidity. How we act
 

2707
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,390
just take all that liquidity. How we act
here then becomes key. If they lose

2708
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
here then becomes key. If they lose
 

2709
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:57,270
here then becomes key. If they lose
this, that's your rotation again.

2710
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:57,280

 

2711
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,589

Alex, what do you mean about a squeeze

2712
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
Alex, what do you mean about a squeeze
 

2713
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,910
Alex, what do you mean about a squeeze
when it's when they get liquidity off a

2714
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:01,920
when it's when they get liquidity off a
 

2715
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,510
when it's when they get liquidity off a
low or a high and then move in the other

2716
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:03,520
low or a high and then move in the other
 

2717
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,670
low or a high and then move in the other
direction? No, it's when it's when

2718
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
direction? No, it's when it's when
 

2719
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,510
direction? No, it's when it's when
you've got one side piling in. So, like,

2720
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:07,520
you've got one side piling in. So, like,
 

2721
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,069
you've got one side piling in. So, like,
let's think about this. All right,

2722
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:10,079
let's think about this. All right,
 

2723
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,349
let's think about this. All right,
shorts from the morning

2724
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:13,359
shorts from the morning
 

2725
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:14,950
shorts from the morning
get short here and they have their stop

2726
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:14,960
get short here and they have their stop
 

2727
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,589
get short here and they have their stop
here, right? So, we have shorts, stops

2728
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:17,599
here, right? So, we have shorts, stops
 

2729
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,069
here, right? So, we have shorts, stops
here, right? They come back, they add

2730
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:20,079
here, right? They come back, they add
 

2731
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,349
here, right? They come back, they add
because it's a first retest. They've

2732
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
because it's a first retest. They've
 

2733
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,270
because it's a first retest. They've
added short and added short and added

2734
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
added short and added short and added
 

2735
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,190
added short and added short and added
short. All right, so we have all these

2736
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:25,200
short. All right, so we have all these
 

2737
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,670
short. All right, so we have all these
shorts here. So guess what happens when

2738
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:27,680
shorts here. So guess what happens when
 

2739
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,630
shorts here. So guess what happens when
we drive through this price here. All

2740
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:30,640
we drive through this price here. All
 

2741
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,870
we drive through this price here. All
right, when we get through 410s, guess

2742
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
right, when we get through 410s, guess
 

2743
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,789
right, when we get through 410s, guess
what happens? They all stop out. When a

2744
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:34,799
what happens? They all stop out. When a
 

2745
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,870
what happens? They all stop out. When a
short seller stops out, they become

2746
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
short seller stops out, they become
 

2747
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,030
short seller stops out, they become
what? A market buyer. That's what

2748
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
what? A market buyer. That's what
 

2749
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,789
what? A market buyer. That's what
happens. Market buyer. So now we have

2750
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
happens. Market buyer. So now we have
 

2751
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,190
happens. Market buyer. So now we have
breakout longs and shorts stopping out,

2752
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,200
breakout longs and shorts stopping out,
 

2753
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,270
breakout longs and shorts stopping out,
forcing the market up. When our entry

2754
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
forcing the market up. When our entry
 

2755
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,870
forcing the market up. When our entry
was right down here, right? The same

2756
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:46,880
was right down here, right? The same
 

2757
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,190

thing down here. We had breakout shorts

2758
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,200
thing down here. We had breakout shorts
 

2759
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,430
thing down here. We had breakout shorts
being absorbed by longs. Breakout shorts

2760
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:51,440
being absorbed by longs. Breakout shorts
 

2761
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,349
being absorbed by longs. Breakout shorts
got stuck. I'll show you it on the tape.

2762
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:53,359
got stuck. I'll show you it on the tape.
 

2763
00:59:53,359 --> 01:00:00,870
got stuck. I'll show you it on the tape.
It'll be easier. Uh

2764
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:00,880

We have breakout shorts right entering

2778
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
We have breakout shorts right entering
 

2779
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,630
We have breakout shorts right entering
the market. We also have buyers from

2780
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:22,640
the market. We also have buyers from
 

2781
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,549
the market. We also have buyers from

with their stop here. So if the buyers

2784
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:26,720
with their stop here. So if the buyers
 

2785
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,109
with their stop here. So if the buyers
stop out, they become sellers in the

2786
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:29,119
stop out, they become sellers in the
 

2787
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,270
stop out, they become sellers in the
market. If short sellers join in, they

2788
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:31,280
market. If short sellers join in, they
 

2789
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,349
market. If short sellers join in, they
become sellers in the market. If we have

2790
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:33,359
become sellers in the market. If we have
 

2791
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,510
become sellers in the market. If we have
short sellers and price does not move

2792
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:35,520
short sellers and price does not move
 

2793
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,309
short sellers and price does not move
lower and it's moving higher, what does

2794
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:38,319
lower and it's moving higher, what does
 

2795
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:41,030
lower and it's moving higher, what does
that mean? That there's a passive buyer

2796
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,040
that mean? That there's a passive buyer
 

2797
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,470
that mean? That there's a passive buyer
down here. as in there's a big

2798
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
down here. as in there's a big
 

2799
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,270
down here. as in there's a big
institution limit ordering buying. Once

2800
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280
institution limit ordering buying. Once
 

2801
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,270
institution limit ordering buying. Once
we turn around, these guys start

2802
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
we turn around, these guys start
 

2803
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,710
we turn around, these guys start
stopping out. All right, they start

2804
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:48,720
stopping out. All right, they start
 

2805
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,789
stopping out. All right, they start
taking their break evens. Oh, there's

2806
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:50,799
taking their break evens. Oh, there's
 

2807
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,270
taking their break evens. Oh, there's
the run back up to the pivot. We base

2808
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,280
the run back up to the pivot. We base
 

2809
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,430
the run back up to the pivot. We base
above that area where more sellers came

2810
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:55,440
above that area where more sellers came
 

2811
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,230
above that area where more sellers came
in. They start stopping out. We squeeze,

2812
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:58,240
in. They start stopping out. We squeeze,
 

2813
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,829
in. They start stopping out. We squeeze,
right? We squeeze because these guys are

2814
01:00:59,829 --> 01:00:59,839
right? We squeeze because these guys are
 

2815
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,270
right? We squeeze because these guys are
all stopping out. They're caught the

2816
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
all stopping out. They're caught the
 

2817
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,750
all stopping out. They're caught the
wrong side of the trade. So, it's the

2818
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:03,760
wrong side of the trade. So, it's the
 

2819
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,270
wrong side of the trade. So, it's the
same at the highs except we're not

2820
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:05,280
same at the highs except we're not
 

2821
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,950
same at the highs except we're not
turning around at the highs now. We're

2822
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
turning around at the highs now. We're
 

2823
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,670
turning around at the highs now. We're
using their fuel to move higher. We're

2824
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,680
using their fuel to move higher. We're
 

2825
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,030
using their fuel to move higher. We're
using the stops. All right, the shorts

2826
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:13,040
using the stops. All right, the shorts
 

2827
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,870
using the stops. All right, the shorts
from here, we're using their stops. Look

2828
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:14,880
from here, we're using their stops. Look
 

2829
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,910
from here, we're using their stops. Look
where the squeeze happens above this,

2830
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:17,920
where the squeeze happens above this,
 

2831
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,470
where the squeeze happens above this,
right? We're using their stops to move

2832
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
right? We're using their stops to move
 

2833
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,309
right? We're using their stops to move
higher, right? We have an imbalance

2834
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:22,319
higher, right? We have an imbalance
 

2835
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:23,670
higher, right? We have an imbalance
here, which they can fill if they want.

2836
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:23,680
here, which they can fill if they want.
 

2837
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,109
here, which they can fill if they want.
I'm out of this now. Might well keep

2838
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:27,119
I'm out of this now. Might well keep
 

2839
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,710
I'm out of this now. Might well keep
going for the day. I don't know, but

2840
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:28,720
going for the day. I don't know, but
 

2841
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,549
going for the day. I don't know, but
hopefully that makes sense for you.

2842
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:32,559
hopefully that makes sense for you.
 

2843
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,349
hopefully that makes sense for you.
If only I have space for more time zone

2844
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:35,359
If only I have space for more time zone
 

2845
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,430
If only I have space for more time zone
other than trade one minute mark, what

other than trade one minute mark, what
 

2847
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,750
other than trade one minute mark, what
would I recommend? Uh yeah, like a 50. I

2848
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,760
would I recommend? Uh yeah, like a 50. I
 

2849

would I recommend? Uh yeah, like a 50. I
I use an hourly. So on my screen I have

Now that we've broken the range, do we

2862
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:55,520
Now that we've broken the range, do we
 

2863
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,510
Now that we've broken the range, do we
want to be looking for upside expansion?

2864
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:57,520
want to be looking for upside expansion?
 

2865
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,109
want to be looking for upside expansion?
I would not say it's proved anything

2866
01:01:59,109 --> 01:01:59,119
I would not say it's proved anything
 

2867
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,750
I would not say it's proved anything
yet, right? What I'd say right now is we

01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:01,760
yet, right? What I'd say right now is we
 

2869
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,789
yet, right? What I'd say right now is we
have this node being developed. we have

01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:04,799
have this node being developed. we have

unless it does this, it would have to do

01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:12,880
unless it does this, it would have to do
 

2879
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,270
unless it does this, it would have to do
something like this. All right?

2880
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,280
something like this. All right?
 

2881
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,190
something like this. All right?
Otherwise, we're going to leave buyers

2882
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,200
Otherwise, we're going to leave buyers
 

2883
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,789
Otherwise, we're going to leave buyers
who are late trapped up here. We're

2884
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:18,799
who are late trapped up here. We're
 

2885
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,309
who are late trapped up here. We're
going to revisit here. We're going to

2886
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:20,319
going to revisit here. We're going to
 

2887
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,950
going to revisit here. We're going to
make a decision here. All right? This

2888
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:22,960
make a decision here. All right? This
 

2889
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,510
make a decision here. All right? This
this right here is massive. Not just on

2890
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
this right here is massive. Not just on
 

2891
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,230
this right here is massive. Not just on
this day, on the developing week. All

2892
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:28,240
this day, on the developing week. All
 

2893
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,470
this day, on the developing week. All
right? If we hold this and do this,

2894
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,480
right? If we hold this and do this,
 

2895
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,470
right? If we hold this and do this,
maybe a squeeze. If we lose this, we can

2896
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:32,480
maybe a squeeze. If we lose this, we can
 

2897
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,430
maybe a squeeze. If we lose this, we can
collapse this whole thing on a rotation

2898
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,440
collapse this whole thing on a rotation
 

2899
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,190
collapse this whole thing on a rotation
because buyers are now caught at the

2900
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,200
because buyers are now caught at the
 

2901
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,710
because buyers are now caught at the
high. So if I come over here, we'll

2902
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
high. So if I come over here, we'll
 

2903
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,910
high. So if I come over here, we'll
probably find that the buyers at the

2904
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:39,920
probably find that the buyers at the
 

2905
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,030
probably find that the buyers at the
high just got caught offside.

2906
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:43,040
high just got caught offside.
 

2907
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,549
high just got caught offside.
We're filling the imbalance, right? So

2908
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:44,559
We're filling the imbalance, right? So
 

2909
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,109
We're filling the imbalance, right? So
all these buyers who chase the high,

2910
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:47,119
all these buyers who chase the high,
 

2911
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,030
all these buyers who chase the high,
they come start stopping out under here.

2912
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:49,040
they come start stopping out under here.
 

2913
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,109
they come start stopping out under here.
We're now filling this imbalance of

2914
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
We're now filling this imbalance of
 

2915
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,870
We're now filling this imbalance of
where we did that squeeze, that short

2916
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:52,880
where we did that squeeze, that short
 

2917
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,390
where we did that squeeze, that short
squeeze, we're back into that imbalance

2918
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
squeeze, we're back into that imbalance
 

2919
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,750
squeeze, we're back into that imbalance
area. So the question is, do more

2920
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:55,760
area. So the question is, do more
 

2921
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,670
area. So the question is, do more
sellers come in here and get trapped or

2922
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:57,680
sellers come in here and get trapped or
 

2923
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,470
sellers come in here and get trapped or
do we find acceptance back down now?

2924
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:00,480
do we find acceptance back down now?
 

2925
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,309
do we find acceptance back down now?
right back down into this gray box. Like

2926
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:02,319
right back down into this gray box. Like
 

2927
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,309
right back down into this gray box. Like
I said, this is your sentiment for the

2928
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
I said, this is your sentiment for the
 

2929
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,789
I said, this is your sentiment for the
day. I would imagine this right here.

2930
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:06,799
day. I would imagine this right here.
 

2931
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,470
day. I would imagine this right here.
So, starting to lose gray box. So, it

2932
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:08,480
So, starting to lose gray box. So, it
 

2933
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,630
So, starting to lose gray box. So, it
might come down to VWAP now and previous

2934
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:10,640
might come down to VWAP now and previous
 

2935
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,190
might come down to VWAP now and previous
day point control. And if they now the

2936
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,200
day point control. And if they now the
 

2937
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,589
day point control. And if they now the
opportunity is this, right, they

2938
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:15,599
opportunity is this, right, they
 

2939
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,349
opportunity is this, right, they
probably back test this. If they sell

2940
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:17,359
probably back test this. If they sell
 

2941
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,630
probably back test this. If they sell
this, they're going to look for this

2942
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:18,640
this, they're going to look for this
 

2943
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,829
this, they're going to look for this
rotation, right? Because we're in a

2944
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
rotation, right? Because we're in a
 

2945
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,470
rotation, right? Because we're in a
rotation between these. All right. So, I

2946
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,480
rotation between these. All right. So, I
 

2947
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,710
rotation between these. All right. So, I
would be watching this for a sell and

2948
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720
would be watching this for a sell and
 

2949
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,549
would be watching this for a sell and
this for a sell. If they reclaim this,

2950
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:28,559
this for a sell. If they reclaim this,
 

2951
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,950
this for a sell. If they reclaim this,
I'd be very skeptical about this being a

2952
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
I'd be very skeptical about this being a
 

2953
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,510
I'd be very skeptical about this being a
big old trap, right? Where they absorb

2954
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:33,520
big old trap, right? Where they absorb
 

2955
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,510
big old trap, right? Where they absorb
now,

2956
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,520
now,
 

2957
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,109
now,
right? So, this level coming up here is

2958
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:37,119
right? So, this level coming up here is
 

2959
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,069
right? So, this level coming up here is
key into 400. If they start rifling

2960
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
key into 400. If they start rifling
 

2961
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,109
key into 400. If they start rifling
through this, this is a massive trap,

2962
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
through this, this is a massive trap,
 

2963
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,710
through this, this is a massive trap,
right? So, they have to resell this

2964
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
right? So, they have to resell this
 

2965
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,710
right? So, they have to resell this
right here, right now to come back down

2966
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720
right here, right now to come back down
 

2967
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,230
right here, right now to come back down
to here. If they don't, and they do

2968
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
to here. If they don't, and they do
 

2969
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,829
to here. If they don't, and they do
this, I would imagine we are going to

2970
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:49,839
this, I would imagine we are going to
 

2971
01:03:49,839 --> 01:04:04,870
this, I would imagine we are going to
come and rip some faces.

2972
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:04,880

 

2973
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,870

Can you have an opinion about momentum

2974
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:06,880
Can you have an opinion about momentum
 

2975
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,789
Can you have an opinion about momentum
on the 1 hour market? Yeah, of course

2976
01:04:08,789 --> 01:04:08,799
on the 1 hour market? Yeah, of course

01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,470
you can.

How do I mark the GlobeEx levels? Uh

2984
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:18,160
How do I mark the GlobeEx levels? Uh
 

2985
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,950
How do I mark the GlobeEx levels? Uh
just the high and lows. just you can

2986
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:20,960
just the high and lows. just you can
 

2987
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,470
just the high and lows. just you can
just you can do the high and lows

2988
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:22,480
just you can do the high and lows
 

2989
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,950
just you can do the high and lows
overnight or you can do them of those

2990
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
overnight or you can do them of those
 

2991
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,549
overnight or you can do them of those
specific levels based on time. You can

2992
01:04:26,549 --> 01:04:26,559
specific levels based on time. You can
 

2993
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,150
specific levels based on time. You can
get plenty of indicators online will do

2994
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:28,160
get plenty of indicators online will do
 

2995
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,589
get plenty of indicators online will do
that. So, so far we're starting to see

2996
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:29,599
that. So, so far we're starting to see
 

2997
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,870
that. So, so far we're starting to see
rejection there, aren't we? So, they're

2998
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:30,880
rejection there, aren't we? So, they're
 

2999
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,230
rejection there, aren't we? So, they're
going to try and force follow through

3000
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:32,240
going to try and force follow through
 

3001
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,109
going to try and force follow through
now. So, sellers will want to trim a

3002
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,119
now. So, sellers will want to trim a
 

3003
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,789
now. So, sellers will want to trim a
little bit here now in case they in case

3004
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:36,799
little bit here now in case they in case
 

3005
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,470
little bit here now in case they in case
they rebid it. And if they see follow

3006
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
they rebid it. And if they see follow
 

3007
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,750
they rebid it. And if they see follow
through, they will be looking for a

3008
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,760
through, they will be looking for a
 

3009
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,589
through, they will be looking for a
trade back down to 300 because we're in

3010
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:41,599
trade back down to 300 because we're in
 

3011
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,150
trade back down to 300 because we're in
a range rotating market. Okay. So, we've

3012
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
a range rotating market. Okay. So, we've
 

3013
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,549
a range rotating market. Okay. So, we've
just rejected fours. If you took this

3014
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:46,559
just rejected fours. If you took this
 

3015
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,549
just rejected fours. If you took this
short at fours, I would be covering some

3016
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:48,559
short at fours, I would be covering some
 

3017
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,430
short at fours, I would be covering some
here into these 60s because we have a

3018
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
here into these 60s because we have a
 

3019
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,349
here into these 60s because we have a
developing weak point of control. We

3020
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:53,359
developing weak point of control. We
 

3021
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,670
developing weak point of control. We
have PDC. We have both VWAPS. We have

3022
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:55,680
have PDC. We have both VWAPS. We have
 

3023
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,910
have PDC. We have both VWAPS. We have
lower time frame algo. If we let go of

3024
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
lower time frame algo. If we let go of
 

3025
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,230
lower time frame algo. If we let go of
this, your continuation trade will be

3026
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,240
this, your continuation trade will be
 

3027
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,470
this, your continuation trade will be
down into here. All right. So, if this

3028
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:02,480
down into here. All right. So, if this
 

3029
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,549
down into here. All right. So, if this
is a big rotating day, which is what our

3030
01:05:04,549 --> 01:05:04,559
is a big rotating day, which is what our
 

3031
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,109
is a big rotating day, which is what our
expectation is, if we let go of this,

3032
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:07,119
expectation is, if we let go of this,
 

3033
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:16,950
expectation is, if we let go of this,
they can come right back down into this

3034
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:16,960

 

3035
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,270

Oh, you want a a Valentine sale? Okay.

fine.
 

3041
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,910
fine.
Fine. We can sort something.

3042
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:27,920
Fine. We can sort something.
 

3043
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,789
Fine. We can sort something.

3123
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,150

think it's so personal. I think it's
 

3133
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,309
think it's so personal. I think it's
really easy to see the trap players on

3134
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
really easy to see the trap players on
 

3135
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,230
really easy to see the trap players on
the footprint when you have delta on the

01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,240
the footprint when you have delta on the
 

3137
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,549
the footprint when you have delta on the
side. But I really do like that map. I

3138
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:32,559
side. But I really do like that map. I
 

3139
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,470
side. But I really do like that map. I
think it's really useful. It's a really

3140
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:34,480
think it's really useful. It's a really
 

3141
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,630
think it's really useful. It's a really
useful tool.

3142
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:36,640
useful tool.
 

3143
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,150
useful tool.
So, we're seeing like aggressive buyers

3144
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:38,160
So, we're seeing like aggressive buyers
 

3145
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,029
So, we're seeing like aggressive buyers
keep trying to step in here at 80.

3146
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:41,039
keep trying to step in here at 80.
 

3147
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,029

He's just come in another 80 lot. He's

3148
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
He's just come in another 80 lot. He's
 

3149
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,470
He's just come in another 80 lot. He's
trying to force up. He needs to get a

3150
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:44,480
trying to force up. He needs to get a
 

3151
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,390
trying to force up. He needs to get a
break of 90. Here we go. So, they're

3152
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:46,400
break of 90. Here we go. So, they're
 

3153
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,069
break of 90. Here we go. So, they're
trying to get this reclaim of this gray

3154
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:48,079
trying to get this reclaim of this gray
 

3155
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,349
trying to get this reclaim of this gray
box. I would say if buyers are able to

3156
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
box. I would say if buyers are able to
 

3157
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,870
box. I would say if buyers are able to
reclaim this and hold, they're going to

3158
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:52,880
reclaim this and hold, they're going to
 

3159
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,630
reclaim this and hold, they're going to
look to do this. All right. So, sellers

3160
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
look to do this. All right. So, sellers
 

3161
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,150
look to do this. All right. So, sellers
now losing control. They had the

3162
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:56,160
now losing control. They had the
 

3163
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,589
now losing control. They had the
opportunity. They are now starting to

3164
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:57,599
opportunity. They are now starting to
 

3165
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,750
opportunity. They are now starting to
lose control. If buyers get above this,

3166
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
lose control. If buyers get above this,
 

3167
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,309
lose control. If buyers get above this,
they will look for more upside. This can

3168
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
they will look for more upside. This can
 

3169
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,990
they will look for more upside. This can
be a giant trap if they're able to do

3170
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,000
be a giant trap if they're able to do
 

3171
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:16,709
be a giant trap if they're able to do
that. Big if, but uh that's what it is.

3172
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:16,719

3286
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:46,640

3287
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,990
400s now you're watching for expansion
through 22s you're going to need to

3288
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
through 22s you're going to need to
 

3289
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,149
through 22s you're going to need to
respect 34s but through that I think

3290
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
respect 34s but through that I think
 

3291
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,149
respect 34s but through that I think
you've got a shot of going now. I think

3292
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
you've got a shot of going now. I think
 

3293
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,790
you've got a shot of going now. I think
this is might well be a trap now that

01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:54,800
this is might well be a trap now that
 

3295
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,950
this is might well be a trap now that

they lift. All right they flushed they
absorbed. They got sellers to get

3298
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,040
absorbed. They got sellers to get
 

3299
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,709
absorbed. They got sellers to get
involved versus this pivot. They've got

3300
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:00,719
involved versus this pivot. They've got
 

3301
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,390
involved versus this pivot. They've got
above them. Those sellers now stopping

3302

above them. Those sellers now stopping
 

3303
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,070

out. They will come up to here and if
 

3305
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,350
out. They will come up to here and if
they get through that there will be

3306
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360
they get through that there will be
 

3307
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,590
they get through that there will be
expansion. Now

this is the rotation now. It's between

3344
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:56,800
this is the rotation now. It's between
 

3345
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,270
this is the rotation now. It's between
here and all the time balls are holding

here and all the time balls are holding
 

3347
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,189
here and all the time balls are holding
this. I think that this is possible. The

3348
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
this. I think that this is possible. The
 

3349
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,590
this. I think that this is possible. The
only thing I would say that you need to

3350
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:03,600
only thing I would say that you need to
 

3351
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,430
only thing I would say that you need to
be aware of is definitely the higher

3352

01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,630
previous week value high into here and
current developing. All right, remember

3360
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:14,640
current developing. All right, remember
 

3361
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,390

we've got stops here to run it towards

3362
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:16,400
we've got stops here to run it towards
 

3363
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,550
we've got stops here to run it towards
the 500s. If they find a swipe towards

3364
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:18,560
the 500s. If they find a swipe towards
 

3365
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,950
the 500s. If they find a swipe towards
500s, great. If they can't base over

3366
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:20,960
500s, great. If they can't base over
 

3367
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,510
500s, great. If they can't base over
this, right, they will look for that if

3368
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:23,520
this, right, they will look for that if
 

3369
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,510
this, right, they will look for that if
they can. If they can't base over this,

3370
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,520
they can. If they can't base over this,
 

3371
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,669
they can. If they can't base over this,
I'm telling you, this is possible. It

3372
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:27,679
I'm telling you, this is possible. It
 

3373
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:30,149
I'm telling you, this is possible. It
can be a massive trap in here. So, I

3374
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:30,159
can be a massive trap in here. So, I
 

3375
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,830
can be a massive trap in here. So, I
wouldn't get long in here. All right.

3376
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:31,840
wouldn't get long in here. All right.
 

3377
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,350
wouldn't get long in here. All right.
You need to be long and selling into

3378
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,360
You need to be long and selling into
 

3379
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,390
You need to be long and selling into
there unless we push and hold because

3380
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,400
there unless we push and hold because
 

3381
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,470
there unless we push and hold because
they can just keep selling the edge of

3382
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
they can just keep selling the edge of
 

3383
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,870
they can just keep selling the edge of
this all the time that they want to. And

3384
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:40,880
this all the time that they want to. And
 

3385
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,750
this all the time that they want to. And
then a push above can also be sold. So,

3386
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:43,760
then a push above can also be sold. So,
 

3387
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,709
then a push above can also be sold. So,
it's why for me I'm done with it.

3388
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:46,719
it's why for me I'm done with it.
 

3389
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,189
it's why for me I'm done with it.
Get back to the screen. Oh, they just

3390
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
Get back to the screen. Oh, they just
 

3391
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,790
Get back to the screen. Oh, they just
rejected. So, gray to gray and they're

3392
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:50,800
rejected. So, gray to gray and they're
 

3393
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,350
rejected. So, gray to gray and they're
they're swapping under gray. Now, we are

3394
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:53,360
they're swapping under gray. Now, we are
 

3395
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,870
they're swapping under gray. Now, we are
starting to develop quite a big node

3396
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:54,880
starting to develop quite a big node
 

3397
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,030
starting to develop quite a big node
here. If we lose this, sellers will come

3398
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
here. If we lose this, sellers will come
 

3399
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,590
here. If we lose this, sellers will come
back in again.

3400
01:13:59,590 --> 01:13:59,600
back in again.
 

3401
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,510
back in again.
It's very washy here. That is a lower

3402
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:01,520
It's very washy here. That is a lower
 

3403
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,590
It's very washy here. That is a lower
high for sure

3404
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:03,600
high for sure
 

3405
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,270
high for sure
versus this. They didn't able weren't

3406
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:05,280
versus this. They didn't able weren't
 

3407
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,790
versus this. They didn't able weren't
able to reclaim. They've just snapped

3408
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:06,800
able to reclaim. They've just snapped
 

3409
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,430
able to reclaim. They've just snapped
right back through PC. If we lose this,

3410
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:09,440
right back through PC. If we lose this,
 

3411
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,550
right back through PC. If we lose this,
that can happen or this can happen. Why

3412
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
that can happen or this can happen. Why
 

3413
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,310
that can happen or this can happen. Why
both? It's just cuz we're in a rotation,

3414
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
both? It's just cuz we're in a rotation,
 

3415
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,110
both? It's just cuz we're in a rotation,
guys. These are the my least favorite

3416
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:17,120
guys. These are the my least favorite
 

3417
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,550
guys. These are the my least favorite
markets that we talk about. They've just

3418
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:18,560
markets that we talk about. They've just
 

3419
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,229
markets that we talk about. They've just
had an opportunity there to go higher

3420
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
had an opportunity there to go higher
 

3421
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,229
had an opportunity there to go higher
and they failed and a big seller is

3422
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:22,239
and they failed and a big seller is
 

3423
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,630
and they failed and a big seller is
trying to drive this down now. So if

3424
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:24,640
trying to drive this down now. So if
 

3425
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,149
trying to drive this down now. So if
they ret be the same thing if they

3426
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:26,159
they ret be the same thing if they
 

3427
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,790
they ret be the same thing if they
retest 85s to 80s they will try and do

3428
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:28,800
retest 85s to 80s they will try and do
 

3429
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,430
retest 85s to 80s they will try and do
the same play they did here

3430
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
the same play they did here
 

3431
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,270
the same play they did here
they will try and sell this and if they

3432
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:33,280
they will try and sell this and if they
 

3433
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,430
they will try and sell this and if they
fail to sell this is the same thing that

3434
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:35,440
fail to sell this is the same thing that
 

3435
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,110
fail to sell this is the same thing that
can happen again is they're just going

3436
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,120
can happen again is they're just going
 

3437
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,630
can happen again is they're just going
to keep doing this until they've got one

3438
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
to keep doing this until they've got one
 

3439
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,709
to keep doing this until they've got one

01:14:48,960 --> 01:15:06,870
through which is nasty back test this
question is this now or this Now,

How does the way you trade apply to

3466
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:27,280
How does the way you trade apply to
 

3467
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,870
How does the way you trade apply to
other sessions? Is volume too low? It's

3468
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
other sessions? Is volume too low? It's
 

3469
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,229
other sessions? Is volume too low? It's
the same principles, just volume's

3470
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:30,239
the same principles, just volume's
 

3471
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:31,910
the same principles, just volume's
lower.

3472
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:31,920
lower.

don't like shorts. I'd like to see it
 

3477
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,350
don't like shorts. I'd like to see it
swipe all the liquidity first, but ES

3478
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,360
swipe all the liquidity first, but ES
 

3479
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,030
swipe all the liquidity first, but ES
has done it. Like we talked about, ES

3480
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
has done it. Like we talked about, ES
 

3481
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,630
has done it. Like we talked about, ES
has taken out that liquidity, but

3482
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:42,640
has taken out that liquidity, but
 

3483
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,110
has taken out that liquidity, but
I would like to see it break out first.

3484
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
I would like to see it break out first.

reason I didn't take the one this
 

3489
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,990
reason I didn't take the one this
morning. I prefer it if it cleans out

3490
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:50,000
morning. I prefer it if it cleans out
 

3491
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,390
morning. I prefer it if it cleans out
some of these guys first and then offers

3492

some of these guys first and then offers
 

3493
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,229
some of these guys first and then offers
it. But it just might it might we might

3494
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:54,239
it. But it just might it might we might
 

3495
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,510
it. But it just might it might we might
just build all day. Remember, we're

3496
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:55,520
just build all day. Remember, we're
 

3497

we going to protect these
 

3505
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,070
we going to protect these
or are we going to swipe these and trap

3506
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
or are we going to swipe these and trap
 

3507
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,550
or are we going to swipe these and trap
above? I don't want to become liquidity

3508

came because we swiped underneath these
 

3513
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,270
came because we swiped underneath these

So on the airing on the side of caution

3520
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,480
So on the airing on the side of caution
 

3521
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,510
So on the airing on the side of caution
the market looks very like iffy right

just a read out on the mag it should
 

3527
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,229

trying to add it to my analysis. There's
no there's no that that question's like

no there's no that that question's like
 

3583
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,630
no there's no that that question's like
not valid. There's no time frame that's

time frame are you able do you like
 

3591
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,430
time frame are you able do you like
trading in? What time frame are you able

trading in? What time frame are you able
 

3593
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,550
trading in? What time frame are you able
to digest the information in? If a one

to digest the information in? If a one

minute chart is too fast for you, if you
 

3597
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,390
minute chart is too fast for you, if you
cannot digest the delta in a one minute

3598
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:30,400
cannot digest the delta in a one minute
 

3599
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,750
cannot digest the delta in a one minute
chart, you should not be looking at a

3600
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:31,760
chart, you should not be looking at a
 

3601
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,430
chart, you should not be looking at a
one minute chart. Look at a two, a

3602
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:33,440
one minute chart. Look at a two, a
 

3603
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,310
one minute chart. Look at a two, a
three, a four, a five, a 15, a 30, an

3604
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
three, a four, a five, a 15, a 30, an

01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,189
three, a four, a five, a 15, a 30, an
hour. There is no like specific time

3606

hour. There is no like specific time
 

3607
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,270
hour. There is no like specific time
frame that's better. It's about what

3608
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280
frame that's better. It's about what
 

3609
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,990
frame that's better. It's about what
works for you. And that

3610
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:44,000
works for you. And that
 

3611
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,830
works for you. And that
is based on what you're looking for and

3612
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
is based on what you're looking for and
 

3613
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,590
is based on what you're looking for and
what your experience is, right? I can

3614
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:47,600
what your experience is, right? I can
 

3615
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,430
what your experience is, right? I can
read a one minute time frame. I can see

3616
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
read a one minute time frame. I can see
 

3617
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,030
read a one minute time frame. I can see
when they're getting trapped in there. I

3618
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
when they're getting trapped in there. I
 

3619
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,550
when they're getting trapped in there. I
can read ticks because I'm looking at

3620
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
can read ticks because I'm looking at
 

3621
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,870
can read ticks because I'm looking at
bookmap, which is not even minutes. It's

3622
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:54,880
bookmap, which is not even minutes. It's
 

3623
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,350
bookmap, which is not even minutes. It's
ticks, right? But that took a lot of

3624
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,360
ticks, right? But that took a lot of
 

3625
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,630
ticks, right? But that took a lot of
experience. When I first started looking

3626
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:58,640
experience. When I first started looking
 

3627
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,709
experience. When I first started looking
at this stuff, it would be overkill. I'd

3628
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
at this stuff, it would be overkill. I'd
 

3629
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:01,910
at this stuff, it would be overkill. I'd
be like, "Well, this is too much

3630
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:01,920
be like, "Well, this is too much
 

3631
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,430
be like, "Well, this is too much
information." So, if it's too much

3632
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,440
information." So, if it's too much
 

3633
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,830
information." So, if it's too much
information, keep going up the time

3634
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
information, keep going up the time
 

3635
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,470
information, keep going up the time
frames until you find, "Okay, now I get

3636
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:08,480
frames until you find, "Okay, now I get
 

3637
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,950
frames until you find, "Okay, now I get
it. Now I get it." The higher the time

3638
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:10,960
it. Now I get it." The higher the time
 

3639
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,630
it. Now I get it." The higher the time
frame, the less information you're

3640
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:12,640
frame, the less information you're
 

3641
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,790
frame, the less information you're
absorbing per minute, the easier it is

3642
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
absorbing per minute, the easier it is
 

3643
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:25,669
absorbing per minute, the easier it is
for you.

think is currently like 13 a month. I
 

3661
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,390
think is currently like 13 a month. I
don't know what they call it. They are

01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:42,400
don't know what they call it. They are
 

3663
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,149
don't know what they call it. They are
building out this node. I still think

01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:44,159
building out this node. I still think
 

3665
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,750
building out this node. I still think

Bulls have unfinished business up here
in this gray box. In fact, would like to

3668
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,320
in this gray box. In fact, would like to
 

3669
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,950
in this gray box. In fact, would like to
just move this up so it's accurate there

3670
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:50,960
just move this up so it's accurate there
 

3671
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,870
just move this up so it's accurate there
and

3672

and

01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:59,189
I still think they are trying to get up
into there where the liquidity is, but

into there where the liquidity is, but
 

3679
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,350
into there where the liquidity is, but
we will see. They definitely just caught

3680
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,360
we will see. They definitely just caught
 

3681
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,830
we will see. They definitely just caught
shorts on that last flush right under

3682
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:03,840
shorts on that last flush right under
 

3683
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,669
shorts on that last flush right under
400.

3684
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:05,679
400.
 

3685
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:10,470
400.
We just caught shorts again here

3686
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:10,480
We just caught shorts again here
 

3687
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,870
We just caught shorts again here
under 400 in there. I can show you in

3688
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:12,880
under 400 in there. I can show you in
 

3689
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:22,070
under 400 in there. I can show you in
there.

3690
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080

 

3691
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,149

This is all sell side under 400. Look at

3692
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:24,159
This is all sell side under 400. Look at
 

3693
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,750
This is all sell side under 400. Look at
this candle here.

3694
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:25,760
this candle here.
 

3695
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,669
this candle here.
Right. So, this is a fiveminute chart.

3696
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
Right. So, this is a fiveminute chart.
 

3697
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,750
Right. So, this is a fiveminute chart.
Look under 400. This is all market

3698
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:29,760
Look under 400. This is all market
 

3699
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,910
Look under 400. This is all market
selling into an imbalance who just

3700
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:31,920
selling into an imbalance who just
 

3701
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,990
selling into an imbalance who just
paired off with where this buyer was.

3702
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,000
paired off with where this buyer was.
 

3703
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,910
paired off with where this buyer was.
Right. And they reclaimed 400 and now

3704
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
Right. And they reclaimed 400 and now
 

3705
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,910
Right. And they reclaimed 400 and now
we're shoving. So, every seller under

3706
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:37,920
we're shoving. So, every seller under
 

3707
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,950
we're shoving. So, every seller under
400 just got themselves caught. They

3708
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:40,960
400 just got themselves caught. They
 

3709
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,870
400 just got themselves caught. They
just got themselves caught. I think they

3710
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:42,880
just got themselves caught. I think they
 

3711
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,149
just got themselves caught. I think they
want this gray box. I've been saying it

3712
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:44,159
want this gray box. I've been saying it
 

3713
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:45,350
want this gray box. I've been saying it
the whole time. I think that's what they

3714
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:45,360
the whole time. I think that's what they
 

3715
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,830
the whole time. I think that's what they
want. Sellers coming in here at 50 52.

3716
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:47,840
want. Sellers coming in here at 50 52.
 

3717
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,189
want. Sellers coming in here at 50 52.
Lot of these highs. I think we probably

3718
01:20:49,189 --> 01:20:49,199
Lot of these highs. I think we probably
 

3719
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,510
Lot of these highs. I think we probably
get a breakout here. The next pullback

3720
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:51,520
get a breakout here. The next pullback
 

3721
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,870
get a breakout here. The next pullback
probably holds and they probably go for

3722
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:52,880
probably holds and they probably go for
 

3723
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,110
probably holds and they probably go for
it. There is a node up here. You can see

3724
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:55,120
it. There is a node up here. You can see
 

3725
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,550
it. There is a node up here. You can see
there's a slight node up there. I think

3726
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,560
there's a slight node up there. I think
 

3727
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,910
there's a slight node up there. I think
there is a breakout coming.

3728
01:20:59,910 --> 01:20:59,920
there is a breakout coming.
 

3729
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,510
there is a breakout coming.
It's just a matter of time at the

3730
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:01,520
It's just a matter of time at the
 

3731
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,510
It's just a matter of time at the
moment. Can they catch enough offguard

3732
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:03,520
moment. Can they catch enough offguard
 

3733
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,430
moment. Can they catch enough offguard
to do it is what I think they are trying

3734
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:05,440
to do it is what I think they are trying
 

3735
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,070
to do it is what I think they are trying
to do.

3736
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
to do.
 

3737
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,669
to do.
Vivc.

3738
01:21:11,669 --> 01:21:11,679

 

3739
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,350

Can they bid above previous day high?

3740
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
Can they bid above previous day high?
 

3741
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,950
Can they bid above previous day high?
Can they get through this gray box node

3742
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:14,960
Can they get through this gray box node
 

3743
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,350
Can they get through this gray box node
up into here?

3744
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:17,360
up into here?
 

3745
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,709
up into here?
That's like the big question at the

3746
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:18,719
That's like the big question at the
 

3747
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:23,030
That's like the big question at the
moment.

3748
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040

 

3749
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,070

So that node sort of 35s is like where

3750
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
So that node sort of 35s is like where
 

3751
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:33,030
So that node sort of 35s is like where
its thickest point is.

3752
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,040

 

3753
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,270

ES doing it. ES has broken out. Can it

3754
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:35,280
ES doing it. ES has broken out. Can it
 

3755
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,189
ES doing it. ES has broken out. Can it
hold its gains above initial balance? IB

3756
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
hold its gains above initial balance? IB
 

3757
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,790
hold its gains above initial balance? IB
now set. Yeah, IB is now set. So we're

3758
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
now set. Yeah, IB is now set. So we're
 

3759
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,310
now set. Yeah, IB is now set. So we're
also going to think about a rotational

3760
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:40,320
also going to think about a rotational
 

3761
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:44,870
also going to think about a rotational
IB. IB day IB day. AB day. We're going

3762
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:44,880
IB. IB day IB day. AB day. We're going
 

3763
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,310
IB. IB day IB day. AB day. We're going
to think about that rotation. So if we

3764
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:46,320
to think about that rotation. So if we
 

3765
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,229
to think about that rotation. So if we
have a fail breakout of the IB today,

3766
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:48,239
have a fail breakout of the IB today,
 

3767
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:54,310
have a fail breakout of the IB today,
you might get that trade back to VW up

3768
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:54,320

 

3769
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,790

imbalance down here down to 15s if they

3770
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:56,800
imbalance down here down to 15s if they
 

3771
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,550
imbalance down here down to 15s if they
do want to do that little wash down and

3772
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:58,560
do want to do that little wash down and
 

3773
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,629
do want to do that little wash down and
retra.

3774
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639

 

3775
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,550

I think it looks like it's coming to me.

3776
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
I think it looks like it's coming to me.
 

3777
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,750
I think it looks like it's coming to me.
It's just whether they can get through

3778
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:05,760
It's just whether they can get through
 

3779
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,350
It's just whether they can get through
this little gray box. And if they can,

3780
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:07,360
this little gray box. And if they can,
 

3781
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:15,350
this little gray box. And if they can,
we're going to see that expansion.

3782
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360

 

3783
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,270

Alex, would it say it's best to stay out

3784
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
Alex, would it say it's best to stay out
 

3785
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,950
Alex, would it say it's best to stay out
of market like this? Um, it's just

3786
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:18,960
of market like this? Um, it's just
 

3787
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,830
of market like this? Um, it's just
personal, right? It's like it's personal

3788
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
personal, right? It's like it's personal
 

3789
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,550
personal, right? It's like it's personal
preference. Um, I don't love rotational

3790
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:24,560
preference. Um, I don't love rotational
 

3791
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,390
preference. Um, I don't love rotational
markets. Like, it's not where my edge

3792
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
markets. Like, it's not where my edge
 

3793
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,910
markets. Like, it's not where my edge
is. I know we got this today because

3794
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:27,920
is. I know we got this today because
 

3795
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,310
is. I know we got this today because
there was a nice trap towards a low. Uh,

3796
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:30,320
there was a nice trap towards a low. Uh,
 

3797
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,149
there was a nice trap towards a low. Uh,
I can think about the same kind of play

3798
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
I can think about the same kind of play
 

3799
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,910
I can think about the same kind of play
reverse up here. I can think about the

3800
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:33,920
reverse up here. I can think about the
 

3801
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,430
reverse up here. I can think about the
continuation if they're going to do it.

3802
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
continuation if they're going to do it.
 

3803
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,510
continuation if they're going to do it.
But

3804
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,520
But
 

3805
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,350
But
there's no like with all these things,

3806
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:39,360
there's no like with all these things,
 

3807
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,709
there's no like with all these things,
there's no like, oh yeah, you need to

3808
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:40,719
there's no like, oh yeah, you need to
 

3809
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,110
there's no like, oh yeah, you need to
stay out or you can't do this. It's just

3810
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:43,120
stay out or you can't do this. It's just
 

3811
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,709
stay out or you can't do this. It's just
personal preference. What kind of

3812
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
personal preference. What kind of
 

3813
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,229
personal preference. What kind of
conditions do you like trading in? That

3814
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:46,239
conditions do you like trading in? That
 

3815
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,990
conditions do you like trading in? That
will come from back testing. Are you a

3816
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
will come from back testing. Are you a
 

3817
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,910
will come from back testing. Are you a
trend trader? Do you like traps? Do you

3818
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:49,920
trend trader? Do you like traps? Do you
 

3819
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,270
trend trader? Do you like traps? Do you
like trading edges? Do you like

3820
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:51,280
like trading edges? Do you like
 

3821
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,030
like trading edges? Do you like
rotation? Do you like continuation? Do

3822
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
rotation? Do you like continuation? Do
 

3823
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,310
rotation? Do you like continuation? Do
you like trades when we're leaving

3824
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,320
you like trades when we're leaving
 

3825
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,070
you like trades when we're leaving
volume trapped? Do you like trades when

3826
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:56,080
volume trapped? Do you like trades when
 

3827
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,070
volume trapped? Do you like trades when
we're creating volume? I like trades

3828
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:58,080
we're creating volume? I like trades
 

3829
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,669
we're creating volume? I like trades
when we're leaving volume trapped. All

3830
01:22:59,669 --> 01:22:59,679
when we're leaving volume trapped. All
 

3831
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,110
when we're leaving volume trapped. All
right, coming back now to this imbalance

3832
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,120
right, coming back now to this imbalance
 

3833
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,750
right, coming back now to this imbalance
to the 15s again. They're failing to get

3834
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:03,760
to the 15s again. They're failing to get
 

3835
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,590
to the 15s again. They're failing to get
through here right now.

3836
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:07,600

 

3837
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,070

They cannot make their mind up. I don't

3838
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
They cannot make their mind up. I don't
 

3839
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,830
They cannot make their mind up. I don't
think we've completed the auction at the

3840
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:11,840
think we've completed the auction at the
 

3841
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,350
think we've completed the auction at the
highs, but I could well be wrong.

3842
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:15,360
highs, but I could well be wrong.
 

3843
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,350
highs, but I could well be wrong.
Maybe they have. Maybe they're like, "We

3844
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,360
Maybe they have. Maybe they're like, "We
 

3845
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,629
Maybe they have. Maybe they're like, "We
don't want to go and do it. We're only

3846
01:23:18,629 --> 01:23:18,639
don't want to go and do it. We're only
 

3847
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:20,790
don't want to go and do it. We're only
going to do it on ES."

3848
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:20,800
going to do it on ES."
 

3849
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,750
going to do it on ES."
Yeah, they trapped again here. Absorbing

3850
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:23,760
Yeah, they trapped again here. Absorbing
 

3851
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,270
Yeah, they trapped again here. Absorbing
again here. Can they get follow through

3852
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:25,280
again here. Can they get follow through
 

3853
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,110
again here. Can they get follow through
upside? That last candle just trapped

3854
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,120
upside? That last candle just trapped
 

3855
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,750
upside? That last candle just trapped
again in that imbalance. It's washy,

3856
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
again in that imbalance. It's washy,
 

3857
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,110
again in that imbalance. It's washy,
that's for sure. It's not very pretty

3858
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,120
that's for sure. It's not very pretty
 

3859
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:43,110
that's for sure. It's not very pretty
out here.

3860
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:43,120

 

3861
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,149

definitely washy. So into GlobeEx. Do

3862
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:46,159
definitely washy. So into GlobeEx. Do
 

3863
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,990
definitely washy. So into GlobeEx. Do
they bid around here again and have one

3864
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,000
they bid around here again and have one
 

3865
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,669
they bid around here again and have one
more attempt? If they can't get up there

3866
01:23:49,669 --> 01:23:49,679
more attempt? If they can't get up there
 

3867
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,110
more attempt? If they can't get up there
soon and break out, they're going to get

3868
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:51,120
soon and break out, they're going to get
 

3869
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,950
soon and break out, they're going to get
themselves caught.

3870
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:52,960
themselves caught.
 

3871
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,590
themselves caught.
I'm just not convinced that high of day

3872
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:55,600
I'm just not convinced that high of day
 

3873
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,310
I'm just not convinced that high of day
is in. But

3874
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
is in. But
 

3875
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,470
is in. But
it is looking more like it might be in

3876
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:00,480
it is looking more like it might be in
 

3877
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,189
it is looking more like it might be in
on ES, that's for sure. Back to VPO then

3878
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:03,199
on ES, that's for sure. Back to VPO then
 

3879
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:07,350
on ES, that's for sure. Back to VPO then
we go.

3880
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360

 

3881
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,189

Somewhat surprised they didn't take that

3882
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:09,199
Somewhat surprised they didn't take that
 

3883
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,870
Somewhat surprised they didn't take that
out there. This is not looking very good

3884
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:10,880
out there. This is not looking very good
 

3885
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,430
out there. This is not looking very good
for the bulls at the moment. Say last

3886
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:13,440
for the bulls at the moment. Say last
 

3887
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,110
for the bulls at the moment. Say last
chance here to save it in this gray box,

3888
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,120
chance here to save it in this gray box,
 

3889
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:15,910
chance here to save it in this gray box,
otherwise they're going to get

3890
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:15,920
otherwise they're going to get
 

3891
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,910
otherwise they're going to get
themselves in big trouble. It's a big

3892
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
themselves in big trouble. It's a big
 

3893
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,350
themselves in big trouble. It's a big
rejection after clearing out the high.

3894
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
rejection after clearing out the high.
 

3895
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,750
rejection after clearing out the high.
So ES has done the move that I would

3896
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:21,760
So ES has done the move that I would
 

3897
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,070
So ES has done the move that I would
traditionally be looking for in NQ. Like

3898
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:24,080
traditionally be looking for in NQ. Like
 

3899
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,110
traditionally be looking for in NQ. Like
when we look for this, see how ES just

3900
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:27,120
when we look for this, see how ES just
 

3901
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,950
when we look for this, see how ES just
swiped it all and then Ben has come back

3902
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:28,960
swiped it all and then Ben has come back
 

3903
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:48,070
swiped it all and then Ben has come back
down.

3904
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,080

 

3905
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,990

What's weird is the sellers keep getting

3906
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
What's weird is the sellers keep getting
 

3907
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,990
What's weird is the sellers keep getting
caught down here, but there's not able

3908
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,000
caught down here, but there's not able
 

3909
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,790
caught down here, but there's not able
to run it higher. It's like how high.

3910
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:54,800
to run it higher. It's like how high.
 

3911
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,270
to run it higher. It's like how high.
They just caught into 400s and under

3912
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
They just caught into 400s and under
 

3913
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:01,110
They just caught into 400s and under
again. Same level as before. Exactly the

3914
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,120
again. Same level as before. Exactly the
 

3915
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,470
again. Same level as before. Exactly the
same level we just went over on the

3916
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:02,480
same level we just went over on the
 

3917
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,070
same level we just went over on the
chart. I'm just unconvinced at the

3918
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:04,080
chart. I'm just unconvinced at the
 

3919
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:13,510
chart. I'm just unconvinced at the
moment. The lack of strength

3920
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:13,520

 

3921
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,430

You can see it in the mag like Nvidia,

3922
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:15,440
You can see it in the mag like Nvidia,
 

3923
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,790
You can see it in the mag like Nvidia,
Meta, Google red, Tesla, Microsoft,

3924
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:18,800
Meta, Google red, Tesla, Microsoft,
 

3925
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,110
Meta, Google red, Tesla, Microsoft,
Amazon green, Apple flat. I mean, it's

3926
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:21,120
Amazon green, Apple flat. I mean, it's
 

3927
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,870
Amazon green, Apple flat. I mean, it's
just complete indecision in the mag. You

3928
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:22,880
just complete indecision in the mag. You
 

3929
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,750
just complete indecision in the mag. You
remember that's 60% of the ENQ. It's

3930
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
remember that's 60% of the ENQ. It's
 

3931
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,149
remember that's 60% of the ENQ. It's
complete indecision right now.

3932
01:25:28,149 --> 01:25:28,159
complete indecision right now.
 

3933
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,149
complete indecision right now.
It would just be nice if we would get a

3934
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
It would just be nice if we would get a
 

3935
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,709
It would just be nice if we would get a
liquidity sweep at the highs rather than

3936
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:32,719
liquidity sweep at the highs rather than
 

3937
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,110
liquidity sweep at the highs rather than
just these uh

3938
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:35,120
just these uh
 

3939
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,910
just these uh
how we've set this up. But we'll see.

3940
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:37,920
how we've set this up. But we'll see.
 

3941
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,590
how we've set this up. But we'll see.
We'll see. I was waiting to break out

3942
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:39,600
We'll see. I was waiting to break out
 

3943
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,669
We'll see. I was waiting to break out
and then fail failure to short back in.

3944
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:41,679
and then fail failure to short back in.
 

3945
01:25:41,679 --> 01:26:10,550
and then fail failure to short back in.
We'll see.

3946
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:10,560

 

3947
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:20,550

tape slowed right down as well.

3948
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:20,560

 

3949
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,070

What are all the lines next to New York

3950
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,080
What are all the lines next to New York
 

3951
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,750
What are all the lines next to New York
VWAP? Uh this here is like a lower time

3952
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
VWAP? Uh this here is like a lower time
 

3953
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,910
VWAP? Uh this here is like a lower time
frame algo. This is 24-hour view up.

3954
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:27,920
frame algo. This is 24-hour view up.
 

3955
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,750
frame algo. This is 24-hour view up.
This is previous day close. This is

3956
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760
This is previous day close. This is
 

3957
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,629
This is previous day close. This is
developing weeks point of control.

3958
01:26:34,629 --> 01:26:34,639
developing weeks point of control.
 

3959
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:35,910
developing weeks point of control.
Maybe I can do this one a different

3960
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:35,920
Maybe I can do this one a different
 

3961
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:41,669
Maybe I can do this one a different
color so we can remember that. I do this

3962
01:26:41,669 --> 01:26:41,679

 

3963
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:45,830

pinky. Like that's better.

3964
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,840
pinky. Like that's better.
 

3965
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:52,550
pinky. Like that's better.
So it's like fair value on the week.

3966
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:52,560

 

3967
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,149

down to this same level where these

3968
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:54,159
down to this same level where these
 

3969
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,750
down to this same level where these
sellers keep getting stuck. But we're

3970
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:55,760
sellers keep getting stuck. But we're
 

3971
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,030
sellers keep getting stuck. But we're
not seeing follow through downside.

3972
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:57,040
not seeing follow through downside.
 

3973
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,149
not seeing follow through downside.
We're not seeing follow through upside.

3974
01:26:58,149 --> 01:26:58,159
We're not seeing follow through upside.
 

3975
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:03,430
We're not seeing follow through upside.
We're just seeing chop.

3976
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:03,440

 

3977
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,790

I'm not going to go through volume

3978
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
I'm not going to go through volume
 

3979
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,590
I'm not going to go through volume
profile anymore, guys. Rewind the tape.

3980
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:07,600
profile anymore, guys. Rewind the tape.
 

3981
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,110
profile anymore, guys. Rewind the tape.

3985
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,950
free on YouTube. Honestly, you guys are
asking the same questions over and over

3986
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
asking the same questions over and over
 

3987
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,510
asking the same questions over and over
and over and over and over and over. It

3988
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:15,520
and over and over and over and over. It
 

3989
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,790
and over and over and over and over. It
is absolutely ridiculous.

3990
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:18,800
is absolutely ridiculous.
 

3991
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,189
is absolutely ridiculous.
Read Nightbot. Nightbot literally tells

This is thickened up a bit. We can do

This is thickened up a bit. We can do

Oh, come on. They trapped under 400s the

Oh, come on. They trapped under 400s the
 

4005

Oh, come on. They trapped under 400s the
last few times. We're just in this is

4006
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:47,199
last few times. We're just in this is
 

4007
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,030
last few times. We're just in this is
the chop zone while they decide what the

01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:49,040
the chop zone while they decide what the
 

4009
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:54,470

bloody hell they're going to do with it.

01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,830

And I recommend a copy trader.

And I recommend a copy trader.

And I recommend a copy trader.
Affordable indicators, I would say, is

Affordable indicators, I would say, is
 

4015
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:03,990
Affordable indicators, I would say, is
probably the best copy trader right now.

PDC but it just looks awful on a
 

4025
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,990

4033
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:55,669

Did we break the high there? Delta-wise,

4034
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:55,679
Did we break the high there? Delta-wise,
 

4035
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,990
Did we break the high there? Delta-wise,
we did, which means there's passive

4036
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
we did, which means there's passive
 

4037
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,590
we did, which means there's passive
sellers up there because we broke it and

4038
01:28:59,590 --> 01:28:59,600
sellers up there because we broke it and
 

4039
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:11,990
sellers up there because we broke it and
didn't move higher so far.

4040
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:12,000

 

4041
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,870

This is ugly. ES keeps finding a bid in

4042
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:14,880
This is ugly. ES keeps finding a bid in
 

4043
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,430
This is ugly. ES keeps finding a bid in
front of new or VWAP. This is ugly right

4044
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:17,440
front of new or VWAP. This is ugly right
 

4045
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,550
front of new or VWAP. This is ugly right
now. Thank goodness. Leaving this alone

4046
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:20,560
now. Thank goodness. Leaving this alone
 

4047
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,110
now. Thank goodness. Leaving this alone
for me. This is exactly what I don't

4048
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:23,120
for me. This is exactly what I don't
 

4049
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,270
for me. This is exactly what I don't
like trading when the market doesn't

4050
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:25,280
like trading when the market doesn't
 

4051
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,870
like trading when the market doesn't
know what it wants to do. So, it has to

4052
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:26,880
know what it wants to do. So, it has to
 

4053
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,709
know what it wants to do. So, it has to
build out liquidity. I think we should

4054
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719
build out liquidity. I think we should
 

4055
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,950
build out liquidity. I think we should
move higher, but I it's clear that we're

4056
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
move higher, but I it's clear that we're
 

4057
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,510
move higher, but I it's clear that we're
not.

4058
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
not.
 

4059
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,070
not.
But I sold into that run into a previous

4060
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,080
But I sold into that run into a previous
 

4061
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,629
But I sold into that run into a previous
week value high. I they should really

4062
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:38,639
week value high. I they should really
 

4063
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,310
week value high. I they should really
come and clean out the highs and give a

4064
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
come and clean out the highs and give a
 

4065
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,750
come and clean out the highs and give a
better auction at that high in my

4066
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:41,760
better auction at that high in my
 

4067
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,830
better auction at that high in my
opinion. But ES has already done it and

4068
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:45,840
opinion. But ES has already done it and
 

4069
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,110
opinion. But ES has already done it and
that seems to be leading right now.

4070
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120
that seems to be leading right now.
 

4071
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,910
that seems to be leading right now.
ES swipe barely. I mean

4072
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:51,920
ES swipe barely. I mean
 

4073
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:57,510
ES swipe barely. I mean
705s to 70625s. I mean it's enough. It's

4074
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:57,520
705s to 70625s. I mean it's enough. It's
 

4075
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,950
705s to 70625s. I mean it's enough. It's
more about what happened after it

4076
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:58,960
more about what happened after it
 

4077
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,110
more about what happened after it
swiped. It's pretty decent rejection

4078
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,120
swiped. It's pretty decent rejection
 

4079
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,470
swiped. It's pretty decent rejection
right on the ES.

4080
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:04,480
right on the ES.
 

4081
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:12,390
right on the ES.
We'll see. We will see.

4082
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:12,400

 

4083
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,550

Back to these 400s like this area where

4084
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
Back to these 400s like this area where
 

4085
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,070
Back to these 400s like this area where
I keep saying the buyers kept getting

4086
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
I keep saying the buyers kept getting
 

4087
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,990
I keep saying the buyers kept getting
stuck. Sorry, sellers keep getting

4088
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,000
stuck. Sorry, sellers keep getting
 

4089
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,629
stuck. Sorry, sellers keep getting
stuck. Buyers now can't get through it.

4090
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:20,639
stuck. Buyers now can't get through it.
 

4091
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,950
stuck. Buyers now can't get through it.
So right here you can see just like we

4092
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:22,960
So right here you can see just like we
 

4093
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,229
So right here you can see just like we
are struggling. Buyers keep getting

4094
01:30:24,229 --> 01:30:24,239
are struggling. Buyers keep getting
 

4095
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:25,669
are struggling. Buyers keep getting
stuck over it. Sellers keep getting

4096
01:30:25,669 --> 01:30:25,679
stuck over it. Sellers keep getting
 

4097
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:27,750
stuck over it. Sellers keep getting
stuck under it. We can't make a decision

4098
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:27,760
stuck under it. We can't make a decision
 

4099
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,910
stuck under it. We can't make a decision
here. Then price is stuck here. It's why

4100
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:29,920
here. Then price is stuck here. It's why
 

4101
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,470
here. Then price is stuck here. It's why
it's become point of control. It's fair

4102
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:32,480
it's become point of control. It's fair
 

4103
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:38,790
it's become point of control. It's fair
value at the moment.

4104
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:38,800

 

4105
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,910

How annoyed would you be if I accuse you

get through this key level. They've got
 

4307
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,830
get through this key level. They've got
to get through this gray box right into

01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:11,840
to get through this gray box right into
 

4309
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,990
to get through this gray box right into
the edge of range and failing. Still

4310
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:14,000
the edge of range and failing. Still
 

4311
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,189
the edge of range and failing. Still
think they've got a chance to come and

think they've got a chance to come and
 

4313
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:17,109
think they've got a chance to come and
clean this out. It just depends how long

clean this out. It just depends how long
 

4315
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:18,310
clean this out. It just depends how long
they're going to mess around with all

they're going to mess around with all

01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,470

Can we keep going here? Is the market

4346

Can we keep going here? Is the market
 

4347
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,310
Can we keep going here? Is the market
going to give a clear out of these highs

4348
01:37:58,310 --> 01:37:58,320
going to give a clear out of these highs
 

4349
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,629
going to give a clear out of these highs
or not on the cues? Yes. Still can't get

up there.

4352

4353
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,910

It's trying. It's just chopping between

4354
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
It's trying. It's just chopping between
 

4355
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,229
It's trying. It's just chopping between
this gray box and this one here. I don't

4356
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:10,239
this gray box and this one here. I don't
 

4357
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,629
this gray box and this one here. I don't
like the highs up here. I really don't

4358
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,639
like the highs up here. I really don't
 

4359
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,030
like the highs up here. I really don't
think we have enough excess here. I

4360
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:15,040
think we have enough excess here. I
 

4361
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,950
think we have enough excess here. I
would like to see a spike into here, but

4362
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:16,960
would like to see a spike into here, but
 

4363
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,750
would like to see a spike into here, but
the Q's just can't get going now. Just

4364
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:19,760
the Q's just can't get going now. Just
 

4365
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,830
the Q's just can't get going now. Just
look at this trapping action. It's

4366
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,840
look at this trapping action. It's
 

4367
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:26,550
look at this trapping action. It's
awful. It's absolutely awful.

4368
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:26,560
awful. It's absolutely awful.
 

4369
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,550
awful. It's absolutely awful.
There we go. Back downside we go now.

4370
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:28,560
There we go. Back downside we go now.
 

4371
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,669
There we go. Back downside we go now.
Jesus Christ. Make your mind up, market.

4372
01:38:31,669 --> 01:38:31,679
Jesus Christ. Make your mind up, market.
 

4373
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,510
Jesus Christ. Make your mind up, market.
I'm only interested in short if we fail

4374
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:33,520
I'm only interested in short if we fail
 

4375
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,950
I'm only interested in short if we fail
to break out up here. The fact that

4376
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:34,960
to break out up here. The fact that
 

4377
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,629
to break out up here. The fact that
we're holding in here, it just doesn't

4378
01:38:36,629 --> 01:38:36,639
we're holding in here, it just doesn't
 

4379
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:39,270
we're holding in here, it just doesn't
make me like it very much. Honestly, I

4380
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:39,280
make me like it very much. Honestly, I
 

4381
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,550
make me like it very much. Honestly, I
don't want to trade it

4382
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:42,560
don't want to trade it
 

4383
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,149
don't want to trade it
because they can keep protecting down

4384
01:38:44,149 --> 01:38:44,159
because they can keep protecting down
 

4385
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:47,189
because they can keep protecting down
here. So, I need to get an extreme edge

4386
01:38:47,189 --> 01:38:47,199
here. So, I need to get an extreme edge
 

4387
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,950
here. So, I need to get an extreme edge
if I'm going to fade back inside for

4388
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,960
if I'm going to fade back inside for
 

4389
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,790
if I'm going to fade back inside for
what I'm looking for personally.

4390
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,800
what I'm looking for personally.
 

4391
01:38:52,800 --> 01:39:06,470
what I'm looking for personally.
Personally,

4392
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:06,480

 

4393
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,109

oh my god, you're so dumb. You're so

4394
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:09,119
oh my god, you're so dumb. You're so
 

4395
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:12,550
oh my god, you're so dumb. You're so
dumb. It's not a macro between 950 and

4396
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:12,560
dumb. It's not a macro between 950 and
 

4397
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,790
dumb. It's not a macro between 950 and
10:10. It is just an hourly close.

4398
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:16,800
10:10. It is just an hourly close.
 

4399

Stop listening to this [\h__\h] mate.

4401
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,430
Stop listening to this [\h__\h] mate.
It's an hourly close, a 4hour close. A

4402
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:23,440
It's an hourly close, a 4hour close. A
 

4403
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,950
It's an hourly close, a 4hour close. A
macro is a madeup [\h__\h] term. Okay?

4404
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:26,960
macro is a madeup [\h__\h] term. Okay?
 

4405
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,070
macro is a madeup [\h__\h] term. Okay?
It's just made up. It's an hourly bar

4406
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:30,080
It's just made up. It's an hourly bar
 

4407
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,189
It's just made up. It's an hourly bar
close. Which means on that close you

4408
01:39:33,189 --> 01:39:33,199
close. Which means on that close you
 

4409
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:36,709
close. Which means on that close you
have a high low open close of an hour, a

4410
01:39:36,709 --> 01:39:36,719
have a high low open close of an hour, a
 

4411

have a high low open close of an hour, a
4 hour, a 30 minute, a 15 minute, a five

What would I look for for sales? There's

01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:04,560
What would I look for for sales? There's
 

4515
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,070
What would I look for for sales? There's
two things, but I think it's very, very

4516
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:06,080
two things, but I think it's very, very
 

4517
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,870
two things, but I think it's very, very
trappy to look for sells. I would like

4518
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:08,880
trappy to look for sells. I would like
 

4519
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,270
trappy to look for sells. I would like
this to be traded into up here. All

4520
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:11,280
this to be traded into up here. All
 

4521
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,030
this to be traded into up here. All
right. I would like them to clear out

4522
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:13,040
right. I would like them to clear out
 

4523
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:16,310
right. I would like them to clear out
all of this and trap buyers up here and

4524
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:16,320
all of this and trap buyers up here and
 

4525
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,390
all of this and trap buyers up here and
expand the range and have a good auction

4526
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:18,400
expand the range and have a good auction
 

4527
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,310
expand the range and have a good auction
of the high where buyers are stuck and

4528
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:20,320
of the high where buyers are stuck and
 

4529
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,990
of the high where buyers are stuck and
then look to fade back down into the

4530
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:22,000
then look to fade back down into the
 

4531
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,390
then look to fade back down into the
range. The issue for me is how we've

4532
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:24,400
range. The issue for me is how we've
 

4533
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,990
range. The issue for me is how we've
built out this liquidity is if you are

4534
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
built out this liquidity is if you are
 

4535
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,669
built out this liquidity is if you are
looking for sells breaking down from

4536
01:43:27,669 --> 01:43:27,679
looking for sells breaking down from
 

4537
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:29,910
looking for sells breaking down from
here and they decide to hold here, you

4538
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:29,920
here and they decide to hold here, you
 

4539
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,070
here and they decide to hold here, you
have no RR. If they let go of this,

4540
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,080
have no RR. If they let go of this,
 

4541
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,910
have no RR. If they let go of this,
yeah, there's a move down to here. But

4542
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:33,920
yeah, there's a move down to here. But
 

4543
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,990
yeah, there's a move down to here. But
the way they're building structurally,

4544
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,000
the way they're building structurally,
 

4545
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,990
the way they're building structurally,
the way they've built out volume, it's

4546
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:38,000
the way they've built out volume, it's
 

4547
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,430
the way they've built out volume, it's
not great right now to do anything.

4548
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:43,440

4551
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:46,629
He really said he was kidnapped to show
how the market works. Oh yeah, he was

4552
01:43:46,629 --> 01:43:46,639
how the market works. Oh yeah, he was
 

4553
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,550
how the market works. Oh yeah, he was
chucked in a white van and God came down

4554
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:48,560
chucked in a white van and God came down
 

4555
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,990
chucked in a white van and God came down
and talked to him and shown him how it

4556
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:50,000
and talked to him and shown him how it
 

4557
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,790
and talked to him and shown him how it
works and then he wrote the algorithm.

4558
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:52,800
works and then he wrote the algorithm.
 

4559
01:43:52,800 --> 01:44:04,790
works and then he wrote the algorithm.
That's really what he said.

4614
01:45:22,629 --> 01:45:22,639
going to leave this and wash right the
 

4615
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:29,669
going to leave this and wash right the
way down? That's the big question.

4616
01:45:29,669 --> 01:45:29,679

 

4617
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,750

Here's the wash. So, back down into

4618
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:31,760
Here's the wash. So, back down into
 

4619
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,430
Here's the wash. So, back down into
value area low for the current session

4620
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,440
value area low for the current session
 

4621
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,189
value area low for the current session
like I said and PDC. Now, the question

4622
01:45:35,189 --> 01:45:35,199
like I said and PDC. Now, the question
 

4623
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,750
like I said and PDC. Now, the question
is if they don't bid here, there is a

4624
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:37,760
is if they don't bid here, there is a
 

4625
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,270
is if they don't bid here, there is a
move down to 300. So, I'm not going to

4626
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:39,280
move down to 300. So, I'm not going to
 

4627
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,109
move down to 300. So, I'm not going to
play it. We are thin in this move out.

4628
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:41,119
play it. We are thin in this move out.
 

4629
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:43,189
play it. We are thin in this move out.
Remember, this was a squeeze up. This is

4630
01:45:43,189 --> 01:45:43,199
Remember, this was a squeeze up. This is
 

4631
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,189
Remember, this was a squeeze up. This is
where all the volume is. We've failed to

4632
01:45:45,189 --> 01:45:45,199
where all the volume is. We've failed to
 

4633
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:46,870
where all the volume is. We've failed to
break out above this volume. At the

4634
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:46,880
break out above this volume. At the
 

4635
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,390
break out above this volume. At the
moment, we're breaking out below it, but

4636
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:48,400
moment, we're breaking out below it, but
 

4637
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,550
moment, we're breaking out below it, but
there's been no back test and leave. So

4638
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:50,560
there's been no back test and leave. So
 

4639
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,229
there's been no back test and leave. So
really the question is do they come down

4640
01:45:52,229 --> 01:45:52,239
really the question is do they come down
 

4641
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:54,310
really the question is do they come down
here for this or not. I'm not playing it

4642
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:54,320
here for this or not. I'm not playing it
 

4643
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,390
here for this or not. I'm not playing it
either way. Like I'm quite happy with

4644
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:56,400
either way. Like I'm quite happy with
 

4645
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,990
either way. Like I'm quite happy with
how this day's progressed. I don't need

4646
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000
how this day's progressed. I don't need
 

4647
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,030
how this day's progressed. I don't need
to be forcing into anything right now.

4648
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:01,040
to be forcing into anything right now.
 

4649
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,629
to be forcing into anything right now.
Let them build out the volume. In my

4650
01:46:02,629 --> 01:46:02,639
Let them build out the volume. In my
 

4651
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,470
Let them build out the volume. In my
mind, I'm avoiding trading where there's

4652
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:04,480
mind, I'm avoiding trading where there's
 

4653
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:11,910
mind, I'm avoiding trading where there's
no edge.

4654
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:11,920

 

4655
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,310

Building some imbalances here into that

4656
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:14,320
Building some imbalances here into that
 

4657
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:15,910
Building some imbalances here into that
PDC.

4658
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:15,920
PDC.
 

4659
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,750
PDC.
They can afford a wash lower here if

4660
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:17,760
They can afford a wash lower here if
 

4661
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,510
They can afford a wash lower here if
they want. There are imbalances much

4662
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:19,520
they want. There are imbalances much
 

4663
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,709
they want. There are imbalances much
much lower

4664
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:22,719
much lower
 

4665
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:27,990
much lower
into 34 to 30 and then 98 and then 86es.

4666
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:28,000
into 34 to 30 and then 98 and then 86es.
 

4667
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,510
into 34 to 30 and then 98 and then 86es.
There's lots of imbalances down here. So

4668
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
There's lots of imbalances down here. So
 

4669
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,790
There's lots of imbalances down here. So
they're going to back test VW up here

4670
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:30,800
they're going to back test VW up here
 

4671
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,149
they're going to back test VW up here
and then make a decision by the looks of

4672
01:46:32,149 --> 01:46:32,159
and then make a decision by the looks of
 

4673
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,669
and then make a decision by the looks of
it. Buyers got caught on that little

4674
01:46:33,669 --> 01:46:33,679
it. Buyers got caught on that little
 

4675
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:39,350
it. Buyers got caught on that little
back test on that first shove in.

4676
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:39,360

 

4677
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,910

Do they reclaim now? So I'd be watching

4678
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:41,920
Do they reclaim now? So I'd be watching
 

4679
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,790
Do they reclaim now? So I'd be watching
this shelf up here into 84s if they if

4680
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:44,800
this shelf up here into 84s if they if
 

4681
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,390
this shelf up here into 84s if they if
they could be really nasty and just dump

4682
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:46,400
they could be really nasty and just dump
 

4683
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,629
they could be really nasty and just dump
this here. Where are we trading at on

4684
01:46:48,629 --> 01:46:48,639
this here. Where are we trading at on
 

4685
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:51,030
this here. Where are we trading at on
the spy? SPY is into 95. So into that

4686
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:51,040
the spy? SPY is into 95. So into that
 

4687
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,629
the spy? SPY is into 95. So into that
gamma level. These are big levels,

4688
01:46:52,629 --> 01:46:52,639
gamma level. These are big levels,
 

4689
01:46:52,639 --> 01:47:06,870
gamma level. These are big levels,
folks. These are really big levels.

4690
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:06,880

 

4691
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,709

And here comes the back test. Here comes

4692
01:47:08,709 --> 01:47:08,719
And here comes the back test. Here comes
 

4693
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:11,590
And here comes the back test. Here comes
that back test.

4694
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:11,600
that back test.
 

4695
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,590
that back test.
So in towards the 80s will be the back

4696
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:13,600
So in towards the 80s will be the back
 

4697
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,270
So in towards the 80s will be the back
test. And how they operate once they get

4698
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:15,280
test. And how they operate once they get
 

4699
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,950
test. And how they operate once they get
there will be absolutely vital. If

4700
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:16,960
there will be absolutely vital. If
 

4701
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,189
there will be absolutely vital. If
they've just trapped down here right for

4702
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:19,199
they've just trapped down here right for
 

4703
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:20,950
they've just trapped down here right for
a wash, we're coming into this back test

4704
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:20,960
a wash, we're coming into this back test
 

4705
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,390
a wash, we're coming into this back test
now. They will need to make a decision

4706
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:22,400
now. They will need to make a decision
 

4707
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,310
now. They will need to make a decision
here. If they rip through this, we're

4708
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:24,320
here. If they rip through this, we're
 

4709
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,510
here. If they rip through this, we're
going to go right the way back to the

4710
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:25,520
going to go right the way back to the
 

4711
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,910
going to go right the way back to the
top side of this 400s and then another

4712
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
top side of this 400s and then another
 

4713
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,189
top side of this 400s and then another
squeeze is on. If they've just trapped

4714
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:29,199
squeeze is on. If they've just trapped
 

4715
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,270
squeeze is on. If they've just trapped
enough sellers down here, it's a big if.

4716
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:31,280
enough sellers down here, it's a big if.
 

4717
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,550
enough sellers down here, it's a big if.
But if they have just trapped enough

4718
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:32,560
But if they have just trapped enough
 

4719
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:33,590
But if they have just trapped enough
sellers down here, it's what they're

4720
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:33,600
sellers down here, it's what they're
 

4721
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,590
sellers down here, it's what they're
trying to do. This is why I'm saying I'm

4722
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:35,600
trying to do. This is why I'm saying I'm
 

4723
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,270
trying to do. This is why I'm saying I'm
not convinced. We just talked about this

4724
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:37,280
not convinced. We just talked about this
 

4725
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:38,550
not convinced. We just talked about this
because if you're playing the trade from

4726
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:38,560
because if you're playing the trade from
 

4727
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,990
because if you're playing the trade from
there, all you've got is to this value

4728
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,000
there, all you've got is to this value
 

4729
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,709
there, all you've got is to this value
area low. So, we have so many stacked

4730
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:42,719
area low. So, we have so many stacked
 

4731
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:44,870
area low. So, we have so many stacked
levels here. If we look at this value

4732
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880
levels here. If we look at this value
 

4733

01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:22,310
today and in this morning is up into
there.

4768
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:22,320
there.
 

4769
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,669
there.
That is based on what I was looking at

4770
01:48:23,669 --> 01:48:23,679
That is based on what I was looking at
 

4771
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:28,070
That is based on what I was looking at
on the hourly, those hourly pivots

4772
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:28,080

 

4773
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,070

right into here, right? Where all those

4774
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:30,080
right into here, right? Where all those
 

4775
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,990
right into here, right? Where all those
short sellers have their stops, right?

4776
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:32,000
short sellers have their stops, right?
 

4777
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,750
short sellers have their stops, right?
This is where they pivoted out. So, this

4778
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:33,760
This is where they pivoted out. So, this
 

4779
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,590
This is where they pivoted out. So, this
is our first test of this since leaving.

4780
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:35,600
is our first test of this since leaving.
 

4781
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,149
is our first test of this since leaving.
If we think about this breakdown,

4782
01:48:38,149 --> 01:48:38,159
If we think about this breakdown,
 

4783
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,390
If we think about this breakdown,
breakdown, failed to break lower, pull

4784
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:40,400
breakdown, failed to break lower, pull
 

4785
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,070
breakdown, failed to break lower, pull
back held, wash, pull back held. I think

4786
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:44,080
back held, wash, pull back held. I think
 

4787
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,510
back held, wash, pull back held. I think
we're trying to come into this and run

4788
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:45,520
we're trying to come into this and run
 

4789
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:47,350
we're trying to come into this and run
these stops. I think there will be a

4790
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:47,360
these stops. I think there will be a
 

4791
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,910
these stops. I think there will be a
bull trap in this area here. That's what

4792
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:49,920
bull trap in this area here. That's what
 

4793
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,830
bull trap in this area here. That's what
I think.

4794
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:53,840

 

4795
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,750

anything else.

4800
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:08,320

uh value area high right here. So that

4810
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:20,000
uh value area high right here. So that
 

4811
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,070
uh value area high right here. So that
was my final TP,

the best state. So, if someone comes and
talks [\h__\h] they're going to [\h__\h] get

4922
01:51:46,229 --> 01:51:46,239
talks [\h__\h] they're going to [\h__\h] get
 

4923
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:48,070
talks [\h__\h] they're going to [\h__\h] get
it cuz I have no patience at the moment.

4924
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
it cuz I have no patience at the moment.
 

4925
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:51,350
it cuz I have no patience at the moment.
I'm not the best version of myself. So,

4926
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:51,360
I'm not the best version of myself. So,
 

4927
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,910
I'm not the best version of myself. So,
you will get a clapback and I'm not

4928
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:53,920
you will get a clapback and I'm not
 

4929
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,830
you will get a clapback and I'm not
going to say sorry for it. If you want

4930
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:55,840
going to say sorry for it. If you want
 

4931
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,669
going to say sorry for it. If you want
to come to my stream and talk [\h__\h] when

4932
01:51:57,669 --> 01:51:57,679
to come to my stream and talk [\h__\h] when
 

4933
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:59,830
to come to my stream and talk [\h__\h] when
I'm trying to deliver you when to trade,

4934
01:51:59,830 --> 01:51:59,840
I'm trying to deliver you when to trade,
 

4935
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:01,830
I'm trying to deliver you when to trade,
when to leave alone, then you're going

4936
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:01,840
when to leave alone, then you're going
 

4937
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:06,149
when to leave alone, then you're going
to get clap back.

4938
01:52:06,149 --> 01:52:06,159

 

4939
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:07,669

What's the max higher think they can go

4940
01:52:07,669 --> 01:52:07,679
What's the max higher think they can go
 

4941
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:09,990
What's the max higher think they can go
for? If they really really go for it, I

4942
01:52:09,990 --> 01:52:10,000
for? If they really really go for it, I
 

4943
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,030
for? If they really really go for it, I
don't think I don't know if you're

4944
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,040
don't think I don't know if you're
 

4945
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,870
don't think I don't know if you're
talking about today, but up here into

4946
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:12,880
talking about today, but up here into
 

4947
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,709
talking about today, but up here into
800 will be a fresh back test,

4948
01:52:16,709 --> 01:52:16,719
800 will be a fresh back test,
 

4949
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:19,350
800 will be a fresh back test,
right? which is that is an absolute

4950
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:19,360
right? which is that is an absolute
 

4951
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:23,030
right? which is that is an absolute
mustdeend level. It is a mustdeend level

4952
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
mustdeend level. It is a mustdeend level
 

4953
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:26,870
mustdeend level. It is a mustdeend level
for bears. All right, this

4954
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:26,880
for bears. All right, this
 

4955
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,070
for bears. All right, this
it's an old PC

4956
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,080
it's an old PC
 

4957
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,470
it's an old PC
on a weekly. Look at this node here. It

4958
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:32,480
on a weekly. Look at this node here. It
 

4959
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,229
on a weekly. Look at this node here. It
lines up with this. It's a huge level

4960
01:52:34,229 --> 01:52:34,239
lines up with this. It's a huge level
 

4961
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:37,109
lines up with this. It's a huge level
800s, right? If we are going to do this

4962
01:52:37,109 --> 01:52:37,119
800s, right? If we are going to do this
 

4963
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:39,910
800s, right? If we are going to do this
whole thing back,

4964
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:39,920
whole thing back,
 

4965
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,790
whole thing back,
right? This has to be defended. If if no

4966
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:42,800
right? This has to be defended. If if no
 

4967
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,870
right? This has to be defended. If if no
bull trap is set here, bears must defend

4968
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:44,880
bull trap is set here, bears must defend
 

4969
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,030
bull trap is set here, bears must defend
that. If bears don't defend that, we

4970
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:47,040
that. If bears don't defend that, we
 

4971
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:49,589
that. If bears don't defend that, we
will break out. Like, it's just too

4972
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:49,599
will break out. Like, it's just too
 

4973
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,350
will break out. Like, it's just too
much. If we start getting over that, we

4974
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360
much. If we start getting over that, we
 

4975
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,709
much. If we start getting over that, we
will break out. There's just too much

4976
01:52:52,709 --> 01:52:52,719
will break out. There's just too much
 

4977
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:54,470
will break out. There's just too much
momentum being allowed to come back in

4978
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:54,480
momentum being allowed to come back in
 

4979
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,629
momentum being allowed to come back in
at the moment. All right, we can think

4980
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:56,639
at the moment. All right, we can think
 

4981
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,870
at the moment. All right, we can think
about this as a retest into here to

4982
01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:58,880
about this as a retest into here to
 

4983
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,270
about this as a retest into here to
sell. Ideally, a little trap to sell and

4984
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:01,280
sell. Ideally, a little trap to sell and
 

4985
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:02,709
sell. Ideally, a little trap to sell and
then we'll be covering some back down

4986
01:53:02,709 --> 01:53:02,719
then we'll be covering some back down
 

4987
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:04,790
then we'll be covering some back down
into here and holding runners if there's

4988
01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:04,800
into here and holding runners if there's
 

4989
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,750
into here and holding runners if there's
follow through. If there's no follow

4990
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:05,760
follow through. If there's no follow
 

4991
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,510
follow through. If there's no follow
through, that's fine. But 800,

4992
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:09,520
through, that's fine. But 800,
 

4993
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:13,350
through, that's fine. But 800,
it's a big level.

4994
01:53:13,350 --> 01:53:13,360

 

4995
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,990

It's big because last night in my dream,

4996
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:16,000
It's big because last night in my dream,
 

4997
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,070
It's big because last night in my dream,
I got kidnapped in a white van and God

4998
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:18,080
I got kidnapped in a white van and God
 

4999
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,070
I got kidnapped in a white van and God
told me it was a big level. So, I just

5000
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:20,080
told me it was a big level. So, I just
 

5001
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:29,669
told me it was a big level. So, I just
marked it out for the sake of it.

5002
01:53:29,669 --> 01:53:29,679

 

5003
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:31,750

Yeah, Larry, it's it's tough, man. Yeah,

5004
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:31,760
Yeah, Larry, it's it's tough, man. Yeah,
 

5005
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:38,790
Yeah, Larry, it's it's tough, man. Yeah,
it's really tough.

5006
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:38,800

 

5007
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:49,830

How old am I? I'm 40. I'm 40.

5008
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:49,840

 

5009
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:50,950

Yeah, it's all right. It's just part of

5010
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:50,960
Yeah, it's all right. It's just part of
 

5011
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,629
Yeah, it's all right. It's just part of
life. Like life's not always smooth,

5012
01:53:52,629 --> 01:53:52,639
life. Like life's not always smooth,
 

5013
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:55,030
life. Like life's not always smooth,
right? Good with the bad,

5014
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:55,040

5015
01:53:55,040 --> 01:54:02,310

01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:08,320
asking questions. It's just when people
 

5023
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,870

Is it possible to chop that? Yeah,
 

5047
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,109
Is it possible to chop that? Yeah,

an inside bar. We're inside value. We
 

5051
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:05,990
an inside bar. We're inside value. We
went over this at the very beginning of

5052
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
went over this at the very beginning of
 

5053
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,589
went over this at the very beginning of
the show. Remember my what we

5054
01:55:07,589 --> 01:55:07,599
the show. Remember my what we
 

5055
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:09,430
the show. Remember my what we
anticipated today. Maybe some of you

5056
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:09,440
anticipated today. Maybe some of you
 

5057
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,270
anticipated today. Maybe some of you
have forgotten. All right. We're an

5058
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:11,280
have forgotten. All right. We're an
 

5059
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,270
have forgotten. All right. We're an
inside bar. Really, we failed to break

5060
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:13,280
inside bar. Really, we failed to break
 

5061
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,950
inside bar. Really, we failed to break
out of the highs, right? We've washed

5062
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:14,960
out of the highs, right? We've washed
 

5063
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,750
out of the highs, right? We've washed
it. There's a little wick. All right.

5064
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:17,760
it. There's a little wick. All right.
 

5065
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,830
it. There's a little wick. All right.
But really, if we can't find acceptance

5066
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:19,840
But really, if we can't find acceptance
 

5067
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:21,510
But really, if we can't find acceptance
above here, this is a big level, isn't

5068
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:21,520
above here, this is a big level, isn't
 

5069
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,390
above here, this is a big level, isn't
it? All right.

5070
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:24,400
it? All right.
 

5071
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:27,830
it? All right.
We can very easily traverse in here. And

5072
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,840
We can very easily traverse in here. And
 

5073
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,270
We can very easily traverse in here. And
the moment we're holding top side of it,

5074
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:29,280
the moment we're holding top side of it,
 

5075
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,510
the moment we're holding top side of it,
we can easily easily easily do that.

5076
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:31,520
we can easily easily easily do that.
 

5077
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,189
we can easily easily easily do that.
Once we go from that and we go to the

5078
01:55:33,189 --> 01:55:33,199
Once we go from that and we go to the
 

5079
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:34,709
Once we go from that and we go to the
hourlys,

5080
01:55:34,709 --> 01:55:34,719
hourlys,
 

5081
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:37,510
hourlys,
we're inside previous days value, right?

5082
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:37,520
we're inside previous days value, right?
 

5083
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:41,270
we're inside previous days value, right?
So inside

5084
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,280

 

5085
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:46,629

we're inside previous week's value

5086
01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:46,639

 

5087
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,550

we're inside previous current week's

5088
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:48,560
we're inside previous current week's
 

5089
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:52,070
we're inside previous current week's
value. We're inside previous days value.

5090
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:52,080
value. We're inside previous days value.
 

5091
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,070
value. We're inside previous days value.
Right? It's very very very possible,

5092
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:54,080
Right? It's very very very possible,
 

5093
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:56,390
Right? It's very very very possible,
isn't it, that we just do this all day.

5094
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:56,400
isn't it, that we just do this all day.
 

5095
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,750
isn't it, that we just do this all day.
Okay. And like I said to you, I wouldn't

5096
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:57,760
Okay. And like I said to you, I wouldn't
 

5097
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:59,510
Okay. And like I said to you, I wouldn't
be surprised as some form of megaphone

5098
01:55:59,510 --> 01:55:59,520
be surprised as some form of megaphone
 

5099
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,030
be surprised as some form of megaphone
pattern up here. All right. It would not

5100
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,040
pattern up here. All right. It would not
 

5101
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,589
pattern up here. All right. It would not
surprise me to see this build out,

5102
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:03,599
surprise me to see this build out,
 

5103
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:05,669
surprise me to see this build out,
right? While they decide what they're

5104
01:56:05,669 --> 01:56:05,679
right? While they decide what they're
 

5105
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,990
right? While they decide what they're
doing. All right. They can trap up here.

5106
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:08,000
doing. All right. They can trap up here.
 

5107
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,070
doing. All right. They can trap up here.
They can trap down here. But the main

5108
01:56:10,070 --> 01:56:10,080
They can trap down here. But the main
 

5109
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,830
They can trap down here. But the main
trend has been down, but we did hit the

5110
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:11,840
trend has been down, but we did hit the
 

5111
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,750
trend has been down, but we did hit the
200 day. The bigger question is, is tech

5112
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:13,760
200 day. The bigger question is, is tech
 

5113
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,350
200 day. The bigger question is, is tech
going to sell off? Are the ETFs going to

5114
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:15,360
going to sell off? Are the ETFs going to
 

5115
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:18,070
going to sell off? Are the ETFs going to
catch up to get to those 200 days? We'll

5116
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:18,080
catch up to get to those 200 days? We'll
 

5117
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:23,750
catch up to get to those 200 days? We'll
see.

5118
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:23,760

 

5119
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:26,229

I'm a honorable person. Oh, thank you. I

person. I was like, you might have a
 

5125
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,589

point. Do I watch football? If so,

5126
01:56:31,589 --> 01:56:31,599
point. Do I watch football? If so,
 

5127
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:33,189

Okay, we said we're going to be pinned,

5196
01:58:20,629 --> 01:58:20,639
Okay, we said we're going to be pinned,
 

5197
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:22,070
Okay, we said we're going to be pinned,
right? Here's your range. They've

5198
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:22,080
right? Here's your range. They've
 

5199
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:25,270
right? Here's your range. They've
they've showed you the range, right? The

5200
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:25,280
they've showed you the range, right? The
 

5201
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,350
they've showed you the range, right? The
trend the last few days has been up,

5202
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:27,360
trend the last few days has been up,
 

5203
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:32,070
trend the last few days has been up,
right? So, we look for a trap where

5204
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:32,080
right? So, we look for a trap where
 

5205
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:33,830
right? So, we look for a trap where
shorts get stuck to trade the other

5206
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:33,840
shorts get stuck to trade the other
 

5207
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,550
shorts get stuck to trade the other
side. You can argue that this is the top

5208
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:36,560
side. You can argue that this is the top
 

5209
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,830
side. You can argue that this is the top
side of the range and then we'll come

5210
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:37,840
side of the range and then we'll come
 

5211
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:40,149
side of the range and then we'll come
back down. The only danger for that for

5212
01:58:40,149 --> 01:58:40,159
back down. The only danger for that for
 

5213
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:42,310
back down. The only danger for that for
me in that move like I've talked about

5214
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:42,320
me in that move like I've talked about
 

5215
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:45,510
me in that move like I've talked about
is if we go back far enough

5216
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:45,520
is if we go back far enough
 

5217
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,350
is if we go back far enough
there are these stops here which I think

5218
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:47,360
there are these stops here which I think
 

5219
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:50,709
there are these stops here which I think
are ripe. So I'd almost we run those

5220
01:58:50,709 --> 01:58:50,719
are ripe. So I'd almost we run those
 

5221
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:52,629
are ripe. So I'd almost we run those
first before we turn back down. That's

5222
01:58:52,629 --> 01:58:52,639
first before we turn back down. That's
 

5223
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:54,790
first before we turn back down. That's
when I feel safer once they set a bull

5224
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:54,800
when I feel safer once they set a bull
 

5225
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:56,950
when I feel safer once they set a bull
trap above it. But we can just rotate

5226
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:56,960
trap above it. But we can just rotate
 

5227
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:59,430
trap above it. But we can just rotate
all day. It is our expectation is to

5228
01:58:59,430 --> 01:58:59,440
all day. It is our expectation is to
 

5229
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:01,189
all day. It is our expectation is to
rotate all day long. I am probably going

5230
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:01,199
rotate all day long. I am probably going
 

5231
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:03,910
rotate all day long. I am probably going
to be a one and done trader here today.

01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:09,430
But we will see if we pop up here and
trap. Then I'm interested.

5236
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:09,440
trap. Then I'm interested.
 

5237
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:19,189
trap. Then I'm interested.

understand forms of imbalances and gaps
 

5297
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,750
understand forms of imbalances and gaps
are great. The your understanding of

stop looking for every fair value gap to
trade and all this stuff. It's like

5310
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:49,360
trade and all this stuff. It's like
 

5311
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:53,510
trade and all this stuff. It's like
no no fair value gaps can be great but

5312
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:53,520
no no fair value gaps can be great but
 

5313
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,830

back into like some of you would have
 

5319
02:00:59,119 --> 02:01:00,709
back into like some of you would have
because I understood that shorts were

5320
02:01:00,709 --> 02:01:00,719
because I understood that shorts were
 

5321
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:02,870
because I understood that shorts were
trapped and I took the break over it. If

5322
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:02,880
trapped and I took the break over it. If
 

5323
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,070
trapped and I took the break over it. If
you waited for that you would have been

5324

you waited for that you would have been
 

5325
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:06,070
you waited for that you would have been
waiting a long time and the next gap you

5326
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:06,080
waiting a long time and the next gap you
 

5327
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:08,470
waiting a long time and the next gap you
could have taken is here and if it ran

5328
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:08,480
could have taken is here and if it ran
 

5329
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:09,910
could have taken is here and if it ran
that low which it did you would have got

5330
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:09,920
that low which it did you would have got
 

5331
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,669

02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:13,760
All right, here we go.
 

5381
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,950
All right, here we go.
I'm going to clean this up.

5382
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:18,960

 

5383
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,629

Okay.

5384
02:02:22,629 --> 02:02:22,639

 

5385
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:25,589

Trend here for the last few sessions

5386
02:02:25,589 --> 02:02:25,599
Trend here for the last few sessions
 

5387
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:27,350
Trend here for the last few sessions
been upside for relief. I think we can

5388
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:27,360
been upside for relief. I think we can
 

5389
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:29,109
been upside for relief. I think we can
all agree with that, right? Here's your

5390
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:29,119
all agree with that, right? Here's your
 

5391
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:32,070
all agree with that, right? Here's your
upside relief.

5392
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:32,080
upside relief.
 

5393
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:34,390
upside relief.
Yes, upside relief. We know we're coming

5394
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:34,400
Yes, upside relief. We know we're coming
 

5395
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,390
Yes, upside relief. We know we're coming
into supply.

5396
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:36,400
into supply.
 

5397
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:38,870
into supply.
We don't want to buy up here. But if we

5398
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:38,880
We don't want to buy up here. But if we
 

5399
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,030
We don't want to buy up here. But if we
want to be a buyer, there are some areas

5400
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:41,040
want to be a buyer, there are some areas
 

5401
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:43,189
want to be a buyer, there are some areas
where we can think about buying in.

5402
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:43,199
where we can think about buying in.
 

5403
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:47,030
where we can think about buying in.
Those areas would be the edge

5404
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:47,040
Those areas would be the edge
 

5405
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,589
Those areas would be the edge
of a node. All right, the edge of a

5406
02:02:49,589 --> 02:02:49,599
of a node. All right, the edge of a
 

5407
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:52,310
of a node. All right, the edge of a
node. Maybe even a low volume node on

5408
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:52,320
node. Maybe even a low volume node on
 

5409
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:53,750
node. Maybe even a low volume node on
the previous week. All right, we can

5410
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:53,760
the previous week. All right, we can
 

5411
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:55,669
the previous week. All right, we can
watch like all these areas. An edge of a

5412
02:02:55,669 --> 02:02:55,679
watch like all these areas. An edge of a
 

5413
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:57,830
watch like all these areas. An edge of a
node, right? So, we mark those out.

5414
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:57,840
node, right? So, we mark those out.
 

5415
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,510
node, right? So, we mark those out.
Hello, gray box. That's why you get

5416
02:02:59,510 --> 02:02:59,520
Hello, gray box. That's why you get
 

5417
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,870
Hello, gray box. That's why you get
marked out. We can already see overnight

5418
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:02,880
marked out. We can already see overnight
 

5419
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:05,189
marked out. We can already see overnight
every time we can come under here, we

5420
02:03:05,189 --> 02:03:05,199
every time we can come under here, we
 

5421
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:06,950
every time we can come under here, we
are being absorbed, right? So, that's

5422
02:03:06,950 --> 02:03:06,960
are being absorbed, right? So, that's
 

5423
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,030
are being absorbed, right? So, that's
the first thing. What is the location

5424
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:09,040
the first thing. What is the location
 

5425
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,950
the first thing. What is the location
that we're interested in trading in?

5426
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:10,960
that we're interested in trading in?
 

5427
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:13,910
that we're interested in trading in?
Right? We said if we reject 300s,

5428
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:13,920
Right? We said if we reject 300s,
 

5429
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,750
Right? We said if we reject 300s,
there's potentially a trade back down to

5430
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:15,760
there's potentially a trade back down to
 

5431
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,310
there's potentially a trade back down to
here, but we have to be very aware of

5432
02:03:18,310 --> 02:03:18,320
here, but we have to be very aware of
 

5433
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:21,030
here, but we have to be very aware of
under 300, they can trap and go back for

5434
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:21,040
under 300, they can trap and go back for
 

5435
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:23,109
under 300, they can trap and go back for
the upside because that's the easiest

5436
02:03:23,109 --> 02:03:23,119
the upside because that's the easiest
 

5437
02:03:23,119 --> 02:03:25,270
the upside because that's the easiest
move right now. So, the first thing is

5438
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:25,280
move right now. So, the first thing is
 

5439
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:27,830
move right now. So, the first thing is
the location. Once we understand the

5440
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:27,840
the location. Once we understand the
 

5441
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:31,109
the location. Once we understand the
location, we're looking for reactions at

5442
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:31,119
location, we're looking for reactions at
 

5443
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:34,149
location, we're looking for reactions at
levels and how order flow operates. So

5444
02:03:34,149 --> 02:03:34,159
levels and how order flow operates. So
 

5445
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:36,149
levels and how order flow operates. So
if we now go into like even a five

5446
02:03:36,149 --> 02:03:36,159
if we now go into like even a five
 

5447
02:03:36,159 --> 02:03:38,550
if we now go into like even a five

5449
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:42,070
minute chart
all right we sweep as you would call it

5450
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:42,080
all right we sweep as you would call it
 

5451
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:43,990
all right we sweep as you would call it
or we steal liquidity or we run the

5452
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,000
or we steal liquidity or we run the
 

5453
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,830

5455
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:50,550

right and as we leave here right in this

right and as we leave here right in this
 

5457
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,790

whole area here what happens in here

02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:52,800
whole area here what happens in here
 

5459
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,629
whole area here what happens in here
like we talked about breakout shorts

5460
02:03:54,629 --> 02:03:54,639
like we talked about breakout shorts
 

5461
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:57,109
like we talked about breakout shorts
come into the market and bulls this guy

5462
02:03:57,109 --> 02:03:57,119
come into the market and bulls this guy
 

5463
02:03:57,119 --> 02:03:58,870
come into the market and bulls this guy
who was a bull and this guy was a bull

5464
02:03:58,870 --> 02:03:58,880
who was a bull and this guy was a bull
 

5465
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:00,629
who was a bull and this guy was a bull
and this guy was a bull and this guy was

5467
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:03,669
and this guy was a bull and this guy was
a bull they probably stop out so you get

5468
02:04:03,669 --> 02:04:03,679
a bull they probably stop out so you get
 

5469
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:09,109
a bull they probably stop out so you get
lots of sellside delta.

5470
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:09,119
lots of sellside delta.
 

5471
02:04:09,119 --> 02:04:11,910
lots of sellside delta.
What does that mean? It means that you

5472
02:04:11,910 --> 02:04:11,920
What does that mean? It means that you
 

5473
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:15,270
What does that mean? It means that you
get lots of people hitting the bid. Lots

5474
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:15,280
get lots of people hitting the bid. Lots
 

5475
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,109
get lots of people hitting the bid. Lots
of aggressive selling. Market sell,

5476
02:04:17,109 --> 02:04:17,119
of aggressive selling. Market sell,
 

5477

02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:19,280
market sell, market sell, market sell.
 

5479
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:28,310
market sell, market sell, market sell.
What does that look like on the tape?

5480
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:28,320

 

5481
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:33,430

Right. We have heavy CVD and on the tape

5482
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:33,440
Right. We have heavy CVD and on the tape
 

5483
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:36,310
Right. We have heavy CVD and on the tape
here you can see aggressive sellers.

5484
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320
here you can see aggressive sellers.
 

5485
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,470
here you can see aggressive sellers.
Aggressive sellers under 300. Aggressive

5486
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:38,480
Aggressive sellers under 300. Aggressive
 

5487
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,390
Aggressive sellers under 300. Aggressive
sellers. Aggressive sellers. Aggressive

02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:40,400
sellers. Aggressive sellers. Aggressive
 

5489
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,470
sellers. Aggressive sellers. Aggressive
sellers. And at the very low of day,

5490
02:04:42,470 --> 02:04:42,480
sellers. And at the very low of day,
 

5491
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,629
sellers. And at the very low of day,
aggressive sellers. All right. What

5492
02:04:44,629 --> 02:04:44,639
aggressive sellers. All right. What
 

5493
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:46,149
aggressive sellers. All right. What
happens after these aggressive sellers

5494
02:04:46,149 --> 02:04:46,159
happens after these aggressive sellers
 

5495
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:47,510
happens after these aggressive sellers
come in at lower day? What's the

5496
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:47,520
come in at lower day? What's the
 

5497
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,750
come in at lower day? What's the
reaction? Do we move lower? No, we

5498
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:49,760
reaction? Do we move lower? No, we
 

5499
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:51,830
reaction? Do we move lower? No, we
don't. So, what does that mean? That

5500
02:04:51,830 --> 02:04:51,840
don't. So, what does that mean? That
 

5501
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,910
don't. So, what does that mean? That
means right here we have a passive

5502
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:53,920
means right here we have a passive
 

5503
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,430
means right here we have a passive
buyer. Now, if that passive buyer wants

5504
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:55,440
buyer. Now, if that passive buyer wants
 

5505
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,790
buyer. Now, if that passive buyer wants
to step up and start becoming

5506
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:56,800
to step up and start becoming
 

5507
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,709
to step up and start becoming
aggressive, we can start moving price

5508
02:04:58,709 --> 02:04:58,719
aggressive, we can start moving price
 

5509
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:00,550
aggressive, we can start moving price
higher and they start stopping out. And

5510
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:00,560
higher and they start stopping out. And
 

5511
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:03,750
higher and they start stopping out. And
all these guys who were short start to

5512
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:03,760
all these guys who were short start to
 

5513
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,669
all these guys who were short start to
stop out. And that's why we use their

5514
02:05:05,669 --> 02:05:05,679
stop out. And that's why we use their
 

5515
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:08,310
stop out. And that's why we use their
pain at 310s. You would have heard me

5516
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:08,320
pain at 310s. You would have heard me
 

5517
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,830
pain at 310s. You would have heard me
keep calling 310s because they kept

5518
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:09,840
keep calling 310s because they kept
 

5519
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:12,070
keep calling 310s because they kept
getting aggressive here at 310s. I know

5520
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:12,080
getting aggressive here at 310s. I know
 

5521
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:13,510
getting aggressive here at 310s. I know
there's a big chunk. Look at the delta

5522
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,520
there's a big chunk. Look at the delta
 

5523
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:14,709
there's a big chunk. Look at the delta
here. I know there's a big chunk of

5524
02:05:14,709 --> 02:05:14,719
here. I know there's a big chunk of
 

5525
02:05:14,719 --> 02:05:16,070
here. I know there's a big chunk of
sellers here. And if we start taking

5526
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:16,080
sellers here. And if we start taking
 

5527
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:18,149
sellers here. And if we start taking
that out, there's only one way we are

5528
02:05:18,149 --> 02:05:18,159
that out, there's only one way we are
 

5529
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:20,390
that out, there's only one way we are
going to go and that's upside. That is

5530
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:20,400
going to go and that's upside. That is
 

5531
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,470
going to go and that's upside. That is
how they set the trap. They wash the

5532
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:22,480
how they set the trap. They wash the
 

5533
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,149
how they set the trap. They wash the
liquidity. They encourage shorts to come

5534
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:24,159
liquidity. They encourage shorts to come
 

5535
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:26,070
liquidity. They encourage shorts to come
in and then we trade the other way. If

5536
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:26,080
in and then we trade the other way. If
 

5537
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:28,390
in and then we trade the other way. If
you were waiting for a tap back in here

5538
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:28,400
you were waiting for a tap back in here
 

5539
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,229
you were waiting for a tap back in here
today, it ain't never going to come.

5540
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:30,239
today, it ain't never going to come.
 

5541
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:31,430
today, it ain't never going to come.
Maybe it comes towards the end of the

5542
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:31,440
Maybe it comes towards the end of the
 

5543
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,910
Maybe it comes towards the end of the
day, but when we leave aggressively

5544
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:33,920
day, but when we leave aggressively
 

5545
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:36,149
day, but when we leave aggressively
because a seller is stuck, we will not

5546
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:36,159
because a seller is stuck, we will not
 

5547
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:38,070
because a seller is stuck, we will not
come back and revisit that area because

5548
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:38,080
come back and revisit that area because
 

5549
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:41,830
come back and revisit that area because
they will be rushing to hit cover. All

5550
02:05:41,830 --> 02:05:41,840
they will be rushing to hit cover. All
 

5551
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,589
they will be rushing to hit cover. All
right? If they are short here or here,

5552
02:05:45,589 --> 02:05:45,599
right? If they are short here or here,
 

5553
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:47,990
right? If they are short here or here,
they will be rushing to hit buy to get

5554
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:48,000
they will be rushing to hit buy to get
 

5555
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,910
they will be rushing to hit buy to get
out of the position. We are not going to

5556
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:49,920
out of the position. We are not going to
 

5557
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,750
out of the position. We are not going to
come back down and pick that up again in

5558
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:51,760
come back down and pick that up again in
 

5559
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,030
come back down and pick that up again in
a hurry. All right? We're going to move

5560
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:53,040
a hurry. All right? We're going to move
 

5561
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:57,669
a hurry. All right? We're going to move
away from it. That's how that's why.

5562
02:05:57,669 --> 02:05:57,679
away from it. That's how that's why.
 

5563
02:05:57,679 --> 02:05:59,669
away from it. That's how that's why.
That's the edge, right? And you can look

5564
02:05:59,669 --> 02:05:59,679
That's the edge, right? And you can look
 

5565
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:01,350
That's the edge, right? And you can look
at that anywhere you want. Whether

5566
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:01,360
at that anywhere you want. Whether
 

5567
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,109
at that anywhere you want. Whether
you're using footprint or bookmap or

5568
02:06:03,109 --> 02:06:03,119
you're using footprint or bookmap or
 

5569
02:06:03,119 --> 02:06:08,149
you're using footprint or bookmap or
whatever, it doesn't matter.

5570
02:06:08,149 --> 02:06:08,159

 

5571
02:06:08,159 --> 02:06:09,830

How many years are in trading? Like six

5572
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:09,840
How many years are in trading? Like six
 

5573
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,550
How many years are in trading? Like six
or seven full-time. I started in uh

5574
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:12,560
or seven full-time. I started in uh
 

5575
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:21,830
or seven full-time. I started in uh
early 20s.

5576
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:21,840

 

5577
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,350

I don't collect cards or anything like

5578
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:23,360
I don't collect cards or anything like
 

5579
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:25,750
I don't collect cards or anything like
that. No, I collect watches which is a

5580
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:25,760
that. No, I collect watches which is a
 

5581
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:28,470
that. No, I collect watches which is a
worst more more expensive habit. Maybe

5582
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:28,480
worst more more expensive habit. Maybe
 

5583
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:30,550
worst more more expensive habit. Maybe
re accumulation for the weekly model.

5584
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:30,560
re accumulation for the weekly model.
 

5585
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,629
re accumulation for the weekly model.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. So that

5586
02:06:32,629 --> 02:06:32,639
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. So that
 

5587
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:35,109
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. So that
weekly model, mate, think about the

5588
02:06:35,109 --> 02:06:35,119
weekly model, mate, think about the
 

5589
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:38,149
weekly model, mate, think about the
newsletter, Scotty. Think about the news

5590
02:06:38,149 --> 02:06:38,159
newsletter, Scotty. Think about the news
 

5591
02:06:38,159 --> 02:06:40,069
newsletter, Scotty. Think about the news
coming this week. Think about the high

5592
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:40,079
coming this week. Think about the high
 

5593
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:42,629
coming this week. Think about the high
impact news. Think about how high we can

5594
02:06:42,629 --> 02:06:42,639
impact news. Think about how high we can
 

5595
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:45,189
impact news. Think about how high we can
squeeze and how much of a reprice that

5596
02:06:45,189 --> 02:06:45,199
squeeze and how much of a reprice that
 

5597
02:06:45,199 --> 02:06:47,270
squeeze and how much of a reprice that
can offer Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

5598
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:47,280
can offer Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
 

5599
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:50,149
can offer Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
The higher we go, the better. I think

5600
02:06:50,149 --> 02:06:50,159
The higher we go, the better. I think
 

5601
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:51,910
The higher we go, the better. I think
there is a reprice coming into this

5602
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:51,920
there is a reprice coming into this
 

5603
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:54,069
there is a reprice coming into this
market.

5604
02:06:54,069 --> 02:06:54,079
market.
 

5605
02:06:54,079 --> 02:06:56,390
market.
End of week maybe. We'll see if we can

5606
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:56,400
End of week maybe. We'll see if we can
 

5607
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,470
End of week maybe. We'll see if we can
squeeze enough. If they can get too

5608
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:58,480
squeeze enough. If they can get too
 

5609
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:01,109
squeeze enough. If they can get too
violent, these bulls,

5610
02:07:01,109 --> 02:07:01,119
violent, these bulls,
 

5611
02:07:01,119 --> 02:07:03,270
violent, these bulls,
they set up that weekly model really

5612
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:03,280
they set up that weekly model really
 

5613
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,669
they set up that weekly model really
well. Especially like you look at uh

5614
02:07:05,669 --> 02:07:05,679
well. Especially like you look at uh
 

5615
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:08,149
well. Especially like you look at uh
yesterday and today if we,

5616
02:07:08,149 --> 02:07:08,159
yesterday and today if we,
 

5617
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:09,750
yesterday and today if we,
you know, we have already taken the high

5618
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:09,760
you know, we have already taken the high
 

5619
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:11,510
you know, we have already taken the high
today. If we can push a bit higher or

5620
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:11,520
today. If we can push a bit higher or
 

5621
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:13,430
today. If we can push a bit higher or
maybe do it tomorrow and then close that

5622
02:07:13,430 --> 02:07:13,440
maybe do it tomorrow and then close that
 

5623
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,750
maybe do it tomorrow and then close that
down, then we look pretty good. So, not

5624
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:15,760
down, then we look pretty good. So, not
 

5625
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:17,270
down, then we look pretty good. So, not
telling everyone that because that's big

5626
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:17,280
telling everyone that because that's big
 

5627
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:21,270
telling everyone that because that's big
part of the course.

5628
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,280

 

5629
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:26,149

Um,

5630
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:26,159

 

5631
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:28,390

do I trade live every day? Yeah. Yeah,

5632
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:28,400
do I trade live every day? Yeah. Yeah,
 

5633
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:29,990
do I trade live every day? Yeah. Yeah,
I'm here every day. Monday to Friday. I

5634
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,000
I'm here every day. Monday to Friday. I
 

5635
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,149
I'm here every day. Monday to Friday. I
know today's slower, folks. And just I

5636
02:07:32,149 --> 02:07:32,159
know today's slower, folks. And just I
 

5637
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:33,910
know today's slower, folks. And just I
like I said, I will not trade out this

5638
02:07:33,910 --> 02:07:33,920
like I said, I will not trade out this
 

5639
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:35,669
like I said, I will not trade out this
range. I I still think this is not a

5640
02:07:35,669 --> 02:07:35,679
range. I I still think this is not a
 

5641
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:37,030
range. I I still think this is not a
good enough high, but we will just see

5642
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,040
good enough high, but we will just see
 

5643
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:38,950
good enough high, but we will just see
what they want to do with it. You can

5644
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:38,960
what they want to do with it. You can
 

5645
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,950
what they want to do with it. You can
see like ES just found a bid on PDC

5646
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:40,960
see like ES just found a bid on PDC
 

5647
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:43,109
see like ES just found a bid on PDC

Amigga Speed Master?
 

5853
02:12:19,119 --> 02:12:26,069
Amigga Speed Master?
Do I want the white D speed master?

5854
02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:26,079

 

5855
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:27,750

I don't know what I want. I'll make a

5856
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:27,760
I don't know what I want. I'll make a
 

5857
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:29,189
I don't know what I want. I'll make a
decision this year. Right. I'd be

5858
02:12:29,189 --> 02:12:29,199
decision this year. Right. I'd be
 

5859
02:12:29,199 --> 02:12:30,870
decision this year. Right. I'd be
watching this for a rejection here now.

5860
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:30,880
watching this for a rejection here now.
 

5861
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:33,030
watching this for a rejection here now.
So, like, do they reject 357? Same

5862
02:12:33,030 --> 02:12:33,040
So, like, do they reject 357? Same
 

5863
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:34,390
So, like, do they reject 357? Same
story. I hate how they've built this

5864
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:34,400
story. I hate how they've built this
 

5865
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,990
story. I hate how they've built this
out. They can still trap here and come

5866
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,000
out. They can still trap here and come
 

5867
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,910
out. They can still trap here and come
back in. But if they reject this kind of

5868
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:37,920
back in. But if they reject this kind of
 

5869
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:39,750
back in. But if they reject this kind of
level here, this is a node that they

5870
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:39,760
level here, this is a node that they
 

5871
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:41,990
level here, this is a node that they
will want to revisit, but it's just I

5872
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:42,000
will want to revisit, but it's just I
 

5873
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,669
will want to revisit, but it's just I
really do not like the action that I'm

5874
02:12:43,669 --> 02:12:43,679
really do not like the action that I'm
 

5875
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:44,790
really do not like the action that I'm
seeing. You see, every time they're

5876
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:44,800
seeing. You see, every time they're
 

5877
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:46,790
seeing. You see, every time they're
fading, we're coming back inside, coming

5878
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:46,800
fading, we're coming back inside, coming
 

5879
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,790
fading, we're coming back inside, coming
back inside. Every time I pop him, we're

5880
02:12:48,790 --> 02:12:48,800
back inside. Every time I pop him, we're
 

5881
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,149
back inside. Every time I pop him, we're
coming back inside, coming back inside.

5882
02:12:50,149 --> 02:12:50,159
coming back inside, coming back inside.
 

5883
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:51,750
coming back inside, coming back inside.
They might have just retrapped here and

5884
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:51,760
They might have just retrapped here and
 

5885
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,990
They might have just retrapped here and
come back inside. It's just not I just

5886
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:54,000
come back inside. It's just not I just
 

5887
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,910
come back inside. It's just not I just
do not want to trade in here. Look at

5888
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:55,920
do not want to trade in here. Look at
 

5889
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,270
do not want to trade in here. Look at
your initial balance. Look at your

5890
02:12:57,270 --> 02:12:57,280
your initial balance. Look at your
 

5891
02:12:57,280 --> 02:13:00,550
your initial balance. Look at your
midpoint. Look at your value areas. It's

5892
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:00,560
midpoint. Look at your value areas. It's
 

5893
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:02,470
midpoint. Look at your value areas. It's
just there's lack of edge here, guys.

5894
02:13:02,470 --> 02:13:02,480
just there's lack of edge here, guys.
 

5895
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:03,990
just there's lack of edge here, guys.
Know when to trade, when not to trade.

5896
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,000
Know when to trade, when not to trade.
 

5897
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,550
Know when to trade, when not to trade.
For me and how I trade, this is not a

For me and how I trade, this is not a
 

5899
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,229
For me and how I trade, this is not a
time to trade right now. This was a time

5900
02:13:08,229 --> 02:13:08,239
time to trade right now. This was a time
 

5901
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:09,589
time to trade right now. This was a time
to trade. This is a time to leave it

5902
02:13:09,589 --> 02:13:09,599
to trade. This is a time to leave it
 

5903
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:16,310
to trade. This is a time to leave it
alone.

5905
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,149

How do I look for traps on higher time

5906
02:13:18,149 --> 02:13:18,159
How do I look for traps on higher time
 

5907
02:13:18,159 --> 02:13:21,189
How do I look for traps on higher time
frames for swings on stocks?

5908
02:13:21,189 --> 02:13:21,199
frames for swings on stocks?
 

5909

frames for swings on stocks?
harder to look for them on higher time

5910
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:23,280
harder to look for them on higher time
 

5911
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:24,870
harder to look for them on higher time
frames, but you can look for the same

5912
02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:24,880
frames, but you can look for the same
 

5913
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:27,189
frames, but you can look for the same
thing that we just went over. On higher

5914
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:27,199
thing that we just went over. On higher
 

5915
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:28,310
thing that we just went over. On higher

time frames, when I'm looking for

of a basket. So, if I think about my

5920
02:13:34,550 --> 02:13:34,560
of a basket. So, if I think about my
 

5921
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,709
of a basket. So, if I think about my
swings right now, so let's think about

5922
02:13:36,709 --> 02:13:36,719
swings right now, so let's think about
 

5923
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:39,990
swings right now, so let's think about
why am I long software right now? Why

5924
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:40,000
why am I long software right now? Why
 

5925
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,750
why am I long software right now? Why
was I long OCL for example,

5926
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:43,760
was I long OCL for example,
 

5927
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:49,750
was I long OCL for example,
right? If we look at this,

5928
02:13:49,750 --> 02:13:49,760

 

5929
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:51,750

right, basic

5930
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:51,760
right, basic

02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:53,430
right, basic
understanding is here's your swing

understanding is here's your swing
 

5933
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:55,830
understanding is here's your swing
point.

5934

In terms of a discount from premium,

02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:04,390
In terms of a discount from premium,
we picked this up at a 61% discount,

we picked this up at a 61% discount,

5941
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,910
right? And we're looking for a
retracement long upside. Why? Because

5942
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:07,920
retracement long upside. Why? Because
 

5943
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:10,310
retracement long upside. Why? Because
this is ridiculous. This stock has some

5944
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:10,320
this is ridiculous. This stock has some
 

5945
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:12,629
this is ridiculous. This stock has some
issues. Like there is a chance that it's

5946
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:12,639
issues. Like there is a chance that it's
 

5947
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:14,390
issues. Like there is a chance that it's
got some debt issues, but there's only

02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:14,400
got some debt issues, but there's only
 

5949
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,629
got some debt issues, but there's only
like an 8% chance now. And up here they

5950
02:14:16,629 --> 02:14:16,639
like an 8% chance now. And up here they
 

5951
02:14:16,639 --> 02:14:18,550
like an 8% chance now. And up here they
were thinking it was like 100% chance.

02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:18,560
were thinking it was like 100% chance.

we're looking for this. We'll sell a bit

we're looking for this. We'll sell a bit
 

5961
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:29,030
we're looking for this. We'll sell a bit
here. If we start doing this, we'll try

02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,040
here. If we start doing this, we'll try
 

5963
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:31,270
here. If we start doing this, we'll try
and hold it into here. Same kind of

02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:31,280
and hold it into here. Same kind of
 

5965
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:32,709
and hold it into here. Same kind of
strategies, right? We're looking for

5966
02:14:32,709 --> 02:14:32,719
strategies, right? We're looking for
 

5967
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:35,189
strategies, right? We're looking for
deep discount where too many sellers are

5968
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:35,199
deep discount where too many sellers are
 

5969
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:37,189
deep discount where too many sellers are
too ridiculous chasing the lows, right?

5970
02:14:37,189 --> 02:14:37,199
too ridiculous chasing the lows, right?
 

5971
02:14:37,199 --> 02:14:40,149
too ridiculous chasing the lows, right?
Too many sellers get too ridiculous

5972
02:14:40,149 --> 02:14:40,159
Too many sellers get too ridiculous
 

5973
02:14:40,159 --> 02:14:42,390
Too many sellers get too ridiculous
chasing the lows down here. Now, I would

5974
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:42,400
chasing the lows down here. Now, I would
 

5975
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:44,390
chasing the lows down here. Now, I would
We'll have a look. We'll have a look. I

5976
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:44,400
We'll have a look. We'll have a look. I
 

5977
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:45,910
We'll have a look. We'll have a look. I
haven't even looked, but we will have a

5978
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:45,920
haven't even looked, but we will have a
 

5979
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:52,950
haven't even looked, but we will have a
look.

5980
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:52,960

 

5981
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:55,750

Put my template on.

5982
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:55,760
Put my template on.
 

5983
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:58,069
Put my template on.
Oh, you [\h__\h] I have to do this all by

5984
02:14:58,069 --> 02:14:58,079
Oh, you [\h__\h] I have to do this all by
 

5985
02:14:58,079 --> 02:15:16,310
Oh, you [\h__\h] I have to do this all by
myself. I thought I saved this

5986
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:16,320

 

5987
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:19,990

Okay. So, once we pivoted above 40,

5988
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:20,000
Okay. So, once we pivoted above 40,
 

5989
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,669
Okay. So, once we pivoted above 40,
that's where the sellers were getting

5990
02:15:21,669 --> 02:15:21,679
that's where the sellers were getting
 

5991
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:23,830
that's where the sellers were getting
too aggressive the day before and on

5992
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:23,840
too aggressive the day before and on
 

5993
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:25,589
too aggressive the day before and on
this day and Friday. So, once we pivoted

5994
02:15:25,589 --> 02:15:25,599
this day and Friday. So, once we pivoted
 

5995
02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:28,229
this day and Friday. So, once we pivoted
above 40, we're now driving higher. We

5996
02:15:28,229 --> 02:15:28,239
above 40, we're now driving higher. We
 

5997
02:15:28,239 --> 02:15:29,669
above 40, we're now driving higher. We
can see we're coming into some of these

5998
02:15:29,669 --> 02:15:29,679
can see we're coming into some of these
 

5999
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:31,750
can see we're coming into some of these
key pivots here now. All right. Where

6000
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:31,760
key pivots here now. All right. Where
 

6001
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:33,430
key pivots here now. All right. Where
these sellers last come in. So, I did

6002
02:15:33,430 --> 02:15:33,440
these sellers last come in. So, I did
 

6003
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:35,910
these sellers last come in. So, I did
take a partial yesterday

6004
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:35,920
take a partial yesterday
 

6005
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,990
take a partial yesterday
and we're watching this and if we get

6006
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:38,000
and we're watching this and if we get
 

6007
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,069
and we're watching this and if we get
over this, we're going to see if we let

6008
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
over this, we're going to see if we let
 

6009
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:41,510
over this, we're going to see if we let
out these buyers. And if we let those

6010
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:41,520
out these buyers. And if we let those
 

6011
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:42,709
out these buyers. And if we let those
buyers out, we're going to look for the

6012
02:15:42,709 --> 02:15:42,719
buyers out, we're going to look for the
 

6013
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:43,990
buyers out, we're going to look for the
next level. So, the last place the

6014
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:44,000
next level. So, the last place the
 

6015
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,390
next level. So, the last place the
buyers retracted was up here at 203. So,

6016
02:15:46,390 --> 02:15:46,400
buyers retracted was up here at 203. So,
 

6017
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:49,189
buyers retracted was up here at 203. So,
we've got potentially we've got this

6018
02:15:49,189 --> 02:15:49,199
we've got potentially we've got this
 

6019
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:52,149
we've got potentially we've got this
move to 70. If we get over 85 and we let

6020
02:15:52,149 --> 02:15:52,159
move to 70. If we get over 85 and we let
 

6021
02:15:52,159 --> 02:15:53,990
move to 70. If we get over 85 and we let
the buyers out, I'm looking for 200. So,

6022
02:15:53,990 --> 02:15:54,000
the buyers out, I'm looking for 200. So,
 

6023
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,750
the buyers out, I'm looking for 200. So,
that would be what, a 70 plus point

6024
02:15:55,750 --> 02:15:55,760
that would be what, a 70 plus point
 

6025
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:57,990
that would be what, a 70 plus point

setups? What setup should a newbie start

6158
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:40,960
setups? What setup should a newbie start
 

6159
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:43,830
setups? What setup should a newbie start
on? What I call a protrend setup is the

6160
02:18:43,830 --> 02:18:43,840
on? What I call a protrend setup is the
 

6161
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,830
on? What I call a protrend setup is the
first trade you should start on. All

6162
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:45,840
first trade you should start on. All
 

6163
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,830
first trade you should start on. All
right, a protrend setup. I will show you

6164
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:47,840
right, a protrend setup. I will show you
 

6165
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:50,230
right, a protrend setup. I will show you
what that is.

6166
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:50,240
what that is.
 

6167
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,669
what that is.
We talk about this all the time. All

6168
02:18:51,669 --> 02:18:51,679
We talk about this all the time. All
 

6169
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:53,270
We talk about this all the time. All
right,

6170
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:53,280
right,
 

6171
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:55,110
right,
let's talk let's say that this is the

6172
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:55,120
let's talk let's say that this is the
 

6173
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:57,990
let's talk let's say that this is the
daily.

6174
02:18:57,990 --> 02:18:58,000
daily.
 

6175
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,950
daily.
All right, that's a daily chart. Quite

6176
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:00,960
All right, that's a daily chart. Quite
 

6177
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:02,389
All right, that's a daily chart. Quite
clearly it's in an uptrend. So the

6178
02:19:02,389 --> 02:19:02,399
clearly it's in an uptrend. So the
 

6179
02:19:02,399 --> 02:19:13,669
clearly it's in an uptrend. So the
hourly chart would look like this.

6180
02:19:13,669 --> 02:19:13,679

 

6181
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:15,990

Right. And inside here we have protrend

6182
02:19:15,990 --> 02:19:16,000
Right. And inside here we have protrend
 

6183
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,509
Right. And inside here we have protrend
availabilities. Now I would be looking

6184
02:19:17,509 --> 02:19:17,519
availabilities. Now I would be looking
 

6185
02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:21,270
availabilities. Now I would be looking
for the first and second leg over the

6186
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:21,280
for the first and second leg over the
 

6187
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,509
for the first and second leg over the
third leg. So I'd be looking in these

6188
02:19:23,509 --> 02:19:23,519
third leg. So I'd be looking in these
 

6189
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:26,709
third leg. So I'd be looking in these
opportunities here to get long. All

6190
02:19:26,709 --> 02:19:26,719
opportunities here to get long. All
 

6191
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:29,030
opportunities here to get long. All
right. On a lower time frame. So in a

6192
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:29,040
right. On a lower time frame. So in a
 

6193
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,270
right. On a lower time frame. So in a
lower time frame I'd be looking at these

6194
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:31,280
lower time frame I'd be looking at these
 

6195
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:33,910
lower time frame I'd be looking at these
zones here, right? This zone here. Think

6196
02:19:33,910 --> 02:19:33,920
zones here, right? This zone here. Think
 

6197
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:36,950
zones here, right? This zone here. Think
about this as an RBS. Right? resistance

6198
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:36,960
about this as an RBS. Right? resistance
 

6199
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:39,270
about this as an RBS. Right? resistance
becomes support. This zone here and on a

6200
02:19:39,270 --> 02:19:39,280
becomes support. This zone here and on a
 

6201
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,110
becomes support. This zone here and on a
lower time frame I'd be looking for

6202
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:41,120
lower time frame I'd be looking for
 

6203
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:43,990
lower time frame I'd be looking for
something like this where shorts get

6204
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:44,000
something like this where shorts get
 

6205
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,629
something like this where shorts get
trapped and we can trade back upside

6206
02:19:46,629 --> 02:19:46,639
trapped and we can trade back upside
 

6207
02:19:46,639 --> 02:19:48,309
trapped and we can trade back upside
which is the main trend and we have

6208
02:19:48,309 --> 02:19:48,319
which is the main trend and we have
 

6209
02:19:48,319 --> 02:19:50,630
which is the main trend and we have
liquidity to aim for which would be this

6210
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:50,640
liquidity to aim for which would be this
 

6211
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:53,349
liquidity to aim for which would be this
high and we would hold runners above it.

6212
02:19:53,349 --> 02:19:53,359
high and we would hold runners above it.
 

6213
02:19:53,359 --> 02:19:56,630
high and we would hold runners above it.
Right? That's the easiest trade to start

6214
02:19:56,630 --> 02:19:56,640
Right? That's the easiest trade to start
 

6215
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:59,590
Right? That's the easiest trade to start
with when you are learning to trade what

6216
02:19:59,590 --> 02:19:59,600
with when you are learning to trade what
 

6217
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,270
with when you are learning to trade what
we are currently in. Right? All right,

6218
02:20:01,270 --> 02:20:01,280
we are currently in. Right? All right,
 

6219
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:08,630
we are currently in. Right? All right,
if we think about what the dy's done,

6220
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:08,640

 

6221
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:12,469

we are currently here. This is not a fun

6222
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:12,479
we are currently here. This is not a fun
 

6223
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:16,710
we are currently here. This is not a fun
trade, right? This trade was fun.

6224
02:20:16,710 --> 02:20:16,720
trade, right? This trade was fun.
 

6225
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:18,550
trade, right? This trade was fun.
This trade would be fun because it' be

6226
02:20:18,550 --> 02:20:18,560
This trade would be fun because it' be
 

6227
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:21,590
This trade would be fun because it' be
pro back down. This trade is not fun.

6228
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:21,600
pro back down. This trade is not fun.
 

6229
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:23,670
pro back down. This trade is not fun.
This trade is a liquidity building phase

6230
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:23,680
This trade is a liquidity building phase
 

6231
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,750
This trade is a liquidity building phase
of the market. All right, this is why

6232
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:25,760
of the market. All right, this is why
 

6233
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,990
of the market. All right, this is why
Alex is chilling out today and doesn't

6234
02:20:27,990 --> 02:20:28,000
Alex is chilling out today and doesn't
 

6235
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,469
Alex is chilling out today and doesn't
really care. All right, because Alex

6236
02:20:30,469 --> 02:20:30,479
really care. All right, because Alex
 

6237
02:20:30,479 --> 02:20:32,070
really care. All right, because Alex
thinks there can be a trap. If we call

6238
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:32,080
thinks there can be a trap. If we call
 

6239
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:34,790
thinks there can be a trap. If we call
this the 800s

6240
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:34,800
this the 800s
 

6241
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:37,349
this the 800s
on ENQ, I think there can be a trap up

6242
02:20:37,349 --> 02:20:37,359
on ENQ, I think there can be a trap up
 

6243
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:39,349
on ENQ, I think there can be a trap up
into there. If we reclaim that, I think

6244
02:20:39,349 --> 02:20:39,359
into there. If we reclaim that, I think
 

6245
02:20:39,359 --> 02:20:41,190
into there. If we reclaim that, I think
there's a giant squeeze out. I think

6246
02:20:41,190 --> 02:20:41,200
there's a giant squeeze out. I think
 

6247
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,950
there's a giant squeeze out. I think
somewhere in here, they will trap bulls

6248
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:42,960
somewhere in here, they will trap bulls
 

6249
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:44,630
somewhere in here, they will trap bulls
and they will look to try and do this

6250
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:44,640
and they will look to try and do this
 

6251
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:47,030
and they will look to try and do this
move for a retest down here and then

6252
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:47,040
move for a retest down here and then
 

6253
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:48,870
move for a retest down here and then
we'll see if they bid up or let it go.

6254
02:20:48,870 --> 02:20:48,880
we'll see if they bid up or let it go.
 

6255
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:51,110
we'll see if they bid up or let it go.
All right, so we don't trade this. Well,

6256
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:51,120
All right, so we don't trade this. Well,
 

6257
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:52,870
All right, so we don't trade this. Well,
I don't trade that. You guys can do what

6258
02:20:52,870 --> 02:20:52,880
I don't trade that. You guys can do what
 

6259
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,230
I don't trade that. You guys can do what
you want. If you like trading the

6260
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:54,240
you want. If you like trading the
 

6261
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:56,150
you want. If you like trading the
rotations, trade trade the rotations,

6262
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:56,160
rotations, trade trade the rotations,
 

6263
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:59,030
rotations, trade trade the rotations,
right? Some people love a rotation. I

6264
02:20:59,030 --> 02:20:59,040
right? Some people love a rotation. I
 

6265
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:01,990
right? Some people love a rotation. I
don't I really don't. Right. And I'm

6266
02:21:01,990 --> 02:21:02,000
don't I really don't. Right. And I'm
 

6267
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,349
don't I really don't. Right. And I'm
very honest about that. I talk about

6268
02:21:03,349 --> 02:21:03,359
very honest about that. I talk about
 

6269
02:21:03,359 --> 02:21:06,469
very honest about that. I talk about
that all the time.

6270
02:21:06,469 --> 02:21:06,479
that all the time.
 

6271
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:08,150
that all the time.
What's my opinion on Jacob Co? Don't

6272
02:21:08,150 --> 02:21:08,160
What's my opinion on Jacob Co? Don't
 

6273

What's my opinion on Jacob Co? Don't
like them. Each their own though.

6274
02:21:14,389 --> 02:21:14,399

 

6275

6277
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:18,070
I hate the Land Dweller. Not a fan at
all. I'd rather have an AP than a Land

6278
02:21:18,070 --> 02:21:18,080
all. I'd rather have an AP than a Land
 

6279
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:20,790
all. I'd rather have an AP than a Land
Dweller. And I really like my engineer.

6280
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:20,800
Dweller. And I really like my engineer.
 

6281
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,150
Dweller. And I really like my engineer.
So, I don't feel like I need either of

6282
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:22,160
So, I don't feel like I need either of
 

6283
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:23,750
So, I don't feel like I need either of
those.

6284
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:23,760
those.
 

6285
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:25,590
those.

sneaky sneakys. I've told you guys a

long time that guy is not a good guy.
 

6305
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:49,510
long time that guy is not a good guy.
That is a bad actor.

6306
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:49,520

 

6307
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:51,030

Going to the doctor and dentist would be

6308
02:21:51,030 --> 02:21:51,040
Going to the doctor and dentist would be
 

6309
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,110
Going to the doctor and dentist would be
a priority for me. I don't know what I

twelves around here. Once we reclaim
 

6371
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:11,830
twelves around here. Once we reclaim
that, I I think I put some on here

6372
02:23:11,830 --> 02:23:11,840
that, I I think I put some on here
 

6373
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:12,710
that, I I think I put some on here
because I was like, they're getting

02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:14,070
because I was like, they're getting
stuck. I'll have to rewatch it. I'm

stuck. I'll have to rewatch it. I'm
 

6377
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:15,590

No, Speedy Daytona is best value. I

6422
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:13,600
No, Speedy Daytona is best value. I
 

6423
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:14,870
No, Speedy Daytona is best value. I
mean, Daytona is double the price of

I don't keep a trade calendar, Gambino.
 

6431
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:34,710
I don't keep a trade calendar, Gambino.

6433
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:36,309

But I can start keeping one if that's

6434
02:24:36,309 --> 02:24:36,319
But I can start keeping one if that's
 

6435
02:24:36,319 --> 02:24:38,309
But I can start keeping one if that's
going to make people happy. But I just

6438
02:24:39,590 --> 02:24:39,600
don't do it. I've been I've been around
 

6439
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:40,870
don't do it. I've been I've been around
for too long. I don't even journal

6440
02:24:40,870 --> 02:24:40,880
for too long. I don't even journal
 

6441
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:42,870
for too long. I don't even journal
anymore. I used to journal all the day.

6442
02:24:42,870 --> 02:24:42,880
anymore. I used to journal all the day.
 

6443
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:44,710
anymore. I used to journal all the day.
All the time. I have like stacked

6444
02:24:44,710 --> 02:24:44,720
All the time. I have like stacked
 

6445
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:48,070
All the time. I have like stacked
journals like full of these are all old

6446
02:24:48,070 --> 02:24:48,080
journals like full of these are all old
 

6447
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,910
journals like full of these are all old
journals of trades that I used to write

6448
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:49,920
journals of trades that I used to write
 

6449
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:52,389
journals of trades that I used to write
down because I think writing down makes

6450
02:24:52,389 --> 02:24:52,399
down because I think writing down makes
 

6451
02:24:52,399 --> 02:24:53,990
down because I think writing down makes
you

6452
02:24:53,990 --> 02:24:54,000
you
 

6453
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,270
you
able to uh absorb stuff. Let's let's see

6454
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:57,280
able to uh absorb stuff. Let's let's see
 

6455
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:58,870

if I can find a big loss in here. There

6456
02:24:58,870 --> 02:24:58,880
if I can find a big loss in here. There

02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:12,790
here.
This is like the small cap days.

6462
02:25:12,790 --> 02:25:12,800

 

6463
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:14,309

How do I use both volume bars at the

6548
02:27:36,710 --> 02:27:36,720
How do I use both volume bars at the
 

6549
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:38,070
How do I use both volume bars at the
bottom? Well, one's volume and one's

6550
02:27:38,070 --> 02:27:38,080
bottom? Well, one's volume and one's
 

6551
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:40,550
bottom? Well, one's volume and one's
delta. They're not both volume, right?

6552
02:27:40,550 --> 02:27:40,560
delta. They're not both volume, right?
 

6553
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:42,550
delta. They're not both volume, right?
So, this is volume. This is actually

6554
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:42,560
So, this is volume. This is actually
 

6555
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:45,990
So, this is volume. This is actually
delta. It's not volume,

6556
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:46,000
delta. It's not volume,
 

6557
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,349
delta. It's not volume,
right? You don't have to have delta this

6558
02:27:47,349 --> 02:27:47,359
right? You don't have to have delta this
 

6559
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:48,790
right? You don't have to have delta this
way. It's just you have a choice on

6560
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:48,800
way. It's just you have a choice on
 

6561
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:51,030
way. It's just you have a choice on
trading view. You could have the

02:27:51,030 --> 02:27:51,040
trading view. You could have the
 

6563
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:52,469
trading view. You could have the
traditional delta, which I have on a

6564
02:27:52,469 --> 02:27:52,479
traditional delta, which I have on a
 

6565
02:27:52,479 --> 02:27:55,190
traditional delta, which I have on a
five minute, which is right here.

6566
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:55,200
five minute, which is right here.
 

6567
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:58,230
five minute, which is right here.
Right? Traditional delta. This is delta.

6568
02:27:58,230 --> 02:27:58,240

02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:01,200
line, delta and the charts are doing the
 

6573
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:02,790

lot to anyone who'd help me. You're

6628
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,120

doing great, mate. If you're 16 and
 

6631
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:13,510

7K, size up slowly. That doesn't mean

6634
02:29:15,830 --> 02:29:15,840
7K, size up slowly. That doesn't mean
 

6635
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:17,349
7K, size up slowly. That doesn't mean
double your size. So, I don't know what

6636
02:29:17,349 --> 02:29:17,359
double your size. So, I don't know what
 

6637
02:29:17,359 --> 02:29:20,150
double your size. So, I don't know what
your lot size is at the moment,

6638
02:29:20,150 --> 02:29:20,160
your lot size is at the moment,
 

6639
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:21,990
your lot size is at the moment,
but you want to scale slowly. And

6640
02:29:21,990 --> 02:29:22,000
but you want to scale slowly. And
 

6641
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,510
but you want to scale slowly. And
remember, if you jump from one mini to

6642
02:29:23,510 --> 02:29:23,520
remember, if you jump from one mini to
 

6643
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:25,030
remember, if you jump from one mini to
two, you're literally doubling your size

6644
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:25,040
two, you're literally doubling your size
 

6645
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:26,469
two, you're literally doubling your size
and your risk. You're going to find it

6646
02:29:26,469 --> 02:29:26,479
and your risk. You're going to find it
 

6647
02:29:26,479 --> 02:29:28,710
and your risk. You're going to find it
hard to do that. So, if I if you were

6648
02:29:28,710 --> 02:29:28,720
hard to do that. So, if I if you were
 

6649
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:30,950
hard to do that. So, if I if you were
using one mini, I would move to like 12

6650
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:30,960
using one mini, I would move to like 12
 

6651
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:34,070
using one mini, I would move to like 12
or 13 micros, then 15, then 17, then two

6652
02:29:34,070 --> 02:29:34,080
or 13 micros, then 15, then 17, then two
 

6653
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:41,190
or 13 micros, then 15, then 17, then two
minis, for example.

6654
02:29:41,190 --> 02:29:41,200

 

6655

don't use it. I like it on higher time

6764
02:31:58,070 --> 02:31:58,080
don't use it. I like it on higher time
 

6765
02:31:58,080 --> 02:31:59,429
don't use it. I like it on higher time
frames. I would not use it on a lower

6766
02:31:59,429 --> 02:31:59,439
frames. I would not use it on a lower

6968
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:44,240
off, but it does not mean it goes up or
 

6969
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:48,710
off, but it does not mean it goes up or
down. Yeah. So, if we I'll show you.

All right. So,

6972
02:36:50,150 --> 02:36:50,160
All right. So,
 

6973
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:53,750
All right. So,
This guy here was a big seller. He was I

6974
02:36:53,750 --> 02:36:53,760
This guy here was a big seller. He was I
 

6975
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:55,270
This guy here was a big seller. He was I
don't know why it's saying 64 lot. Maybe

6976
02:36:55,270 --> 02:36:55,280
don't know why it's saying 64 lot. Maybe
 

6977
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:56,870
don't know why it's saying 64 lot. Maybe
it was stacked, but we had like a number

6978
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:56,880
it was stacked, but we had like a number
 

6979
02:36:56,880 --> 02:36:59,830
it was stacked, but we had like a number
of hundred lots here. As price got close

6980
02:36:59,830 --> 02:36:59,840
of hundred lots here. As price got close
 

6981
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:01,670
of hundred lots here. As price got close
to him, he removed that. So, he was a

6982
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:01,680
to him, he removed that. So, he was a
 

6983
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:03,429
to him, he removed that. So, he was a
seller. He removed that. So, then we

6984
02:37:03,429 --> 02:37:03,439
seller. He removed that. So, then we
 

6985
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:05,830
seller. He removed that. So, then we
traded through him. All right. So, he

6986
02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:05,840
traded through him. All right. So, he
 

6987
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:07,429
traded through him. All right. So, he
let the price come up and maybe he

6988
02:37:07,429 --> 02:37:07,439
let the price come up and maybe he
 

6989
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:08,870
let the price come up and maybe he
filled some of it here and we're trading

6990
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:08,880
filled some of it here and we're trading
 

6991
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:10,710
filled some of it here and we're trading
back downside. But, he did not try and

6992
02:37:10,710 --> 02:37:10,720
back downside. But, he did not try and
 

6993
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:13,030
back downside. But, he did not try and
put up a wall here. He lifted it hoping

6994
02:37:13,030 --> 02:37:13,040
put up a wall here. He lifted it hoping
 

6995
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:14,309
put up a wall here. He lifted it hoping
that price would go higher by the looks

6996
02:37:14,309 --> 02:37:14,319
that price would go higher by the looks
 

6997
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:16,070
that price would go higher by the looks
of it. There you go. He's up here. So,

6998
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:16,080
of it. There you go. He's up here. So,
 

6999
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:18,870
of it. There you go. He's up here. So,
this 300 lot moved up here. So he put a

7000
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:18,880
this 300 lot moved up here. So he put a
 

7001
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:21,110
this 300 lot moved up here. So he put a
wall there and as price came in, he's

7002
02:37:21,110 --> 02:37:21,120
wall there and as price came in, he's
 

7003
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:23,030
wall there and as price came in, he's
lifted it and he's now trying to attract

7004
02:37:23,030 --> 02:37:23,040
lifted it and he's now trying to attract
 

7005
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:26,150
lifted it and he's now trying to attract
price up into the 400. So he's trying to

7006
02:37:26,150 --> 02:37:26,160
price up into the 400. So he's trying to
 

7007
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:28,790
price up into the 400. So he's trying to
encourage price to come back up here

7008
02:37:28,790 --> 02:37:28,800
encourage price to come back up here
 

7009
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:30,550
encourage price to come back up here
right now. All right, he was here. He's

7010
02:37:30,550 --> 02:37:30,560
right now. All right, he was here. He's
 

7011
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:33,030
right now. All right, he was here. He's
trying to use his size to say, "Hey,

7012
02:37:33,030 --> 02:37:33,040
trying to use his size to say, "Hey,
 

7013
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:34,550
trying to use his size to say, "Hey,
I've got liquidity here. Come up here

7014
02:37:34,550 --> 02:37:34,560
I've got liquidity here. Come up here
 

7015
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:36,950
I've got liquidity here. Come up here
and get me." All right, so he could be

7016
02:37:36,950 --> 02:37:36,960
and get me." All right, so he could be
 

7017
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:38,790
and get me." All right, so he could be
two things. He might be a buyer trying

7018
02:37:38,790 --> 02:37:38,800
two things. He might be a buyer trying
 

7019
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:41,830
two things. He might be a buyer trying
to force price higher.

7020
02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:41,840
to force price higher.
 

7021
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:43,190
to force price higher.
Or he might be a seller trying to

7022
02:37:43,190 --> 02:37:43,200
Or he might be a seller trying to
 

7023
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:45,030
Or he might be a seller trying to
attract price to come higher to then

7024
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:45,040
attract price to come higher to then
 

7025
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:46,630
attract price to come higher to then
sell into. Both of those things are

7026
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
sell into. Both of those things are
 

7027
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:48,150
sell into. Both of those things are
possible.

7028
02:37:48,150 --> 02:37:48,160
possible.
 

7029
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:50,710
possible.
How do I clean up this drawing tool?

7030
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:50,720
How do I clean up this drawing tool?
 

7031
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:57,750
How do I clean up this drawing tool?
Clear drawings.

7032
02:37:57,750 --> 02:37:57,760

 

7033
02:37:57,760 --> 02:37:59,429

We go.

7034
02:37:59,429 --> 02:37:59,439
We go.
 

7035
02:37:59,439 --> 02:38:02,230
We go.
All right. So, that's the spoofing.

7036
02:38:02,230 --> 02:38:02,240
All right. So, that's the spoofing.
 

7037
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:03,990
All right. So, that's the spoofing.
Lifting is the same thing. Normally,

7038
02:38:03,990 --> 02:38:04,000
Lifting is the same thing. Normally,
 

7039
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,990
Lifting is the same thing. Normally,
you'll just see them like buyers will

7040
02:38:05,990 --> 02:38:06,000
you'll just see them like buyers will
 

7041
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,990
you'll just see them like buyers will
step through like this and they'll just

7042
02:38:07,990 --> 02:38:08,000
step through like this and they'll just
 

7043
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:12,950
step through like this and they'll just
keep sell sell on the way up.

7044
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:12,960
keep sell sell on the way up.
 

7045
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:24,309
keep sell sell on the way up.
It's just so ugly this chart right now.

7046
02:38:24,309 --> 02:38:24,319

 

7047
02:38:24,319 --> 02:38:27,030

What tells me that he removed just that

7048
02:38:27,030 --> 02:38:27,040
What tells me that he removed just that
 

7049
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:29,270
What tells me that he removed just that
that right there, Scotty, when he

7050
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:29,280
that right there, Scotty, when he
 

7051
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:31,349
that right there, Scotty, when he
doesn't get filled.

7052
02:38:31,349 --> 02:38:31,359
doesn't get filled.
 

7053
02:38:31,359 --> 02:38:33,590
doesn't get filled.
So this guy here, see how it's vertical?

7054
02:38:33,590 --> 02:38:33,600
So this guy here, see how it's vertical?
 

7055
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:35,349
So this guy here, see how it's vertical?
It's horizontal. Sorry. And we never

7056
02:38:35,349 --> 02:38:35,359
It's horizontal. Sorry. And we never
 

7057
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:37,590
It's horizontal. Sorry. And we never
touch him. All right. Because if we

7058
02:38:37,590 --> 02:38:37,600
touch him. All right. Because if we
 

7059
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:39,830
touch him. All right. Because if we
traded through him,

7060
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:39,840
traded through him,
 

7061
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:41,670
traded through him,
you'd see it like this where this limit

7062
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:41,680
you'd see it like this where this limit
 

7063
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:43,990
you'd see it like this where this limit
order gets filled down here. So this

7064
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:44,000
order gets filled down here. So this
 

7065
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,830
order gets filled down here. So this
buyer here, he gets filled. He moves up

7066
02:38:45,830 --> 02:38:45,840
buyer here, he gets filled. He moves up
 

7067
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:47,830
buyer here, he gets filled. He moves up
a bit to get filled, right? So, we will

7068
02:38:47,830 --> 02:38:47,840
a bit to get filled, right? So, we will
 

7069
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,429
a bit to get filled, right? So, we will
trade through those levels. You'll see

7070

02:38:51,270 --> 02:38:51,280
price come through all this orange. This
 

7073
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:52,790

We trade through this buyer and then

7076
02:38:54,630 --> 02:38:54,640
We trade through this buyer and then
 

7077
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:56,309
We trade through this buyer and then
turn around. I'll try and see if I can

7078
02:38:56,309 --> 02:38:56,319
turn around. I'll try and see if I can
 

7079
02:38:56,319 --> 02:38:59,110
turn around. I'll try and see if I can
find some other big stuff. All right.

7080
02:38:59,110 --> 02:38:59,120
find some other big stuff. All right.
 

7081
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:00,870
find some other big stuff. All right.
Here, we trade through this buyer and

7082
02:39:00,870 --> 02:39:00,880
Here, we trade through this buyer and
 

7083
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:02,469
Here, we trade through this buyer and
then turn around. Here, we don't fill

7084
02:39:02,469 --> 02:39:02,479
then turn around. Here, we don't fill
 

7085
02:39:02,479 --> 02:39:03,910
then turn around. Here, we don't fill
these guys. We never get up into them.

7086
02:39:03,910 --> 02:39:03,920
these guys. We never get up into them.
 

7087
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:06,389
these guys. We never get up into them.
He's been here all day at 450 looking to

7088
02:39:06,389 --> 02:39:06,399
He's been here all day at 450 looking to
 

7089
02:39:06,399 --> 02:39:08,070
He's been here all day at 450 looking to
get filled. All right. And then he's

7090
02:39:08,070 --> 02:39:08,080
get filled. All right. And then he's
 

7091
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:10,230
get filled. All right. And then he's
pulled it off. And that might well be

7092
02:39:10,230 --> 02:39:10,240
pulled it off. And that might well be
 

7093
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:11,910
pulled it off. And that might well be
him scattering down here looking to get

7094
02:39:11,910 --> 02:39:11,920
him scattering down here looking to get
 

7095
02:39:11,920 --> 02:39:13,990
him scattering down here looking to get
filled down here. But this guy never

7096
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:14,000
filled down here. But this guy never
 

7097
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,309
filled down here. But this guy never
gets filled. He pulls his offer before

7098
02:39:16,309 --> 02:39:16,319
gets filled. He pulls his offer before
 

7099
02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:18,389
gets filled. He pulls his offer before
he gets filled. Not only that, we would

7100
02:39:18,389 --> 02:39:18,399
he gets filled. Not only that, we would
 

7101
02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:20,870
he gets filled. Not only that, we would
see that show up in the volume. All

7102
02:39:20,870 --> 02:39:20,880
see that show up in the volume. All
 

7103
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:22,230
see that show up in the volume. All
right, we would see that additional

7104
02:39:22,230 --> 02:39:22,240
right, we would see that additional
 

7105
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:24,150
right, we would see that additional
volume here. All right, and we would see

7106
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:24,160
volume here. All right, and we would see
 

7107
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:26,309
volume here. All right, and we would see
it in the delta. It never gets filled.

7108
02:39:26,309 --> 02:39:26,319
it in the delta. It never gets filled.
 

7109
02:39:26,319 --> 02:39:28,230
it in the delta. It never gets filled.
He pulls it and look at it's the same

7110
02:39:28,230 --> 02:39:28,240
He pulls it and look at it's the same
 

7111
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:30,469
He pulls it and look at it's the same
size lifting up here. It's the same

7112
02:39:30,469 --> 02:39:30,479
size lifting up here. It's the same
 

7113
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:32,389
size lifting up here. It's the same
block. The moment he pulls it, look

7114
02:39:32,389 --> 02:39:32,399
block. The moment he pulls it, look
 

7115
02:39:32,399 --> 02:39:33,830
block. The moment he pulls it, look
where he goes. Oh, I'm just going to

7116
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:33,840
where he goes. Oh, I'm just going to
 

7117
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:35,590
where he goes. Oh, I'm just going to
skip up here. He moves it 50 points

7118
02:39:35,590 --> 02:39:35,600
skip up here. He moves it 50 points
 

7119
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:38,309
skip up here. He moves it 50 points
higher. That's how we know. That's how

7120
02:39:38,309 --> 02:39:38,319
higher. That's how we know. That's how
 

7121
02:39:38,319 --> 02:39:40,150
higher. That's how we know. That's how
we know it's the same size as well. Same

7122
02:39:40,150 --> 02:39:40,160
we know it's the same size as well. Same
 

7123
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:42,630
we know it's the same size as well. Same
size, same time. It's the same player

7124
02:39:42,630 --> 02:39:42,640
size, same time. It's the same player
 

7125
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:44,309
size, same time. It's the same player
lifting. He's trying to get price to

7126
02:39:44,309 --> 02:39:44,319
lifting. He's trying to get price to
 

7127
02:39:44,319 --> 02:39:47,910
lifting. He's trying to get price to
retract up to him.

7128
02:39:47,910 --> 02:39:47,920
retract up to him.
 

7129
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:49,510
retract up to him.
Doesn't mean he gets it, but it's what

7130
02:39:49,510 --> 02:39:49,520
Doesn't mean he gets it, but it's what
 

7131
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:55,429
Doesn't mean he gets it, but it's what
he's looking to do.

7132
02:39:55,429 --> 02:39:55,439

 

7133
02:39:55,439 --> 02:39:57,349

Am I going to trade more today? Uh, not

7134
02:39:57,349 --> 02:39:57,359
Am I going to trade more today? Uh, not
 

7135
02:39:57,359 --> 02:40:00,550
Am I going to trade more today? Uh, not
unless I see something I really like.

7136
02:40:00,550 --> 02:40:00,560
unless I see something I really like.
 

7137
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:07,830
unless I see something I really like.
Um, I will set price alerts for sure.

7138
02:40:07,830 --> 02:40:07,840

 

7139
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,830

Which implemented change had the biggest

7140
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:09,840
Which implemented change had the biggest
 

7141
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:11,990
Which implemented change had the biggest
impact on

7142
02:40:11,990 --> 02:40:12,000
impact on
 

7143
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,950
impact on
trading? Um,

7144
02:40:14,950 --> 02:40:14,960
trading? Um,
 

7145
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:17,590
trading? Um,
I would say just location momentum,

7146
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:17,600
I would say just location momentum,
 

7147
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:19,670
I would say just location momentum,
asking myself that question, right? So,

7148
02:40:19,670 --> 02:40:19,680
asking myself that question, right? So,
 

7149
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:21,429
asking myself that question, right? So,
pl plotting out the locations that I

7150
02:40:21,429 --> 02:40:21,439
pl plotting out the locations that I
 

7151
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:24,150
pl plotting out the locations that I
want to trade and not trading the

7152
02:40:24,150 --> 02:40:24,160
want to trade and not trading the
 

7153
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:25,830
want to trade and not trading the
locations I don't want to trade. So, we

7154
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:25,840
locations I don't want to trade. So, we
 

7155
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:27,270
locations I don't want to trade. So, we
plotted out down here. We were willing

7156
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:27,280
plotted out down here. We were willing
 

7157
02:40:27,280 --> 02:40:29,750
plotted out down here. We were willing
to trade under these gray boxes or

7158
02:40:29,750 --> 02:40:29,760
to trade under these gray boxes or
 

7159
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:31,349
to trade under these gray boxes or
around these gray boxes today because we

7160
02:40:31,349 --> 02:40:31,359
around these gray boxes today because we
 

7161
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:33,110
around these gray boxes today because we
knew there was possible trap levels down

7162
02:40:33,110 --> 02:40:33,120
knew there was possible trap levels down
 

7163
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:35,270
knew there was possible trap levels down
here. Up here, I was willing to look at

7164
02:40:35,270 --> 02:40:35,280
here. Up here, I was willing to look at
 

7165
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:36,870
here. Up here, I was willing to look at
trading for the short side, but I don't

7166
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:36,880
trading for the short side, but I don't
 

7167
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,230
trading for the short side, but I don't
like this high of day auction. All

7168
02:40:38,230 --> 02:40:38,240
like this high of day auction. All
 

7169
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:39,750
like this high of day auction. All
right, we've gone flat there. I would

7170
02:40:39,750 --> 02:40:39,760
right, we've gone flat there. I would
 

7171
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:42,469
right, we've gone flat there. I would
really have liked us to spike up into

7172
02:40:42,469 --> 02:40:42,479
really have liked us to spike up into
 

7173
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:44,230
really have liked us to spike up into
this gray box. All right, if we'd done

7174
02:40:44,230 --> 02:40:44,240
this gray box. All right, if we'd done
 

7175
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:47,349
this gray box. All right, if we'd done
something like this. All right, then I'd

7176
02:40:47,349 --> 02:40:47,359
something like this. All right, then I'd
 

7177
02:40:47,359 --> 02:40:49,349
something like this. All right, then I'd
be happy to look for a short back down.

7178
02:40:49,349 --> 02:40:49,359
be happy to look for a short back down.
 

7179
02:40:49,359 --> 02:40:51,349
be happy to look for a short back down.
All right, so my locations today were

7180
02:40:51,349 --> 02:40:51,359
All right, so my locations today were
 

7181
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:54,230
All right, so my locations today were
here and down here to trade from. My

7182
02:40:54,230 --> 02:40:54,240
here and down here to trade from. My
 

7183
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:56,389
here and down here to trade from. My
locations not to trade from are in here.

7184
02:40:56,389 --> 02:40:56,399
locations not to trade from are in here.
 

7185
02:40:56,399 --> 02:40:59,270
locations not to trade from are in here.
I don't want to trade in here. So, that

7186
02:40:59,270 --> 02:40:59,280
I don't want to trade in here. So, that
 

7187
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:01,910
I don't want to trade in here. So, that
probably helped me a lot, right? Because

7188
02:41:01,910 --> 02:41:01,920
probably helped me a lot, right? Because
 

7189
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:04,070
probably helped me a lot, right? Because
now I have a rule of if I'm not in that

7190
02:41:04,070 --> 02:41:04,080
now I have a rule of if I'm not in that
 

7191
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:06,950
now I have a rule of if I'm not in that
location, I cannot trade, right? I

7192
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:06,960
location, I cannot trade, right? I
 

7193
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,870
location, I cannot trade, right? I
cannot trade. Yesterday was kind of the

7194
02:41:08,870 --> 02:41:08,880
cannot trade. Yesterday was kind of the
 

7195
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:10,389
cannot trade. Yesterday was kind of the
same actually. It made it a bit hard for

7196
02:41:10,389 --> 02:41:10,399
same actually. It made it a bit hard for
 

7197
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:12,230
same actually. It made it a bit hard for
me. We took the longs. Anyone that was

7198
02:41:12,230 --> 02:41:12,240
me. We took the longs. Anyone that was
 

7199
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:14,550
me. We took the longs. Anyone that was
here yesterday, we knew, see here's the

7200
02:41:14,550 --> 02:41:14,560
here yesterday, we knew, see here's the
 

7201
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:16,389
here yesterday, we knew, see here's the
location. We knew that if we held blue

7202
02:41:16,389 --> 02:41:16,399
location. We knew that if we held blue
 

7203
02:41:16,399 --> 02:41:18,070
location. We knew that if we held blue
box, we'd be looking for longs. It was a

7204
02:41:18,070 --> 02:41:18,080
box, we'd be looking for longs. It was a
 

7205
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:20,389
box, we'd be looking for longs. It was a
very similar trade setup yesterday. We

7206
02:41:20,389 --> 02:41:20,399
very similar trade setup yesterday. We
 

7207
02:41:20,399 --> 02:41:23,590
very similar trade setup yesterday. We
washed into the low trapped and we got

7208
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:23,600
washed into the low trapped and we got
 

7209
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:25,750
washed into the low trapped and we got
long here and I think we got long here

7210
02:41:25,750 --> 02:41:25,760
long here and I think we got long here
 

7211
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,270
long here and I think we got long here
and then I think I was done with it. I

7212
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:27,280
and then I think I was done with it. I
 

7213
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:28,710
and then I think I was done with it. I
think I got knocked out. Now, this is

7214
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:28,720
think I got knocked out. Now, this is
 

7215
02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:31,510
think I got knocked out. Now, this is
hard because we go deep premium all the

7216
02:41:31,510 --> 02:41:31,520
hard because we go deep premium all the
 

7217
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:33,190
hard because we go deep premium all the
way up to previous week high. So, I

7218
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:33,200
way up to previous week high. So, I
 

7219
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,670
way up to previous week high. So, I
think I previous week high. I think I

7220
02:41:35,670 --> 02:41:35,680
think I previous week high. I think I
 

7221
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:39,110
think I previous week high. I think I

and then right here. So I say just got
 

7261
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:38,790
and then right here. So I say just got
to start a short side here just in case

7262

7265
02:42:40,399 --> 02:42:41,990
last trade for me either goes or doesn't
either way. Can't force it and don't

7266
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:42,000
either way. Can't force it and don't
 

7267
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,389
either way. Can't force it and don't
want to. Here we go. So you can see my

want to. Here we go. So you can see my
 

7269
02:42:44,399 --> 02:42:47,190
want to. Here we go. So you can see my
short position right using this trap

7270
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:47,200
short position right using this trap
 

7271
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:49,750

low. So the team start to join me in
 

7277
02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:56,309
low. So the team start to join me in
here and then I think I draw what I'm

02:42:56,309 --> 02:42:56,319
here and then I think I draw what I'm
 

7279
02:42:56,319 --> 02:42:57,510
here and then I think I draw what I'm
looking for. So, I'm looking for that

right? For the wash, we're talking about
 

7285
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:04,230
right? For the wash, we're talking about
who needs to leave because there was a

7286
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:04,240
who needs to leave because there was a
 

7287
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:06,309
who needs to leave because there was a
buyer bidding all day at 80 once he left

7288
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:06,319

7289
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:07,910

the tape, right? We're talking about

7290
02:43:07,910 --> 02:43:07,920
the tape, right? We're talking about
 

7291
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:09,590
the tape, right? We're talking about
this shelf. Once we leave the tape, we

7292
02:43:09,590 --> 02:43:09,600
this shelf. Once we leave the tape, we
 

7293
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:14,230
this shelf. Once we leave the tape, we
can repric this low volume node

7294
02:43:14,230 --> 02:43:14,240
can repric this low volume node
 

7295
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:15,910
can repric this low volume node
and we start locking some in. And I

7296
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:15,920
and we start locking some in. And I
 

7297
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:18,630
and we start locking some in. And I
think the guys catch it a bit later when

7298
02:43:18,630 --> 02:43:18,640
think the guys catch it a bit later when
 

7299
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:23,110
think the guys catch it a bit later when
I leave.

7300
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:23,120

 

7301
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:26,469

There we go. Daniel got it. goop

7302
02:43:26,469 --> 02:43:26,479
There we go. Daniel got it. goop
 

7303
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:29,110
There we go. Daniel got it. goop
and that was it. All right. So, if I

7304
02:43:29,110 --> 02:43:29,120
and that was it. All right. So, if I
 

7305
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:31,030
and that was it. All right. So, if I
don't get it here, I if it's still

7306
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:31,040
don't get it here, I if it's still
 

7307
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:32,389
don't get it here, I if it's still
selling up, I try and get it in the next

7308
02:43:32,389 --> 02:43:32,399
selling up, I try and get it in the next
 

7309
02:43:32,399 --> 02:43:34,630
selling up, I try and get it in the next
trade, but it's the same thesis. So,

7310
02:43:34,630 --> 02:43:34,640
trade, but it's the same thesis. So,
 

7311
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:36,389
trade, but it's the same thesis. So,
it's just waiting for the location. All

7312
02:43:36,389 --> 02:43:36,399
it's just waiting for the location. All
 

7313
02:43:36,399 --> 02:43:38,630
it's just waiting for the location. All
right. I was unwilling to buy all this.

7314
02:43:38,630 --> 02:43:38,640
right. I was unwilling to buy all this.
 

7315
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:40,309
right. I was unwilling to buy all this.
Anyone who joined me on stream, I said

Anyone who joined me on stream, I said
this is a force up. I think there'll be

7318
02:43:42,630 --> 02:43:42,640
this is a force up. I think there'll be
 

7319
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:44,309
this is a force up. I think there'll be
a wash down and a rebid and we're going

7320
02:43:44,309 --> 02:43:44,319
a wash down and a rebid and we're going
 

7321
02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:46,150
a wash down and a rebid and we're going
to range. There's the wash down. There's

7325
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:50,790
the rebid. And we go back into range,
which we are still in now. Nothing has

in the same range all night, all day,
 

7331
02:43:55,279 --> 02:43:56,870
in the same range all night, all day,
right? This is how I know it's liquidity

What made those locations attractive?
 

7337
02:44:01,359 --> 02:44:11,190
What made those locations attractive?
Higher time frame volume areas.

Do I also trade VWAP bounces sometimes?
 

7357
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:35,349

Nice opportunities. If not, why? Yeah, I
 

7359
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:38,309
Nice opportunities. If not, why? Yeah, I
do. I prefer the IB trade, which is what

7363
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:41,349
I would have been looking for today. So,
I would have preferred that fail

7364
02:44:41,349 --> 02:44:41,359
I would have preferred that fail
 

7365

I would have preferred that fail
breakout rejection of IB trade to VWAP.

7366
02:44:44,389 --> 02:44:44,399
breakout rejection of IB trade to VWAP.
 

7367
02:44:44,399 --> 02:44:46,950
breakout rejection of IB trade to VWAP.
All right. And then if we reject IB, we

7368
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:46,960
All right. And then if we reject IB, we
 

7369
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:49,269
All right. And then if we reject IB, we
keep rejecting there. There is

7370
02:44:49,269 --> 02:44:49,279
keep rejecting there. There is
 

7371
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:50,790
keep rejecting there. There is
possibility. We got have to get under

7372
02:44:50,790 --> 02:44:50,800
possibility. We got have to get under
 

7373
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:53,269
possibility. We got have to get under
this that we will go from VWAP to IB low

7374

they're definitely losing market share

7526
02:49:00,630 --> 02:49:00,640
they're definitely losing market share
 

7527
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:01,910
they're definitely losing market share
and it's hurting them. So, they're

7528
02:49:01,910 --> 02:49:01,920
and it's hurting them. So, they're
 

7529
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:08,710
and it's hurting them. So, they're
changing rules.

7530
02:49:08,710 --> 02:49:08,720

 

7531
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:10,630

Latif, you don't get the location part

7532
02:49:10,630 --> 02:49:10,640
Latif, you don't get the location part
 

7533
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:14,469
Latif, you don't get the location part
of where I took it.

7534
02:49:14,469 --> 02:49:14,479

 

7535
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:17,830

went over this under here, right?

7536
02:49:17,830 --> 02:49:17,840
went over this under here, right?
 

7537
02:49:17,840 --> 02:49:19,670
went over this under here, right?
Because breakout sellers came in under

7538
02:49:19,670 --> 02:49:19,680
Because breakout sellers came in under
 

7539
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:22,230
Because breakout sellers came in under
here and stops got washed. So once we

7540
02:49:22,230 --> 02:49:22,240
here and stops got washed. So once we
 

7541
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:24,469
here and stops got washed. So once we
return back, they get trapped. So I take

7542
02:49:24,469 --> 02:49:24,479
return back, they get trapped. So I take
 

7543
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:26,630
return back, they get trapped. So I take
it here on the reclaim or this move back

7544
02:49:26,630 --> 02:49:26,640
it here on the reclaim or this move back
 

7545
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:29,750
it here on the reclaim or this move back
to the upside of this. We're protecting

7546
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:29,760
to the upside of this. We're protecting
 

7547
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:32,309
to the upside of this. We're protecting
current week developing volume profile

7548
02:49:32,309 --> 02:49:32,319
current week developing volume profile
 

7549
02:49:32,319 --> 02:49:35,349
current week developing volume profile
value towards this node, right? And then

7550
02:49:35,349 --> 02:49:35,359
value towards this node, right? And then
 

7551
02:49:35,359 --> 02:49:41,590
value towards this node, right? And then
we rinse back up.

7552
02:49:41,590 --> 02:49:41,600

box here first, but yeah, possibly. They
 

7565
02:49:54,800 --> 02:49:56,230
box here first, but yeah, possibly. They

7567

Shown to do this in real time is

7616
02:51:06,630 --> 02:51:06,640
Shown to do this in real time is
 

7617
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:08,230
Shown to do this in real time is
different.

7618
02:51:08,230 --> 02:51:08,240
different.
 

7619
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:13,349

I do it in real [\h__\h] time. You

7620
02:51:13,349 --> 02:51:13,359
I do it in real [\h__\h] time. You
 

7621
02:51:13,359 --> 02:51:16,230
I do it in real [\h__\h] time. You
I do it even before it's happening. But

7622
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:16,240
I do it even before it's happening. But
 

7623
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:20,150
I do it even before it's happening. But
I cannot draw everything on for you all

7624
02:51:20,150 --> 02:51:20,160
I cannot draw everything on for you all
 

7625
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:22,389
I cannot draw everything on for you all
the [\h__\h] time. I literally tell you

7626
02:51:22,389 --> 02:51:22,399
the [\h__\h] time. I literally tell you
 

7627
02:51:22,399 --> 02:51:24,950
the [\h__\h] time. I literally tell you
what I'm doing. I execute on a different

7628
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:24,960
what I'm doing. I execute on a different
 

7629
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:27,269
what I'm doing. I execute on a different
chart because I cannot draw all this on

7630
02:51:27,269 --> 02:51:27,279
chart because I cannot draw all this on
 

7631

on Ninja for you.
Why are you here asking that? Is it

7634
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:33,120
Why are you here asking that? Is it
 

7635
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:35,190
Why are you here asking that? Is it
because you're [\h__\h] at trading and you

7636
02:51:35,190 --> 02:51:35,200
because you're [\h__\h] at trading and you
 

7637
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:37,349
because you're [\h__\h] at trading and you
need me to do it and you can't listen or

7638
02:51:37,349 --> 02:51:37,359
need me to do it and you can't listen or
 

7639
02:51:37,359 --> 02:51:39,190
need me to do it and you can't listen or
understand and you need me to physically

7640
02:51:39,190 --> 02:51:39,200
understand and you need me to physically
 

7641
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:41,269
understand and you need me to physically
do it so you can just do the same thing?

7642
02:51:41,269 --> 02:51:41,279
do it so you can just do the same thing?
 

7643
02:51:41,279 --> 02:51:47,110
do it so you can just do the same thing?
Is that why? That's the bigger question.

7644
02:51:47,110 --> 02:51:47,120

 

7645
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:53,910

[\h__\h] me.

02:51:59,910 --> 02:51:59,920
after the fact. It's before it even
 

7651
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:02,630
after the fact. It's before it even
happens. Before it even happens. It's

7652
02:52:02,630 --> 02:52:02,640
happens. Before it even happens. It's
 

7653
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:05,030
happens. Before it even happens. It's
here. I'm going to look for a trap down

7654
02:52:05,030 --> 02:52:05,040

7813
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:30,309

Would

7814
02:56:30,309 --> 02:56:30,319

 

7815
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:33,990

you go long 310? This node here I like.

7816
02:56:33,990 --> 02:56:34,000
you go long 310? This node here I like.
 

7817

Right. So if we think about where we

7818
02:56:35,510 --> 02:56:35,520
Right. So if we think about where we
 

7819
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:38,230
Right. So if we think about where we
found bids this morning, right? It might

7820
02:56:38,230 --> 02:56:38,240
found bids this morning, right? It might
 

7821
02:56:38,240 --> 02:56:40,309
found bids this morning, right? It might
be that they come into here and rebid

7822
02:56:40,309 --> 02:56:40,319
be that they come into here and rebid
 

7823
02:56:40,319 --> 02:56:42,950
be that they come into here and rebid
it. Um so this gray box has been here

7824
02:56:42,950 --> 02:56:42,960
it. Um so this gray box has been here
 

7825
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:44,950
it. Um so this gray box has been here
all day. This is where I think I would

7826
02:56:44,950 --> 02:56:44,960
all day. This is where I think I would
 

7827
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:47,269
all day. This is where I think I would
cover if I if I was short, if I'd got

7828
02:56:47,269 --> 02:56:47,279
cover if I if I was short, if I'd got
 

7829
02:56:47,279 --> 02:56:50,230
cover if I if I was short, if I'd got
this move, I'd be covering into this and

7830
02:56:50,230 --> 02:56:50,240
this move, I'd be covering into this and
 

7831
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:52,389
this move, I'd be covering into this and
holding a runner. If shorts fail to

7832
02:56:52,389 --> 02:56:52,399
holding a runner. If shorts fail to
 

7833
02:56:52,399 --> 02:56:54,790
holding a runner. If shorts fail to
break down, now

7834
02:56:54,790 --> 02:56:54,800
break down, now
 

7835
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:57,110
break down, now
just have a look at here.

7836
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:57,120
just have a look at here.
 

7837
02:56:57,120 --> 02:56:58,630
just have a look at here.

02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:03,590
got caught again.
Shorts got caught under 310.

7842
02:57:03,590 --> 02:57:03,600
Shorts got caught under 310.
 

7843
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:08,389
Shorts got caught under 310.
Shorts just got caught under 310.

7844
02:57:08,389 --> 02:57:08,399

 

7845
02:57:08,399 --> 02:57:10,710

Look here. Lookie lookie. All right,

7846
02:57:10,710 --> 02:57:10,720
Look here. Lookie lookie. All right,
 

7847
02:57:10,720 --> 02:57:12,070
Look here. Lookie lookie. All right,
these are the aggressive shorts. There

7848
02:57:12,070 --> 02:57:12,080
these are the aggressive shorts. There
 

7849
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:15,110
these are the aggressive shorts. There
they are. Same level 311. Right, they

7850
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:15,120
they are. Same level 311. Right, they
 

7851
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:16,710
they are. Same level 311. Right, they
just got caught there. If we hold that,

7852
02:57:16,710 --> 02:57:16,720
just got caught there. If we hold that,
 

7853
02:57:16,720 --> 02:57:19,190
just got caught there. If we hold that,
we will bid back up and come and try and

7854
02:57:19,190 --> 02:57:19,200
we will bid back up and come and try and
 

7855
02:57:19,200 --> 02:57:20,630
we will bid back up and come and try and
let out all these buyers. You might see

7856
02:57:20,630 --> 02:57:20,640
let out all these buyers. You might see
 

7857
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:22,150
let out all these buyers. You might see
a squeeze here starting. Yeah, you're

7858
02:57:22,150 --> 02:57:22,160
a squeeze here starting. Yeah, you're
 

7859
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:24,150
a squeeze here starting. Yeah, you're
starting to see it right into the gray

7860
02:57:24,150 --> 02:57:24,160
starting to see it right into the gray
 

7861
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:27,110
starting to see it right into the gray
box. All right. So, under 310s, all the

7862
02:57:27,110 --> 02:57:27,120
box. All right. So, under 310s, all the
 

7863
02:57:27,120 --> 02:57:29,349
box. All right. So, under 310s, all the
time we protect 310s. Now, shorts are

7864
02:57:29,349 --> 02:57:29,359
time we protect 310s. Now, shorts are
 

7865
02:57:29,359 --> 02:57:32,469
time we protect 310s. Now, shorts are
stuck. This is your reversion. So, if

7866
02:57:32,469 --> 02:57:32,479
stuck. This is your reversion. So, if
 

7867
02:57:32,479 --> 02:57:35,190
stuck. This is your reversion. So, if
they can hold a bid into 30s, you'll get

7868
02:57:35,190 --> 02:57:35,200
they can hold a bid into 30s, you'll get
 

7869
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:37,030
they can hold a bid into 30s, you'll get
a squeeze back out into this node. And

7870
02:57:37,030 --> 02:57:37,040
a squeeze back out into this node. And
 

7871
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:38,230
a squeeze back out into this node. And
then you're asking for the same thing.

7872
02:57:38,230 --> 02:57:38,240
then you're asking for the same thing.
 

7873
02:57:38,240 --> 02:57:39,750
then you're asking for the same thing.
Remember, this is very controlled

7874
02:57:39,750 --> 02:57:39,760
Remember, this is very controlled
 

7875
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:41,349
Remember, this is very controlled
selling. When they have finished

7876
02:57:41,349 --> 02:57:41,359
selling. When they have finished
 

7877
02:57:41,359 --> 02:57:43,269
selling. When they have finished
selling, they can come and rinse all

7878
02:57:43,269 --> 02:57:43,279
selling, they can come and rinse all
 

7879
02:57:43,279 --> 02:57:45,510
selling, they can come and rinse all
this this out. There is still that

7880
02:57:45,510 --> 02:57:45,520
this this out. There is still that
 

7881
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:47,830
this this out. There is still that
seller at 50. And we're going to test

7882
02:57:47,830 --> 02:57:47,840
seller at 50. And we're going to test
 

7883
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:50,790
seller at 50. And we're going to test
him. And if he lifts, this might spike.

7884
02:57:50,790 --> 02:57:50,800
him. And if he lifts, this might spike.
 

7885
02:57:50,800 --> 02:57:53,510
him. And if he lifts, this might spike.
So, we'll see. I'll stay with you for

7886
02:57:53,510 --> 02:57:53,520
So, we'll see. I'll stay with you for
 

7887
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:55,190
So, we'll see. I'll stay with you for
like five minutes here. If he lifts at

7888
02:57:55,190 --> 02:57:55,200
like five minutes here. If he lifts at
 

7889
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:57,110
like five minutes here. If he lifts at
this 50, he has been filled here once

7890
02:57:57,110 --> 02:57:57,120
this 50, he has been filled here once
 

7891
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:58,950
this 50, he has been filled here once
before, but he's here. He's here right

7892
02:57:58,950 --> 02:57:58,960
before, but he's here. He's here right
 

7893
02:57:58,960 --> 02:58:00,950
before, but he's here. He's here right
now. If they lift him, we might spike

7894
02:58:00,950 --> 02:58:00,960
now. If they lift him, we might spike
 

7895
02:58:00,960 --> 02:58:03,030
now. If they lift him, we might spike
here. ES reclaiming VW up as well. Big

7896
02:58:03,030 --> 02:58:03,040
here. ES reclaiming VW up as well. Big
 

7897
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:07,110

7898
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:07,120
level. 50. Big level.
 

7899
02:58:07,120 --> 02:58:08,790
level. 50. Big level.
Here comes the squeeze. They're trying

7900
02:58:08,790 --> 02:58:08,800
Here comes the squeeze. They're trying
 

7901
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:10,389
Here comes the squeeze. They're trying
to lift 50. They filled some of him.

7902
02:58:10,389 --> 02:58:10,399
to lift 50. They filled some of him.
 

7903
02:58:10,399 --> 02:58:12,389
to lift 50. They filled some of him.
He's staying on the tape this time. He's

7904
02:58:12,389 --> 02:58:12,399
He's staying on the tape this time. He's
 

7905
02:58:12,399 --> 02:58:13,910
He's staying on the tape this time. He's
actually providing the liquidity this

7906
02:58:13,910 --> 02:58:13,920
actually providing the liquidity this
 

7907
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:15,670
actually providing the liquidity this
time. He's staying there. Let's see if a

7908
02:58:15,670 --> 02:58:15,680
time. He's staying there. Let's see if a
 

7909
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:17,190
time. He's staying there. Let's see if a
buyer can just force them through here

7910
02:58:17,190 --> 02:58:17,200
buyer can just force them through here
 

7911
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:19,910
buyer can just force them through here
or not.

7912
02:58:19,910 --> 02:58:19,920
or not.
 

7913
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:21,910
or not.
Yeah, I would say now all the time you

7914
02:58:21,910 --> 02:58:21,920
Yeah, I would say now all the time you
 

7915
02:58:21,920 --> 02:58:25,110
Yeah, I would say now all the time you
protect uh 311s, you've got a shot to

7916
02:58:25,110 --> 02:58:25,120
protect uh 311s, you've got a shot to
 

7917
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:27,429
protect uh 311s, you've got a shot to
move higher. If the next pullback holds

7918
02:58:27,429 --> 02:58:27,439
move higher. If the next pullback holds
 

7919
02:58:27,439 --> 02:58:30,630
move higher. If the next pullback holds
25s, you could think about getting long,

7920
02:58:30,630 --> 02:58:30,640
25s, you could think about getting long,
 

7921
02:58:30,640 --> 02:58:35,349
25s, you could think about getting long,
right? If the next pullback holds

7922
02:58:35,349 --> 02:58:35,359

 

7923
02:58:35,359 --> 02:58:37,349

25s,

7924
02:58:37,349 --> 02:58:37,359
25s,
 

7925
02:58:37,359 --> 02:58:38,870
25s,
you could think about getting long for

7926
02:58:38,870 --> 02:58:38,880
you could think about getting long for
 

7927
02:58:38,880 --> 02:58:41,429
you could think about getting long for
this move here.

7928
02:58:41,429 --> 02:58:41,439
this move here.
 

7929
02:58:41,439 --> 02:58:43,590
this move here.
And you must respect 50. So if it does

7930
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:43,600
And you must respect 50. So if it does
 

7931
02:58:43,600 --> 02:58:45,030
And you must respect 50. So if it does
this, I'd be a partial. And if you do

7932
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:45,040
this, I'd be a partial. And if you do
 

7933
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:48,309
this, I'd be a partial. And if you do
this, you'll get a great move.

7934
02:58:48,309 --> 02:58:48,319
this, you'll get a great move.
 

7935
02:58:48,319 --> 02:58:51,190
this, you'll get a great move.
Okay. But you know, you could always

7936
02:58:51,190 --> 02:58:51,200
Okay. But you know, you could always
 

7937
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:58,550
Okay. But you know, you could always
listen to Ivan. Um,

7938
02:58:58,550 --> 02:58:58,560

 

7939
02:58:58,560 --> 02:59:01,269

okay.

7940
02:59:01,269 --> 02:59:01,279
okay.
 

7941
02:59:01,279 --> 02:59:20,150
okay.
Yeah. Without being an idiot.

7942
02:59:20,150 --> 02:59:20,160

 

7943
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:23,349

See you. Um, with large moves you try

7944
02:59:23,349 --> 02:59:23,359
See you. Um, with large moves you try
 

7945
02:59:23,359 --> 02:59:26,309
See you. Um, with large moves you try
and catch, what typical point stop loss

7946
02:59:26,309 --> 02:59:26,319
and catch, what typical point stop loss
 

7947
02:59:26,319 --> 02:59:28,230
and catch, what typical point stop loss
do you have? It all depends on where the

7948
02:59:28,230 --> 02:59:28,240
do you have? It all depends on where the
 

7949
02:59:28,240 --> 02:59:29,830
do you have? It all depends on where the
moves invalidated. Right, you're through

7950
02:59:29,830 --> 02:59:29,840
moves invalidated. Right, you're through
 

7951
02:59:29,840 --> 02:59:31,830
moves invalidated. Right, you're through
the 50s now. They you have to see if

7952
02:59:31,830 --> 02:59:31,840
the 50s now. They you have to see if
 

7953
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:33,510
the 50s now. They you have to see if
they lift this. So, you got this node

7954
02:59:33,510 --> 02:59:33,520
they lift this. So, you got this node
 

7955
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:37,590
they lift this. So, you got this node
here, 57, 64s, and then sort of 90s is

7956
02:59:37,590 --> 02:59:37,600
here, 57, 64s, and then sort of 90s is
 

7957
02:59:37,600 --> 03:00:01,429
here, 57, 64s, and then sort of 90s is
what you're looking for.

7958
03:00:01,429 --> 03:00:01,439

 

7959
03:00:01,439 --> 03:00:03,590

There you go. There's the lift. So into

7960
03:00:03,590 --> 03:00:03,600
There you go. There's the lift. So into
 

7961
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:18,710
There you go. There's the lift. So into
58. They're adding liquidity at 70s now.

7962
03:00:18,710 --> 03:00:18,720

 

7963
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:20,469

You might well get a lift back up. I

7964
03:00:20,469 --> 03:00:20,479
You might well get a lift back up. I
 

7965
03:00:20,479 --> 03:00:22,550
You might well get a lift back up. I
would still say if you defend 25s and

7966
03:00:22,550 --> 03:00:22,560
would still say if you defend 25s and
 

7967
03:00:22,560 --> 03:00:24,230
would still say if you defend 25s and
30s now, there's still an opportunity to

7968
03:00:24,230 --> 03:00:24,240
30s now, there's still an opportunity to
 

7969
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:25,910
30s now, there's still an opportunity to
get long, but you're into lunchtime now.

7970
03:00:25,910 --> 03:00:25,920
get long, but you're into lunchtime now.
 

7971
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:27,269
get long, but you're into lunchtime now.
Volume's dipped. But you can see the

7972
03:00:27,269 --> 03:00:27,279
Volume's dipped. But you can see the
 

7973
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:28,710
Volume's dipped. But you can see the
gray box held. All right. So, think

7974
03:00:28,710 --> 03:00:28,720
gray box held. All right. So, think
 

7975
03:00:28,720 --> 03:00:31,110
gray box held. All right. So, think
about this same area. This is where the

7976
03:00:31,110 --> 03:00:31,120
about this same area. This is where the
 

7977
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:32,230
about this same area. This is where the
sellers got trapped this morning.

7978
03:00:32,230 --> 03:00:32,240
sellers got trapped this morning.
 

7979
03:00:32,240 --> 03:00:34,389
sellers got trapped this morning.
Remember I kept saying our ad over 10.

7980
03:00:34,389 --> 03:00:34,399
Remember I kept saying our ad over 10.
 

7981
03:00:34,399 --> 03:00:36,469
Remember I kept saying our ad over 10.
That was the ad. So, we bought that. We

7982
03:00:36,469 --> 03:00:36,479
That was the ad. So, we bought that. We
 

7983
03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:39,670
That was the ad. So, we bought that. We
added, we've controlled repric down to

7984
03:00:39,670 --> 03:00:39,680
added, we've controlled repric down to
 

7985
03:00:39,680 --> 03:00:42,070
added, we've controlled repric down to
this same area. They've rebid this and

8005
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:02,230
and then this one, and then this one,
and then this one cuz this is very

8006
03:01:02,230 --> 03:01:02,240
and then this one cuz this is very
 

8007
03:01:02,240 --> 03:01:04,230
and then this one cuz this is very
controlled with no one being run out. So

8008
03:01:04,230 --> 03:01:04,240
controlled with no one being run out. So

the rotation today,
yeah, really, unless you bought that,

03:01:51,830 --> 03:01:51,840
yeah, really, unless you bought that,
 

8035
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:53,429
yeah, really, unless you bought that,
you need a pullback to come in to give

8036
03:01:53,429 --> 03:01:53,439
you need a pullback to come in to give
 

8037
03:01:53,439 --> 03:01:55,990
you need a pullback to come in to give
you the opportunity uh into some of

8038
03:01:55,990 --> 03:01:56,000
you the opportunity uh into some of
 

8039
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,710
you the opportunity uh into some of
these nodes and then look for 90s and

8040
03:01:58,710 --> 03:01:58,720
these nodes and then look for 90s and
 

8041
03:01:58,720 --> 03:02:00,469
these nodes and then look for 90s and
then see if they lift 90s for that high

8042
03:02:00,469 --> 03:02:00,479
then see if they lift 90s for that high
 

8043
03:02:00,479 --> 03:02:01,990
then see if they lift 90s for that high
of day. I don't think the auction at the

8044
03:02:01,990 --> 03:02:02,000
of day. I don't think the auction at the
 

8045
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,550
of day. I don't think the auction at the
high is in not on not on ENQ. It is

8046
03:02:04,550 --> 03:02:04,560
high is in not on not on ENQ. It is
 

8047
03:02:04,560 --> 03:02:06,790
high is in not on not on ENQ. It is
looks in on ES. I don't like that high

8048
03:02:06,790 --> 03:02:06,800
looks in on ES. I don't like that high
 

8049
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:08,790
looks in on ES. I don't like that high
of day auction. Like I said, I think

8050
03:02:08,790 --> 03:02:08,800
of day auction. Like I said, I think
 

8051
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:10,389
of day auction. Like I said, I think
there is a chance to get up into this

8052
03:02:10,389 --> 03:02:10,399
there is a chance to get up into this
 

8053
03:02:10,399 --> 03:02:13,190
there is a chance to get up into this
gray box. We've said it all day long.

8054
03:02:13,190 --> 03:02:13,200
gray box. We've said it all day long.
