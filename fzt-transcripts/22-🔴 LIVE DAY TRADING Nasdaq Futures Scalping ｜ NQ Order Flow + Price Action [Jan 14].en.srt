to coming back and trading with you
guys. I did actually take my first trade

18
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
guys. I did actually take my first trade
 

19
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,990
guys. I did actually take my first trade
in about 10 days yesterday.

20
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
in about 10 days yesterday.
 

21
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,350
in about 10 days yesterday.
trying to get a feel for this market.

22
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
trying to get a feel for this market.
 

23
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,670
trying to get a feel for this market.
So, let's go over where we are and have

24
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
So, let's go over where we are and have
 

25
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,430
So, let's go over where we are and have
a look at what kind of models we're in.

26
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
a look at what kind of models we're in.
 

27
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,189
a look at what kind of models we're in.
Starting off in the daily as always. You

28
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
Starting off in the daily as always. You
 

29
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,510
Starting off in the daily as always. You
can see so far we're on a Wednesday,

30
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
can see so far we're on a Wednesday,
 

31
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,469
can see so far we're on a Wednesday,
right? The weekly high and low so far

32
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
right? The weekly high and low so far
 

33
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,110
right? The weekly high and low so far
has been set by the Monday and Tuesday.

34
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
has been set by the Monday and Tuesday.
 

35
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,230
has been set by the Monday and Tuesday.
Those who have done the course will

36
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
Those who have done the course will
 

37
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,589
Those who have done the course will
understand that is our weekly range.

38
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
understand that is our weekly range.
 

39
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,749
understand that is our weekly range.
That is equivalent of a initial balance

40
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
That is equivalent of a initial balance
 

41
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,510
That is equivalent of a initial balance
for this week. So, we're waiting to see

42
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
for this week. So, we're waiting to see
 

43
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,990
for this week. So, we're waiting to see
if the market wants to find a

44
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
if the market wants to find a
 

45
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,150
if the market wants to find a
continuation outside of those first

46
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
continuation outside of those first
 

47
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,550
continuation outside of those first
Monday and Tuesday high and lows.

48
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560

 

49
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,710

within that we have some clear

50
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
within that we have some clear
 

51
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,350
within that we have some clear
resistance. Now you can see every time

52
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
resistance. Now you can see every time
 

53
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,309
resistance. Now you can see every time
we're popping up into 26,000 and above.

54
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
we're popping up into 26,000 and above.
 

55
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,270
we're popping up into 26,000 and above.
All right. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and even

56
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
All right. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and even
 

57
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,070
All right. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and even
yesterday 8 we are unloading. All right.

58
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
yesterday 8 we are unloading. All right.
 

59
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,589
yesterday 8 we are unloading. All right.
Someone keeps passively selling up into

60
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
Someone keeps passively selling up into
 

61
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,110
Someone keeps passively selling up into
pushes in there. All right. The

62
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
pushes in there. All right. The
 

63
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,430
pushes in there. All right. The
Ballingers have been contracting. We

64
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
Ballingers have been contracting. We
 

65
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,589
Ballingers have been contracting. We
have all the EMAs very very tight down

66
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
have all the EMAs very very tight down
 

67
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,270
have all the EMAs very very tight down
here. So far, we keep finding bids in

68
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
here. So far, we keep finding bids in
 

69
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,790
here. So far, we keep finding bids in
this low volume node down here that we

70
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
this low volume node down here that we
 

71
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,150
this low volume node down here that we
talked about a few weeks ago. All right,

72
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
talked about a few weeks ago. All right,
 

73
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,790
talked about a few weeks ago. All right,
so really the levels are 600 to 26,000

74
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
so really the levels are 600 to 26,000
 

75
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,869
so really the levels are 600 to 26,000
rotation, 400 point rotation. We can see

76
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
rotation, 400 point rotation. We can see
 

77
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,189
rotation, 400 point rotation. We can see
we have a node right here into the 800s

78
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
we have a node right here into the 800s
 

79
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,350
we have a node right here into the 800s
as well. Worth paying attention to.

80
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
as well. Worth paying attention to.
 

81
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,189
as well. Worth paying attention to.
Okay, so can the market find acceptance

82
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
Okay, so can the market find acceptance
 

83
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,710
Okay, so can the market find acceptance
over this? If it can, can it get

84
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
over this? If it can, can it get
 

85
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,710
over this? If it can, can it get
acceptance over this and start to drive

86
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
acceptance over this and start to drive
 

87
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,230
acceptance over this and start to drive
up with the bolds? Or does the market

88
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
up with the bolds? Or does the market
 

89
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,029
up with the bolds? Or does the market
find acceptance below this and come down

90
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
find acceptance below this and come down
 

91
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,589
find acceptance below this and come down
and open this out? We don't know. It's

92
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
and open this out? We don't know. It's
 

93
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,510
and open this out? We don't know. It's
really that simple. We don't know. So,

94
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
really that simple. We don't know. So,
 

95
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,070
really that simple. We don't know. So,
we are stuck in here in rotation while

96
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
we are stuck in here in rotation while
 

97
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,670
we are stuck in here in rotation while
it builds and we can get some more clues

98
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
it builds and we can get some more clues
 

99
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,270
it builds and we can get some more clues
as we move down into the hourly charts,

100
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
as we move down into the hourly charts,
 

101
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,029
as we move down into the hourly charts,
which we will do now.

102
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
which we will do now.
 

103
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,510
which we will do now.
Okay, hourly. Make sure you can see all

104
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
Okay, hourly. Make sure you can see all
 

105
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,389
Okay, hourly. Make sure you can see all
this. Make this a bit bigger for you.

106
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
this. Make this a bit bigger for you.
 

107
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,750
this. Make this a bit bigger for you.
All right, you can see we have this old

108
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
All right, you can see we have this old
 

109
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,430
All right, you can see we have this old
balance range down here. We're basically

110
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
balance range down here. We're basically
 

111
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,350
balance range down here. We're basically
stuck between two balance ranges, right?

112
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
stuck between two balance ranges, right?
 

113
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,430
stuck between two balance ranges, right?
This was a twoe balance basically in

114
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
This was a twoe balance basically in
 

115
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,750
This was a twoe balance basically in
here on the old contract, right? And

116
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
here on the old contract, right? And
 

117
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,829
here on the old contract, right? And
this was a two twoe balance dating back

118
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
this was a two twoe balance dating back
 

119
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,710
this was a two twoe balance dating back
to what the 29th of December. Okay.

120
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
to what the 29th of December. Okay.
 

121
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,829
to what the 29th of December. Okay.
And we keep attempting to find new

122
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
And we keep attempting to find new
 

123
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,150
And we keep attempting to find new
balance to move point of control and

124
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
balance to move point of control and
 

125
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,310
balance to move point of control and
value higher, but we keep failing. So we

126
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
value higher, but we keep failing. So we
 

127
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,070
value higher, but we keep failing. So we
came in here for a few days and now

128
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
came in here for a few days and now
 

129
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,829
came in here for a few days and now
we're opening up underneath back inside

130
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
we're opening up underneath back inside
 

131
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,509
we're opening up underneath back inside
this old balance. All right. So this is

132
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
this old balance. All right. So this is
 

133
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,070
this old balance. All right. So this is
the problem right now. We are not seeing

134
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
the problem right now. We are not seeing
 

135
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,870
the problem right now. We are not seeing
continuation. Tech continues to be a

136
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
continuation. Tech continues to be a
 

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,230
continuation. Tech continues to be a
little bit weaker as the market starts

138
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
little bit weaker as the market starts
 

139
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,070
little bit weaker as the market starts
to broaden. We are not seeing this kind

140
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
to broaden. We are not seeing this kind
 

141
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,070
to broaden. We are not seeing this kind
of move here. Moving balance higher,

142
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
of move here. Moving balance higher,
 

143
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,070
of move here. Moving balance higher,
taking out stops. What we're seeing is

144
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
taking out stops. What we're seeing is
 

145
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,310
taking out stops. What we're seeing is
balance created. Everyone says, "No,

146
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
balance created. Everyone says, "No,
 

147
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,910
balance created. Everyone says, "No,
that's too expensive. Let's come back

148
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
that's too expensive. Let's come back
 

149
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,430
that's too expensive. Let's come back
down." And we're back into this old

150
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
down." And we're back into this old
 

151
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,590
down." And we're back into this old
weekly point of control. So, it's worth

152
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
weekly point of control. So, it's worth
 

153
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,590
weekly point of control. So, it's worth
noting the previous week and the

154
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
noting the previous week and the
 

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,509
noting the previous week and the
developing week. We are under the

156
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
developing week. We are under the
 

157
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,150
developing week. We are under the
developing week's value right now. So,

158
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
developing week's value right now. So,
 

159
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,310
developing week's value right now. So,
if we find all right, if we come into

160
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
if we find all right, if we come into
 

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,870
if we find all right, if we come into
sort of the 830s anywhere up here, and

162
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
sort of the 830s anywhere up here, and
 

163
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,550
sort of the 830s anywhere up here, and
we keep selling into it, then we're

164
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
we keep selling into it, then we're
 

165
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,910
we keep selling into it, then we're
probably going to rotate down to this

166
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
probably going to rotate down to this
 

167
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,829
probably going to rotate down to this
point of control. This is where they

168
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
point of control. This is where they
 

169
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,430
point of control. This is where they
keep finding bids. It's a big level.

170
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
keep finding bids. It's a big level.
 

171
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,150
keep finding bids. It's a big level.
One, two, three works week weeks worth

172
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
One, two, three works week weeks worth
 

173
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,990
One, two, three works week weeks worth
of PC down here. If we lose sort of 680,

174
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
of PC down here. If we lose sort of 680,
 

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,990
of PC down here. If we lose sort of 680,
700s and we back test it and we stay

176
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
700s and we back test it and we stay
 

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,750
700s and we back test it and we stay
heavy, then I'm expecting a rotation

178
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
heavy, then I'm expecting a rotation
 

179
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,949
heavy, then I'm expecting a rotation
down to 55s. All right, 550s. If we come

180
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
down to 55s. All right, 550s. If we come
 

181
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,590
down to 55s. All right, 550s. If we come
underneath, find a bid, reclaim, rehold,

182
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
underneath, find a bid, reclaim, rehold,
 

183
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,550
underneath, find a bid, reclaim, rehold,
then what we're going to do, we're going

184
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
then what we're going to do, we're going
 

185
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,550
then what we're going to do, we're going
to come right back to 850s. If we go

186
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
to come right back to 850s. If we go
 

187
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,190
to come right back to 850s. If we go
over 850s, base and hold, then I'm

188
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
over 850s, base and hold, then I'm
 

189
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,710
over 850s, base and hold, then I'm
thinking we're going to go to 900. So,

190
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
thinking we're going to go to 900. So,
 

191
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,949
thinking we're going to go to 900. So,
there's lots of levels here that we need

192
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
there's lots of levels here that we need
 

193
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,269
there's lots of levels here that we need
to be aware of. We are in a rotational

194
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
to be aware of. We are in a rotational
 

195
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,430
to be aware of. We are in a rotational
market. I would say this current week

196
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
market. I would say this current week
 

197
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,230
market. I would say this current week
potentially is seeing some weakness now

198
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
potentially is seeing some weakness now
 

199
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,550
potentially is seeing some weakness now
if we stay heavy versus these eights.

200
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
if we stay heavy versus these eights.
 

201
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,550
if we stay heavy versus these eights.
Okay, if we stay heavy versus eights and

202
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
Okay, if we stay heavy versus eights and
 

203
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,269
Okay, if we stay heavy versus eights and
definitely if we stay heavy under 680s.

204
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
definitely if we stay heavy under 680s.
 

205
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,430
definitely if we stay heavy under 680s.
All right,

206
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
All right,
 

207
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,430
All right,
we can see if we move up here what we've

208
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
we can see if we move up here what we've
 

209
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,750
we can see if we move up here what we've
done overnight. All right, Asia goes

210
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
done overnight. All right, Asia goes
 

211
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,870
done overnight. All right, Asia goes
sideways, we lose the bid, we come down,

212
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
sideways, we lose the bid, we come down,
 

213
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,990
sideways, we lose the bid, we come down,
we come into uh London, we lose it, and

214
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
we come into uh London, we lose it, and
 

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,150
we come into uh London, we lose it, and
so far you're starting to see the sale.

216
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
so far you're starting to see the sale.
 

217
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,269
so far you're starting to see the sale.
Yeah, I'm going to go through the news

218
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
Yeah, I'm going to go through the news
 

219

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
shortly, guys. I know some of you are
 

221
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,910
shortly, guys. I know some of you are
talking about the news at 10. I know

222
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
talking about the news at 10. I know
 

223
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,750
talking about the news at 10. I know
that the tariff news is potentially

224
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
that the tariff news is potentially
 

225
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,430
that the tariff news is potentially
coming at 10. We don't have that for

226
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
coming at 10. We don't have that for
 

227
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,670
coming at 10. We don't have that for
certain. [sighs] Okay, so that's what

228
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
certain. [sighs] Okay, so that's what
 

229
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,310
certain. [sighs] Okay, so that's what
we're looking at

230
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
we're looking at
 

231
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,110
we're looking at
when we move up into here. So, you can

232
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
when we move up into here. So, you can
 

233
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,550
when we move up into here. So, you can
see my key levels. I'm interested in

234
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
see my key levels. I'm interested in
 

235
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,310
see my key levels. I'm interested in
pushes that fail into here, which is

236
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
pushes that fail into here, which is
 

237
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,870
pushes that fail into here, which is
what we had on that 830 PPI print. All

238
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
what we had on that 830 PPI print. All
 

239
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,710
what we had on that 830 PPI print. All
right, pushes that fail anywhere up

240
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
right, pushes that fail anywhere up
 

241
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,430
right, pushes that fail anywhere up
here. Do we see the sell bids that hold

242
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
here. Do we see the sell bids that hold
 

243
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,590
here. Do we see the sell bids that hold
here? All right, dip and reclaim. Do we

244
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
here? All right, dip and reclaim. Do we
 

245
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,590
here? All right, dip and reclaim. Do we
see the buy if we flip this? And I'm

246
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
see the buy if we flip this? And I'm
 

247
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,990
see the buy if we flip this? And I'm
expecting to sell this back down to the

248
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
expecting to sell this back down to the
 

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,550
expecting to sell this back down to the
next lot of levels. All right. I don't

250
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
next lot of levels. All right. I don't
 

251
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,230
next lot of levels. All right. I don't
really want to get caught just trading

252
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
really want to get caught just trading
 

253
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,590
really want to get caught just trading
between this. This is your range

254
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
between this. This is your range
 

255
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,670
between this. This is your range
potentially building out though, so it

256
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
potentially building out though, so it
 

257
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,990
potentially building out though, so it
is worth noting. Right. We can have a

258
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
is worth noting. Right. We can have a
 

259
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,310
is worth noting. Right. We can have a
quick look at the ES and the spiders.

260
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
quick look at the ES and the spiders.
 

261
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,829
quick look at the ES and the spiders.
Same kind of thing here. We're seeing a

262
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
Same kind of thing here. We're seeing a
 

263
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,750
Same kind of thing here. We're seeing a
rejection here of 680s. Sorry, 980s.

264
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
rejection here of 680s. Sorry, 980s.
 

265
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,910
rejection here of 680s. Sorry, 980s.
Right. Keep rejecting here. If we keep

266
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
Right. Keep rejecting here. If we keep
 

267
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,389
Right. Keep rejecting here. If we keep
doing that on the ES, we can have a

268
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
doing that on the ES, we can have a
 

269
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,310
doing that on the ES, we can have a
little zoom out here and maybe we dig in

270
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
little zoom out here and maybe we dig in
 

271
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,750
little zoom out here and maybe we dig in
for some of these stops. We'll have to

272
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
for some of these stops. We'll have to
 

273
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,590
for some of these stops. We'll have to
see. Let's have a look at uh some of the

274
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
see. Let's have a look at uh some of the
 

275
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,430
see. Let's have a look at uh some of the
ETFs quickly. Just make sure they're in

276
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
ETFs quickly. Just make sure they're in
 

277
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,590
ETFs quickly. Just make sure they're in
alignment. Yeah, same thing here on the

278
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
alignment. Yeah, same thing here on the
 

279
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,550
alignment. Yeah, same thing here on the
Q's. Looking good.

280
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
Q's. Looking good.
 

281
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,949
Q's. Looking good.
Rejecting this. So, you've had one, two,

282
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
Rejecting this. So, you've had one, two,
 

283
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,790
Rejecting this. So, you've had one, two,
three drives coming underneath. Do we

284
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
three drives coming underneath. Do we
 

285
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,710
three drives coming underneath. Do we
stay heavy here for this rotation?

286
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
stay heavy here for this rotation?
 

287
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,509
stay heavy here for this rotation?
That's the question for me.

288
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
That's the question for me.
 

289
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,310
That's the question for me.
Spiders the same thing. Yeah, exactly

290
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
Spiders the same thing. Yeah, exactly
 

291
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,910
Spiders the same thing. Yeah, exactly
the same thing. All right. 1 2 3

292
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
the same thing. All right. 1 2 3
 

293
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,389
the same thing. All right. 1 2 3
starting to get stuck here. Do we see a

294
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
starting to get stuck here. Do we see a
 

295
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,069
starting to get stuck here. Do we see a
retest of 87s, 88 somewhere down there?

296
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
retest of 87s, 88 somewhere down there?
 

297
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,269
retest of 87s, 88 somewhere down there?
If we have a look at the VIX, you'll

298
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
If we have a look at the VIX, you'll
 

299
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,990
If we have a look at the VIX, you'll
notice it's started to find a bid. We've

300
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
notice it's started to find a bid. We've
 

301
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,670
notice it's started to find a bid. We've
talked about this for a while. This kind

302
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
talked about this for a while. This kind
 

303
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,430
talked about this for a while. This kind
of thing here is always dangerous,

304
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
of thing here is always dangerous,
 

305
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,590
of thing here is always dangerous,
right? There's the bid, the reclaim. I

306
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
right? There's the bid, the reclaim. I
 

307
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,150
right? There's the bid, the reclaim. I
can mark that out

good to be back. Hopefully, this is uh

482
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
good to be back. Hopefully, this is uh
 

483
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,670
good to be back. Hopefully, this is uh
back to normal. I'm expecting a few

484
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
back to normal. I'm expecting a few
 

485
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,030
back to normal. I'm expecting a few
bumps in the road for me, so it's

486
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
bumps in the road for me, so it's
 

487
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,590
bumps in the road for me, so it's
possible I won't be streaming every day

488
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
possible I won't be streaming every day
 

489
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,310
possible I won't be streaming every day
next week, but let's see. Hopefully

490
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
next week, but let's see. Hopefully
 

491
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,629
next week, but let's see. Hopefully
hopefully we can get back to normal. All

492
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
hopefully we can get back to normal. All
 

493
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,110
hopefully we can get back to normal. All
right, I just want to check my levels

494
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
right, I just want to check my levels
 

495
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,550
right, I just want to check my levels
here. Make sure everything is looking

496
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560
here. Make sure everything is looking
 

497
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,870
here. Make sure everything is looking
good.

498
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
good.
 

499
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,710
good.
Where is that P?

500
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720

 

501
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,110

All right. So, I want to see if I can if

502
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
All right. So, I want to see if I can if
 

503
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,269
All right. So, I want to see if I can if
we can get a drive out this morning to

504
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
we can get a drive out this morning to
 

505
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,670
we can get a drive out this morning to
the upside to fade or see if a dip holds

506
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
the upside to fade or see if a dip holds
 

507
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,269
the upside to fade or see if a dip holds
here or even if they flip it would be

508
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
here or even if they flip it would be
 

509
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,590
here or even if they flip it would be
really nice. Market feels a little bit

510
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
really nice. Market feels a little bit
 

511
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,550
really nice. Market feels a little bit
weak to me today. So, let's just see how

512
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
weak to me today. So, let's just see how
 

513
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,550
weak to me today. So, let's just see how
we go.

514
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560

 

515
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,550

Couple minutes left here. Well, we get

516
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
Couple minutes left here. Well, we get
 

517
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,230
Couple minutes left here. Well, we get
prepped. It's been a [snorts] good week.

518
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
prepped. It's been a [snorts] good week.
 

519
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,910
prepped. It's been a [snorts] good week.
Yeah, lots of you done well. That's good

520
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
Yeah, lots of you done well. That's good
 

521
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,749
Yeah, lots of you done well. That's good
to hear.

522
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
to hear.
 

523
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,150
to hear.
That is good to hear.

524
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160

 

525
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,990

There's been some nice opportunities.

526
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
There's been some nice opportunities.
 

527
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,710
There's been some nice opportunities.
Definitely been some nice opportunities.

528
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
Definitely been some nice opportunities.
 

529
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,230
Definitely been some nice opportunities.
You can see like we're just at the

530
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
You can see like we're just at the
 

531
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,269
You can see like we're just at the
midpoint of the range. If you look at

532
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
midpoint of the range. If you look at
 

533
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,470
midpoint of the range. If you look at
the daily, like we're right on the

534
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
the daily, like we're right on the
 

535
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,030
the daily, like we're right on the
20-day right now. So, you know, the edge

536
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
20-day right now. So, you know, the edge
 

537
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,350
20-day right now. So, you know, the edge
will come if we start to lose the bid.

538
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
will come if we start to lose the bid.
 

539
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,590
will come if we start to lose the bid.
And we can think about the rotation to

540
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
And we can think about the rotation to
 

541
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,949
And we can think about the rotation to
come and take out some of these stops

542
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
come and take out some of these stops
 

543
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,550
come and take out some of these stops
maybe down into the sort of the fives,

544
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
maybe down into the sort of the fives,
 

545
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,069
maybe down into the sort of the fives,
the fours, and even the lower Ballinger

546
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
the fours, and even the lower Ballinger
 

547
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,749
the fours, and even the lower Ballinger
band down at 120. Well, that doesn't

548
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
band down at 120. Well, that doesn't
 

549
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,590
band down at 120. Well, that doesn't
have to happen all in one session or

550
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
have to happen all in one session or
 

551
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,829
have to happen all in one session or
even this week. But if we lose the bid,

552
00:16:59,829 --> 00:16:59,839
even this week. But if we lose the bid,
 

553
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,749
even this week. But if we lose the bid,
we'll get some edge in the market. If

554
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
we'll get some edge in the market. If
 

555
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,150
we'll get some edge in the market. If
the bid starts to uh hold up and look to

556
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
the bid starts to uh hold up and look to
 

557
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,069
the bid starts to uh hold up and look to
expand over those stops at 26125, then

558
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
expand over those stops at 26125, then
 

559
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,669
expand over those stops at 26125, then
we can think about alltime highs. But at

560
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
we can think about alltime highs. But at
 

561
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,549
we can think about alltime highs. But at
the moment, the market's showing that it

562
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
the moment, the market's showing that it
 

563
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,230
the moment, the market's showing that it
is really struggling every time it wants

564
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
is really struggling every time it wants
 

565
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,750
is really struggling every time it wants
to look up there.

566
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760

 

567
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,390

I agree, Carla. Yeah, I agree. I agree.

568
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
I agree, Carla. Yeah, I agree. I agree.
 

569
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,870
I agree, Carla. Yeah, I agree. I agree.
It would be a nice area to

570
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
It would be a nice area to
 

571
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,350
It would be a nice area to
to be short versus or even to be long

572
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
to be short versus or even to be long
 

573
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:41,270
to be short versus or even to be long
over if we start to reclaim.

574
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280

 

575
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,590

Put these levels in above.

576
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600

 

577
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,430

Okay, here we go folks.

578
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
Okay, here we go folks.
 

579
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,029
Okay, here we go folks.
15 seconds.

580
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039

 

581
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,350

Like I said, I'm likely to take it a

582
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
Like I said, I'm likely to take it a
 

583
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,870
Like I said, I'm likely to take it a
little bit easy today. Not even going to

584
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
little bit easy today. Not even going to
 

585
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,070
little bit easy today. Not even going to
guarantee that I'm going to trade. Just

586
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
guarantee that I'm going to trade. Just
 

587
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,630
guarantee that I'm going to trade. Just
want to get a feel for this market.

588
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
want to get a feel for this market.
 

589
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,070
want to get a feel for this market.
See how I feel.

590
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
See how I feel.
 

591
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,310
See how I feel.
All right. Fast moving tape here this

592
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
All right. Fast moving tape here this
 

593
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,750
All right. Fast moving tape here this
morning. Let's see what they do. Can

594
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
morning. Let's see what they do. Can
 

595
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,310
morning. Let's see what they do. Can
they pull it upside off us that fade?

596
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
they pull it upside off us that fade?
 

597
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,870
they pull it upside off us that fade?
All of the mag opening up very very very

598
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
All of the mag opening up very very very
 

599

All of the mag opening up very very very
heavy to start the day. All gapping

600
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
heavy to start the day. All gapping
 

601
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,230
heavy to start the day. All gapping
down, all in the red. So, can this

602
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
down, all in the red. So, can this
 

603
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,310
down, all in the red. So, can this
market move upside and offer us a fade

604
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320
market move upside and offer us a fade
 

605
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,990
market move upside and offer us a fade
to start the day or are we just going to

606
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
to start the day or are we just going to
 

607
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,830
to start the day or are we just going to
stay heavy and lose this previous week

608
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
stay heavy and lose this previous week
 

609
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,430
stay heavy and lose this previous week
point of control? It's actually a twoe

610
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
point of control? It's actually a twoe
 

611
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,830
point of control? It's actually a twoe
balance down there. Let's see. Time will

612
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
balance down there. Let's see. Time will
 

613
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,909
balance down there. Let's see. Time will
tell.

614
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
tell.
 

615
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,669
tell.
Feels heavy to me. Feels like we're

616
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
Feels heavy to me. Feels like we're
 

617
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,669
Feels heavy to me. Feels like we're
going downside here

619
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:52,390

into some of these old imbalances.

620
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400

 

621
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,990

Get this five minute. Looking better.

622
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
Get this five minute. Looking better.
 

623
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,549
Get this five minute. Looking better.
There we go.

624
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
There we go.
 

625
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,110
There we go.
All right. Give this a chance to see if

626
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
All right. Give this a chance to see if
 

627
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,789
All right. Give this a chance to see if
we flip this blue box or we drive into

628
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
we flip this blue box or we drive into
 

629
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,150
we flip this blue box or we drive into
the red box. Don't really want to trade

630
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
the red box. Don't really want to trade
 

631
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,669
the red box. Don't really want to trade
in the middle of this. I feel like we're

632
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
in the middle of this. I feel like we're
 

633
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,230
in the middle of this. I feel like we're
going to come down into this. Most ideal

634
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
going to come down into this. Most ideal
 

635
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,669
going to come down into this. Most ideal
thing would be if we drive higher first

636
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
thing would be if we drive higher first
 

637
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,750
thing would be if we drive higher first
and then lose a bid. That would be

638
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
and then lose a bid. That would be
 

639
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,590
and then lose a bid. That would be
really ideal.

640
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600

 

641
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,430

They keep bidding around these 720s for

642
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
They keep bidding around these 720s for
 

643
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,630
They keep bidding around these 720s for
now. I think we'll probably lose this

644
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
now. I think we'll probably lose this
 

645
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,630
now. I think we'll probably lose this
and trade down to these 685s at some

646
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
and trade down to these 685s at some
 

647
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,990
and trade down to these 685s at some
point as the mag looks very very heavy.

648
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
point as the mag looks very very heavy.
 

649
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,990
point as the mag looks very very heavy.
Big sellers coming in here on the market

650
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
Big sellers coming in here on the market
 

651
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,430
Big sellers coming in here on the market
trying to force us lower now. So into

652
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
trying to force us lower now. So into
 

653
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,190
trying to force us lower now. So into
these 700s once we lose these. I'm

654
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
these 700s once we lose these. I'm
 

655
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,590
these 700s once we lose these. I'm
looking for 685s. Here we go. Bang.

656
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
looking for 685s. Here we go. Bang.
 

657
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,350
looking for 685s. Here we go. Bang.
Straight into it. So a little scalp

658
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
Straight into it. So a little scalp
 

659
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,430
Straight into it. So a little scalp
trade into that from 700s down. And

660
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
trade into that from 700s down. And
 

661
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,950
trade into that from 700s down. And
let's see if we lose a bid here in this

662
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
let's see if we lose a bid here in this
 

663
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,630
let's see if we lose a bid here in this
blue box now and we start to flip this.

664
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
blue box now and we start to flip this.
 

665
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,029
blue box now and we start to flip this.
So previous

666
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
So previous
 

667
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,510
So previous
is this right? Just make sure I've got

668
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
is this right? Just make sure I've got
 

669
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,350
is this right? Just make sure I've got
this right.

670
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
this right.
 

671
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,430
this right.
Yeah, we can trade all the way down into

672
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
Yeah, we can trade all the way down into
 

673
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,710
Yeah, we can trade all the way down into
565s here if we lose this point of

674
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
565s here if we lose this point of
 

675
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,870
565s here if we lose this point of
control. Really nice.

676
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880

 

677
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,909

So into the 80s. This is the previous

678
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
So into the 80s. This is the previous
 

679
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,789
So into the 80s. This is the previous
week PC.

680
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799

 

681
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,549

And if we lose this, very possible we

682
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
And if we lose this, very possible we
 

683
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,549
And if we lose this, very possible we
come into sort of 570 kind of area.

684
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
come into sort of 570 kind of area.
 

685
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,230
come into sort of 570 kind of area.
This blue box, we need to flip this blue

686
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
This blue box, we need to flip this blue
 

687
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,190
This blue box, we need to flip this blue
box now if we're going to get

688
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,200
box now if we're going to get
 

689
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,110
box now if we're going to get
continuation. All right, this is the

690
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
continuation. All right, this is the
 

691
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,950
continuation. All right, this is the
choice. Market comes back up here or

692
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
choice. Market comes back up here or
 

693
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,789
choice. Market comes back up here or
market builds some liquidity and comes

694
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
market builds some liquidity and comes
 

695
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,110
market builds some liquidity and comes
down for this. Just letting it build

696
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
down for this. Just letting it build
 

697
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,909
down for this. Just letting it build
out. I did take a little snap trade from

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
out. I did take a little snap trade from
 

699
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,990
out. I did take a little snap trade from
the 700 break down into this previous

700
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
the 700 break down into this previous
 

701
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,430
the 700 break down into this previous
week point of control just for a little

702
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
week point of control just for a little
 

703
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,990
week point of control just for a little
scalp. Trying to feel my way back into

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
scalp. Trying to feel my way back into
 

705
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,149
scalp. Trying to feel my way back into

came in this morning at 720s. So that

708
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
came in this morning at 720s. So that
 

709
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,390
came in this morning at 720s. So that
you know that's a level.

710
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400

 

711
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,950

Vick starting to break out upside.

712
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
Vick starting to break out upside.
 

713
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,470
Vick starting to break out upside.
Looks good for more downside pressure

714
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
Looks good for more downside pressure
 

715
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,710
Looks good for more downside pressure
here.

716
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
here.
 

717
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,870
here.
As long as they stay heavy. Would like

718
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
As long as they stay heavy. Would like
 

719
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,710
As long as they stay heavy. Would like
to see us come under this retest this

720
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
to see us come under this retest this
 

721
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,909
to see us come under this retest this
and stay heavy. That would be the best

722
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
and stay heavy. That would be the best
 

723
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,310
and stay heavy. That would be the best
move. I see how we work our way back to

724
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
move. I see how we work our way back to
 

725
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,830
move. I see how we work our way back to
be up here if they stay heavy. But I'm

726
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840
be up here if they stay heavy. But I'm
 

727
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,270
be up here if they stay heavy. But I'm
not going to reshort until we come under

728
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
not going to reshort until we come under
 

729
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,750
not going to reshort until we come under
all of this. Now I want to see buyers

730
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
all of this. Now I want to see buyers
 

731
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,590
all of this. Now I want to see buyers
push us up and get trapped basically.

732
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
push us up and get trapped basically.
 

733
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,950
push us up and get trapped basically.
Otherwise, if they're going to hold this

734
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
Otherwise, if they're going to hold this
 

735
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,029
Otherwise, if they're going to hold this
blue box, then we can think about if

736
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
blue box, then we can think about if
 

737
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,549
blue box, then we can think about if
we're going to go in full range rotation

738
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
we're going to go in full range rotation
 

739
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,789
we're going to go in full range rotation
all the way back up to here. Right? Make

740
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
all the way back up to here. Right? Make
 

741
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,230
all the way back up to here. Right? Make
sure you're zoomed out on the hourly.

742
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
sure you're zoomed out on the hourly.
 

743
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,430
sure you're zoomed out on the hourly.
Remember, we went over this level.

744
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,440
Remember, we went over this level.
 

745
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,630
Remember, we went over this level.
There's a reason there's a blue box

746
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
There's a reason there's a blue box
 

747
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,230
There's a reason there's a blue box
here. [snorts]

So, they're finding bids here for now.
 

751
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,830
So, they're finding bids here for now.
Question is,

752
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:15,840
Question is,
 

753
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,710
Question is,
is this met with some passive selling or

754
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
is this met with some passive selling or
 

755
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,149
is this met with some passive selling or
are they actually going to look to hold

756
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
are they actually going to look to hold
 

757
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,510
are they actually going to look to hold
previous week point control and come all

758
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
previous week point control and come all
 

759
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,750
previous week point control and come all

the way back up all the way up into
 

761
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,909
the way back up all the way up into
here? So, at the moment, they're trying

762
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
here? So, at the moment, they're trying
 

763
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,830
here? So, at the moment, they're trying
to hold. Here comes the squeeze. It's

764
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
to hold. Here comes the squeeze. It's
 

765
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,350
to hold. Here comes the squeeze. It's
good to get a feel for this market right

766
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
good to get a feel for this market right
 

767
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,990
good to get a feel for this market right
now. Back to the New York Open. If they

768

now. Back to the New York Open. If they
 

769
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,270
now. Back to the New York Open. If they
squeeze through this, then technically

770
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
squeeze through this, then technically
 

771
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,590
squeeze through this, then technically
they should come back up for these 820s.

772
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
they should come back up for these 820s.
 

773
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,559
they should come back up for these 820s.
If they really want to gun for it,

774
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:37,569
If they really want to gun for it,
 

775
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:45,430
If they really want to gun for it,

trapped there to buyers on that New York
 

781
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,029
trapped there to buyers on that New York
open. So far,

782
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
open. So far,
 

783
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,029
open. So far,
720 has been the level that they keep

784
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
720 has been the level that they keep
 

785
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,870
720 has been the level that they keep
selling at. Buyers just came in

786
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
selling at. Buyers just came in
 

787
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,110
selling at. Buyers just came in
aggressively at 740. Can they hold a bid

788
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
aggressively at 740. Can they hold a bid
 

789
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,590
aggressively at 740. Can they hold a bid
over that 740, that New York open print?

790
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
over that 740, that New York open print?
 

791
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,750
over that 740, that New York open print?
If they can, then maybe we're going to

792
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
If they can, then maybe we're going to
 

793
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,510
If they can, then maybe we're going to
go back into these 820s, which would be

794
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
go back into these 820s, which would be
 

795
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,909
go back into these 820s, which would be
an area I'm very interested in uh seeing

796
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
an area I'm very interested in uh seeing
 

797
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,230
an area I'm very interested in uh seeing
if buyers get stuck into fade against.

798
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,240
if buyers get stuck into fade against.
 

799
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,750
if buyers get stuck into fade against.
So, here's the squeeze. So, they're

800
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
So, here's the squeeze. So, they're
 

801
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,390
So, here's the squeeze. So, they're
still protecting this area. Amazing. How

802
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
still protecting this area. Amazing. How
 

803
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,789
still protecting this area. Amazing. How
many times is that now? Quite a few.

804
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
many times is that now? Quite a few.
 

805
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,149
many times is that now? Quite a few.
All right, this is where we're going to

806
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
All right, this is where we're going to
 

807
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,990
All right, this is where we're going to
get interesting. into lower time frame

816
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
day point of control. So I'm looking for
 

817
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,149
day point of control. So I'm looking for
this to lift into here. I'm not playing

818
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
this to lift into here. I'm not playing
 

819
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,549
this to lift into here. I'm not playing
this long. I don't like that setup down

820
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
this long. I don't like that setup down
 

821
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,750

there. I'm not playing this long. Let's

822
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
there. I'm not playing this long. Let's
 

823
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,990
there. I'm not playing this long. Let's
see how we act in here. If we are able

824
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
see how we act in here. If we are able
 

825
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,149
see how we act in here. If we are able
to fade this or if we pivot above base

826
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
to fade this or if we pivot above base

829
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,070

not ruling anything out. [snorts]

831
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,430

Took the long from previous week point

832
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
Took the long from previous week point
 

833
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,270
Took the long from previous week point
control. Yeah, I mean it made sense. I

834
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
control. Yeah, I mean it made sense. I
 

835
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,950
control. Yeah, I mean it made sense. I
would have liked to have seen it dip

836
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:50,960
would have liked to have seen it dip
 

837
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,950
would have liked to have seen it dip
under this. I guess it did dip and rip.

838
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
under this. I guess it did dip and rip.
 

839
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,630
under this. I guess it did dip and rip.
But I mean, your only long trigger

840
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
But I mean, your only long trigger
 

841
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,789
But I mean, your only long trigger
really was, I guess, 700 reclaim, but

842
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
really was, I guess, 700 reclaim, but
 

843
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,230
really was, I guess, 700 reclaim, but
you're already almost 100 points up.

you're already almost 100 points up.

It's a good long. Some strong selling

It's a good long. Some strong selling
 

847

It's a good long. Some strong selling
coming in here. And we're still bidding

coming in here. And we're still bidding
 

849
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,070
coming in here. And we're still bidding
up. So, just be careful. They look like

850
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
up. So, just be careful. They look like
 

851
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,350
up. So, just be careful. They look like
they're trying to force a squeeze here.

into that 24-hour VWAP. If we get

into that 24-hour VWAP. If we get
 

861
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,549
into that 24-hour VWAP. If we get
through this, we're going to go 820.

So, we will see here. It's a bit of a
messy tape here this morning.

936
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
messy tape here this morning.
 

937
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,630
messy tape here this morning.
Mag still very heavy.

938
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
Mag still very heavy.
 

939
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,470
Mag still very heavy.
Spider's holding those 90s. We talked

940
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
Spider's holding those 90s. We talked
 

941
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,110
Spider's holding those 90s. We talked
about those 90s on the spy probably

942
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
about those 90s on the spy probably
 

943
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,870
about those 90s on the spy probably
gamma exposure there. Here's comes the

944
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
gamma exposure there. Here's comes the
 

945
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,269
gamma exposure there. Here's comes the
fade back into that volume point of

946
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
fade back into that volume point of
 

947
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,230
fade back into that volume point of
control kind of level.

948
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
control kind of level.
 

949
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,070
control kind of level.
from previous week. It's also current

950
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080

day
 

953
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,830
day
right back into this blue box. So, I'd

954
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
right back into this blue box. So, I'd
 

955
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,390
right back into this blue box. So, I'd
say now sellers will try and fade every

956
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
say now sellers will try and fade every
 

957
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,230
say now sellers will try and fade every
single pop here. They will try to fade

958
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
single pop here. They will try to fade
 

959
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,710
single pop here. They will try to fade
and force a new low, leaving the buyers

960
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:22,720
and force a new low, leaving the buyers
 

961
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,230
and force a new low, leaving the buyers
stuck. Buyers will want to reclaim New

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240

963
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,710

964
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,990
York open.
This is what I'm saying. Bit of a messy

966
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
This is what I'm saying. Bit of a messy
 

967
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,590
This is what I'm saying. Bit of a messy
tape here. Probably to be expected

968
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
tape here. Probably to be expected
 

969
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:36,070
tape here. Probably to be expected
before 10:00 a.m. Right

970
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080

 

971
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,350

back to these sevens [snorts] again.

972
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
back to these sevens [snorts] again.
 

973
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:47,029
back to these sevens [snorts] again.
They're trying to bid off sevens.

974
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:47,039

 

975
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,470

Feel like they want to wash this.

976
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
Feel like they want to wash this.
 

977
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,549
Feel like they want to wash this.
Honestly, we'll see.

978
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
Honestly, we'll see.
 

979
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,310
Honestly, we'll see.
They've got to come under there and stay

980
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
They've got to come under there and stay
 

981
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,950
They've got to come under there and stay
heavy. In my mind,

982
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
heavy. In my mind,
 

983
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,630
heavy. In my mind,
we're right at point of control for the

984
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
we're right at point of control for the
 

985
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,872
we're right at point of control for the
session right now.

986
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:00,882
session right now.
 

987
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:02,390
session right now.

988
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
[snorts]
 

989
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,549
[snorts]
Let's get a bit of volume on here.

990
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
Let's get a bit of volume on here.
 

991
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,950
Let's get a bit of volume on here.
There's my guy.

992
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960

 

993
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,430

So big selling came in at 15s for today.

994
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
So big selling came in at 15s for today.
 

995
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,950
So big selling came in at 15s for today.
So they keep trying to drive up there.

996
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:14,960
So they keep trying to drive up there.
 

997
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,350
So they keep trying to drive up there.
That's where we keep seeing big selling

998
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
That's where we keep seeing big selling
 

999
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,430
That's where we keep seeing big selling
stepping in. If they get back above 15s,

1000
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
stepping in. If they get back above 15s,
 

1001
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,269
stepping in. If they get back above 15s,
there's a squeeze out to 40s. There's

1002
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
there's a squeeze out to 40s. There's
 

1003
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,029
there's a squeeze out to 40s. There's
above 15s now. So can they squeeze out

1004
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
above 15s now. So can they squeeze out
 

1005
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,870
above 15s now. So can they squeeze out
to 40s now is the question

1006
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880

 

1007
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,190

and cannot get a close above 15s. So

1008
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
and cannot get a close above 15s. So
 

1009
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,789
and cannot get a close above 15s. So
there's passive selling still there

1010
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
there's passive selling still there
 

1011
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,710
there's passive selling still there
around 15s. Aggressive buying, passive

1012
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
around 15s. Aggressive buying, passive
 

1013
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,470
around 15s. Aggressive buying, passive
selling. So there is a passive seller

1014
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
selling. So there is a passive seller
 

1015
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,070
selling. So there is a passive seller
around 15s. If he gets squeezed out,

1016
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
around 15s. If he gets squeezed out,
 

1017
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,070
around 15s. If he gets squeezed out,
then we probably trade 40s. If he keeps

1018
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
then we probably trade 40s. If he keeps
 

1019
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,909
then we probably trade 40s. If he keeps
stepping in there, then we're probably

1020
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
stepping in there, then we're probably
 

1021
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,350
stepping in there, then we're probably
going to see downside pressure for low

1022
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
going to see downside pressure for low
 

1023
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,830
going to see downside pressure for low
of day. It's very messy because we're on

1024
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
of day. It's very messy because we're on
 

1025
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,590
of day. It's very messy because we're on
this big blue box. We know this is a

1026
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
this big blue box. We know this is a
 

1027
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,669
this big blue box. We know this is a
huge level from two previous weeks. All

1028
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
huge level from two previous weeks. All
 

1029
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,350
huge level from two previous weeks. All
right, this isn't just a daily level.

1030
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
right, this isn't just a daily level.
 

1031
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,310
right, this isn't just a daily level.
This is a weekly level from at least two

1032
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
This is a weekly level from at least two
 

1033
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,149
This is a weekly level from at least two
weeks, possibly even three to be honest.

1034
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
weeks, possibly even three to be honest.
 

1035
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,230
weeks, possibly even three to be honest.
Dates back to Sunday the 21st of

00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
Dates back to Sunday the 21st of
 

1037
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,190
Dates back to Sunday the 21st of
December. So, we got P from that week

1038
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200

 

1039
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,269

and from what's this? The 4th of Jan.

1040
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
and from what's this? The 4th of Jan.
 

1041
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,070
and from what's this? The 4th of Jan.
That 15 is still a level. Still a battle

1042
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
That 15 is still a level. Still a battle
 

1043
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,549
That 15 is still a level. Still a battle
here at 15. [snorts]

1044
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559

 

1045
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,310

Adam. Supposed to be. No guarantees

1050
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,400
though. They've kicked it two or three
 

1051
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:37,669
though. They've kicked it two or three
times already down the road. [snorts]

1052
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679

 

1053
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,669

Back to the 700s. Huge seller coming in

1054
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
Back to the 700s. Huge seller coming in
 

1055
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,110
Back to the 700s. Huge seller coming in
here. Let's see if we get some follow

1056
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,120
here. Let's see if we get some follow
 

1057
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,149
here. Let's see if we get some follow
through now versus point of control. Are

1058
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
through now versus point of control. Are
 

1059
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,510
through now versus point of control. Are
they going to absorb here or are we

1060
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520
they going to absorb here or are we
 

1061
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,789
they going to absorb here or are we
finally going to see some follow through

1062
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
finally going to see some follow through
 

1063
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,750
finally going to see some follow through
on the market today?

1064
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
on the market today?
 

1065
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,510
on the market today?
Still absorbing that previous week point

1066
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
Still absorbing that previous week point
 

1067
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,029
Still absorbing that previous week point
of control. They've got to get under

1068
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
of control. They've got to get under
 

1069
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,710
of control. They've got to get under
85s. If sellers get under 85, we're

1070
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
85s. If sellers get under 85, we're
 

1071
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,389
85s. If sellers get under 85, we're
going to see new low dates. I'm just I'm

1072
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
going to see new low dates. I'm just I'm
 

1073
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,789
going to see new low dates. I'm just I'm
interested this we're underneath point

1074
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
interested this we're underneath point
 

1075
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,630
interested this we're underneath point
control on the day the 700s. A big

1076
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
control on the day the 700s. A big
 

1077
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,149
control on the day the 700s. A big
sellers just stepped in here. We can't

1078
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,159
sellers just stepped in here. We can't
 

1079
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,750
sellers just stepped in here. We can't
reclaim 15. Sellers have got the

1080
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
reclaim 15. Sellers have got the
 

1081
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,269
reclaim 15. Sellers have got the
opportunity to wash this but they need

1082
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
opportunity to wash this but they need
 

1083
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,510
opportunity to wash this but they need
to get closed under 85s and then we're

1084
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
to get closed under 85s and then we're
 

1085
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,070
to get closed under 85s and then we're
going to see lower day. Here we go. 85s.

1086
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
going to see lower day. Here we go. 85s.
 

1087
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,750
going to see lower day. Here we go. 85s.
Can we get closure under here? And are

1088
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760
Can we get closure under here? And are
 

1089
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,950
Can we get closure under here? And are
we going to start a break lower? So

1090

market right now. We're hovering at
 

1111
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,549
market right now. We're hovering at
demand area. What sellers need to do is

00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:40,559
demand area. What sellers need to do is
 

1113
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,710
demand area. What sellers need to do is
very simple. They need to fade versus 7

1114
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
very simple. They need to fade versus 7
 

1115
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,750
very simple. They need to fade versus 7

or 715 close under here and reject to go
 

1117
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,269
or 715 close under here and reject to go

1118
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
lower. They want to be very careful
 

1119
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,870
lower. They want to be very careful
adding short down here. They will get

1120
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:48,880
adding short down here. They will get
 

1121
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,870
adding short down here. They will get
caught just like they did here. So,

1122
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
caught just like they did here. So,
 

1123
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,430
caught just like they did here. So,
we're looking for this to fade, to stay

1124
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
we're looking for this to fade, to stay
 

1125
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,870
we're looking for this to fade, to stay
heavy, to cause a rotation down to here.

1151
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,230
down. RTY 0.19% down. So those indexes
which we've seen rotation in doing a

00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
which we've seen rotation in doing a
 

1153
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,830
which we've seen rotation in doing a

Okay, here we go. So, the rotation, as I

Okay, here we go. So, the rotation, as I
said, trying to position 715 700. See if

we can get a rotation. Right, let's see

1170
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:06,799
we can get a rotation. Right, let's see
 

1171
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,029
we can get a rotation. Right, let's see
if we stay heavy now for potential ads.

00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
probably not that sharp. Here goes
 

1241
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,870
probably not that sharp. Here goes
Vicks. Looking for that 1750s on the

1242
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:34,880
Vicks. Looking for that 1750s on the
 

1243
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,190
Vicks. Looking for that 1750s on the
VIX. [snorts]

1244
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200

 

1245
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,909

Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.

1246
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919

 

1247
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,509

What I don't want to do is see us trade

1248
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:45,519
What I don't want to do is see us trade
 

1249
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,110
What I don't want to do is see us trade
down to here and then come back up and

1250
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
down to here and then come back up and
 

1251
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,870
down to here and then come back up and
look for an ad. I want to get an add-on

1252
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:48,880
look for an ad. I want to get an add-on
 

1253
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,269
look for an ad. I want to get an add-on
before we see weakness down into this.

1254
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
before we see weakness down into this.
 

1255
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,549
before we see weakness down into this.
All right? Because this is like a low

1256
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:52,559
All right? Because this is like a low
 

1257
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,750
All right? Because this is like a low
hanging fruit.

1258
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760

 

1259
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,669

And I'd say it's a range cuz last week's

1260
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
And I'd say it's a range cuz last week's
 

1261
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,070
And I'd say it's a range cuz last week's
one is

1262
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,080
one is
 

1263
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,310
one is
sort of 560s and the week before is just

1264
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
sort of 560s and the week before is just
 

1265
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,710
sort of 560s and the week before is just
below at 540s. So it's a range down

1266
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720
below at 540s. So it's a range down
 

1267
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,389
below at 540s. So it's a range down
here. So it's probably a 20 point range

1268
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:08,399
here. So it's probably a 20 point range
 

1269
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,630
here. So it's probably a 20 point range
that we can think about a cover point

1270
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
that we can think about a cover point
 

1271
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,029
that we can think about a cover point
in.

1272
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
in.
 

1273
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,870
in.
Come on, get your ass up so I can get

1274
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
Come on, get your ass up so I can get
 

1275
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:23,190
Come on, get your ass up so I can get
some size on here, please. [snorts]

1276
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,200

 

1277
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,710

Where's my volume gone? Didn't I just

1278
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
Where's my volume gone? Didn't I just
 

1279
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,149
Where's my volume gone? Didn't I just
put that on?

1280
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159

 

1281
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,990

Nice development here as well. This is

1282
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,000
Nice development here as well. This is
 

1283

Nice development here as well. This is
going to support thesis of shorts from

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:36,480
going to support thesis of shorts from
 

1285
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,710
going to support thesis of shorts from
sort of 70s to 90s. Oh, just going to

man.

1292
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
man.
 

1293
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,789
man.
All right, coming into the 20-day on the

1294
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
All right, coming into the 20-day on the
 

1295
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,029
All right, coming into the 20-day on the
cues.

1296
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:57,039
cues.
 

1297
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:03,509
cues.
Spy with a little bit further to go.

1298
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:03,519

 

1299
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,669

Oh well, almost 100 pointer, but not

1300
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
Oh well, almost 100 pointer, but not
 

1301
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,430
Oh well, almost 100 pointer, but not
enough size.

1302
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
enough size.
 

1303
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,190
enough size.
All right, opening range now set here,

1304
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,200
All right, opening range now set here,
 

1305
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,269
All right, opening range now set here,
folks. Your first 15 minutes. So, just

1306
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
folks. Your first 15 minutes. So, just
 

1307
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,269
folks. Your first 15 minutes. So, just
be aware of that. This white line, your

1308
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
be aware of that. This white line, your
 

1309
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,110
be aware of that. This white line, your
opening range. I want to see if we

1310
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
opening range. I want to see if we
 

1311
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,710
opening range. I want to see if we
return into here and stay heavy. All

1312
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
return into here and stay heavy. All
 

1313
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,310
return into here and stay heavy. All
right, so trimmed most off now. Going to

1314
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
right, so trimmed most off now. Going to
 

1315
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:32,389
right, so trimmed most off now. Going to
make sure I lock in $800 no matter what.

1316
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399

 

1317
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,350

No. What is it a bad time to ask? No

1318
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
No. What is it a bad time to ask? No
 

1319
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,789
No. What is it a bad time to ask? No
worries. But were you inspired by all

1320
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:36,799
worries. But were you inspired by all
 

1321
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,630
worries. But were you inspired by all
the turtle trading strategy? Always

1322
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
the turtle trading strategy? Always
 

1323
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,110
the turtle trading strategy? Always
minimizing losses and and never

1324
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,120
minimizing losses and and never
 

1325
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,830
minimizing losses and and never
minimizing profits. I mean, I don't

1326
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
minimizing profits. I mean, I don't
 

1327
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,509
minimizing profits. I mean, I don't
think that's like a turtle trader

1328
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
think that's like a turtle trader
 

1329
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,430
think that's like a turtle trader
strategy. I think that's just the key to

1330
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
strategy. I think that's just the key to
 

1331
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:56,389
strategy. I think that's just the key to
trading the end.

1332
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399

 

1333
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,870

Big buyer down here at the lows. Big big

1334
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:58,880
Big buyer down here at the lows. Big big
 

1335
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,549
Big buyer down here at the lows. Big big
buy down here at the lows. So, I don't

1336
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
buy down here at the lows. So, I don't
 

1337
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,990
buy down here at the lows. So, I don't
think we finished the auction lower. I

1338
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
think we finished the auction lower. I
 

1339
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,190
think we finished the auction lower. I
think we're going to move lower. There's

1340
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,200
think we're going to move lower. There's
 

1341
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,149
think we're going to move lower. There's
a big buyer down here. 190 lot right at

1342
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
a big buyer down here. 190 lot right at
 

1343
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,310
a big buyer down here. 190 lot right at
the low of day. I don't think that we

1344
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
the low of day. I don't think that we
 

1345
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,510
the low of day. I don't think that we
finish this auction based on that.

1346
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
finish this auction based on that.
 

1347
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,950
finish this auction based on that.
I think we will move lower. We might

1348
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
I think we will move lower. We might
 

1349
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,470
I think we will move lower. We might
have to pop up first, but I would not

1350
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,480
have to pop up first, but I would not
 

1351
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,270
have to pop up first, but I would not
say this will be low of day just because

1352
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,280
say this will be low of day just because
 

1353
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:25,750
say this will be low of day just because
of what I seen there.

1354
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760

 

1355
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,430

Yes, remaining weak.

1356
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440

 

1357
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,629

Where's this guy stacking? 50s 600's

1358
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:34,639
Where's this guy stacking? 50s 600's
 

1359
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,990
Where's this guy stacking? 50s 600's
below us. I think we're going to wash

1360
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,000
below us. I think we're going to wash
 

1361
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,230
below us. I think we're going to wash
600s, honestly.

1362
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:38,240
600s, honestly.
 

1363
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,909
600s, honestly.
Let's see if we can pop first. Will they

1364
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:39,919
Let's see if we can pop first. Will they
 

1365
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:41,510
Let's see if we can pop first. Will they
let me get some more size on? There's a

1366
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
let me get some more size on? There's a
 

1367
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,310
let me get some more size on? There's a
little shelf here. 43s and 55s. Here we

1368
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320
little shelf here. 43s and 55s. Here we
 

1369
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,109
little shelf here. 43s and 55s. Here we
go for the drive into it, which is good.

1370
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:47,119
go for the drive into it, which is good.
 

1371
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:58,390
go for the drive into it, which is good.
43 and 55s.

1372
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400

 

1373
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,630

Sell it here at 650. If we reclaim this,

1374
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:00,640
Sell it here at 650. If we reclaim this,
 

1375
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,990
Sell it here at 650. If we reclaim this,
we squeeze right back up into this

1376
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
we squeeze right back up into this
 

1377
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,230
we squeeze right back up into this
block. We've got a little node which has

1378
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,240
block. We've got a little node which has
 

1379
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,750
block. We've got a little node which has
barely been traded through here. It's a

1380
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:05,760
barely been traded through here. It's a
 

1381
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,670
barely been traded through here. It's a
little bit of a gap here into 70s if

1382
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:07,680
little bit of a gap here into 70s if
 

1383
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,589
little bit of a gap here into 70s if
they do really want to get up for that.

1384
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:11,599
they do really want to get up for that.
 

1385
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,510
they do really want to get up for that.
I don't think I'm not convinced lower

1386
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:13,520
I don't think I'm not convinced lower
 

1387
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,589
I don't think I'm not convinced lower
days in just cuz of this guy here. But

1388
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
days in just cuz of this guy here. But
 

1389
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,750
days in just cuz of this guy here. But
maybe we did flip that delta. But we'll

1390
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,760
maybe we did flip that delta. But we'll
 

1391
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,230
maybe we did flip that delta. But we'll
see. We will see in time. It's good for

1392
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,240
see. We will see in time. It's good for
 

1393
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,150
see. We will see in time. It's good for
me to just get feeling of what this

1394
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
me to just get feeling of what this
 

1395
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:34,230
me to just get feeling of what this
feels like.

1396
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240

 

1397
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,430

So up to the 55s like we said into this

1398
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
So up to the 55s like we said into this
 

1399
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,430
So up to the 55s like we said into this
sort of node. You can see this sort of

1400
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,440
sort of node. You can see this sort of
 

1401
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,510
sort of node. You can see this sort of
shelf here develop

1402
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520

 

1403
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:51,990

acting as resistance so far

1404
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000

 

1405
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,750

and they're finding dips now versus 30s.

1406
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,760

 

1407
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,270

come up here. So, we're reclaiming this.

1408
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,280
come up here. So, we're reclaiming this.
 

1409
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,670
come up here. So, we're reclaiming this.
I'll make this gray.

1410
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,680
I'll make this gray.
 

1411
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,910
I'll make this gray.
I want to see how we act into this. This

1412
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
I want to see how we act into this. This
 

1413
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,510
I want to see how we act into this. This
is what I really want to see. Little low

1414
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:07,520
is what I really want to see. Little low
 

1415
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,990
is what I really want to see. Little low
volume node. Do we push and fail here

1416
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
volume node. Do we push and fail here
 

1417
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,069
volume node. Do we push and fail here
into this imbalance

1418
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079

 

1419
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,150

messy tape? I don't think low of day is

1420
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,160
messy tape? I don't think low of day is
 

1421
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,990
messy tape? I don't think low of day is
in. I'm going to be honest. I know we've

1422
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,000
in. I'm going to be honest. I know we've
 

1423
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,150
in. I'm going to be honest. I know we've
got some delta down there, but that big

1424
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
got some delta down there, but that big
 

1425
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,670
got some delta down there, but that big
buyer that came in here, 167 lot at low

1427
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,430
buyer that came in here, 167 lot at low
of day, I doubt they let him stay

1428
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
of day, I doubt they let him stay
 

1429
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,910
of day, I doubt they let him stay
comfortable. I very much doubt they let

1430
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
comfortable. I very much doubt they let
 

1431
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,470
comfortable. I very much doubt they let
him stay comfortable. Losing this shelf

1432
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:32,480
him stay comfortable. Losing this shelf
 

1433
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,069

again then see how we react here. Get

1434
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
again then see how we react here. Get
 

1435
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,195
again then see how we react here. Get
into this low volume node almost.

1436
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:38,205
into this low volume node almost.
 

1437
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:42,230
into this low volume node almost.

So bid here 170 lot at 630 once we wash

1440

So bid here 170 lot at 630 once we wash

00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,040
that potentially lower day. If they keep
 

1443
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,870
that potentially lower day. If they keep
bidding off this then maybe they go for

1444
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
bidding off this then maybe they go for
 

1445
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,190
bidding off this then maybe they go for
a two leg higher into that block that we

1446
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,200
a two leg higher into that block that we
 

1447
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,990
a two leg higher into that block that we
talked about before into the 80s. If

talked about before into the 80s. If
 

1449
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,750

they lose it, maybe lower date.

I mean, I don't know. If they say the

This 630 is a big level. You can see it

1498
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:18,800
This 630 is a big level. You can see it
 

1499
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,950
This 630 is a big level. You can see it
on bookmap, right? We've got 175 lot

1500
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
on bookmap, right? We've got 175 lot
 

1501
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,470
on bookmap, right? We've got 175 lot
stacked there. We've come down to it

1502
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,480
stacked there. We've come down to it
 

1503
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,990
stacked there. We've come down to it
twice. I want to see if we trade under

1504
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,000
twice. I want to see if we trade under
 

1505
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,990
twice. I want to see if we trade under
it and lose it or if they uh bid off

1506
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
it and lose it or if they uh bid off
 

1507
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,230
it and lose it or if they uh bid off
this. I'm just waiting at the moment. I

this. I'm just waiting at the moment. I

guaranteeing that lower day is set

00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,599
guaranteeing that lower day is set
 

1513
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,030
guaranteeing that lower day is set
because I don't like the look of that

00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,040
because I don't like the look of that
 

1515
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,630
because I don't like the look of that
lower day. I think there's too many

1516
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:34,640
lower day. I think there's too many
 

1517
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,150
lower day. I think there's too many
buyers down there and they will probably

1518
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
buyers down there and they will probably
 

1519
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,550
buyers down there and they will probably
want to wash them. But

1520
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,560
want to wash them. But
 

1521
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,950
want to wash them. But
my first day back in the market, so

1522
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
my first day back in the market, so
 

1523
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,109
my first day back in the market, so
don't take what I say as gospel. All

1524
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:43,119
don't take what I say as gospel. All
 

1525
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,870
don't take what I say as gospel. All
right, coming back down to this 630

1526
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:44,880
right, coming back down to this 630
 

1527
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,430
right, coming back down to this 630
again. So 176 lot is. Let's see if they

1528
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:47,440
again. So 176 lot is. Let's see if they
 

1529
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,430
again. So 176 lot is. Let's see if they
fill him.

1530
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
fill him.
 

1531
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,230
fill him.
Does he get absorbed here? He's just sat

1532
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,240
Does he get absorbed here? He's just sat
 

1533
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,990
Does he get absorbed here? He's just sat
on the tape. Everyone's front running

1534
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,000
on the tape. Everyone's front running
 

1535
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,829
on the tape. Everyone's front running
him. I think we're going to snap him. I

1536
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:55,839
him. I think we're going to snap him. I
 

1537
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,230
him. I think we're going to snap him. I
just think that this is going to get

00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,240
just think that this is going to get
 

1539
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,030
just think that this is going to get
nasty.

1540
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040
nasty.
 

1541
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,990
nasty.
Here

1542
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,000
Here
 

1543
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,069
Here
he comes. 630. Let's see if we wash

1544
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:06,079
he comes. 630. Let's see if we wash
 

1545
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,510
he comes. 630. Let's see if we wash
through him. And if we do, do we go

1546
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,520
through him. And if we do, do we go
 

1547
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,750
through him. And if we do, do we go
lower of date?

1548
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
lower of date?
 

1549
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,310
lower of date?
Still absorbing off him so far. They've

1550

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,430
days of my life, and it will always be
the worst 10 days of my life for the

1704
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:51,440
the worst 10 days of my life for the
 

1705
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,230
the worst 10 days of my life for the
rest of my life. So, I can't get into

1706
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,240
rest of my life. So, I can't get into
 

1707
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,069
rest of my life. So, I can't get into
it, guys. I will choke up. I will start

1708
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
it, guys. I will choke up. I will start
 

1709
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,550
it, guys. I will choke up. I will start
becoming a puddle of tears on stream. I

1710
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:58,560
becoming a puddle of tears on stream. I
 

1711
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,390
becoming a puddle of tears on stream. I
can't I just can't get into it with you

1712
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
can't I just can't get into it with you
 

1713
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,430
can't I just can't get into it with you
guys. All right? But just know I don't

1714
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:03,440
guys. All right? But just know I don't
 

1715
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,190
guys. All right? But just know I don't
leave you guys. I don't not stream

1716
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
leave you guys. I don't not stream
 

1717
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,710
leave you guys. I don't not stream
because I can't be bothered or anything

1718
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
because I can't be bothered or anything
 

1719
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,790
because I can't be bothered or anything
like that. If I'm not on stream, it's

1720
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
like that. If I'm not on stream, it's
 

1721
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,230
like that. If I'm not on stream, it's
because something serious has happened

1722
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
because something serious has happened
 

1723
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,910
because something serious has happened
unless I'm on vacation. That's what's

1724
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:11,920
unless I'm on vacation. That's what's
 

1725
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,230
unless I'm on vacation. That's what's
happened. something very very serious

1726
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,240
happened. something very very serious
 

1727
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,990
happened. something very very serious
started to occur last week and I've been

1728
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,000
started to occur last week and I've been
 

1729
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,230
started to occur last week and I've been
dealing with it ever since. All right,

1730
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
dealing with it ever since. All right,
 

1731
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,069
dealing with it ever since. All right,
so it's been a very very tough time for

1732
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:20,079
so it's been a very very tough time for
 

1733
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,670
so it's been a very very tough time for
me. It continues to be a tough time for

1734
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:21,680
me. It continues to be a tough time for
 

1735
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,150
me. It continues to be a tough time for
me, but it's important that I have my

1736
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:24,160
me, but it's important that I have my
 

1737
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,990
me, but it's important that I have my
own sanity and try and get in some

1738
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,000
own sanity and try and get in some
 

1739
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,990
own sanity and try and get in some
routine and I genuinely miss trading

1740
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
routine and I genuinely miss trading
 

1741
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,790
routine and I genuinely miss trading
with you guys. So, it's it's healthy for

1742
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:30,800
with you guys. So, it's it's healthy for
 

1743
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,109
with you guys. So, it's it's healthy for
me to come back. All right, we have some

1744
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:33,119
me to come back. All right, we have some
 

1745
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,150
me to come back. All right, we have some
buy side delta here at 16s. If we get

1746
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,160
buy side delta here at 16s. If we get
 

1747
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,390
buy side delta here at 16s. If we get
under 16s, that big buy will get caught

1748
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:38,400
under 16s, that big buy will get caught
 

1749
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,950
under 16s, that big buy will get caught
again and we get a reflush. There's

1750
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:40,960
again and we get a reflush. There's
 

1751
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,870
again and we get a reflush. There's
under 16s. Let's see if they expand it.

1752
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:42,880
under 16s. Let's see if they expand it.
 

1753
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,430
under 16s. Let's see if they expand it.

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,589
I think it was this drive here. Trying
to remember. It was either here or here.

1840
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
to remember. It was either here or here.
 

1841
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,430
to remember. It was either here or here.
Somewhere around here. We were looking

1842
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:31,440
Somewhere around here. We were looking
 

1843
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,190
Somewhere around here. We were looking
for shorts. And this is where we're

1844
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
for shorts. And this is where we're
 

1845
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,710
for shorts. And this is where we're
looking to try and get down into. All

1846
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:34,720
looking to try and get down into. All
 

1847
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,630
looking to try and get down into. All
right. So, we're looking at this whole

1848
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:36,640
right. So, we're looking at this whole
 

1849
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,950
right. So, we're looking at this whole
number 600s here. If we lose that, I

1850
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:38,960
number 600s here. If we lose that, I
 

1851
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,790
number 600s here. If we lose that, I
think we trade into this. This is like a

1852
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:40,800
think we trade into this. This is like a
 

1853
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,630
think we trade into this. This is like a
20 point block. All right, I'll tell you

1854
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:42,640
20 point block. All right, I'll tell you
 

1855
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,150
20 point block. All right, I'll tell you
why it's a 20 point block. Cuz it's a

1856
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,160
why it's a 20 point block. Cuz it's a
 

1857
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,750
why it's a 20 point block. Cuz it's a
twoe range that we're looking at down

1858
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:45,760
twoe range that we're looking at down
 

1859
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,910
twoe range that we're looking at down
there. The edge of a twoe range. We went

1860
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:47,920
there. The edge of a twoe range. We went
 

1861
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,589
there. The edge of a twoe range. We went
over this pre-market. All right, this

1862
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:49,599
over this pre-market. All right, this
 

1863
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,069
over this pre-market. All right, this
right here. All right, bang, bang. All

1864
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:52,079
right here. All right, bang, bang. All
 

1865
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,430
right here. All right, bang, bang. All
right, this is what we're looking at.

1866
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
right, this is what we're looking at.
 

1867
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,270
right, this is what we're looking at.
This kind of level. If we lose that and

1868
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,280
This kind of level. If we lose that and
 

1869
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,670
This kind of level. If we lose that and
stay heavy, then you can see this old

1870
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:57,680
stay heavy, then you can see this old
 

1871
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,430
stay heavy, then you can see this old
pivot. Don't have to do it today, but

1872
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
pivot. Don't have to do it today, but
 

1873
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,910
pivot. Don't have to do it today, but
it's possible. All right, maybe if they

1874
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:01,920
it's possible. All right, maybe if they
 

1875
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,430
it's possible. All right, maybe if they
if we have some bad news like the

1876
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,440
if we have some bad news like the
 

1877
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,109
if we have some bad news like the
tariffs were illegal, blah blah blah.

1878
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
tariffs were illegal, blah blah blah.
 

1879
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,309
tariffs were illegal, blah blah blah.
Got to give all the money back. Don't

1880
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
Got to give all the money back. Don't
 

1881
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,750
Got to give all the money back. Don't
know how that looks. Maybe we come down

1882
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:07,760
know how that looks. Maybe we come down
 

1883
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,750
know how that looks. Maybe we come down
into that. We have a huge amount of

1884
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
into that. We have a huge amount of
 

1885
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,069
into that. We have a huge amount of
liquidity. Then think about all the

1886
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
liquidity. Then think about all the
 

1887
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,309
liquidity. Then think about all the
liquidity we have then built built out

1888
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
liquidity we have then built built out
 

1889
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,069
liquidity we have then built built out
in here. And if we start to lose it and

1890
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:16,079
in here. And if we start to lose it and
 

1891
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,710
in here. And if we start to lose it and
these are all buyers, all right, we will

1892
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
these are all buyers, all right, we will
 

1893
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,270
these are all buyers, all right, we will
see major heaviness in the market that

1894
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
see major heaviness in the market that
 

1895
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,710
see major heaviness in the market that
might start to form a crack in the

1896
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:22,720
might start to form a crack in the
 

1897
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,309
might start to form a crack in the
market because that is one, two, three,

1898
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
market because that is one, two, three,
 

1899
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,630
market because that is one, two, three,
four weeks trapped and before that we

1900
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640
four weeks trapped and before that we
 

1901
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,190
four weeks trapped and before that we
had another few weeks trapped up here,

1902
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
had another few weeks trapped up here,
 

1903
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,349
had another few weeks trapped up here,
right? So, if we start to lose all of

1904
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:31,359
right? So, if we start to lose all of
 

1905
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,950
right? So, if we start to lose all of
this,

1906
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
this,
 

1907
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,550
this,
we can talk about this was the old naked

1908
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:34,560
we can talk about this was the old naked
 

1909
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,750
we can talk about this was the old naked
point of control, wasn't it? Let's move

1910
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
point of control, wasn't it? Let's move
 

1911
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,109
point of control, wasn't it? Let's move
this up. Remember that we bought those

1912
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:37,119
this up. Remember that we bought those
 

1913
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,349
this up. Remember that we bought those
dips last month into that. So, again, a

1914
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:41,359
dips last month into that. So, again, a
 

1915
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,750
dips last month into that. So, again, a
level to be aware of.

1916
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
level to be aware of.
 

1917
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,870
level to be aware of.
No longer naked, but we uh we traded

1918
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:46,880
No longer naked, but we uh we traded
 

1919
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,390
No longer naked, but we uh we traded
into that a while ago. Let's move this

1920
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,400
into that a while ago. Let's move this
 

1921
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,270
into that a while ago. Let's move this
up so you can see the days. There we go.

1922
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:51,280
up so you can see the days. There we go.
 

1923
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,270
up so you can see the days. There we go.
Okay. Almost there, folks. Almost into

1924
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
Okay. Almost there, folks. Almost into
 

1925

Okay. Almost there, folks. Almost into

00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
this previous week value low.
 

1927
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,870
this previous week value low.
So, that's your low hanging fruit. I

1928
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:58,880
So, that's your low hanging fruit. I
 

1929
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,390
So, that's your low hanging fruit. I
would be taking a good chunk of your

1930
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,400
would be taking a good chunk of your
 

1931
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,589
would be taking a good chunk of your
money off into that and you can hold

1932
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:03,599
money off into that and you can hold
 

1933
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:11,190
money off into that and you can hold
runners for beyond that.

1934
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200

 

1935
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,109

00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:16,960
decision from the Supreme Court on
 

1941
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,309
decision from the Supreme Court on
whether tariffs are legal or not.

1942
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:20,319
whether tariffs are legal or not.
 

1943
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,470
whether tariffs are legal or not.
Um, we also have existing home sales.

Um, we also have existing home sales.
 

1945
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,829
Um, we also have existing home sales.
And then we don't have anything until

1946
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
And then we don't have anything until
 

1947
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,750
And then we don't have anything until
midday where we've got, you know, I'd

1948
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:25,760
midday where we've got, you know, I'd
 

1949
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,470
midday where we've got, you know, I'd

beige book at two as well. So, you might

1954
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:34,960
beige book at two as well. So, you might
 

1955
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,870
beige book at two as well. So, you might
get a little volatility at two. I won't

1956
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:36,880
get a little volatility at two. I won't
 

1957
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,710
get a little volatility at two. I won't
be here for that today. I've got to ease

00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
be here for that today. I've got to ease

2026
00:48:59,829 --> 00:48:59,839
really good. All right, so the question
 

2027
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,630
really good. All right, so the question
now will be very very simple. Can we

2028
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:02,640
now will be very very simple. Can we
 

2029
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,030
now will be very very simple. Can we
build out new liquidity

2030
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:05,040

to come down into these?
That's the question. That is the only

2036
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:13,200
That's the question. That is the only
 

2037
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,549
That's the question. That is the only
question I'm now asking. All right. So,

2038
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:16,559
question I'm now asking. All right. So,

2051
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,790

Vick's really starting to break. Look,

2052
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
Vick's really starting to break. Look,
 

2053
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,309
Vick's really starting to break. Look,
I've just got a notification. Vick's

2054
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319
I've just got a notification. Vick's
 

2055
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,910
I've just got a notification. Vick's
coming into the 18s we just talked

2056
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920
coming into the 18s we just talked
 

2057
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,750
coming into the 18s we just talked
about, right? It just got stuck in front

2058
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:39,760
about, right? It just got stuck in front
 

2059
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:47,349
about, right? It just got stuck in front
of 18. So, be aware of that.

2060
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:47,359

 

2061
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,589

Existing home sales came in good, better

2062
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:49,599
Existing home sales came in good, better
 

2063
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,349
Existing home sales came in good, better
than expected. 4.35 million versus 4.13

2064
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
than expected. 4.35 million versus 4.13
 

2065
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,870
than expected. 4.35 million versus 4.13
previous 4.22. So, more home sales,

2066
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:56,880
previous 4.22. So, more home sales,
 

2067
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,270
previous 4.22. So, more home sales,
which is good. And nothing on the

2068
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,280
which is good. And nothing on the
 

2069
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,950
which is good. And nothing on the
tariffs yet. Like I said, that that's

2070
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:00,960
tariffs yet. Like I said, that that's
 

2071
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,910
tariffs yet. Like I said, that that's
the uh outlier. That's the

2072
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
the uh outlier. That's the
 

2073
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,750
the uh outlier. That's the
that's the big outlier today. If we get

2074
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:05,760
that's the big outlier today. If we get
 

2075
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,589
that's the big outlier today. If we get
that tariff news. Yeah, lots of you

Oh, sorry. bookmaps footprint feature

footprints on bookmap. I I just struggle
 

2085
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,270
footprints on bookmap. I I just struggle
to read it that well. I don't like the

2086
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:21,280
to read it that well. I don't like the
 

2087
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,910
to read it that well. I don't like the
layout of it. Um I use it on Ninja. All

right. So I have it on my Ninja Trader.
I use it on here

2092
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
I use it on here
 

2093
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,910
I use it on here
so you can see. But it's horses for

2094
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
so you can see. But it's horses for
 

2095

took the short from 690 uh from up here.

2100
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
took the short from 690 uh from up here.
 

2101
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,910
took the short from 690 uh from up here.
Really good. Look at that. All the way

2102
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:43,920
Really good. Look at that. All the way
 

2103
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,630
Really good. Look at that. All the way
down. So, well over 100 points, 130 odd

2104
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:46,640
down. So, well over 100 points, 130 odd
 

2105
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,270
down. So, well over 100 points, 130 odd
points for you. And we see now this is

2106
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:49,280
points for you. And we see now this is
 

2107
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,790
points for you. And we see now this is
we see if we build liquidity here like

2108
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,800
we see if we build liquidity here like
 

2109
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,150
we see if we build liquidity here like
we talked about. I mean, potentially

2110
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
we talked about. I mean, potentially
 

2111
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,349
we talked about. I mean, potentially
there's a continuation. But remember,

2112
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:53,359
there's a continuation. But remember,
 

2113
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,950
there's a continuation. But remember,
we're on discount now versus the

2114
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:54,960
we're on discount now versus the
 

2115
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,270
we're on discount now versus the
previous week. But if we lose a bid, we

2116
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:57,280
previous week. But if we lose a bid, we
 

2117
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,349
previous week. But if we lose a bid, we
can't rule this out. This is not the

2118
00:50:59,349 --> 00:50:59,359
can't rule this out. This is not the
 

2119
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,270
can't rule this out. This is not the
best location to be short now, which is

2120
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
best location to be short now, which is
 

2121
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,510
best location to be short now, which is
under previous week value area low

2122
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
under previous week value area low
 

2123
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,870
under previous week value area low
because we are very, very cheap. We're

2124
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:04,880
because we are very, very cheap. We're
 

2125
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,190
because we are very, very cheap. We're
in discount. But if we lose a bid here,

2126
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,200
in discount. But if we lose a bid here,
 

2127
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,109
in discount. But if we lose a bid here,
we can't rule out that this market, it

2128
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
we can't rule out that this market, it
 

2129
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,349
we can't rule out that this market, it
may very well want to continue to rotate

2130
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
may very well want to continue to rotate
 

2131
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,349
may very well want to continue to rotate
lower. We cannot rule that out. It's

2132
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
lower. We cannot rule that out. It's
 

2133
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:18,630
lower. We cannot rule that out. It's
very very possible.

2134
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640

 

2135
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,390

But lots of people been trying will be

2136
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400
But lots of people been trying will be
 

2137
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,309
But lots of people been trying will be
trying to buy here thinking that this is

2138
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:22,319
trying to buy here thinking that this is
 

2139
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,270
trying to buy here thinking that this is
cheap on a twoe discount. So uh we will

2140
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
cheap on a twoe discount. So uh we will
 

2141
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,190
cheap on a twoe discount. So uh we will
just see.

2142
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200

 

2143
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,710

I say you need to pay attention to these

2144
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:30,720
I say you need to pay attention to these
 

2145
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,630
I say you need to pay attention to these
shelves. Look at liquidity built here.

2146
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:32,640
shelves. Look at liquidity built here.
 

2147
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,670

low volume above up into 14s. So if they

2148
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:35,680
low volume above up into 14s. So if they
 

2149
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,510
low volume above up into 14s. So if they
get a squeeze out, they'll come to 14s.

2150
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520
get a squeeze out, they'll come to 14s.
 

2151
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,270
get a squeeze out, they'll come to 14s.
I would be sort of risk off if we start

2152
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,280
I would be sort of risk off if we start
 

2153
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,790
I would be sort of risk off if we start
to where I'd be cautious, right, is if

00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
to where I'd be cautious, right, is if
 

2155
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,030
to where I'd be cautious, right, is if
we start to reclaim this is where we can

2156
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
we start to reclaim this is where we can
 

2157
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,190
we start to reclaim this is where we can
get a little bit squeezy. Otherwise, we

2158
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:47,200
get a little bit squeezy. Otherwise, we
 

2159
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,190

failure at that point. Again, it's
 

2163
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,549
failure at that point. Again, it's
possible. Look at the liquidity built.

2164
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:52,559
possible. Look at the liquidity built.
 

2165

Okay. So, we have relative weakness in

2318
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:06,079
Okay. So, we have relative weakness in
 

2319
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,349
Okay. So, we have relative weakness in
tech. We've talked about that.

2320
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359
tech. We've talked about that.
 

2321
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,109
tech. We've talked about that.
Definitely talked about it in Discord

2322
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119
Definitely talked about it in Discord
 

2323
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,549
Definitely talked about it in Discord
this morning.

2324
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:14,559

 

2325
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,470

How do I set up my profile? This is just

2326
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,480
How do I set up my profile? This is just
 

2327
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,870
How do I set up my profile? This is just
anchored to 930. It's anchored volume

2328
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:18,880
anchored to 930. It's anchored volume
 

2329
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,990
anchored to 930. It's anchored volume
profile to 930. I've got it set at two

2330
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,000
profile to 930. I've got it set at two
 

2331
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,829
profile to 930. I've got it set at two
ticks. You can have it at um a th00and

2332
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
ticks. You can have it at um a th00and
 

2333
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,790
ticks. You can have it at um a th00and
per row. Here we go. So, pops failing

2334
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:26,800
per row. Here we go. So, pops failing
 

2335
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,270
per row. Here we go. So, pops failing
again. I would like to see a second leg

2336
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,280
again. I would like to see a second leg
 

2337
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,349
again. I would like to see a second leg
here develop to really get short into

2338
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:31,359
here develop to really get short into
 

2339
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,950
here develop to really get short into
this

2340
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:32,960
this
 

2341
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,710
this
but into this low volume node into this

2342
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
but into this low volume node into this
 

2343
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,270
but into this low volume node into this
like little bit of an edge.

2344
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
like little bit of an edge.
 

2345
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,790
like little bit of an edge.
I really want to see a second leg

2346
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:38,800
I really want to see a second leg
 

2347
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,710
I really want to see a second leg
develop here to short. What if I'm

2348
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:40,720
develop here to short. What if I'm
 

2349
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,829
develop here to short. What if I'm
saying a second leg? What I'm talking

2350
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:41,839
saying a second leg? What I'm talking
 

2351
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,430
saying a second leg? What I'm talking
about? I love to see something like

2352
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
about? I love to see something like
 

2353
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,589
about? I love to see something like
this.

2354
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:45,599
this.
 

2355
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,349
this.
This would be really nice. And we can

2356
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:47,359
This would be really nice. And we can
 

2357
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,190
This would be really nice. And we can
look for the trade down into here and

2358
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,200
look for the trade down into here and
 

2359
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,150
look for the trade down into here and
here. So, I want to stay short on this.

2360
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
here. So, I want to stay short on this.
 

2361
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,990
here. So, I want to stay short on this.
Please don't just be a single leg.

2362
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,000
Please don't just be a single leg.
 

2363
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,510
Please don't just be a single leg.
Please.

2364
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
Please.
 

2365
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,030
Please.
Right. I tell you what, 550 to the low

2366
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
Right. I tell you what, 550 to the low
 

2367
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,549
Right. I tell you what, 550 to the low
of day is well where sellers got

2368
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:00,559
of day is well where sellers got
 

2369
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:01,990
of day is well where sellers got
trapped. So, if they're going to force a

2370
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,000
trapped. So, if they're going to force a
 

2371
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,109
trapped. So, if they're going to force a
second leg up, they're going to want to

2372
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:03,119
second leg up, they're going to want to
 

2373
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,870
second leg up, they're going to want to
protect 550. If they can't, then we're

2374
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:04,880
protect 550. If they can't, then we're
 

2375
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,950
protect 550. If they can't, then we're
probably going to go lower day.

2376
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:08,960
probably going to go lower day.
 

2377
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,750
probably going to go lower day.
Which tool is this? It's anchored volume

2378
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
Which tool is this? It's anchored volume
 

2379
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,910
Which tool is this? It's anchored volume
profile, guys.

2380
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:13,920
profile, guys.
 

2381
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,710
profile, guys.
All right. It's right here. See this?

2382
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
All right. It's right here. See this?
 

2383
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,549
All right. It's right here. See this?
Anchored volume profile. All right. And

2384
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:18,559
Anchored volume profile. All right. And
 

2385
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,549
Anchored volume profile. All right. And
these are the settings

2386
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:22,559

 

2387
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,349

right here. Two ticks and have it set to

2388
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
right here. Two ticks and have it set to
 

2389
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,589
right here. Two ticks and have it set to
right.

2390
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
right.
 

2391
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,030
right.
Okay. So, they're holding that 550,

2392
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
Okay. So, they're holding that 550,
 

2393
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,710
Okay. So, they're holding that 550,
which is good. So, hopefully we can get

2394
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
which is good. So, hopefully we can get
 

2395
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,030
which is good. So, hopefully we can get
that second leg higher here. And then if

2396
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
that second leg higher here. And then if
 

2397
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,470
that second leg higher here. And then if
buyers get stuck, we can think about

2398
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,480
buyers get stuck, we can think about
 

2399
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,589
buyers get stuck, we can think about
that reshaw. Alex, I passed 50K. take

2400
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:37,599
that reshaw. Alex, I passed 50K. take
 

2401
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,109
that reshaw. Alex, I passed 50K. take

I got to get this algorithm remembering

Nice hold of 550 there we just talked

2434
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
Nice hold of 550 there we just talked
 

2435
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,190
Nice hold of 550 there we just talked
about. So those sellers are trapped

2436
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,200
about. So those sellers are trapped
 

2437
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,950
about. So those sellers are trapped
under 550. If you're wondering how I can

2438
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
under 550. If you're wondering how I can
 

2439
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,390
under 550. If you're wondering how I can
see them, I'm can see them using

2440
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
see them, I'm can see them using
 

2441
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,910
see them, I'm can see them using
orderflow. All right, could see that the

2442
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:21,920
orderflow. All right, could see that the
 

2443
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,430
orderflow. All right, could see that the
sellers were caught under 550. That was

2444
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
sellers were caught under 550. That was
 

2445
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,309
sellers were caught under 550. That was
a big level. Question is, how high can

2446
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:26,319
a big level. Question is, how high can
 

2447
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,230
a big level. Question is, how high can
buyers push this? Can we get this second

2448
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:28,240
buyers push this? Can we get this second
 

2449
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,670
buyers push this? Can we get this second
leg up to sell into? Can SPY or ES get

2450
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:31,680
leg up to sell into? Can SPY or ES get
 

2451
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,390
leg up to sell into? Can SPY or ES get
back into that New York VWAP?

2452
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:34,400
back into that New York VWAP?
 

2453
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:41,990
back into that New York VWAP?
Is there a way to fade up there?

2454
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:42,000

 

2455
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,510

Is that the 50-day on the cues? It is,

2456
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:45,520
Is that the 50-day on the cues? It is,
 

2457
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,630
Is that the 50-day on the cues? It is,
isn't it? So, stack between 20-day and

2458
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:48,640
isn't it? So, stack between 20-day and
 

2459
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,109
isn't it? So, stack between 20-day and
50-day on the cues now as well. So,

2460
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
50-day on the cues now as well. So,
 

2461
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,870
50-day on the cues now as well. So,
coming into huge big big levels

2462
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:54,880
coming into huge big big levels
 

2463
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,950
coming into huge big big levels
on these cues. Maybe we can start to get

2464
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:56,960
on these cues. Maybe we can start to get
 

2465
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,030
on these cues. Maybe we can start to get
some crosses over the next few sessions.

2466
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,040
some crosses over the next few sessions.
 

2467
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,349
some crosses over the next few sessions.
We will see. All right, here's the 50

2468
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:01,359
We will see. All right, here's the 50
 

2469
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:02,710
We will see. All right, here's the 50
hold. Let's see if we can get up to one

2470
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:02,720
hold. Let's see if we can get up to one
 

2471
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,910
hold. Let's see if we can get up to one
of these gray boxes. This would be

2472
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:03,920
of these gray boxes. This would be
 

2473
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,349
of these gray boxes. This would be
really nice if we can get all the way up

2474
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:05,359
really nice if we can get all the way up
 

2475
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,950
really nice if we can get all the way up
into here. It' be really nice because we

2476
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:06,960
into here. It' be really nice because we
 

2477
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,630
into here. It' be really nice because we
have buyers stuck up there already. We

2478
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
have buyers stuck up there already. We
 

2479
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:18,230
have buyers stuck up there already. We
already know it somewhere up here.

2480
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240

 

2481
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,150

Back down to these 70s. Do they test

2482
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
Back down to these 70s. Do they test
 

2483
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,150
Back down to these 70s. Do they test
these 50s again? Hopefully not. We want

2484
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,160
these 50s again? Hopefully not. We want
 

2485
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,470
these 50s again? Hopefully not. We want
this higher, please. What we looking

2486
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:24,480
this higher, please. What we looking
 

2487
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,309
this higher, please. What we looking
like on the hourly here?

2488
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:28,319
like on the hourly here?
 

2489
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,829
like on the hourly here?
If you hear me talking to myself a lot

2490
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:29,839
If you hear me talking to myself a lot
 

2491
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,430
If you hear me talking to myself a lot
folks, I've got to get myself back in

2492
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:31,440
folks, I've got to get myself back in
 

2493
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,349
folks, I've got to get myself back in
gear here. Right. So, the hourly trans

2494
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
gear here. Right. So, the hourly trans
 

2495
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,789
gear here. Right. So, the hourly trans
transition was 86s.

2496
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:36,799
transition was 86s.
 

2497
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,549
transition was 86s.
There is a big imbalance on that hourly

2498
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:38,559
There is a big imbalance on that hourly
 

2499
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,150
There is a big imbalance on that hourly
if we do want to drive back up and test

2500
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,160
if we do want to drive back up and test
 

2501
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,829
if we do want to drive back up and test
some of those levels. So, I am aware of

2502
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:41,839
some of those levels. So, I am aware of
 

2503
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,670
some of those levels. So, I am aware of
that.

2504
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,680
that.
 

2505
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,829
that.
So, I want to stay short, but I want

2506
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:45,839
So, I want to stay short, but I want
 

2507
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,990
So, I want to stay short, but I want
this market to move up first, trap

2508
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,000
this market to move up first, trap
 

2509
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,390
this market to move up first, trap
buyers to allow me to think about the

2510
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
buyers to allow me to think about the
 

2511
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,470
buyers to allow me to think about the
short. I do not want to be short at the

2512
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:52,480
short. I do not want to be short at the
 

2513
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,030
short. I do not want to be short at the
low of day.

2514
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
low of day.
 

2515
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,630
low of day.
I haven't been here this week, but it's

2516
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:56,640
I haven't been here this week, but it's
 

2517
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,549
I haven't been here this week, but it's
looked to me like we've rotated quite a

2518
00:58:58,549 --> 00:58:58,559
looked to me like we've rotated quite a
 

2519
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:07,829
looked to me like we've rotated quite a
lot on numerous 200 point rotations.

2520
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:07,839

 

2521
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,710

Yeah, I see that Adam. Yes, like that 17

2522
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:10,720
Yeah, I see that Adam. Yes, like that 17
 

2523
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,630
Yeah, I see that Adam. Yes, like that 17
has that big buy delta spike and then

2524
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,640
has that big buy delta spike and then
 

2525
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,069
has that big buy delta spike and then
above that we have sell delta at uh 29s

2526
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:16,079
above that we have sell delta at uh 29s
 

2527
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,829
above that we have sell delta at uh 29s
and then point of control into sort of

2528
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:17,839
and then point of control into sort of
 

2529
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:20,150
and then point of control into sort of
44s. Yeah, I see exactly what you're

2530
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,160
44s. Yeah, I see exactly what you're
 

2531
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,870
44s. Yeah, I see exactly what you're
looking at. right into here really into

2532
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
looking at. right into here really into
 

2533
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,950
looking at. right into here really into
this gray box right this is where if you

2534
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:24,960
this gray box right this is where if you
 

2535
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,309
this gray box right this is where if you
think about where they kept bidding off

2536
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:26,319
think about where they kept bidding off
 

2537
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,349
think about where they kept bidding off
do you remember why I said I don't think

2538
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
do you remember why I said I don't think
 

2539
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,789
do you remember why I said I don't think
the low of day is in yet because we had

2540
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:28,799
the low of day is in yet because we had
 

2541
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,670
the low of day is in yet because we had
a huge buyer here it was 190 lot buying

2542
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
a huge buyer here it was 190 lot buying
 

2543
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,829
a huge buyer here it was 190 lot buying
here on the market I said if we if he

2544
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:33,839
here on the market I said if we if he
 

2545
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,230
here on the market I said if we if he
loses we wash and I said this is not low

2546
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
loses we wash and I said this is not low
 

2547
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,950
loses we wash and I said this is not low
of day because it was buy side delta or

2548
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:38,960
of day because it was buy side delta or
 

2549
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,030
of day because it was buy side delta or
that was the wash so we want to see if

2550
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
that was the wash so we want to see if
 

2551
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,190
that was the wash so we want to see if
we retest it and if he sells on the

2552
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,200
we retest it and if he sells on the
 

2553
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,589
we retest it and if he sells on the
retest right if he didn't stop out and

2554
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:45,599
retest right if he didn't stop out and
 

2555
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,349
retest right if he didn't stop out and
he sells on the retest we'll see some

2556
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:47,359
he sells on the retest we'll see some
 

2557
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,430
he sells on the retest we'll see some
heaviness come back in if he's just been

2558
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:49,440
heaviness come back in if he's just been
 

2559
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,190
heaviness come back in if he's just been
relentlessly buying this and he gets

2560
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:51,200
relentlessly buying this and he gets
 

2561
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,789
relentlessly buying this and he gets
back above. He'll take control of the

2562
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:52,799
back above. He'll take control of the
 

2563
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,630
back above. He'll take control of the
market. There we go. Maybe we've just

2564
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:54,640
market. There we go. Maybe we've just
 

2565
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,150
market. There we go. Maybe we've just
had some news there. That feels a bit

2566
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:56,160
had some news there. That feels a bit
 

2567
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,630
had some news there. That feels a bit
newsy. Let's have a look.

2568
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:00,640

 

2569
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,549

Maybe that's the decision from the

2570
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
Maybe that's the decision from the
 

2571
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,430
Maybe that's the decision from the
Supreme Court. Let's see.

2572
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:05,440
Supreme Court. Let's see.
 

2573
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,829
Supreme Court. Let's see.
I can't see anything yet.

2574
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839

 

2575
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:14,390

Nothing on Squawk.

2576
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400

 

2577
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,069

No ruling today. Is that what they just

2578
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
No ruling today. Is that what they just
 

2579
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,510
No ruling today. Is that what they just
said? What a surprise. Is that right,

2580
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:19,520
said? What a surprise. Is that right,
 

2581
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:28,950
said? What a surprise. Is that right,
Gigi? Has that actually been announced?

2582
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:28,960

 

2583
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:42,710

Looking for that on juice.

2584
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:42,720

 

2585
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,270

Financial juice. Okay. Yeah. Well, then

2586
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280
Financial juice. Okay. Yeah. Well, then
 

2587
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,309
Financial juice. Okay. Yeah. Well, then
that's the case then. So no reason for

2588
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:48,319
that's the case then. So no reason for
 

2589
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:49,990
that's the case then. So no reason for
this market to necessarily fade lower

2590
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,000
this market to necessarily fade lower
 

2591
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,030
this market to necessarily fade lower
other than like technicals now. We said

2592
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,040
other than like technicals now. We said
 

2593
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,950
other than like technicals now. We said
it, didn't we? We said it.

2594
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:56,960
it, didn't we? We said it.
 

2595
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,349
it, didn't we? We said it.
Will they kick it down the road again?

2596
01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,359
Will they kick it down the road again?
 

2597
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:00,710
Will they kick it down the road again?
Apparently the answer is yes. So we're

2598
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:00,720
Apparently the answer is yes. So we're
 

2599
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,549
Apparently the answer is yes. So we're
coming into that block. Like I said, if

2600
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:02,559
coming into that block. Like I said, if
 

2601
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,670
coming into that block. Like I said, if
we reclaim this now, this is the danger,

2602
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
we reclaim this now, this is the danger,
 

2603
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,349
we reclaim this now, this is the danger,
right? [snorts] If we reclaim this now,

2604
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
right? [snorts] If we reclaim this now,
 

2605
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,710
right? [snorts] If we reclaim this now,
we talked about this earlier. We built

2606
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:08,720
we talked about this earlier. We built
 

2607
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,349
we talked about this earlier. We built
liquidity here

2608
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:11,359
liquidity here
 

2609
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,750
liquidity here
and here. And if they start reclaiming

2610
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:13,760
and here. And if they start reclaiming
 

2611
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,390
and here. And if they start reclaiming
this, this drive out can can take place.

2612
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
this, this drive out can can take place.
 

2613
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,910
this, this drive out can can take place.
Doesn't have to take place. Can take

2614
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:17,920
Doesn't have to take place. Can take
 

2615
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:23,670
Doesn't have to take place. Can take
place. This is the big level.

2616
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:23,680

 

2617
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,589

It's why you don't get short at low of

2618
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
It's why you don't get short at low of

2839
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,630

Okay, so watching to see if they can get

2840
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
Okay, so watching to see if they can get
 

2841
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,029
Okay, so watching to see if they can get
up into 700s. We got VWAP just above

2842
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
up into 700s. We got VWAP just above
 

2843
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,950
up into 700s. We got VWAP just above
that. You've got the New York open up at

2844
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:54,960
that. You've got the New York open up at
 

2845
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,190
that. You've got the New York open up at
740s. Value area high on the day up at

740s. Value area high on the day up at
740s. 745s

2848
01:06:59,510 --> 01:06:59,520
740s. 745s
 

2849
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,109
740s. 745s
and then previous day value all the way

2850
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:01,119
and then previous day value all the way
 

2851
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,470
and then previous day value all the way
up here. So they're starting to hold

2852
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:02,480
up here. So they're starting to hold
 

2853
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,990
up here. So they're starting to hold
this. This is the bullish move now.

2854
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:04,000
this. This is the bullish move now.
 

2855
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,270

into its New York open already. So far

2862
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:16,480
into its New York open already. So far
 

2863
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,029

01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:44,960

 

2867
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:51,190

like one more squeeze

2868
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200

 

2869
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,870

rotational market. We're inside value

2870
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:52,880
rotational market. We're inside value
 

2871
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,789
rotational market. We're inside value
now on the day, right? I'd love a

2872
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:54,799

2873
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:59,349

squeeze up here and see if we get stuck

2874
01:07:59,349 --> 01:07:59,359
squeeze up here and see if we get stuck
 

2875
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,109
squeeze up here and see if we get stuck
down into this gray box again. Do they

2876
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,119
down into this gray box again. Do they
 

2877
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,029
down into this gray box again. Do they
rebid off this and be up again or are

2878
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039
rebid off this and be up again or are
 

2879
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:11,109
rebid off this and be up again or are
they going to let this go?

2880
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:11,119

 

2881
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:17,430

VIX has found a little bit of a bid here

2882
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:17,440

 

2883
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,669

towards the 20s on the VIX. Back into

2885
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,510

2887
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,430

This is the question. Bulls must defend

2888
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,440
This is the question. Bulls must defend
 

2889
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,829
This is the question. Bulls must defend
this now. If they fail to defend this,

2890
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
this now. If they fail to defend this,
 

2891
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,030
this now. If they fail to defend this,
they will get themselves caught. There's

2892
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,040
they will get themselves caught. There's
 

2893
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,630
they will get themselves caught. There's
a lot of aggressive selling coming in

01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
a lot of aggressive selling coming in
 

2895
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,110
a lot of aggressive selling coming in

01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:36,719
absorbed into point of control. We do
 

2903
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,630
absorbed into point of control. We do
have bids down at 640, 630, 625.

2904
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
have bids down at 640, 630, 625.
 

2905
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,070
have bids down at 640, 630, 625.
So sellers are getting a little bit

2906
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,080
So sellers are getting a little bit
 

2907
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,749
So sellers are getting a little bit
angry here. There is definitely some

2908
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:43,759
angry here. There is definitely some
 

2909
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,349
angry here. There is definitely some
passive buying absorbing this on the

2910
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:45,359
passive buying absorbing this on the
 

2911
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,709
passive buying absorbing this on the
tape at the moment because sellers are

2912
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
tape at the moment because sellers are
 

2913
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,910
tape at the moment because sellers are
not getting the flush and they came

2914
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:47,920
not getting the flush and they came
 

2915
01:08:47,920 --> 01:09:00,550
not getting the flush and they came
through pretty heavy there.

2916
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:00,560

 

2917
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,390

It's really strong from buyers to absorb

2918
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,400
It's really strong from buyers to absorb
 

2919
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,990
It's really strong from buyers to absorb
that. That was heavy sell pressure. We

2920
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:04,000
that. That was heavy sell pressure. We
 

2921
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,630
that. That was heavy sell pressure. We
had 84 lot, 36 lot, six lot, 43 lot, 55

2922
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,640
had 84 lot, 36 lot, six lot, 43 lot, 55
 

2923
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,470
had 84 lot, 36 lot, six lot, 43 lot, 55
lot. Everything absorbed, 30 lot. Just

2924
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
lot. Everything absorbed, 30 lot. Just
 

2925
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,590
lot. Everything absorbed, 30 lot. Just
everything absorbed. And now they're

2926
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:11,600
everything absorbed. And now they're
 

2927
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,789
everything absorbed. And now they're

right. To get inside current week's
 

2995
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,310
right. To get inside current week's
developing value, we will need to get

2996
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,320
developing value, we will need to get
 

2997
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,310
developing value, we will need to get
back inside 830s. All right. There's a

It just proves process. You stick to the

3090
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
It just proves process. You stick to the
 

3091
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,070
It just proves process. You stick to the
process, you will end up making money.

3092
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,080
process, you will end up making money.
 

3093
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,229
process, you will end up making money.
If you start following the money, you

3094
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:24,239
If you start following the money, you
 

3095
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,590
If you start following the money, you
end up going wrong.

3096
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:27,600
end up going wrong.
 

3097
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:34,070
end up going wrong.
Super proud of you, buddy.

3098
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,080

 

3099
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,510

Okay, just trapped between these two

3100
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
Okay, just trapped between these two
 

3101
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,270
Okay, just trapped between these two
boxes still. If you're wondering why I'm

3102
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
boxes still. If you're wondering why I'm
 

3103
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,870
boxes still. If you're wondering why I'm
not executing anything, that's why we're

3104
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:38,880
not executing anything, that's why we're
 

3105
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,310
not executing anything, that's why we're
building liquidity. I want to see what

3106
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
building liquidity. I want to see what
 

3107
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,070
building liquidity. I want to see what
we do with this liquidity. Sellers keep

3108
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:42,080
we do with this liquidity. Sellers keep
 

3109
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,149
we do with this liquidity. Sellers keep
getting very aggressive around these 50s

3110
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
getting very aggressive around these 50s
 

3111
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,990
getting very aggressive around these 50s
without getting the breakdown. They are

3112
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
without getting the breakdown. They are
 

3113
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,590
without getting the breakdown. They are
probably looking to wash us back down

3114
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:47,600
probably looking to wash us back down
 

3115
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,030
probably looking to wash us back down
into this low volume node or at least

3116
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
into this low volume node or at least
 

3117
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,030
into this low volume node or at least
the edge into twelves. They keep getting

3118
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:51,040
the edge into twelves. They keep getting
 

3119
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,950
the edge into twelves. They keep getting
aggressive here trying to get the wash.

3120
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:52,960
aggressive here trying to get the wash.
 

3121
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,390
aggressive here trying to get the wash.
There is a passive buyer who keeps

3122
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:54,400
There is a passive buyer who keeps
 

3123
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,870
There is a passive buyer who keeps
absorbing everything on this tape here.

3124
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:56,880
absorbing everything on this tape here.
 

3125
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,270
absorbing everything on this tape here.
If this passive buyer gives up, then

3126
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,280
If this passive buyer gives up, then
 

3127
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,950
If this passive buyer gives up, then
they get the wash. If the passive buyer

3128
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960
they get the wash. If the passive buyer
 

3129
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,630
they get the wash. If the passive buyer
keeps holding it, then we can expect

3130
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:02,640
keeps holding it, then we can expect
 

3131
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,950
keeps holding it, then we can expect
this market to try and rotate higher. I

3132
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:04,960
this market to try and rotate higher. I
 

3133
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,630
this market to try and rotate higher. I
don't want to trade in this tightening

3134
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:06,640
don't want to trade in this tightening
 

3135
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,870
don't want to trade in this tightening
range, right? There's like 30 40 point

3136
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:08,880
range, right? There's like 30 40 point
 

3137
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,430
range, right? There's like 30 40 point
range here developing for the last I

3138
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440
range here developing for the last I
 

3139
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,189
range here developing for the last I
don't know 10 15 minutes and just want

3140
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:13,199
don't know 10 15 minutes and just want
 

3141
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:19,270
don't know 10 15 minutes and just want
to wait for us to leave that.

3142
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:19,280

 

3143
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,550

It's been a pleasure to work with you,

01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,750
students and be able to take them to

are scams. Do you think I should depend
 

3201
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,470
are scams. Do you think I should depend
on a book?

3202
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:24,480
on a book?
 

3203
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,390
on a book?
Mind you, I'm a CS student. Uh,

3204
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:28,400
Mind you, I'm a CS student. Uh,
 

3205
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,149
Mind you, I'm a CS student. Uh,
I don't think books help. Like, it's

3206
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
I don't think books help. Like, it's
 

3207
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,709
I don't think books help. Like, it's
good to read books,

3208
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
good to read books,
 

3209
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,070
good to read books,
but you're going to have to learn and

3210
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
but you're going to have to learn and
 

3211
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,910
but you're going to have to learn and
find your own path, right? It's the path

3212
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:35,920
find your own path, right? It's the path
 

3213
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,390
find your own path, right? It's the path
of 10,000 hours. Same as any skill. All

3214
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
of 10,000 hours. Same as any skill. All
 

3215
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,910
of 10,000 hours. Same as any skill. All
right. Losing that shelf now. It's

3216
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:39,920
right. Losing that shelf now. It's
 

3217
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,430
right. Losing that shelf now. It's
coming down to this low volume node that

3218
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
coming down to this low volume node that
 

3219
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,590
coming down to this low volume node that
we just talked about. All right. So this

3220
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:43,600
we just talked about. All right. So this
 

3221
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,550
we just talked about. All right. So this
passive buyer

3222
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,560
passive buyer
 

3223
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,310
passive buyer
who's been trying to absorb the 50s. He

3224
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,320
who's been trying to absorb the 50s. He
 

3225
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,229
who's been trying to absorb the 50s. He
lost. We come back down into value area

3226
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:50,239
lost. We come back down into value area
 

3227
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,990
lost. We come back down into value area
low on the session. All right. If we

3228
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,000
low on the session. All right. If we
 

3229
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,430
low on the session. All right. If we
lose this, we trade lower. If they

3230
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:53,440
lose this, we trade lower. If they
 

3231
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,070
lose this, we trade lower. If they
rebid, this is the rotation here. All

3232
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:56,080
rebid, this is the rotation here. All
 

3233
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,669
rebid, this is the rotation here. All
right. So there's a rotation here. There

3234
01:16:57,669 --> 01:16:57,679
right. So there's a rotation here. There
 

3235
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,750
right. So there's a rotation here. There
can be a rotation here. There can be a

3236
01:16:59,750 --> 01:16:59,760
can be a rotation here. There can be a
 

3237
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,990
can be a rotation here. There can be a
rotation here. Right? We have to wait

That's okay. There's plenty of styles

3302
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:14,880
That's okay. There's plenty of styles
 

3303
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,630
That's okay. There's plenty of styles
out there. Find the one that's right for

3304
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:16,640
out there. Find the one that's right for
 

3305
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,229
out there. Find the one that's right for
you. Look at this wash right into the

3306
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:18,239
you. Look at this wash right into the
 

3307
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,669
you. Look at this wash right into the
low volume node we just talked about.

3308
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:19,679
low volume node we just talked about.
 

3309
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,630
low volume node we just talked about.
All right. So, rotation lost it back

3310
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,640
All right. So, rotation lost it back
 

3311
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,310
All right. So, rotation lost it back
down into this. Do they bid over this

3312
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:24,320
down into this. Do they bid over this
 

3313
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,669
down into this. Do they bid over this
now? All right. So, these will be cover

3314
01:18:25,669 --> 01:18:25,679
now? All right. So, these will be cover
 

3315
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,910
now? All right. So, these will be cover
points for shorts. Balls will want to

3316
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:27,920
points for shorts. Balls will want to
 

3317
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,270
points for shorts. Balls will want to
hold these levels. If they don't hold

3318
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,280
hold these levels. If they don't hold
 

3319
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,790
hold these levels. If they don't hold
these levels, we are opening ourselves

3320
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:30,800
these levels, we are opening ourselves
 

3321
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,350
these levels, we are opening ourselves
up for a huge amount of liquidity to be

3322
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:33,360
up for a huge amount of liquidity to be
 

3323
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,550
up for a huge amount of liquidity to be
built to come back down into here.

3324
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:34,560
built to come back down into here.
 

3325
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:44,950
built to come back down into here.
Initial balance now set as well.

3326
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:44,960

 

3327
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,590

Alex, would one or two kind of paid

3331
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,750

at any point in the future? Um, if

3332
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:51,760
at any point in the future? Um, if
 

3333
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,750
at any point in the future? Um, if
you're in the mentorship program, yeah,

3334
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
you're in the mentorship program, yeah,
 

3335
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,270
you're in the mentorship program, yeah,
but I won't do it for people that I

3336
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
but I won't do it for people that I
 

3337
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,550
but I won't do it for people that I
haven't worked with because it'll just

3338
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:58,560
haven't worked with because it'll just
 

3339
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,110
haven't worked with because it'll just
be too many unknowns and variables of

3340
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
be too many unknowns and variables of
 

3341
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:06,310
be too many unknowns and variables of
how you trade.

3342
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:06,320

 

3343
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,189

Uh, I use it, Nick. I use it on a M1 and

3344
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:09,199
Uh, I use it, Nick. I use it on a M1 and
 

3345
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:14,870
Uh, I use it, Nick. I use it on a M1 and
an M5

3346
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:14,880

 

3347
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,550

previous week low. No, it's not the last

3348
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:16,560
previous week low. No, it's not the last
 

3349
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,990
previous week low. No, it's not the last
zone. There's one zone we could hit. I'd

3350
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
zone. There's one zone we could hit. I'd
 

3351
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,910
zone. There's one zone we could hit. I'd
say all the way down here underneath it.

3352
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:19,920
say all the way down here underneath it.
 

3353
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,070
say all the way down here underneath it.
330 to 260 is possible if if we stay

3354
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080
330 to 260 is possible if if we stay
 

3355
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,910
330 to 260 is possible if if we stay
heavy. That is a big if. We remember we

3356
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:25,920
heavy. That is a big if. We remember we
 

3357
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,110
heavy. That is a big if. We remember we
are inside of initial balance right now.

3358
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120
are inside of initial balance right now.
 

3359
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,870
are inside of initial balance right now.
So, here's back to previous week value

3360
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
So, here's back to previous week value
 

3361
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,350
So, here's back to previous week value
area low. This is a big big big level.

3362
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
area low. This is a big big big level.
 

3363
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,510
area low. This is a big big big level.
Remember shorts this morning got stuck

3364
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:35,520
Remember shorts this morning got stuck
 

3365
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,990
Remember shorts this morning got stuck
550 to 5:30. All right. The shorts got

3366
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:38,000
550 to 5:30. All right. The shorts got
 

3367
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,110
550 to 5:30. All right. The shorts got
stuck 550 to 5:30. That is the area

3368
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:41,120
stuck 550 to 5:30. That is the area
 

3369
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,550
stuck 550 to 5:30. That is the area
bulls will want to defend because they

3370
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
bulls will want to defend because they
 

3371
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:54,630
bulls will want to defend because they
will want to leave them stuck there.

3372
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:54,640

 

3373
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,910

Reverse cup and handle looking for

3374
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:55,920
Reverse cup and handle looking for
 

3375
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,070
Reverse cup and handle looking for
lower. Possible. It's possible. You

3376
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,080
lower. Possible. It's possible. You
 

3377
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,229
lower. Possible. It's possible. You
can't can't rule it out. But uh I'd say

3378
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
can't can't rule it out. But uh I'd say
 

3379
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,310
can't can't rule it out. But uh I'd say
right now we are still inside of

3380
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:02,320
right now we are still inside of
 

3381
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,310
right now we are still inside of
previous week's value. We are inside of

3382
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:04,320
previous week's value. We are inside of
 

3383
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,229
previous week's value. We are inside of
initial balance.

3384
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
initial balance.
 

3385
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,630
initial balance.
You have to be careful of a uh reclaim

3386
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:08,640
You have to be careful of a uh reclaim
 

3387
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,310
You have to be careful of a uh reclaim
of value and then we'll just go back

3388
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:10,320
of value and then we'll just go back
 

3389
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,350
of value and then we'll just go back
into a rotation again. Right? For me the

3390
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:13,360
into a rotation again. Right? For me the
 

3391
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,430
into a rotation again. Right? For me the
market has been weak but it's been in a

3392
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:15,440
market has been weak but it's been in a
 

3393
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,270
market has been weak but it's been in a
rotation but we are definitely leaving

3394
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,280
rotation but we are definitely leaving
 

3395
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,830
rotation but we are definitely leaving
current week's value. The problem is is

3396
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:19,840
current week's value. The problem is is
 

3397
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,070
current week's value. The problem is is
when you look left on the hourlies or

3398
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
when you look left on the hourlies or
 

3399
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,669
when you look left on the hourlies or
even on the dailies and you see the

3400
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:23,679
even on the dailies and you see the
 

3401
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,430
even on the dailies and you see the
amount of structure we've built out over

3402
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
amount of structure we've built out over
 

3403
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,669
amount of structure we've built out over
the last I mean it's months and months

3404
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
the last I mean it's months and months
 

3405
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,350
the last I mean it's months and months
now guys. We're talking about going back

3406
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,360
now guys. We're talking about going back
 

3407
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,270
now guys. We're talking about going back
to

3408
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:31,280
to
 

3409
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,590
to
October. All right, we're talking about

3410
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
October. All right, we're talking about
 

3411
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,390
October. All right, we're talking about
going back to October levels.

3412
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,400
going back to October levels.
 

3413
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,070
going back to October levels.
We are making higher lows. The problem

3414
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,080
We are making higher lows. The problem
 

3415
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,630
We are making higher lows. The problem
is the market cannot make a higher high.

3416
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:40,640
is the market cannot make a higher high.
 

3417
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,470
is the market cannot make a higher high.
So, every aggressive buyer at the high

3418
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
So, every aggressive buyer at the high
 

3419
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,070
So, every aggressive buyer at the high
of day or every potential breakout is

3420
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
of day or every potential breakout is
 

3421
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,070
of day or every potential breakout is
getting caught, right? But we are making

3422
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:48,080
getting caught, right? But we are making
 

3423
01:20:48,080 --> 01:21:02,149
getting caught, right? But we are making
higher lows on the daily.

3424
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:02,159

 

3425
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:09,830

Two ticks, Mick. Two ticks.

3426
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:09,840

 

3427
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,790

So, back into these lows again to this

3428
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:12,800
So, back into these lows again to this
 

3429
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,590
So, back into these lows again to this
gray box again. This shelf again. See if

3430
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:15,600
gray box again. This shelf again. See if
 

3431
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,990
gray box again. This shelf again. See if
they pop up and how they act. Right. So,

3432
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
they pop up and how they act. Right. So,
 

3433
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,270
they pop up and how they act. Right. So,
if they start reclaiming, they're going

3434
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
if they start reclaiming, they're going
 

3435
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,510
if they start reclaiming, they're going
to try and get back up into here again.

3436
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:21,520
to try and get back up into here again.
 

3437
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,830
to try and get back up into here again.
This is just a big old rotation right

3438
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,840
This is just a big old rotation right
 

3439
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,990
This is just a big old rotation right
now. This market can't make its mind up

3440
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:26,000
now. This market can't make its mind up
 

3441
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,870
now. This market can't make its mind up
what it wants to do. In my mind,

3442
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:30,880

 

3443
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,790

we are seeing weakness across the board

3444
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:32,800
we are seeing weakness across the board
 

3445
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:39,990
we are seeing weakness across the board
though.

3446
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:40,000

This can be a pullback that holds. It's

This can be a pullback that holds. It's
 

3503
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,149
This can be a pullback that holds. It's
very deep already. It's a shame we

3525
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,149
again. Every flush through he's
absorbing it again. The same thing. It's

3529
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,510

Someone doesn't want this to uh trade

Someone doesn't want this to uh trade
 

3531
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:48,790
Someone doesn't want this to uh trade
lower.

3532
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:48,800

 

3533
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,790

You see how every flush is so quickly

3534
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:50,800
You see how every flush is so quickly
 

3535
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,390
You see how every flush is so quickly
snapped back up. That's just a passive

3536
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:52,400
snapped back up. That's just a passive
 

3537

3543
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,510

Doesn't mean he gets his way. I'm just

Do we see follow through to 80s? Now if

we trade under 80s I think uh or

So remember the buy side delta the

So remember the buy side delta the

01:24:51,760 --> 01:25:00,229
So remember the buy side delta the

Still can't get through those 15s. Is it

3630
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
Still can't get through those 15s. Is it
 

3631
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,830
Still can't get through those 15s. Is it
15s? [clears throat] 17s, isn't it? 17.

3632
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:23,840
15s? [clears throat] 17s, isn't it? 17.
 

3633
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,430
15s? [clears throat] 17s, isn't it? 17.
That's still a big level up there. It's

3634
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:25,440
That's still a big level up there. It's
 

3635
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,870
That's still a big level up there. It's
where the buyers got stuck earlier

3636
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:26,880
where the buyers got stuck earlier
 

3637
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,669
where the buyers got stuck earlier
today. Through that, there's a squeeze

3638
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:29,679
today. Through that, there's a squeeze
 

3639
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,229
today. Through that, there's a squeeze
back to I'd say 50s. But so far, every

3640
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:32,239
back to I'd say 50s. But so far, every
 

3641
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:34,310
back to I'd say 50s. But so far, every
little pop up into that area, they keep

3642
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320
little pop up into that area, they keep
 

3643
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,870
little pop up into that area, they keep
reselling.

3644
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:36,880
reselling.
 

3645
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,390
reselling.
Question is, is there follow through to

3646
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:38,400
Question is, is there follow through to
 

3647
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,310
Question is, is there follow through to
downside? I want to see I'd like to see

3648
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:40,320
downside? I want to see I'd like to see
 

3649
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,550
downside? I want to see I'd like to see
follow through to downside,

3650
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:42,560
follow through to downside,
 

3651
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,830
follow through to downside,
but we know 50s. This is where buyers

3652
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,840
but we know 50s. This is where buyers
 

3653
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,709
but we know 50s. This is where buyers
got stuck at 50s and below. All right,

3654
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:48,719
got stuck at 50s and below. All right,
 

3655
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:51,990
got stuck at 50s and below. All right,
sellers got stuck, sorry, down here.

3656
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:52,000
sellers got stuck, sorry, down here.

sellers got stuck, sorry, down here.
And we know we're currently holding

3658
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:53,600
And we know we're currently holding
 

3659
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,350
And we know we're currently holding
these pivots here on the rotation.

3660
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:57,360
these pivots here on the rotation.
 

3661
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,350
these pivots here on the rotation.
Buyers got stuck up here from 50s for

3662
01:26:59,350 --> 01:26:59,360
Buyers got stuck up here from 50s for
 

3663
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,709
Buyers got stuck up here from 50s for
the wash. We're now building out

3664
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
the wash. We're now building out
 

3665
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,550
the wash. We're now building out
liquidity. The question is, are we going

3666
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:02,560
liquidity. The question is, are we going
 

3667
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,830
liquidity. The question is, are we going
to see this or are we going to see a

3668
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:03,840
to see this or are we going to see a
 

3669
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,149
to see this or are we going to see a
reclaim and a recap of this first? I

3670
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
reclaim and a recap of this first? I
 

3671
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,790
reclaim and a recap of this first? I
have no idea, folks. I can't tell you.

3672
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:08,800
have no idea, folks. I can't tell you.
 

3673
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,270
have no idea, folks. I can't tell you.
I'm not Nostradamus. All I know is that

3674
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:11,280
I'm not Nostradamus. All I know is that
 

3675
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,910
I'm not Nostradamus. All I know is that
every pop into 17s like that again, they

3676
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
every pop into 17s like that again, they
 

3677
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,350
every pop into 17s like that again, they
keep reselling. So, every time they're

3678
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:15,360
keep reselling. So, every time they're
 

3679
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,030
keep reselling. So, every time they're
getting aggressive, they keep reselling.

3680
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:17,040
getting aggressive, they keep reselling.
 

3681
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,550
getting aggressive, they keep reselling.
And I know there's a passive buyer that

3682
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:18,560
And I know there's a passive buyer that
 

3683
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,470
And I know there's a passive buyer that
keeps just stepping in here over and

3684
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,480
keeps just stepping in here over and
 

3685
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,390
keeps just stepping in here over and
over and over again. How are we looking

3686
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:22,400
over and over again. How are we looking
 

3687
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:34,070
over and over again. How are we looking
on CBD? Let's move this along.

3688
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,080

 

3689
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,350

Yeah, no divergence on CVD yet.

3690
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,360
Yeah, no divergence on CVD yet.
 

3691
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,355
Yeah, no divergence on CVD yet.
Everything looks correct

3692
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:40,365
Everything looks correct
 

3693
01:27:40,365 --> 01:27:45,990
Everything looks correct
[snorts]

3694
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:46,000

 

3695
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,990

to the 17s. They still can't close over

3696
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,000
to the 17s. They still can't close over
 

3697
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,550
to the 17s. They still can't close over
17s.

3698
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:52,560

 

3699
01:27:52,560 --> 01:28:01,510

It is a bit messy.

3700
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:01,520

 

3701
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,709

And if they get a squeeze, they're going

3702
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:02,719
And if they get a squeeze, they're going
 

3703
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,229
And if they get a squeeze, they're going
to come right back up to here into the

3704
01:28:04,229 --> 01:28:04,239
to come right back up to here into the
 

3705
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:08,790
to come right back up to here into the
50s where we sold from.

3706
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:08,800

 

3707
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,189

Don't see a beautiful setup here at the

3708
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:11,199
Don't see a beautiful setup here at the
 

3709
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:20,311
Don't see a beautiful setup here at the
moment.

3710
01:28:20,311 --> 01:28:20,321

 

3711
01:28:20,321 --> 01:28:33,510

[snorts]

3712
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520

 

3713
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:37,030

Just in a range. Here's

3714
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,040
Just in a range. Here's
 

3715
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,390
Just in a range. Here's
your edges for the day.

3716
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:40,400
your edges for the day.
 

3717
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,709
your edges for the day.
That's your range. At the moment, it's

3718
01:28:42,709 --> 01:28:42,719
That's your range. At the moment, it's
 

3719
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,709
That's your range. At the moment, it's
unwilling to move outside of that. Very,

3720
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:44,719
unwilling to move outside of that. Very,
 

3721
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,550
unwilling to move outside of that. Very,
very clear.

3722
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:46,560
very clear.
 

3723
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,030
very clear.
So, we're in rotation. My least favorite

3724
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:49,040
So, we're in rotation. My least favorite
 

3725
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,430
So, we're in rotation. My least favorite
trade as we all know. [snorts] So,

3726
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:51,440
trade as we all know. [snorts] So,
 

3727
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,790
trade as we all know. [snorts] So,
probably going to come up to these 50s

3728
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
probably going to come up to these 50s
 

3729
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,390
probably going to come up to these 50s
now because we were thin down. We're

3730
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,400
now because we were thin down. We're
 

3731
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,149
now because we were thin down. We're
going to come back up and repric it and

3732
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:56,159
going to come back up and repric it and
 

3733
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:57,830
going to come back up and repric it and
see if there's a seller still there. And

3734
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:57,840
see if there's a seller still there. And
 

3735
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,550
see if there's a seller still there. And
if not, then the squeeze is on. What a

3736
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:00,560
if not, then the squeeze is on. What a
 

3737
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,629
if not, then the squeeze is on. What a
gross market.

3738
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:02,639
gross market.
 

3739
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,149
gross market.
If it's been like this all the time I've

3740
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:04,159
If it's been like this all the time I've
 

3741
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,470
If it's been like this all the time I've
been away then

3742
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:06,480
been away then
 

3743
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,669
been away then
don't care that I've missed it.

3744
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
don't care that I've missed it.
 

3745
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,189
don't care that I've missed it.
You can see it in the daily. The daily

3746
01:29:11,189 --> 01:29:11,199
You can see it in the daily. The daily
 

3747
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,430
You can see it in the daily. The daily
just looks dreadful. It's absolutely

3748
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:13,440
just looks dreadful. It's absolutely
 

3749
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:17,030
just looks dreadful. It's absolutely
dreadful. We're not going anywhere. We

3750
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,040
dreadful. We're not going anywhere. We
 

3751
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,950
dreadful. We're not going anywhere. We
haven't gone anywhere. You've had that

3752
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:18,960
haven't gone anywhere. You've had that
 

3753
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,870
haven't gone anywhere. You've had that
from that pivot in I don't know mid

3754
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:20,880
from that pivot in I don't know mid
 

3755
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,590
from that pivot in I don't know mid
December, 17th of December. We haven't

3756
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:23,600
December, 17th of December. We haven't
 

3757
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:36,229
December, 17th of December. We haven't
gone anywhere. We've just gone sideways.

3758
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239

 

3759
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,229

So, reselling point of control. They

3760
01:29:38,229 --> 01:29:38,239
So, reselling point of control. They
 

3761
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,709
So, reselling point of control. They
didn't even get to that gray box above.

3762
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:40,719
didn't even get to that gray box above.
 

3763
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,189
didn't even get to that gray box above.
Oh my gosh. Market, come on. Make your

3764
01:29:43,189 --> 01:29:43,199
Oh my gosh. Market, come on. Make your
 

3765
01:29:43,199 --> 01:30:01,430
Oh my gosh. Market, come on. Make your
mind up. Make your mind up, market.

3766
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:01,440

 

3767
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,950

Do we get something? I'd like another

3768
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:02,960
Do we get something? I'd like another
 

3769
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:11,830
Do we get something? I'd like another
trade here.

3770
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:11,840

 

3771
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,910

Buy zone still negative. Still under the

3772
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920
Buy zone still negative. Still under the
 

3773
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,310
Buy zone still negative. Still under the
17s,

3774
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:16,320
17s,
 

3775
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,629
17s,
but inside value. I think if we get

3776
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:18,639
but inside value. I think if we get
 

3777
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,310
but inside value. I think if we get
underneath value area low in previous

3778
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,320
underneath value area low in previous
 

3779
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,669
underneath value area low in previous
week value area low, we've got an

3780
01:30:21,669 --> 01:30:21,679
week value area low, we've got an
 

3781
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,110
week value area low, we've got an
expansion model. We just have to watch

3782
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:23,120
expansion model. We just have to watch
 

3783
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:34,470
expansion model. We just have to watch
that initial balance.

3784
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:34,480

 

3785
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:50,629

traed through it too much

3786
01:30:50,629 --> 01:30:50,639

 

3787
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,870

back to the sixes

3788
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:52,880
back to the sixes
 

3789
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,350
back to the sixes
value low just below as you can see but

3790
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:55,360
value low just below as you can see but
 

3791
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,790
value low just below as you can see but
our Current value area low is also

3792
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:56,800
our Current value area low is also
 

3793
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,310
our Current value area low is also
previous week value area low. That is

3794
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,320
previous week value area low. That is
 

3795
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,350
previous week value area low. That is
your edge right now in this market. That

3796
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:01,360
your edge right now in this market. That
 

3797
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:16,550
your edge right now in this market. That
is [snorts] your edge into that level.

3798
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:16,560

 

3799
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,128

Can we see some follow through today?

3800
01:31:19,128 --> 01:31:19,138
Can we see some follow through today?
 

3801
01:31:19,138 --> 01:31:24,470
Can we see some follow through today?
[snorts]

3802
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,480

 

3803
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,149

If the broader market starts to sell,

3804
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
If the broader market starts to sell,
 

3805
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,910
If the broader market starts to sell,
tech will probably get weaker. It's been

3806
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:27,920
tech will probably get weaker. It's been
 

3807
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:33,669
tech will probably get weaker. It's been
the weaker asset. So, we'll see.

3808
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:33,679

 

3809
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:34,950

Here's value area low. Remember,

3810
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:34,960
Here's value area low. Remember,
 

3811
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,709
Here's value area low. Remember,
previous week value area low under this.

3812
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:36,719
previous week value area low under this.
 

3813
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,229
previous week value area low under this.
So, this is starting to look like we

3814
01:31:38,229 --> 01:31:38,239
So, this is starting to look like we
 

3815
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:39,910
So, this is starting to look like we
want to sell through. Now, this is our

3816
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:39,920
want to sell through. Now, this is our
 

3817
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,510
want to sell through. Now, this is our
edge. If we start trading under and

3818
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:41,520
edge. If we start trading under and
 

3819
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,830
edge. If we start trading under and
under IB, your cover is to like to here.

3820
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:43,840
under IB, your cover is to like to here.
 

3821
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,070
under IB, your cover is to like to here.
So, it's a shame they didn't get a

3822
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:46,080
So, it's a shame they didn't get a
 

3823
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,709
So, it's a shame they didn't get a
little bit higher.

3824
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:48,719
little bit higher.
 

3825
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,629
little bit higher.
We're starting to break now. They

3826
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
We're starting to break now. They
 

3827
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,790
We're starting to break now. They
couldn't reclaim. They lost 17s. If we

3828
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:52,800
couldn't reclaim. They lost 17s. If we
 

3829
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,550
couldn't reclaim. They lost 17s. If we
trade, this is the big level here. If we

3830
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:54,560
trade, this is the big level here. If we
 

3831
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,950
trade, this is the big level here. If we
lose this and we lose this, this is

3832
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:56,960
lose this and we lose this, this is
 

3833
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,950
lose this and we lose this, this is
possible.

3834
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:58,960
possible.
 

3835
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,550
possible.
Okay, starting to see follow through in

3836
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:00,560
Okay, starting to see follow through in
 

3837
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,790
Okay, starting to see follow through in
this market.

3838
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:02,800
this market.
 

3839
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,189
this market.
Big seller here. So, I expect a little

3840
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:05,199
Big seller here. So, I expect a little
 

3841
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,910
Big seller here. So, I expect a little
bit of a shift around this point here.

3842
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:07,920
bit of a shift around this point here.
 

3843
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,669
bit of a shift around this point here.
Big seller here. Just came on the tape.

3844

01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:17,430
Big seller here. Just came on the tape.
See if we can get a pop to resell.

3846
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:17,440

 

3847
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,470

Can we get to lower day and under IB?

3848
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:20,480
Can we get to lower day and under IB?
 

3849
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:31,510
Can we get to lower day and under IB?
Then we know where we want to go.

3850
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:31,520

 

3851
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,310

Really good. Remember 550 was the level

3852
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
Really good. Remember 550 was the level
 

3853
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,229
Really good. Remember 550 was the level
I told you before. Remember 550? This is

3854

I told you before. Remember 550? This is
 

3855
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,070
I told you before. Remember 550? This is
the level that uh sellers were stuck.

3856
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
the level that uh sellers were stuck.
 

3857
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,189
the level that uh sellers were stuck.
should put this in 550 to low of day.

3858
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:41,199
should put this in 550 to low of day.
 

3859
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:44,229
should put this in 550 to low of day.
550 right here. Right. That's where

3861
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,669
550 right here. Right. That's where
sellers got stuck this morning. That's

3862
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
sellers got stuck this morning. That's
 

3863
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,510
sellers got stuck this morning. That's
where their delta is. Aggressive sellers

3864
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:47,520
where their delta is. Aggressive sellers
 

3865
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,550
where their delta is. Aggressive sellers
came in at 550 on the dock down to low

3866
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,560
came in at 550 on the dock down to low
 

3867
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,990
came in at 550 on the dock down to low
of day. So, this is why I'm saying there

3868
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:52,000
of day. So, this is why I'm saying there
 

3869
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,510
of day. So, this is why I'm saying there
were big sellers down here. I expect a

3870
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:53,520
were big sellers down here. I expect a
 

3871
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,430
were big sellers down here. I expect a
bit of a shuffle. We want to see if we

3872
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:55,440
bit of a shuffle. We want to see if we
 

3873
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:56,870
bit of a shuffle. We want to see if we
can get a pop to fade now and then trade

3874
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
can get a pop to fade now and then trade
 

3875
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,229
can get a pop to fade now and then trade
through them. You do not want to be a

3876
01:32:58,229 --> 01:32:58,239
through them. You do not want to be a
 

3877
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,910
through them. You do not want to be a
new money short into where everyone was

3878
01:32:59,910 --> 01:32:59,920
new money short into where everyone was
 

3879
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:07,350
new money short into where everyone was
stuck this morning. [snorts]

3880
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,360

 

3881
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,350

And we see how we trade around this

3882
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
And we see how we trade around this
 

3883
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,310
And we see how we trade around this
core. Now we can look at this level here

3884
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:12,320
core. Now we can look at this level here
 

3885
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:17,430
core. Now we can look at this level here
as well. There we go.

3886
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:17,440

 

3887
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,390

80s.

3888
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:20,400
80s.
 

3889
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,110
80s.
Okay. [sighs] I expect we will one of

3890
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:23,120
Okay. [sighs] I expect we will one of
 

3891
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,550
Okay. [sighs] I expect we will one of
these markets will make a new low day.

3892
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,560
these markets will make a new low day.
 

3893
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,550
these markets will make a new low day.
ES come down. Double bottom yet. hasn't

3894
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:26,560
ES come down. Double bottom yet. hasn't
 

3895
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,990
ES come down. Double bottom yet. hasn't
broken down. We have got the 20-day

3896
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:28,000
broken down. We have got the 20-day
 

3897
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,830
broken down. We have got the 20-day
below it. So again, mean reversion type

3898
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:29,840
below it. So again, mean reversion type
 

3899
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:34,709
below it. So again, mean reversion type
trade.

3900
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:34,719

 

3901
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,470

Maybe we can go as high as 80s, maybe

3902
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:36,480
Maybe we can go as high as 80s, maybe
 

3903
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,390
Maybe we can go as high as 80s, maybe
even 90s where a big seller came in at

3904
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:38,400
even 90s where a big seller came in at
 

3905
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,030
even 90s where a big seller came in at
90s. Let's see if we can pop into 80s or

3906
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:41,040
90s. Let's see if we can pop into 80s or
 

3907
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:46,629
90s. Let's see if we can pop into 80s or
90s and if they offer a ref.

3908
01:33:46,629 --> 01:33:46,639

 

3909
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:51,750

Be careful of the reclaims here.

3910
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:51,760

 

3911
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,669

Here

3912
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:55,679

 

3913
01:33:55,679 --> 01:34:02,390

we go.

3914
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:02,400

 

3915
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,430

Really nice. Come on, baby. Can we get

3916
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:05,440
Really nice. Come on, baby. Can we get
 

3917
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,030
Really nice. Come on, baby. Can we get
lows?

3918
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
lows?
 

3919
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,550
lows?
Can we get low of days here? And a snap.

3920
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:10,560
Can we get low of days here? And a snap.
 

3921
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,990
Can we get low of days here? And a snap.
He's back. Thank you. Right, runners

3922
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:14,000
He's back. Thank you. Right, runners
 

3923
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,669
He's back. Thank you. Right, runners
now. Let's see if we get lucky down into

3924
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:15,679
now. Let's see if we get lucky down into
 

3925
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:20,550
now. Let's see if we get lucky down into
there. Let's go.

3926
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:20,560

 

3927
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:27,270

Let's go.

3928
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,280

 

3929
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,110

Let's go. Let's see if we can get follow

3930
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:29,120
Let's go. Let's see if we can get follow
 

3931
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,830
Let's go. Let's see if we can get follow
through now.

3932
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840

 

3933
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,470

What have we got on the tape? 505 500s

3934
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480
What have we got on the tape? 505 500s
 

3935
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,310
What have we got on the tape? 505 500s
whole levels. I think we can get weaker.

3936
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,320
whole levels. I think we can get weaker.
 

3937
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,470
whole levels. I think we can get weaker.
So, we respect the 500s for a whole

3938
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:40,480
So, we respect the 500s for a whole
 

3939
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,550
So, we respect the 500s for a whole
level. Okay, we respect the 500s as a

3940
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,560
level. Okay, we respect the 500s as a
 

3941
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,070
level. Okay, we respect the 500s as a
whole level.

3942
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:46,080

 

3943
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,590

Starting to break now. Broader market

3944
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,600
Starting to break now. Broader market
 

3945
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,030
Starting to break now. Broader market
starting to break with us. We're in the

3946
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:49,040
starting to break with us. We're in the
 

3947
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,709
starting to break with us. We're in the
weaker asset. It's exactly where we want

3948
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:50,719
weaker asset. It's exactly where we want
 

3949
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,790
weaker asset. It's exactly where we want
to be. We want to be positioned short on

3950
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:52,800
to be. We want to be positioned short on
 

3951
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,870
to be. We want to be positioned short on
the weaker asset.

3952
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,880
the weaker asset.
 

3953
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,870
the weaker asset.
It's beauty. It's a beauty. Let's see if

3954
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:56,880
It's beauty. It's a beauty. Let's see if
 

3955
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,590
It's beauty. It's a beauty. Let's see if
we can get downside follow through. So,

3956
01:34:59,590 --> 01:34:59,600
we can get downside follow through. So,
 

3957
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,550
we can get downside follow through. So,
if we get really lucky, we get 400s and

3958
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:02,560
if we get really lucky, we get 400s and
 

3959
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,550
if we get really lucky, we get 400s and
even like these 300s down here. I mean,

3960
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,560
even like these 300s down here. I mean,
 

3961
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,110
even like these 300s down here. I mean,
that would be a pretty big move, but I'm

3962
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:07,120
that would be a pretty big move, but I'm
 

3963
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,950
that would be a pretty big move, but I'm
not going to rule it out. All right. If

3964
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
not going to rule it out. All right. If
 

3965
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,870
not going to rule it out. All right. If
this market wants to go trend, which

3966
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:10,880
this market wants to go trend, which
 

3967
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,550
this market wants to go trend, which
would be outside of initial balance, if

3968
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:12,560
would be outside of initial balance, if
 

3969
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,470
would be outside of initial balance, if
the market wants to go trend, these are

3970
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480
the market wants to go trend, these are
 

3971
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,990
the market wants to go trend, these are
your targets. All right. This is a

3972
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:18,000
your targets. All right. This is a
 

3973
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,430
your targets. All right. This is a
weekly target. This is previous day low.

3974
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:23,440

 

3975
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,110

Is it previous day low or is it previous

3976
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:25,120
Is it previous day low or is it previous
 

3977
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,790
Is it previous day low or is it previous
week low? It's previous week low. My

3978
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:26,800
week low? It's previous week low. My
 

3979
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,590
week low? It's previous week low. My
bad. Previous week low. [snorts]

3980
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:29,600
bad. Previous week low. [snorts]
 

3981
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,189
bad. Previous week low. [snorts]
Yeah, runner only. Same for me. Runner

3982
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:31,199
Yeah, runner only. Same for me. Runner
 

3983
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,510
Yeah, runner only. Same for me. Runner
only.

3984
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:33,520
only.
 

3985
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,470

It's a nice trade.

3986
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:38,480

 

3987
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,310

Runner [snorts] only. And I'm not going

3988
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,320
Runner [snorts] only. And I'm not going
 

3989
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,070
Runner [snorts] only. And I'm not going
to add back on just because we're in

3990
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:42,080
to add back on just because we're in
 

3991
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,030
to add back on just because we're in
rotation. I cons maybe I'd consider it

3992
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:45,040
rotation. I cons maybe I'd consider it
 

3993
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,709
rotation. I cons maybe I'd consider it
up into here if I see a strong rejection

3994
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:46,719
up into here if I see a strong rejection
 

3995
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:48,550
up into here if I see a strong rejection
and buyers getting caught. But really, I

3996
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:48,560
and buyers getting caught. But really, I
 

3997
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,629
and buyers getting caught. But really, I
just want to manage this position now

3998
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:50,639
just want to manage this position now
 

3999
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,910

01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:19,520
Spy can join in. We're coming into our
 

4017
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,149
Spy can join in. We're coming into our
50-day here on the QQQ. We want to see

4018
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:22,159
50-day here on the QQQ. We want to see
 

4019
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:24,709
50-day here on the QQQ. We want to see
VIX break out of 18. That is clearly a

4020
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:24,719
VIX break out of 18. That is clearly a
 

4021
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,790
VIX break out of 18. That is clearly a
put there at 18 based on the reaction

4022
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:26,800
put there at 18 based on the reaction
 

4023
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,790
put there at 18 based on the reaction
earlier. I've had that level in for

4024
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
earlier. I've had that level in for
 

4025
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,950
earlier. I've had that level in for
months now. If Vic starts breaking out

4026
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:30,960
months now. If Vic starts breaking out
 

4027
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,590
months now. If Vic starts breaking out
of 18, we can possibly get all hell will

4028
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:33,600
of 18, we can possibly get all hell will
 

4029
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:40,070
of 18, we can possibly get all hell will
break loose in here. [snorts]

4030
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:40,080

 

4031
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:43,030

How low can you go? How low? I I need

4032
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:43,040
How low can you go? How low? I I need
 

4033
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,709
How low can you go? How low? I I need
all these as like theme tunes when we're

01:36:44,709 --> 01:36:44,719
all these as like theme tunes when we're
 

4035
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,149
all these as like theme tunes when we're

4036
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:48,159
doing this. All right, breaking. Lovely.
 

4037
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,590
doing this. All right, breaking. Lovely.
Let's see if we can get more follow

4038
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:49,600
Let's see if we can get more follow
 

4039
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,229
Let's see if we can get more follow

4040
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:52,239
through. So into the under 500s now. Can
 

4041
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:54,470
through. So into the under 500s now. Can
we get follow through downside? We just

4042
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:54,480
we get follow through downside? We just
 

4043
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,390
we get follow through downside? We just
want to see pressure. Previous week open

4044
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
want to see pressure. Previous week open
 

4045
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,669
want to see pressure. Previous week open
31. previous week low 406s. These are

4047
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,750
31. previous week low 406s. These are
some of our targets under there. We have

4048
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:01,760
some of our targets under there. We have
 

4049
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,350
some of our targets under there. We have
some old balance ranges down into the

4050
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:03,360
some old balance ranges down into the
 

4051
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,750
some old balance ranges down into the
300s if we get really lucky. [snorts]

4052
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:05,760
300s if we get really lucky. [snorts]

VIX is starting to break through it.

4054
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:07,440
VIX is starting to break through it.
 

4055
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,750
VIX is starting to break through it.
Okay, so we would love a 5m minute close

4056
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:09,760
Okay, so we would love a 5m minute close
 

4057
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,870
Okay, so we would love a 5m minute close
here above it on the VIX above the 18s.

4058
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
here above it on the VIX above the 18s.
 

4059
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,149
here above it on the VIX above the 18s.
We've got one minute left on this

4060
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:14,159
We've got one minute left on this
 

4061
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:17,417
We've got one minute left on this
5minute bar. That would be really good.

4062
01:37:17,417 --> 01:37:17,427
5minute bar. That would be really good.
 

4063
01:37:17,427 --> 01:37:28,149
5minute bar. That would be really good.

4065
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:29,990

Nice. We're going to break lower.

4066
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,000
Nice. We're going to break lower.
 

4067
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,790
Nice. We're going to break lower.
Looking good here.

4068
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800

 

4069
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,629

Just be careful as spy comes into its

01:37:36,629 --> 01:37:36,639
Just be careful as spy comes into its
 

4071
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:38,870
Just be careful as spy comes into its
20-day right now. So, just be very

4072
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
20-day right now. So, just be very
 

4073
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,790
20-day right now. So, just be very
careful as spy comes into its 20-day

4074
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:40,800
careful as spy comes into its 20-day
 

4075
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,669
careful as spy comes into its 20-day
here.

4076
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
here.
 

4077
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,830
here.
Come on, VIX. I want VIX to close high

4078
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:45,840
Come on, VIX. I want VIX to close high
 

4079
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,709
Come on, VIX. I want VIX to close high
here on this 5m minute bar and then

4080
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:48,719
here on this 5m minute bar and then
 

4081
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,629
here on this 5m minute bar and then
maybe offer a little pull back into 18

4082
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:50,639
maybe offer a little pull back into 18
 

4083
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,109
maybe offer a little pull back into 18
and then I want them to rebid VIX and

4084
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:53,119
and then I want them to rebid VIX and
 

4085
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,030
and then I want them to rebid VIX and
then we'll get follow through downside.

4086
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,040
then we'll get follow through downside.
 

4087
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,430
then we'll get follow through downside.
Just manage your positions.

4088
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:57,440
Just manage your positions.
 

4089
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,337
Just manage your positions.
This is a really nice move here.

4090
01:37:59,337 --> 01:37:59,347
This is a really nice move here.
 

4091
01:37:59,347 --> 01:38:07,750
This is a really nice move here.
[snorts]

4092

4093
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,270

Little bit of shelf being developed

4094
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:09,280
Little bit of shelf being developed
 

4095
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,270
Little bit of shelf being developed
here. You can see it right here. So into

4096
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,280
here. You can see it right here. So into
 

4097
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,070
here. You can see it right here. So into
sort of 90s, right? a bit of a shelf

4098
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,080
sort of 90s, right? a bit of a shelf
 

4099
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,750
sort of 90s, right? a bit of a shelf
here into 90s. You can see it. You want

4100
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:15,760
here into 90s. You can see it. You want
 

4101
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,430
here into 90s. You can see it. You want
them to stay heavy. There we have a low

4102
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:17,440
them to stay heavy. There we have a low
 

4103
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,590
them to stay heavy. There we have a low
volume node up into 22s. So, you want

4104
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:19,600
volume node up into 22s. So, you want
 

4105
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:23,590
volume node up into 22s. So, you want
them to stay heavy from 90s. 22s max. It

4106
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:23,600
them to stay heavy from 90s. 22s max. It
 

4107
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,430
them to stay heavy from 90s. 22s max. It
looks like it's wants to break for that

4108
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:25,440
looks like it's wants to break for that
 

4109
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,750
looks like it's wants to break for that
previous week low. Here you have a buy

4110
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:27,760
previous week low. Here you have a buy
 

4111
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,229
previous week low. Here you have a buy
side delta caught offside at 11s

4112
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:30,239
side delta caught offside at 11s
 

4113
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:33,350
side delta caught offside at 11s
interestingly. So, 511 big buyside delta

4114
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:33,360
interestingly. So, 511 big buyside delta
 

4115
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,990
interestingly. So, 511 big buyside delta
spike there. [snorts] So, someone tried

4116
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,000
spike there. [snorts] So, someone tried
 

4117
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,830
spike there. [snorts] So, someone tried
to come in and buy the market there like

4118
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:37,840
to come in and buy the market there like
 

4119
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,870
to come in and buy the market there like
a bit of a wally.

4120
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
a bit of a wally.
 

4121
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,390
a bit of a wally.
No tariff news today. I don't know.

No tariff news today. I don't know.

No tariff news today. I don't know.
They've kicked it down. Kicked it down a

They've kicked it down. Kicked it down a

01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,189

4131
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,709

Everything's fine. Nothing to see here.

Everything's fine. Nothing to see here.
It's all good. Kick it down the road.

So, watch this shelf here. 90s. If they

01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:09,840
So, watch this shelf here. 90s. If they
 

4139
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,189
So, watch this shelf here. 90s. If they
squeeze, we're going to probably come up

01:39:11,189 --> 01:39:11,199
squeeze, we're going to probably come up
 

4141
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,510
squeeze, we're going to probably come up

50-day on the queue. That is not a good
 

4157
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,550
50-day on the queue. That is not a good

01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:32,560
sign for the market if we stay heavy
 

4159
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,790
sign for the market if we stay heavy

2550 cross. I know lots of you don't

2550 cross. I know lots of you don't

01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:39,119
believe in that, but there are many
 

4165
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,030
believe in that, but there are many
traders that use that as sentiment.

4166

4201
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:38,870
extended from any kind of level. We are
developing a little shelf here, but you

4202
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:38,880
developing a little shelf here, but you
 

4203
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,870
developing a little shelf here, but you
would not really want to be entering

would not really want to be entering
 

4205

01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:45,679
short here. Your short opportunity was
 

4211
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:47,750
short here. Your short opportunity was
like on this break, even here, maybe

01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:47,760
like on this break, even here, maybe
 

4213
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,109
like on this break, even here, maybe
even this here. I think is where I got

Remember, we're thin in here. Like I

Remember, we're thin in here. Like I
said, there is offside delta at 12. So,

4244
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:55,760
said, there is offside delta at 12. So,
 

4245
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,790
said, there is offside delta at 12. So,
this guy right here, it's a big buyside

this guy right here, it's a big buyside

this guy right here, it's a big buyside
outlier. big big buy side outlier there.

So I'm interested how we react into that

4252
01:42:04,629 --> 01:42:04,639
So I'm interested how we react into that
 

4253
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:07,270
So I'm interested how we react into that
12s and if we get above we're going to

4254
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:07,280
12s and if we get above we're going to
 

4255
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,950
12s and if we get above we're going to
retest the IB. All right, this is your

4256
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:08,960
retest the IB. All right, this is your
 

4257
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,709
retest the IB. All right, this is your
sentiment for the day. This is actually

4258
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:10,719
sentiment for the day. This is actually
 

4259
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:12,629
sentiment for the day. This is actually
a really nice day now because you have

4260
01:42:12,629 --> 01:42:12,639
a really nice day now because you have
 

4261
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:14,790
a really nice day now because you have
initial balance, previous week value

4262
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:14,800
initial balance, previous week value
 

4263
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,790
initial balance, previous week value
area low, current day value area low,

4264
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:16,800
area low, current day value area low,
 

4265
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,709
area low, current day value area low,
all pretty tight. All right, so as long

4266
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
all pretty tight. All right, so as long
 

4267
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:19,910
all pretty tight. All right, so as long
as you reject that, you're looking for

4268
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:19,920
as you reject that, you're looking for
 

4269
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,669
as you reject that, you're looking for
trend day lower. If you reclaim that,

4270
01:42:21,669 --> 01:42:21,679
trend day lower. If you reclaim that,
 

4271
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,270
trend day lower. If you reclaim that,
then we're going to go into a rotational

4272
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:23,280
then we're going to go into a rotational
 

4273
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,750
then we're going to go into a rotational
market. So you have a clear level of

4274
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:25,760
market. So you have a clear level of
 

4275
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,830
market. So you have a clear level of
confluence here with three levels all

4276
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:27,840
confluence here with three levels all
 

4277
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,270
confluence here with three levels all
lined out together. All right. So, you

4278
01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:29,280
lined out together. All right. So, you
 

4279
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,750
lined out together. All right. So, you
can use this sort of gray box here as

4280
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:31,760
can use this sort of gray box here as
 

4281
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,430
can use this sort of gray box here as
your sentiment for the day. Are we going

4282
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:33,440
your sentiment for the day. Are we going
 

4283
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,750
your sentiment for the day. Are we going
in a trend lower or are we going in a

4284
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:35,760
in a trend lower or are we going in a
 

4285
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,470
in a trend lower or are we going in a
rotation? This will tell you how we act.

4286
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
rotation? This will tell you how we act.

01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,109
rotation? This will tell you how we act.

Do we stay heavy outside of there into

Do we stay heavy outside of there into

01:42:43,669 --> 01:42:43,679
there? Do we fail to get above or do we
 

4291
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:46,149

just go above, reclaim, and start going

4292
01:42:46,149 --> 01:42:46,159
just go above, reclaim, and start going
 

4293
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:50,161

the outlier right here into where did I
say 11s and twelves. If we squeeze

4322
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:23,280
say 11s and twelves. If we squeeze
 

4323
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,709
say 11s and twelves. If we squeeze
through this, we're going to test this

4324
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:24,719
through this, we're going to test this
 

4325
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,310
through this, we're going to test this
gray box above. But this is where the

4326
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:26,320
gray box above. But this is where the
 

4327
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,310
gray box above. But this is where the
buyer got stuck before. If we squeeze

4328
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:28,320
buyer got stuck before. If we squeeze
 

4329
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,910
buyer got stuck before. If we squeeze
through this, we're going to retest the

4330
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:29,920
through this, we're going to retest the
 

4331
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,910
through this, we're going to retest the
box above. So far, we can't even get

4332
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:31,920
box above. So far, we can't even get
 

4333
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,270
box above. So far, we can't even get
through that outlier I just talked

4334
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:33,280
through that outlier I just talked
 

4335
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,910
through that outlier I just talked
about. [snorts]

4336
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:35,920
about. [snorts]
 

4337
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,270
about. [snorts]
No close above that outlier yet.

4338
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:39,280
No close above that outlier yet.
 

4339
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,270
No close above that outlier yet.
So, the outlier is at 12. We just peaked

4340
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,280
So, the outlier is at 12. We just peaked
 

4341
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,750
So, the outlier is at 12. We just peaked
to 14 and instantly sold off. So, he's

4342
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:43,760
to 14 and instantly sold off. So, he's
 

4343
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,070
to 14 and instantly sold off. So, he's
still stuck up there. If we get through

4344
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:46,080
still stuck up there. If we get through
 

4345
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,550
still stuck up there. If we get through
him, then we will retest this. I would

4346
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:48,560
him, then we will retest this. I would
 

4347
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,709
him, then we will retest this. I would
not be long, guys. The only time I would

4348
01:43:50,709 --> 01:43:50,719
not be long, guys. The only time I would
 

4349
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,830
not be long, guys. The only time I would
consider a long today is if you reclaim

4350
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:53,840
consider a long today is if you reclaim
 

4351
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,830
consider a long today is if you reclaim
all these levels and look at like

4352
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:55,840
all these levels and look at like
 

4353
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,189
all these levels and look at like
something like this. At the moment,

4354
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:57,199
something like this. At the moment,
 

4355
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,750
something like this. At the moment,
you'd be looking short anywhere in here

4356
01:43:59,750 --> 01:43:59,760
you'd be looking short anywhere in here
 

4357
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,350
you'd be looking short anywhere in here
for a continuation. You do not want to

4358
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:01,360
for a continuation. You do not want to
 

4359
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,709
for a continuation. You do not want to
short the low of day. You're looking to

4360
01:44:02,709 --> 01:44:02,719
short the low of day. You're looking to
 

4361
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,669
short the low of day. You're looking to
short pops off good levels.

4362
01:44:05,669 --> 01:44:05,679
short pops off good levels.
 

4363
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:08,390
short pops off good levels.
I show you the outlier. See this guy? I

4364
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:08,400
I show you the outlier. See this guy? I
 

4365
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,270
I show you the outlier. See this guy? I
don't know if you can see this guy.

4366
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:11,280
don't know if you can see this guy.
 

4367
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,510
don't know if you can see this guy.
This guy right here. And it's out. Oh,

4368
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:13,520
This guy right here. And it's out. Oh,
 

4369
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:18,149
This guy right here. And it's out. Oh,
where's he gone?

4370
01:44:18,149 --> 01:44:18,159

 

4371
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:21,109

It's outlier by volume, right? Delta buy

4372
01:44:21,109 --> 01:44:21,119
It's outlier by volume, right? Delta buy
 

4373
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:23,750
It's outlier by volume, right? Delta buy
at 12. So around there, he's stuck. He

4374
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:23,760
at 12. So around there, he's stuck. He
 

4375
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,149
at 12. So around there, he's stuck. He
is stuck. So you can lean on his pain

4376
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:26,159
is stuck. So you can lean on his pain
 

4377
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:28,550
is stuck. So you can lean on his pain
for now if you want. If you're already

4378
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:28,560
for now if you want. If you're already
 

4379
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,149
for now if you want. If you're already
in this all the time he's out the money,

4380
01:44:30,149 --> 01:44:30,159
in this all the time he's out the money,
 

4381
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:31,669
in this all the time he's out the money,
you can lean on his pain. If he starts

4382
01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:31,679
you can lean on his pain. If he starts
 

4383
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,669
you can lean on his pain. If he starts
to reclaim, we're going to touch up

4384
01:44:33,669 --> 01:44:33,679
to reclaim, we're going to touch up
 

4385
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:48,950
to reclaim, we're going to touch up
here. [snorts]

4386
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:48,960

 

4387
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,470

Going to have a little break for a bit.

4388
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:50,480
Going to have a little break for a bit.
 

4389

4395
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:59,270
head's sore. This is a lot of work for
me. Like cognitive load compared to what

4396
01:44:59,270 --> 01:44:59,280
me. Like cognitive load compared to what
 

4397
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,709

I've had to deal with this week. So, I'm

4398

me have a look for you.

I'm looking on a five minute though.
 

4445
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,590
I'm looking on a five minute though.
Maybe you maybe you're seeing some

4446
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:29,600
Maybe you maybe you're seeing some
 

4447
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,669
Maybe you maybe you're seeing some
divergence on a lower time frame than

4448
01:46:31,669 --> 01:46:31,679
divergence on a lower time frame than
 

4449
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,669
divergence on a lower time frame than
that. On a five minute looks all right.

4450
01:46:33,669 --> 01:46:33,679
that. On a five minute looks all right.
 

4451
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:36,229
that. On a five minute looks all right.
No, I can't see any divergence. the

4452

No, I can't see any divergence. the
 

4453
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:40,709
No, I can't see any divergence. the
highs and low peaks are uh in line.

4454
01:46:40,709 --> 01:46:40,719
highs and low peaks are uh in line.
 

4455
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:43,030
highs and low peaks are uh in line.
Okay, you can see again we can't get

4456
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:43,040
Okay, you can see again we can't get
 

4457
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:44,870
Okay, you can see again we can't get
through that player at 11. I just gave

4458
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:44,880
through that player at 11. I just gave
 

4459
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,950
through that player at 11. I just gave
that to you or 12, wherever it was. That

4460
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:46,960
that to you or 12, wherever it was. That
 

4461
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,709
that to you or 12, wherever it was. That
player that we talked about, I showed

4462
01:46:48,709 --> 01:46:48,719
player that we talked about, I showed
 

4463
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:51,109
player that we talked about, I showed
you him on the Delta profile. He is

4464
01:46:51,109 --> 01:46:51,119
you him on the Delta profile. He is
 

4465
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,109
you him on the Delta profile. He is
still stuck at those twelves, right?

4466
01:46:53,109 --> 01:46:53,119
still stuck at those twelves, right?
 

4467
01:46:53,119 --> 01:47:00,390
still stuck at those twelves, right?
He's still stuck at the twelves for now.

Where is Discord? Discord comes as part
of the um beginner to advance program,

4478
01:47:16,390 --> 01:47:16,400
of the um beginner to advance program,
 

4479
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,669
of the um beginner to advance program,
right? So, if you do the beginner to

4480
01:47:17,669 --> 01:47:17,679
right? So, if you do the beginner to
 

4481
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:20,790
right? So, if you do the beginner to
advance course, it's uh I haven't even

4482
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:20,800
advance course, it's uh I haven't even
 

4483
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,310
advance course, it's uh I haven't even
had a chance to put the prices up like I

4484
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:22,320
had a chance to put the prices up like I
 

4485
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,629
had a chance to put the prices up like I
was supposed to. That's how ridiculous

4486
01:47:24,629 --> 01:47:24,639
was supposed to. That's how ridiculous
 

4487
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,590
was supposed to. That's how ridiculous
this year has been. It is then still 649

4488
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:27,600
this year has been. It is then still 649
 

4489
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,629
this year has been. It is then still 649
right now. All right, 649. It's a 20hour

zone indicators come with that and

01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:34,159

I've talked about this many times. The

4504
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:44,000
I've talked about this many times. The
 

4505
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,070
I've talked about this many times. The
reason being I like trading with people

4506
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:46,080
reason being I like trading with people
 

4507
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,629
reason being I like trading with people
who trade the same way. It's important

4508
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:48,639
who trade the same way. It's important
 

4509
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,790
who trade the same way. It's important
especially for occasions like the last

4510
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:50,800
especially for occasions like the last
 

4511
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:51,990
especially for occasions like the last
few weeks when I'm not there that

4512
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:52,000
few weeks when I'm not there that
 

4513
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,189
few weeks when I'm not there that
everyone knows what they're looking at

4514
01:47:53,189 --> 01:47:53,199
everyone knows what they're looking at
 

4515
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:55,030
everyone knows what they're looking at
and are trading in the same way. If you

4516
01:47:55,030 --> 01:47:55,040
and are trading in the same way. If you
 

4517
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,870
and are trading in the same way. If you
want to do a top up, there is I think

4518
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,880
want to do a top up, there is I think
 

4519
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,830
want to do a top up, there is I think
it's about 7h hour course now on trading

4520
01:47:59,830 --> 01:47:59,840
it's about 7h hour course now on trading
 

4521

it's about 7h hour course now on trading

4524
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:03,040
right, which went live just before
 

4525
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:10,950
right, which went live just before
Christmas. That is 399 I think.

01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:10,960

 

4527
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,910

What city did I live in when I was in

4530
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:15,520
What city did I live in when I was in
 

4531
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:18,550
What city did I live in when I was in
the UK? I was in London. Originally from

4532
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:18,560
the UK? I was in London. Originally from
 

4533
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,629
the UK? I was in London. Originally from
Sussex, but I moved to London in my

4534
01:48:20,629 --> 01:48:20,639
Sussex, but I moved to London in my
 

4535
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:34,070
Sussex, but I moved to London in my
teens and never left until I moved here.

4536
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:34,080

 

4537
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,310

Oh, well, yeah. I mean, you're seeing

4538
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:36,320
Oh, well, yeah. I mean, you're seeing
 

4539
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,910
Oh, well, yeah. I mean, you're seeing
bullish delta. Yeah, you're seeing

4540
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:37,920
bullish delta. Yeah, you're seeing
 

4541
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,830
bullish delta. Yeah, you're seeing
bullish delta on ES, but there was no

4542
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:39,840
bullish delta on ES, but there was no
 

4543
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,629
bullish delta on ES, but there was no
divergence because it's matching what

4544
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:42,639
divergence because it's matching what
 

4545
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:44,149
divergence because it's matching what
we're doing. So, the I'm seeing bullish

4546
01:48:44,149 --> 01:48:44,159
we're doing. So, the I'm seeing bullish
 

4547
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:48,470
we're doing. So, the I'm seeing bullish
delta even on the cues here and here,

4548
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:48,480
delta even on the cues here and here,
 

4549
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,390
delta even on the cues here and here,
but we're seeing the market try and move

4550
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:50,400
but we're seeing the market try and move
 

4551
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,830
but we're seeing the market try and move
higher. Where that would be a problem is

4552
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:51,840
higher. Where that would be a problem is
 

4553
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,189
higher. Where that would be a problem is
if we're doing this and we're seeing

4554
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199
if we're doing this and we're seeing
 

4555
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,709
if we're doing this and we're seeing
bullish delta. That would be the

4556
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:54,719
bullish delta. That would be the
 

4557
01:48:54,719 --> 01:49:06,149
bullish delta. That would be the
divergence, right? [snorts]

4558
01:49:06,149 --> 01:49:06,159

 

4559
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:09,990

Oh, MSTU. Did you really um Can you ree

Awesome, Stephen. That's great news.
Congrats on passing.

4568
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:33,440

 

4569
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,669

Thanks, Rosco. Yeah, I mean, the way

4570
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:35,679
Thanks, Rosco. Yeah, I mean, the way
 

4571
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:37,830
Thanks, Rosco. Yeah, I mean, the way
that the way the course works is because

4572
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:37,840
that the way the course works is because
 

4573
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,510
that the way the course works is because
it's from beginner to advance, I have to

4574
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:39,520
it's from beginner to advance, I have to
 

4575
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,750
it's from beginner to advance, I have to
do it as if you've never traded before

4576
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:41,760
do it as if you've never traded before
 

4577
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,430
do it as if you've never traded before
and then it builds and builds and builds

4578
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:43,440
and then it builds and builds and builds
 

4579
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,550
and then it builds and builds and builds
and builds, right? So [snorts]

4580
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:46,560
and builds, right? So [snorts]
 

4581
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,990
and builds, right? So [snorts]
I have to assume someone's got no

4582
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:48,000
I have to assume someone's got no
 

4583
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,270
I have to assume someone's got no
knowledge. It might be that you did the

4584
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:49,280
knowledge. It might be that you did the
 

4585
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:50,790
knowledge. It might be that you did the
course and then had knowledge and then

4586
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:50,800
course and then had knowledge and then
 

4587
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,430
course and then had knowledge and then
as we get through it gets more dense

4588
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,440
as we get through it gets more dense
 

4589
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,830
as we get through it gets more dense
with information once you've got a good

4590
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:55,840
with information once you've got a good
 

4591
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,880
with information once you've got a good
base.

4592
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:57,890
base.
 

4593
01:49:57,890 --> 01:50:06,470
base.
[snorts and clears throat]

4594
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:06,480

 

4595
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,310

So this market still can't get through

4596
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:08,320
So this market still can't get through
 

4597
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:11,189
So this market still can't get through
those sort of 12 levels. If it can get

4598
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:11,199
those sort of 12 levels. If it can get
 

4599
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,790
those sort of 12 levels. If it can get
through 12elves, there'll be relief up

4600
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:12,800
through 12elves, there'll be relief up
 

4601
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,030
through 12elves, there'll be relief up
into here. At the moment, every pop into

4602
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:15,040
into here. At the moment, every pop into
 

4603
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,950
into here. At the moment, every pop into
these twelves, this little edge here is

4604
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:16,960
these twelves, this little edge here is
 

4605
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,310
these twelves, this little edge here is
being sold. You can see this is starting

4606
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:18,320
being sold. You can see this is starting
 

4607
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,990
being sold. You can see this is starting
to get thicker and thicker and thicker

4608
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:20,000
to get thicker and thicker and thicker
 

4609
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,629
to get thicker and thicker and thicker
sort of around here, right? And more

4610
01:50:22,629 --> 01:50:22,639
sort of around here, right? And more
 

4611
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:24,390
sort of around here, right? And more
clear, I'd say even around here, more

4612
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:24,400
clear, I'd say even around here, more
 

4613
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,910
clear, I'd say even around here, more
clear dips are holding into this at the

4614
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:25,920
clear dips are holding into this at the
 

4615
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,430
clear dips are holding into this at the
moment. Relief will be back into this.

4616
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:27,440
moment. Relief will be back into this.
 

4617
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,229
moment. Relief will be back into this.
This is the sentiment up here. I want to

4618
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
This is the sentiment up here. I want to
 

4619
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,070
This is the sentiment up here. I want to
see the market trade into this. And we

4620
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:32,080
see the market trade into this. And we
 

4621
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,310
see the market trade into this. And we
can make a decision how we act from

4622
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:34,320
can make a decision how we act from
 

4623
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,229
can make a decision how we act from
there. Ideally, something like this or

4624
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:36,239
there. Ideally, something like this or
 

4625
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:37,590
there. Ideally, something like this or
if you're looking for the range

4626
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:37,600
if you're looking for the range
 

4627
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,950
if you're looking for the range
rotation, then you're looking for that

4628
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
rotation, then you're looking for that

not not for my own benefit, but I did
 

4645
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:11,030
not not for my own benefit, but I did
say prices were going up in 2026, but um

4646
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:11,040
say prices were going up in 2026, but um
 

4647
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,229
say prices were going up in 2026, but um
as you know, I've been dealing with

4649
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:13,830
as you know, I've been dealing with
personal matters and I have not been

4650
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:13,840
personal matters and I have not been
 

4651
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,390
personal matters and I have not been
able to adjust anything. I had haven't

4652
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,400
able to adjust anything. I had haven't
 

4653
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,189
able to adjust anything. I had haven't
had the time to do anything yet. So,

4654
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:19,199
had the time to do anything yet. So,
 

4655
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:20,629
had the time to do anything yet. So,
prices will go up. They should have gone

4656
01:51:20,629 --> 01:51:20,639
prices will go up. They should have gone
 

4657
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,550
prices will go up. They should have gone
up already. That is my fault.

4658
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:24,560
up already. That is my fault.
 

4659
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,229

01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:28,320
delta outlier. Can they cause the
 

4663
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:31,590
delta outlier. Can they cause the

01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:31,600
squeeze up to those sort of 30s, 40s,
 

4665
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,709
squeeze up to those sort of 30s, 40s,

4667
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:36,310

this now and look to break lower? If

4744
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:24,639
this now and look to break lower? If
 

4745
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,310
this now and look to break lower? If
we're having a trend day, that's what

4746
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:26,320
we're having a trend day, that's what
 

4747

4751
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,910
If we're going to reclaim, right, then
we're going to go back inside value and

4752
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:33,920
we're going to go back inside value and
 

4753
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,109
we're going to go back inside value and
probably come all the way up there.

4754
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119

for you guys. Right? There's someone
absorbing the tape in here right now

4938
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,440
absorbing the tape in here right now
 

4939
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,189
absorbing the tape in here right now
because we just had a big market seller

4940
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:45,199
because we just had a big market seller
 

4941
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:47,589
because we just had a big market seller
come in. Right? We're looking for this

4942
01:58:47,589 --> 01:58:47,599
come in. Right? We're looking for this
 

4943
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:49,510
come in. Right? We're looking for this
for you guys. If you don't do it and we

4944
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:49,520
for you guys. If you don't do it and we
 

4945
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,189
for you guys. If you don't do it and we
start to reclaim this, you do not want

4946
01:58:51,189 --> 01:58:51,199
start to reclaim this, you do not want
 

4947
01:58:51,199 --> 01:59:02,709
start to reclaim this, you do not want
to be like holding and readding.

4948
01:59:02,709 --> 01:59:02,719

 

4949
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:03,990

There's a chance for a flush straight

4950
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:04,000
There's a chance for a flush straight
 

4951
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,750
There's a chance for a flush straight
down to 80s here if they let this go.

4952
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:05,760
down to 80s here if they let this go.
 

4953
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,750
down to 80s here if they let this go.
It's pretty thin between this right now.

4954
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:07,760
It's pretty thin between this right now.
 

4955
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,350
It's pretty thin between this right now.
Let me just change this book map in case

4956
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:09,360
Let me just change this book map in case
 

4957
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:11,350
Let me just change this book map in case
I can't see

4958
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:11,360
I can't see
 

4959
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,982
I can't see
being passive. There we go.

4960
01:59:13,982 --> 01:59:13,992
being passive. There we go.
 

4961
01:59:13,992 --> 01:59:14,709
being passive. There we go.

4964
01:59:27,669 --> 01:59:27,679

 

4965
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:29,270

Right. Be very careful here if they

4966
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:29,280
Right. Be very careful here if they
 

4967
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,830
Right. Be very careful here if they
start to reclaim. You want these this

4968
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:31,840
start to reclaim. You want these this
 

4969
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,830
start to reclaim. You want these this
push up here into these imbalances to

4970
01:59:33,830 --> 01:59:33,840
push up here into these imbalances to
 

4971
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,990
push up here into these imbalances to
fail. And we have some imbalances here.

4972
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:36,000
fail. And we have some imbalances here.
 

4973
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,589
fail. And we have some imbalances here.
You want this to fail. You want this.

4974
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:39,599
You want this to fail. You want this.
 

4975
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:42,149
You want this to fail. You want this.
Show you

4976
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159
Show you
 

4977
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:44,149
Show you
right here.

4978
01:59:44,149 --> 01:59:44,159
right here.
 

4979
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:45,990
right here.
Right. The problem right now is this

4980
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:46,000
Right. The problem right now is this
 

4981
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,149
Right. The problem right now is this
aggressive seller didn't get his way.

4982
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:50,159
aggressive seller didn't get his way.
 

4983
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:52,950
aggressive seller didn't get his way.
Might be that we need to drift into this

4984
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:52,960
Might be that we need to drift into this
 

4985
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,629
Might be that we need to drift into this
and then you'd be looking for that here.

4986
01:59:54,629 --> 01:59:54,639
and then you'd be looking for that here.
 

4987
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:56,229
and then you'd be looking for that here.
You have to cover some into these. And

4988
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:56,239
You have to cover some into these. And
 

4989
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,550
You have to cover some into these. And
if you get lucky, you get a break lower.

4990
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:58,560
if you get lucky, you get a break lower.
 

4991
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:05,270
if you get lucky, you get a break lower.
This guy right here is stuck right now.

4992
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:05,280

 

4993
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:37,669

Stomach is rumbling. I need to eat.

4994
02:00:37,669 --> 02:00:37,679

 

4995
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:43,910

You're long 255 534. I mean you're why

4996
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:43,920
You're long 255 534. I mean you're why
 

4997
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,830
You're long 255 534. I mean you're why
there's no close back above you. Even if

4998
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:45,840
there's no close back above you. Even if
 

4999
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,430
there's no close back above you. Even if
you got that right, look at the draw

5000
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:47,440
you got that right, look at the draw
 

5001
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:48,709
you got that right, look at the draw
down you're having to sit through. Let

5002
02:00:48,709 --> 02:00:48,719
down you're having to sit through. Let
 

5003
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:50,470
down you're having to sit through. Let
it close back above and hold that. I

5004
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:50,480
it close back above and hold that. I
 

5005
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,830
it close back above and hold that. I
would say [snorts]

5006
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:53,840

 

5007
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:56,229

rather than on that first test like it

5008
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
rather than on that first test like it
 

5009
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:58,149
rather than on that first test like it
might you might well be right but let it

5010
02:00:58,149 --> 02:00:58,159
might you might well be right but let it
 

5011
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:00,790
might you might well be right but let it
close back above and hold that level and

5012
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:00,800
close back above and hold that level and
 

5013
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,550
close back above and hold that level and
prove to you okay we want to go back in

5014
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:02,560
prove to you okay we want to go back in
 

5015
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,629
prove to you okay we want to go back in
rotation at the moment there's nothing

5016
02:01:04,629 --> 02:01:04,639
rotation at the moment there's nothing
 

5017
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:06,390
rotation at the moment there's nothing
to say it wants to prove to go back in

5018
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:06,400
to say it wants to prove to go back in
 

5019
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:12,070
to say it wants to prove to go back in
rotation where you've got long

5020
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:12,080

 

5021
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:13,750

back into this delta again the same

5022
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:13,760
back into this delta again the same
 

5023
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:16,229
back into this delta again the same
level as we had earlier at twelves

5024
02:01:16,229 --> 02:01:16,239
level as we had earlier at twelves
 

5025
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:18,629

reselling that twelves there you go so

5026
02:01:18,629 --> 02:01:18,639
reselling that twelves there you go so
 

5027
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:20,070
reselling that twelves there you go so
this is the imbalance that we just

5028
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:20,080
this is the imbalance that we just
 

5029
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:21,990
this is the imbalance that we just
talked about. You want that pop to sell.

5030
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:22,000
talked about. You want that pop to sell.
 

5031
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,589
talked about. You want that pop to sell.
You need a break lower now. All right?

5032
02:01:23,589 --> 02:01:23,599
You need a break lower now. All right?
 

5033
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:24,790
You need a break lower now. All right?
Because they've popped up. They've sold

5034
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:24,800
Because they've popped up. They've sold
 

5035
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,709
Because they've popped up. They've sold
it. Point control shifting lower. You

5036
02:01:26,709 --> 02:01:26,719
it. Point control shifting lower. You
 

5037
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:29,589
it. Point control shifting lower. You
need a break lower now. You do not want

5038
02:01:29,589 --> 02:01:29,599
need a break lower now. You do not want
 

5039
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:31,189
need a break lower now. You do not want
to see this just hang around in this

5040
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:31,199
to see this just hang around in this
 

5041
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:33,270
to see this just hang around in this
this area for a long time. It needs to

5042
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:33,280
this area for a long time. It needs to
 

5043
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,709
this area for a long time. It needs to
start breaking lower for you guys to be

5044
02:01:34,709 --> 02:01:34,719
start breaking lower for you guys to be
 

5045
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:36,149
start breaking lower for you guys to be
comfortable. It's just filled that

5046
02:01:36,149 --> 02:01:36,159
comfortable. It's just filled that
 

5047
02:01:36,159 --> 02:01:38,550
comfortable. It's just filled that
imbalance. It's failed where we had that

5048
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:38,560
imbalance. It's failed where we had that
 

5049
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,990
imbalance. It's failed where we had that
old delta level. It's the same level

5050
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,000
old delta level. It's the same level
 

5051
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,669
old delta level. It's the same level
I've talked about for the last, I don't

5052
02:01:41,669 --> 02:01:41,679
I've talked about for the last, I don't
 

5053
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:44,390
I've talked about for the last, I don't
know, 20 minutes, the twelves. Now, it

5054
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,400
know, 20 minutes, the twelves. Now, it
 

5055
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,070
know, 20 minutes, the twelves. Now, it
needs to break lower. It's as simple as

5056
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:46,080
needs to break lower. It's as simple as
 

5057
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,750
needs to break lower. It's as simple as
that. It has to start breaking lower.

5058
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:47,760
that. It has to start breaking lower.
 

5059
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:49,350
that. It has to start breaking lower.
Otherwise, you're going to have too many

5060
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:49,360
Otherwise, you're going to have too many
 

5061
02:01:49,360 --> 02:02:12,470
Otherwise, you're going to have too many
sellers get caught here. [snorts]

5062
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:12,480

 

5063
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:14,390

Here they go. They're going to try here.

5064
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:14,400
Here they go. They're going to try here.
 

5065
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,950
Here they go. They're going to try here.
Can they get a break?

5066
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:16,960
Can they get a break?
 

5067
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,430
Can they get a break?
Here they come. This is where the seller

5068
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:19,440
Here they come. This is where the seller
 

5069
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:20,950
Here they come. This is where the seller
was stuck. They need a break now down to

5070
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:20,960
was stuck. They need a break now down to
 

5071
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:23,189
was stuck. They need a break now down to
80s. There you go. Right. So now, can

5072
02:02:23,189 --> 02:02:23,199
80s. There you go. Right. So now, can
 

5073
02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:25,189
80s. There you go. Right. So now, can
they get follow through? You don't want

5074
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:25,199
they get follow through? You don't want
 

5075
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:27,510
they get follow through? You don't want
to see them start to hold this. This is

5076
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:27,520
to see them start to hold this. This is
 

5077
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:29,189
to see them start to hold this. This is
where that seller got stuck last time

5078
02:02:29,189 --> 02:02:29,199
where that seller got stuck last time
 

5079
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:30,629
where that seller got stuck last time
that I talked about. You got to get

5080
02:02:30,629 --> 02:02:30,639
that I talked about. You got to get
 

5081
02:02:30,639 --> 02:02:33,430
that I talked about. You got to get
underneath sort of 84s. You get very

5082
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:33,440
underneath sort of 84s. You get very
 

5083
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:35,430
underneath sort of 84s. You get very
comfortable when you get under 84s for a

5084
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:35,440
comfortable when you get under 84s for a
 

5085
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:38,070
comfortable when you get under 84s for a
break of low day.

5086
02:02:38,070 --> 02:02:38,080
break of low day.
 

5087
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,070
break of low day.
So far, they're tr they're still trying

02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:40,080
So far, they're tr they're still trying
 

5089
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,709
So far, they're tr they're still trying
to absorb these levels. There are buyers

5090
02:02:42,709 --> 02:02:42,719
to absorb these levels. There are buyers

02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:44,870
to absorb these levels. There are buyers
down at 80s and 77s. I'm somewhat

5092
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:44,880
down at 80s and 77s. I'm somewhat
 

5093
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,229
down at 80s and 77s. I'm somewhat
surprised we didn't just trade into

5094
02:02:46,229 --> 02:02:46,239
surprised we didn't just trade into
 

5095
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:47,910
surprised we didn't just trade into
that, but still a passive buyer down

5096
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:47,920
that, but still a passive buyer down
 

5097
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:49,830
that, but still a passive buyer down
here. Clearly,

5098
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:49,840
here. Clearly,
 

5099
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:52,709
here. Clearly,
clearly unwilling to let this retrade

5100
02:02:52,709 --> 02:02:52,719
clearly unwilling to let this retrade
 

5101
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:59,109
clearly unwilling to let this retrade
the lows.

5102
02:02:59,109 --> 02:02:59,119

 

5103
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:01,589

This shelf here becoming very very very

5104
02:03:01,589 --> 02:03:01,599
This shelf here becoming very very very
 

5105
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:06,510
This shelf here becoming very very very
important now. This right here.

5106
02:03:06,510 --> 02:03:06,520

5109
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,870

Do you have a free video on how to trade

5110
02:03:22,870 --> 02:03:22,880
Do you have a free video on how to trade
 

5111
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:24,550
Do you have a free video on how to trade
with anchored volume profile? Uh there

5112
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:24,560
with anchored volume profile? Uh there
 

5113
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,390
with anchored volume profile? Uh there
is a video on like volume profile

5114
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:26,400
is a video on like volume profile
 

5115
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,390

5117
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:29,830

don't use the anchor on that, but it's

5118
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:29,840
don't use the anchor on that, but it's
 

5119
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,750
don't use the anchor on that, but it's
the same. It's exactly the same concept.

5120
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:31,760
the same. It's exactly the same concept.
 

5121
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:33,510
the same. It's exactly the same concept.
It's literally identical. Doesn't matter

It's literally identical. Doesn't matter
 

5123
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,270
It's literally identical. Doesn't matter
if you use anchored or fixed or

if you use anchored or fixed or
 

5125
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:43,270

New to trading and I only use top step
 

5129
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:46,550
New to trading and I only use top step
with one screen. Would this course be

5130
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:46,560
with one screen. Would this course be
 

5131
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,310
with one screen. Would this course be
good with that setup? I mean top step's

5132
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:48,320
good with that setup? I mean top step's
 

5133
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,990

All right, you can see them rebidding

they can't get a close over 12. This is

5154
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:10,960
they can't get a close over 12. This is
 

5155
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:13,510
they can't get a close over 12. This is
starting to look very, very, very messy.

02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:13,520
starting to look very, very, very messy.

well. Bit of a twoleg back inside after
 

5171
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:54,070
well. Bit of a twoleg back inside after
squeezing through 18s. Let's see if they

5172
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:54,080
squeezing through 18s. Let's see if they
 

5173
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:56,229
squeezing through 18s. Let's see if they
rebid on VIX for that curl and go. And

5174
02:04:56,229 --> 02:04:56,239
rebid on VIX for that curl and go. And
 

5175
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:57,750
rebid on VIX for that curl and go. And
if they do, then we'll get downside.

5176
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:57,760
if they do, then we'll get downside.
 

5177

if they do, then we'll get downside.
They don't

They don't
 

5179
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,589
They don't
and maybe we do go back into range

5180
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:01,599
and maybe we do go back into range
 

5181
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:03,669
and maybe we do go back into range
today.

for that short that you guys took, you
 

5187
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:09,589
for that short that you guys took, you
have to be proactive.

You have to respect what we built out

this shelf and they do find a rebid,

this shelf and they do find a rebid,
 

5209
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:34,470
this shelf and they do find a rebid,
right? If this is a fail, if this

5210
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:34,480
right? If this is a fail, if this
 

5211
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:36,950
right? If this is a fail, if this
becomes a failure to break lower, right,

5212
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:36,960
becomes a failure to break lower, right,
 

5213
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,790
becomes a failure to break lower, right,
and they do do this move, this is

5214
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:38,800
and they do do this move, this is
 

5215
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:41,990
and they do do this move, this is
possible. Absolutely possible. Big if

5216
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:42,000
possible. Absolutely possible. Big if
 

5217
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,750
possible. Absolutely possible. Big if
because we're nowhere near reclaiming,

5218
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:43,760
because we're nowhere near reclaiming,
 

5219
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:46,149
because we're nowhere near reclaiming,
right? If this is a fail break and we

5220
02:05:46,149 --> 02:05:46,159
right? If this is a fail break and we
 

5221
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,550
right? If this is a fail break and we
reclaim and base, this here becomes

5222
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:48,560
reclaim and base, this here becomes
 

5223
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,270
reclaim and base, this here becomes
possible. But at the moment, it's way

5224
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:51,280
possible. But at the moment, it's way
 

5225
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:53,350
possible. But at the moment, it's way
too early to say that. There's still

5226
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,360
too early to say that. There's still
 

5227
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:54,790
too early to say that. There's still
quite a good chance that they can move

5228
02:05:54,790 --> 02:05:54,800
quite a good chance that they can move
 

5229
02:05:54,800 --> 02:06:00,550
quite a good chance that they can move
down into this, but time will tell.

Little shuffle here at 500s. Just

5248
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:23,760
Little shuffle here at 500s. Just
 

5249
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,910
Little shuffle here at 500s. Just
watching the tape.

5250
02:06:27,910 --> 02:06:27,920

 

5251
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:30,069

Back under 500. Still no follow through

5252
02:06:30,069 --> 02:06:30,079
Back under 500. Still no follow through
 

5253
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:35,109
Back under 500. Still no follow through
down to the 90s and 80s.

5254
02:06:35,109 --> 02:06:35,119

 

5255
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:37,830

ES came back up to the IB rejected so

5256
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:37,840
ES came back up to the IB rejected so
 

5257
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,750
ES came back up to the IB rejected so
far, but still no big close. It's right

5258
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:39,760
far, but still no big close. It's right
 

5259
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,350
far, but still no big close. It's right
at its 20-day. That's the big problem.

5260
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:41,360
at its 20-day. That's the big problem.
 

5261
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:42,950
at its 20-day. That's the big problem.
So, if you look at the spiders, they bid

5262
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:42,960
So, if you look at the spiders, they bid
 

5263
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:46,069
So, if you look at the spiders, they bid
off the 20-day. The low of day was the

5264
02:06:46,069 --> 02:06:46,079
off the 20-day. The low of day was the
 

5265
02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:49,350
off the 20-day. The low of day was the
20-day SMA on the spiders.

5266
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:49,360
20-day SMA on the spiders.
 

5267
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,030
20-day SMA on the spiders.
I think we should see followrough. It's

5268
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:51,040
I think we should see followrough. It's
 

5269
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,270
I think we should see followrough. It's
just like here we go. Finally. Now, can

5270
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:53,280
just like here we go. Finally. Now, can
 

5271
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,830
just like here we go. Finally. Now, can
they get under 90s? Get 84s is the big

5272
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:55,840
they get under 90s? Get 84s is the big
 

5273
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,790
they get under 90s? Get 84s is the big
level. I think we talked about

5274
02:06:58,790 --> 02:06:58,800
level. I think we talked about
 

5275
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:01,270
level. I think we talked about
sort of under here under 84s and then

5276
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,280
sort of under here under 84s and then
 

5277
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,669
sort of under here under 84s and then
maybe they get down into this. We will

5278
02:07:03,669 --> 02:07:03,679
maybe they get down into this. We will
 

5279
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:09,830
maybe they get down into this. We will
see. Time will tell.

5280
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:09,840

 

5281
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,189

Rebidding 90s again. Oh, this look messy

5282
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:13,199
Rebidding 90s again. Oh, this look messy
 

5283
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:26,470
Rebidding 90s again. Oh, this look messy
tape.

5284

5285
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,629

What are the horizontal lines in the

What are the horizontal lines in the
 

5287
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:32,149
What are the horizontal lines in the
gray that show the volume? Well, you've

you've just answered it, my friend.
 

5291
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:35,430
you've just answered it, my friend.
They're volume. That's what they are.

5292
02:07:35,430 --> 02:07:35,440
They're volume. That's what they are.

What does it mean when I say reclaiming?

5298

What does it mean when I say reclaiming?
 

5299
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,550
What does it mean when I say reclaiming?
Well, if we've traded, look, if we think

5300
02:07:52,550 --> 02:07:52,560
Well, if we've traded, look, if we think
 

5301
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:56,390
Well, if we've traded, look, if we think
about if we've broken under this level

5302
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:56,400
about if we've broken under this level
 

5303
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,149
about if we've broken under this level
and we've retested it, we're still

5304
02:07:58,149 --> 02:07:58,159
and we've retested it, we're still
 

5305
02:07:58,159 --> 02:08:01,030
and we've retested it, we're still
heavy. If we get above and hold above,

5306
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:01,040
heavy. If we get above and hold above,
 

5307
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,189
heavy. If we get above and hold above,
that is a reclaim. All right, is bull

5308
02:08:03,189 --> 02:08:03,199
that is a reclaim. All right, is bull
 

5309
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:04,950
that is a reclaim. All right, is bull
saying no, we're controlling this level

5310
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:04,960
saying no, we're controlling this level
 

5311
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:09,910
saying no, we're controlling this level
now to go back upside.

This just looks pretty ugly at the

This just looks pretty ugly at the
 

5321
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:22,470
This just looks pretty ugly at the

02:08:26,870 --> 02:08:26,880
a minute. If this market just goes to
 

5327
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:38,790
a minute. If this market just goes to
sleep, we'll do a giveaway.

5328
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:38,800

 

5329
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,550

Yeah, I've got PC down here now on

02:08:40,550 --> 02:08:40,560
Yeah, I've got PC down here now on
 

5331
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,310
Yeah, I've got PC down here now on
Ninja. I know it hasn't moved it down

5332
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:42,320
Ninja. I know it hasn't moved it down
 

5333
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:43,910
Ninja. I know it hasn't moved it down
here, but for me, PC's flipped down here

5334
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:43,920
here, but for me, PC's flipped down here
 

5335
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:49,510
here, but for me, PC's flipped down here
at 500s, not up here. I agree.

5336
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:49,520
at 500s, not up here. I agree.
 

5337
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:53,189
at 500s, not up here. I agree.
Okay, back into the IB

5338
02:08:53,189 --> 02:08:53,199
Okay, back into the IB
 

5339
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:54,870
Okay, back into the IB
and see if they do reclaim or they

5340
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:54,880
and see if they do reclaim or they
 

5341
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:57,109
and see if they do reclaim or they
reject. I' I'd use this as a rough level

5342
02:08:57,109 --> 02:08:57,119
reject. I' I'd use this as a rough level
 

5343
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:59,750
reject. I' I'd use this as a rough level
from 530 to 560. I'd use it as a 30

5344
02:08:59,750 --> 02:08:59,760
from 530 to 560. I'd use it as a 30
 

5345
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:02,790
from 530 to 560. I'd use it as a 30
point range here.

5346
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:02,800
point range here.
 

5347
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,550
point range here.
And if they do reclaim, we can't rule

5348
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:04,560
And if they do reclaim, we can't rule
 

5349
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:09,910
And if they do reclaim, we can't rule
out the move to 80 and 600 613

5350
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:09,920
out the move to 80 and 600 613
 

5351
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:19,209
out the move to 80 and 600 613
or relief.

5403
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:46,950
reclaim. This is a reclaim. All right,
we've reclaimed this key level. The next

5404

we've reclaimed this key level. The next
 

5405
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:48,950
we've reclaimed this key level. The next
drift is into 83s and then all the way

5406
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:48,960
drift is into 83s and then all the way

Lots of you should have
had a good day today.

5562

02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:11,109
had a good day today.
So, it's just it's good for me to just

5564
02:16:11,109 --> 02:16:11,119
So, it's just it's good for me to just
 

5565
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:13,030
So, it's just it's good for me to just
get back in the saddle and just feel

5566
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:13,040
get back in the saddle and just feel
 

5567
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:43,910

right into that next node, the gray box.
And then above that, if you're long,

5572
02:16:48,150 --> 02:16:48,160
And then above that, if you're long,
 

5573

Yes, driving to its 24-hour VW up now.
We're almost at New York. Not quite. So,

5618
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:18,160
We're almost at New York. Not quite. So,
 

5619
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,750
We're almost at New York. Not quite. So,
we're in this little node here. Through

5620
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:19,760
we're in this little node here. Through
 

5621
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:21,509
we're in this little node here. Through
this, we're going to go VWAP and then

5622
02:18:21,509 --> 02:18:21,519
this, we're going to go VWAP and then
 

5623
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:35,750
this, we're going to go VWAP and then
maybe even 650s. Can't rule it out.

5624
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:35,760

 

5625
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:41,270

Where's the next node? 616. Ready?

5626
02:18:41,270 --> 02:18:41,280

 

5627
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:54,150

616s.

5628
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,160

 

5629
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,309

No, it's not based on reclaiming VUP

5630
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:56,319
No, it's not based on reclaiming VUP
 

5631
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:58,790
No, it's not based on reclaiming VUP
loop. It Luke, it's based on this is a

5632
02:18:58,790 --> 02:18:58,800
loop. It Luke, it's based on this is a
 

5633
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:01,110
loop. It Luke, it's based on this is a
failed auction.

5634
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:01,120
failed auction.
 

5635
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:02,870
failed auction.
Okay, the market if we're going to go in

5636
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:02,880
Okay, the market if we're going to go in
 

5637
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:04,870
Okay, the market if we're going to go in
a trend day, it needs to stay heavy

5638
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:04,880
a trend day, it needs to stay heavy
 

5639
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:06,629
a trend day, it needs to stay heavy
versus the initial balance. We don't

5640
02:19:06,629 --> 02:19:06,639
versus the initial balance. We don't
 

5641
02:19:06,639 --> 02:19:08,230
versus the initial balance. We don't
stay heavy versus the initial balance.

5642
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:08,240
stay heavy versus the initial balance.
 

5643
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:10,070
stay heavy versus the initial balance.
So what we do is we create short stops

5644
02:19:10,070 --> 02:19:10,080
So what we do is we create short stops
 

5645
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:12,389
So what we do is we create short stops
here. You guys sell that. Like I said,

5646
02:19:12,389 --> 02:19:12,399
here. You guys sell that. Like I said,
 

5647
02:19:12,399 --> 02:19:15,030
here. You guys sell that. Like I said,
you must respect structure here. We held

5648
02:19:15,030 --> 02:19:15,040
you must respect structure here. We held
 

5649
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:16,950
you must respect structure here. We held
the uh I can't remember what level that

5650
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:16,960
the uh I can't remember what level that
 

5651
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:18,950
the uh I can't remember what level that
was. I have to look on the screen where

5652
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:18,960
was. I have to look on the screen where
 

5653
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:22,950
was. I have to look on the screen where
they got caught. 90s. We held the 90s

5654
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:22,960
they got caught. 90s. We held the 90s
 

5655
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,190
they got caught. 90s. We held the 90s
and we reclaimed the IB. Once we reclaim

5656
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:25,200
and we reclaimed the IB. Once we reclaim
 

5657
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,870
and we reclaimed the IB. Once we reclaim
this IB and value, there's one one trade

5658
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:28,880
this IB and value, there's one one trade
 

5659
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,389
this IB and value, there's one one trade
where it likes to go from initial

5660
02:19:30,389 --> 02:19:30,399
where it likes to go from initial
 

5661
02:19:30,399 --> 02:19:32,150
where it likes to go from initial
balance reclaim. It's to try and get to

5662
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:32,160
balance reclaim. It's to try and get to
 

5663
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,309
balance reclaim. It's to try and get to
a VWOP. Right? It's very very very

5664
02:19:34,309 --> 02:19:34,319
a VWOP. Right? It's very very very
 

5665
02:19:34,319 --> 02:19:36,150
a VWOP. Right? It's very very very
common. Once we reclaim an IB, if we

5666
02:19:36,150 --> 02:19:36,160
common. Once we reclaim an IB, if we
 

5667
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:37,910
common. Once we reclaim an IB, if we
fail an auction outside of initial

5668
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:37,920
fail an auction outside of initial
 

5669
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:40,549
fail an auction outside of initial
balance, look back at the last few days.

5670
02:19:40,549 --> 02:19:40,559
balance, look back at the last few days.
 

5671
02:19:40,559 --> 02:19:43,110
balance, look back at the last few days.
Haven't been in here, but

5672
02:19:43,110 --> 02:19:43,120
Haven't been in here, but
 

5673
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:47,669
Haven't been in here, but
right here you go.

5674
02:19:47,669 --> 02:19:47,679

 

5675
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:51,590

Fails to trade under IB, goes to VWAP.

5676
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:51,600
Fails to trade under IB, goes to VWAP.
 

5677
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:54,230
Fails to trade under IB, goes to VWAP.
Fails to trade above IB, goes to VWAP.

5678
02:19:54,230 --> 02:19:54,240
Fails to trade above IB, goes to VWAP.
 

5679
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:56,469
Fails to trade above IB, goes to VWAP.
Fails to trade under IB, low of day,

5680
02:19:56,469 --> 02:19:56,479
Fails to trade under IB, low of day,
 

5681
02:19:56,479 --> 02:19:57,830
Fails to trade under IB, low of day,
right at the end of day, goes back to

5682
02:19:57,830 --> 02:19:57,840
right at the end of day, goes back to
 

5683
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:59,590
right at the end of day, goes back to
VWAP. I can go back every day and you're

5684
02:19:59,590 --> 02:19:59,600
VWAP. I can go back every day and you're
 

5685
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:02,150
VWAP. I can go back every day and you're
going to see the same thing, right? It's

5686
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:02,160
going to see the same thing, right? It's
 

5687
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:05,830
going to see the same thing, right? It's
very very very common.

5688
02:20:05,830 --> 02:20:05,840
very very very common.
 

5689
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,750
very very very common.
This was a trend day. All right. So, we

5690
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:07,760
This was a trend day. All right. So, we
 

5691
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,030
This was a trend day. All right. So, we
never come back down. See the

5692
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:09,040
never come back down. See the
 

5693
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:11,910
never come back down. See the
difference? We print above IB. We print

5694
02:20:11,910 --> 02:20:11,920
difference? We print above IB. We print
 

5695
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:15,590
difference? We print above IB. We print
above IB. We expand. It wasn't like we

5696
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:15,600
above IB. We expand. It wasn't like we
 

5697
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,349
above IB. We expand. It wasn't like we
looked above and failed and came back

5698
02:20:17,349 --> 02:20:17,359
looked above and failed and came back
 

5699
02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:18,870
looked above and failed and came back
down. That never happened. There was no

5700
02:20:18,870 --> 02:20:18,880
down. That never happened. There was no
 

5701
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:25,670
down. That never happened. There was no
look above and fail.

5702
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:25,680

 

5703
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:35,270

Right. Rejecting gray box for now.

5704
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:35,280

 

5705
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:37,590

It's an interesting one. This it can't

5706
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:37,600
It's an interesting one. This it can't
 

5707
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:39,670
It's an interesting one. This it can't
get up there. It very very possibly

5708
02:20:39,670 --> 02:20:39,680
get up there. It very very possibly
 

5709
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,110
get up there. It very very possibly
comes all the way back down into this

5710
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:41,120
comes all the way back down into this
 

5711
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:44,150
comes all the way back down into this
shelf here. Right now, I would say bears

5712
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:44,160
shelf here. Right now, I would say bears
 

5713
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,750
shelf here. Right now, I would say bears
got caught under here and the drift

5714
02:20:45,750 --> 02:20:45,760
got caught under here and the drift
 

5715
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:47,429
got caught under here and the drift
higher is very very much possible. But

5716
02:20:47,429 --> 02:20:47,439
higher is very very much possible. But
 

5717
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:49,110
higher is very very much possible. But
we'll see unless the broader market

5718
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:49,120
we'll see unless the broader market
 

5719
02:20:49,120 --> 02:21:01,349
we'll see unless the broader market
starts getting weak.

5720
02:21:01,349 --> 02:21:01,359

 

5721

5723
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:07,830
40 is possible here. 58. They're bidding
50s. Can they flush 40s? And then do

5724
02:21:07,830 --> 02:21:07,840
50s. Can they flush 40s? And then do
 

5725
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:09,510
50s. Can they flush 40s? And then do
they move lower than that? We will see

5726
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:09,520
they move lower than that? We will see
 

5727
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:19,062
they move lower than that? We will see
in time.

02:23:46,469 --> 02:23:46,479
personally, yes, I'm still managing some
 

5829
02:23:46,479 --> 02:23:47,830
personally, yes, I'm still managing some
positions in those that I've had from

5830
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:47,840
positions in those that I've had from
 

5831
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:50,150
positions in those that I've had from
last year, but yes,

5832
02:23:50,150 --> 02:23:50,160
last year, but yes,
 

5833
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:53,830
last year, but yes,
I'm certainly not buying the froth.

5834
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:53,840
I'm certainly not buying the froth.

All right, ES rejecting the VWOPS coming

02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:58,070
All right, ES rejecting the VWOPS coming
back down to its IB. We're doing the

5838
02:23:58,070 --> 02:23:58,080
back down to its IB. We're doing the
 

5839
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:59,910
back down to its IB. We're doing the
same trade here. Now the question is

5840
02:23:59,910 --> 02:23:59,920
same trade here. Now the question is
 

5841
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:02,630
same trade here. Now the question is
does it hold the initial balance now or

5842
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:02,640
does it hold the initial balance now or
 

5843
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:05,910
does it hold the initial balance now or
is this a two leg which gets sold into?

5844
02:24:05,910 --> 02:24:05,920
is this a two leg which gets sold into?
 

5845
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:07,990
is this a two leg which gets sold into?
All right, so this level here key is

5846
02:24:07,990 --> 02:24:08,000
All right, so this level here key is
 

5847
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,429
All right, so this level here key is
this a twoleg which is now sold into

5848
02:24:11,429 --> 02:24:11,439
this a twoleg which is now sold into
 

5849
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:15,190
this a twoleg which is now sold into
i.e. is this a huge bare flag one two

5850
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:15,200
i.e. is this a huge bare flag one two
 

5851
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:18,710
i.e. is this a huge bare flag one two
which is now sold into or do they rebid

5852
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:18,720
which is now sold into or do they rebid
 

5853
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:20,469
which is now sold into or do they rebid
this area here which they've been

this area here which they've been
 

5855
02:24:20,479 --> 02:24:38,790
this area here which they've been

position buys on vehicles that I think
 

5909
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:45,910
position buys on vehicles that I think
have potential for more growth in the

02:26:52,550 --> 02:26:52,560
I guess there's not been much follow
 

5941
02:26:52,560 --> 02:27:03,349
I guess there's not been much follow
through looking at the daily

5942

5943
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:09,349

rejecting this kind of shelf here. Now,

5945
02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:12,150

this is key.

02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,790
Previous week value area low, we did
just reject it. And that gray sh that

But we're inside IB. They're just
 

5957
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:24,230
But we're inside IB. They're just
stacking both sides now. The bookmat

5958
02:27:24,230 --> 02:27:24,240
stacking both sides now. The bookmat
 

5959
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:28,230
stacking both sides now. The bookmat
looks awful. It's just uh

5960
02:27:28,230 --> 02:27:28,240
looks awful. It's just uh
 

5961
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:29,830
looks awful. It's just uh
stacking both sides. And the bid and the

02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:29,840
stacking both sides. And the bid and the

02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:35,990
stacking both sides. And the bid and the
ask, it's not very pretty.

No doubt about it. It's just can they
 

5975

in bitmap for stacking pulling do I just
look at the DOM or do I have some other

I don't know. Just looks a bit iffy

6008
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:11,520
I don't know. Just looks a bit iffy
 

6009
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:13,830

right now. the tape. It's just looks

02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:13,840
right now. the tape. It's just looks
 

6011
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:15,190
right now. the tape. It's just looks
like they don't know what they actually

6012
02:29:15,190 --> 02:29:15,200
like they don't know what they actually
 

6013
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:17,750
like they don't know what they actually
want to do with it. Normally, I'd be

6014
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:17,760
want to do with it. Normally, I'd be
 

6015
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:19,190
want to do with it. Normally, I'd be
thinking about leaning on this short

thinking about leaning on this short
 

6017
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:22,389
thinking about leaning on this short

first day back and all
and it's definitely been a passive buyer

6022
02:29:26,550 --> 02:29:26,560
and it's definitely been a passive buyer
 

6023
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:28,550

6031
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:38,550
momentum. We're not really seeing that.
We're just hanging around at the IB low.

Someone is gobbling it up today on every
 

6043
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,190
Someone is gobbling it up today on every
like major pull. Even though we've moved

lower, someone is like adamant on
gobbling it up. Just waiting for him to

6048
02:30:03,190 --> 02:30:03,200

6049
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:19,830

6050
02:30:19,830 --> 02:30:19,840

 

6051
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:22,150

Yeah, exactly. And they keep reloading

6052
02:30:22,150 --> 02:30:22,160
Yeah, exactly. And they keep reloading
 

6053
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:24,070
Yeah, exactly. And they keep reloading
that bid.

6054
02:30:24,070 --> 02:30:24,080
that bid.
 

6055
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:25,830
that bid.
Maybe like like I said, there's there's

6056
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:25,840
Maybe like like I said, there's there's
 

6057
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:28,150
Maybe like like I said, there's there's
delta outlier at 12. Point of control is

6058
02:30:28,150 --> 02:30:28,160
delta outlier at 12. Point of control is
 

6059
02:30:28,160 --> 02:30:30,469
delta outlier at 12. Point of control is
actually at 500. So like this is still

6060
02:30:30,469 --> 02:30:30,479
actually at 500. So like this is still
 

6061
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:33,349
actually at 500. So like this is still
the level down here. If this is a twoleg

6062
02:30:33,349 --> 02:30:33,359
the level down here. If this is a twoleg
 

6063
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:36,150
the level down here. If this is a twoleg
that we then sell into. All right, we're

6064
02:30:36,150 --> 02:30:36,160
that we then sell into. All right, we're
 

6065
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:37,590
that we then sell into. All right, we're
starting to see this here. If they don't

6066
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:37,600
starting to see this here. If they don't
 

6067
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:39,510
starting to see this here. If they don't
rebid this, this is where we get a

6068
02:30:39,510 --> 02:30:39,520
rebid this, this is where we get a
 

6069
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:41,750
rebid this, this is where we get a
breakaway from. All right, so we've come

6070
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:41,760
breakaway from. All right, so we've come
 

6071
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:43,270
breakaway from. All right, so we've come
back up. These boxes were here.

6072
02:30:43,270 --> 02:30:43,280
back up. These boxes were here.
 

6073
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:44,950
back up. These boxes were here.
Remember, we missed we just missed the

6074
02:30:44,950 --> 02:30:44,960
Remember, we missed we just missed the
 

6075
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:46,950
Remember, we missed we just missed the
VWAP tag, but we had divergence because

6076
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:46,960
VWAP tag, but we had divergence because
 

6077
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:49,349
VWAP tag, but we had divergence because
ES did hit its VWAP. There's your two

6078
02:30:49,349 --> 02:30:49,359
ES did hit its VWAP. There's your two
 

6079
02:30:49,359 --> 02:30:51,670
ES did hit its VWAP. There's your two
leg. There's the backside of this,

6080
02:30:51,670 --> 02:30:51,680
leg. There's the backside of this,
 

6081
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:54,230
leg. There's the backside of this,
right? This is the question now. Do they

6082
02:30:54,230 --> 02:30:54,240
right? This is the question now. Do they
 

6083
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:56,870
right? This is the question now. Do they
rebid here, right? Or do they lose this

6084
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:56,880
rebid here, right? Or do they lose this
 

6085
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:58,870
rebid here, right? Or do they lose this
now? And we've got these levels to

6086
02:30:58,870 --> 02:30:58,880
now? And we've got these levels to
 

6087
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:01,670
now? And we've got these levels to
attack.

6088
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:01,680
attack.
 

6089
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:03,110
attack.
They're not making it easy though, I'll

6090
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:03,120
They're not making it easy though, I'll
 

6091
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:10,790
They're not making it easy though, I'll
tell you that much.

6092
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:10,800

 

6093
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:12,630

So, here's that move into those twelves

6094
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:12,640
So, here's that move into those twelves
 

6095
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,590
So, here's that move into those twelves
again. Remember, we've talked about

6096
02:31:13,590 --> 02:31:13,600
again. Remember, we've talked about
 

6097
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:15,510
again. Remember, we've talked about
those twelves all day. Over under, over

6098
02:31:15,510 --> 02:31:15,520
those twelves all day. Over under, over
 

6099
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,710
those twelves all day. Over under, over
under when we're under them, we kept

6100
02:31:16,710 --> 02:31:16,720
under when we're under them, we kept
 

6101
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:18,150
under when we're under them, we kept
rejecting and rejecting, rejecting,

6102
02:31:18,150 --> 02:31:18,160
rejecting and rejecting, rejecting,
 

6103
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:19,990
rejecting and rejecting, rejecting,
rejecting, rejecting. Now, we've come

6104
02:31:19,990 --> 02:31:20,000
rejecting, rejecting. Now, we've come
 

6105
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,750
rejecting, rejecting. Now, we've come
right back to them into this gray box.

6106
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:21,760
right back to them into this gray box.
 

6107
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:24,070
right back to them into this gray box.
So, let's see how we act. They rebid

6108
02:31:24,070 --> 02:31:24,080
So, let's see how we act. They rebid
 

6109
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:26,230
So, let's see how we act. They rebid
this order. The bid start to lose

6110
02:31:26,230 --> 02:31:26,240
this order. The bid start to lose
 

6111
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:28,230
this order. The bid start to lose
traction. ES back into its initial

6112
02:31:28,230 --> 02:31:28,240
traction. ES back into its initial
 

6113
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:30,790
traction. ES back into its initial
balance low and its 20-day. All right,

6114
02:31:30,790 --> 02:31:30,800
balance low and its 20-day. All right,
 

6115
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:33,830
balance low and its 20-day. All right,
that's the key thing. Q's bid off their

6116
02:31:33,830 --> 02:31:33,840
that's the key thing. Q's bid off their
 

6117
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,429
that's the key thing. Q's bid off their

All right, back to these twelves again.
Big old delta outlier here. Point of

02:32:57,349 --> 02:32:57,359
Big old delta outlier here. Point of
 

6169
02:32:57,359 --> 02:33:01,030

That big standout number. Someone trying

6172
02:33:03,429 --> 02:33:03,439
That big standout number. Someone trying
 

6173
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:04,950
That big standout number. Someone trying
to buy this again. I don't think he's

6174
02:33:04,950 --> 02:33:04,960
to buy this again. I don't think he's
 

6175
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,150
to buy this again. I don't think he's
going to get his way. I think he's going

6176
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,160
going to get his way. I think he's going
 

6177
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:08,230
going to get his way. I think he's going
to get washed out here. Here we go. He's

6178
02:33:08,230 --> 02:33:08,240
to get washed out here. Here we go. He's

6182
02:33:16,630 --> 02:33:16,640
Oh, could have, would have, should have.
 

6183
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:18,550
Oh, could have, would have, should have.
That was probably a very good short

6184
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:18,560
That was probably a very good short
 

6185
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:19,990
That was probably a very good short
here.

6186
02:33:19,990 --> 02:33:20,000
here.
 

6187
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,590
here.
All right. So, if you took that, you'd

6188
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:21,600
All right. So, if you took that, you'd
 

6189
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:24,309
All right. So, if you took that, you'd
be covering some here now. And wait to

6190
02:33:24,309 --> 02:33:24,319
be covering some here now. And wait to
 

6191
02:33:24,319 --> 02:33:26,150
be covering some here now. And wait to
see now if you get that breakaway. One,

6192
02:33:26,150 --> 02:33:26,160
see now if you get that breakaway. One,
 

6193
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,950
see now if you get that breakaway. One,
two, backside. If you get a breakaway

6194
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:28,960
two, backside. If you get a breakaway
 

6195
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:30,790
two, backside. If you get a breakaway
under here, you can attack this level.

6196
02:33:30,790 --> 02:33:30,800
under here, you can attack this level.
 

6197
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:32,550
under here, you can attack this level.
Okay. Looks like you're going to get it.

6198
02:33:32,550 --> 02:33:32,560
Okay. Looks like you're going to get it.
 

6199
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:34,710
Okay. Looks like you're going to get it.
Here's the 500s. I told you that buyer

6200
02:33:34,710 --> 02:33:34,720
Here's the 500s. I told you that buyer
 

6201
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:36,150
Here's the 500s. I told you that buyer
here, you can see he's been too

6202
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:36,160
here, you can see he's been too
 

6203
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:38,230
here, you can see he's been too
aggressive and he's going to get himself

6204
02:33:38,230 --> 02:33:38,240
aggressive and he's going to get himself
 

6205
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:41,429
aggressive and he's going to get himself
caught. So, cover some into this. Now,

6206
02:33:41,429 --> 02:33:41,439
caught. So, cover some into this. Now,
 

6207
02:33:41,439 --> 02:33:43,110
caught. So, cover some into this. Now,
the TP some into this because you got to

6208
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:43,120
the TP some into this because you got to
 

6209
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:45,270
the TP some into this because you got to
respect looking left at what we have.

6210
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:45,280
respect looking left at what we have.
 

6211
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:46,710
respect looking left at what we have.
And if you get a breakaway under here,

6212
02:33:46,710 --> 02:33:46,720
And if you get a breakaway under here,
 

6213
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:50,070
And if you get a breakaway under here,
you can look for the 400s. All right.

6214
02:33:50,070 --> 02:33:50,080
you can look for the 400s. All right.
 

6215
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,510
you can look for the 400s. All right.
get a breakaway underneath, you can look

6216
02:33:51,510 --> 02:33:51,520
get a breakaway underneath, you can look
 

6217
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:54,150
get a breakaway underneath, you can look
for the 400s. Don't expect it. It's if

6218
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,160
for the 400s. Don't expect it. It's if
 

6219
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,070
for the 400s. Don't expect it. It's if
you get it, you can hold your runner for

6220
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:56,080
you get it, you can hold your runner for
 

6221
02:33:56,080 --> 02:34:00,309
you get it, you can hold your runner for
that.

6222
02:34:00,309 --> 02:34:00,319

 

6223
02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:02,150

Small caps are fun trading. Yeah, I

6224
02:34:02,150 --> 02:34:02,160
Small caps are fun trading. Yeah, I
 

6225
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:05,030
Small caps are fun trading. Yeah, I
mean, I left it dried up for like must

6226
02:34:05,030 --> 02:34:05,040
mean, I left it dried up for like must
 

6227
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:09,030
mean, I left it dried up for like must
be a good couple years. Um,

6228
02:34:09,030 --> 02:34:09,040
be a good couple years. Um,
 

6229
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:10,710
be a good couple years. Um,
took some big losses in small caps,

6230
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:10,720
took some big losses in small caps,
 

6231
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:12,790
took some big losses in small caps,
though. It's way too aggressive. Had

6232
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:12,800
though. It's way too aggressive. Had
 

6233
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:15,190
though. It's way too aggressive. Had
some really bad habits.

6234
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:15,200
some really bad habits.
 

6235
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:17,270
some really bad habits.
Hence, creating my flow zones is the

6236
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:17,280
Hence, creating my flow zones is the
 

6237
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,710
Hence, creating my flow zones is the
whole reason

6238
02:34:18,710 --> 02:34:18,720
whole reason
 

6239
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:20,469

02:34:20,479 --> 02:34:23,670
the whole reason I created this whole

02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,910

bottom side of this shelf. Now, if

6244
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:25,920
bottom side of this shelf. Now, if
 

6245
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:28,309
bottom side of this shelf. Now, if
buyers don't start showing up soon,

6246
02:34:28,309 --> 02:34:28,319
buyers don't start showing up soon,
 

6247
02:34:28,319 --> 02:34:30,630
buyers don't start showing up soon,
you're going to get a breakaway towards

6248
02:34:30,630 --> 02:34:30,640
you're going to get a breakaway towards
 

6249
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:36,862
you're going to get a breakaway towards
those lows that we've talked about.

6250
02:34:36,862 --> 02:34:36,872

 

6251
02:34:36,872 --> 02:34:44,630

[snorts]

6252
02:34:44,630 --> 02:34:44,640

 

6253
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:47,349

Where are they bidding? 80s7s. The guy

6254
02:34:47,349 --> 02:34:47,359
Where are they bidding? 80s7s. The guy
 

6255
02:34:47,359 --> 02:34:48,630
Where are they bidding? 80s7s. The guy
is still below like we talked about

6256
02:34:48,630 --> 02:34:48,640
is still below like we talked about
 

6257
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,790
is still below like we talked about
earlier. Yeah, 50s. Yeah, here comes the

6258
02:34:50,790 --> 02:34:50,800
earlier. Yeah, 50s. Yeah, here comes the
 

6259
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:53,030
earlier. Yeah, 50s. Yeah, here comes the
breakaway, guys. Here's the low of day

6260
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:53,040
breakaway, guys. Here's the low of day
 

6261
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:55,349
breakaway, guys. Here's the low of day
value area low here. So, cover point

6262
02:34:55,349 --> 02:34:55,359
value area low here. So, cover point
 

6263
02:34:55,359 --> 02:34:56,630
value area low here. So, cover point
here. And let's see if you get that

6264
02:34:56,630 --> 02:34:56,640
here. And let's see if you get that
 

6265
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,469
here. And let's see if you get that
breakaway to previous week value uh

6266
02:34:58,469 --> 02:34:58,479
breakaway to previous week value uh
 

6267
02:34:58,479 --> 02:34:59,910
breakaway to previous week value uh
previous week low all the way down here

6268
02:34:59,910 --> 02:34:59,920
previous week low all the way down here
 

6269
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:01,349
previous week low all the way down here
if you get lucky. And if you get through

6270
02:35:01,349 --> 02:35:01,359
if you get lucky. And if you get through
 

6271
02:35:01,359 --> 02:35:03,750
if you get lucky. And if you get through
that, there's a big block down here. So,

6272
02:35:03,750 --> 02:35:03,760
that, there's a big block down here. So,
 

6273
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:04,950
that, there's a big block down here. So,
this has just built out loads of

6274
02:35:04,950 --> 02:35:04,960
this has just built out loads of
 

6275
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:07,190
this has just built out loads of
liquidity on a two-leg. And now we can

6276
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,200
liquidity on a two-leg. And now we can
 

6277
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,349
liquidity on a two-leg. And now we can
see if we break away from this gray box,

6278
02:35:09,349 --> 02:35:09,359
see if we break away from this gray box,
 

6279
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:10,870
see if we break away from this gray box,
right? Ideally, we break away from this

6280
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:10,880
right? Ideally, we break away from this
 

6281
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:12,790
right? Ideally, we break away from this
gray box for those of you short and you

6282
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:12,800
gray box for those of you short and you
 

6283
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:16,070
gray box for those of you short and you
can make a ton of money. All right.

6284
02:35:16,070 --> 02:35:16,080
can make a ton of money. All right.
 

6285
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:17,590
can make a ton of money. All right.
Ideally, you get something like this

6286
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:17,600
Ideally, you get something like this
 

6287
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:19,190
Ideally, you get something like this
now. Oh, let me draw it for them before

6288
02:35:19,190 --> 02:35:19,200
now. Oh, let me draw it for them before
 

6289
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:21,270
now. Oh, let me draw it for them before
it goes without me. Ideally, you get

6290
02:35:21,270 --> 02:35:21,280
it goes without me. Ideally, you get
 

6291
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:23,670
it goes without me. Ideally, you get
something like this now. That' be the

6292
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:23,680
something like this now. That' be the
 

6293
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:25,670
something like this now. That' be the
most ideal move. You do not want to see

6294
02:35:25,670 --> 02:35:25,680
most ideal move. You do not want to see
 

6295
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:28,469
most ideal move. You do not want to see
this. That's a failed look below again,

6296
02:35:28,469 --> 02:35:28,479
this. That's a failed look below again,
 

6297
02:35:28,479 --> 02:35:30,070
this. That's a failed look below again,
right? You don't want it to reclaim

6298
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:30,080
right? You don't want it to reclaim
 

6299
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:31,830
right? You don't want it to reclaim
this. All right. If they cannot use this

6300
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:31,840
this. All right. If they cannot use this
 

6301
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,670
this. All right. If they cannot use this
area to protect, if they cannot short

6302
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:33,680
area to protect, if they cannot short
 

6303
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:35,990
area to protect, if they cannot short
here, I'd probably be done with it for

6304
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:36,000
here, I'd probably be done with it for
 

6305
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,349
here, I'd probably be done with it for
the day to be quite honest. Oh, where

6306
02:35:37,349 --> 02:35:37,359
the day to be quite honest. Oh, where
 

6307
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:40,469
the day to be quite honest. Oh, where
have you gone? Right. They want to use

6308
02:35:40,469 --> 02:35:40,479
have you gone? Right. They want to use
 

6309
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:43,110
have you gone? Right. They want to use
this volume to trade lower from. If they

6310
02:35:43,110 --> 02:35:43,120
this volume to trade lower from. If they
 

6311
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:44,550
this volume to trade lower from. If they
can't use that volume to trade lower

6312
02:35:44,550 --> 02:35:44,560
can't use that volume to trade lower
 

6313
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:53,590
can't use that volume to trade lower
from, it will be problematic.

6314
02:35:53,590 --> 02:35:53,600

 

6315
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:56,070

Lots of bids underneath here for it to

6316
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,080
Lots of bids underneath here for it to
 

6317
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:59,190
Lots of bids underneath here for it to
trade down to. It's just uh

6318
02:35:59,190 --> 02:35:59,200
trade down to. It's just uh
 

6319
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:00,469
trade down to. It's just uh
Are they going to let it happen? How

6320
02:36:00,469 --> 02:36:00,479
Are they going to let it happen? How
 

6321
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:03,190
Are they going to let it happen? How
long got to lunch? 13 minutes. They

6322
02:36:03,190 --> 02:36:03,200
long got to lunch? 13 minutes. They
 

6323
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:21,910
long got to lunch? 13 minutes. They
should They should let it happen.

6324
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:21,920

 

6325
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:23,990

So, this gray box so far rejecting. It's

02:36:23,990 --> 02:36:24,000
So, this gray box so far rejecting. It's

lower day
and then down into here. All right. So,

up here. So there could be a sell here.

So, reclaim of 25500 is over for shorts.

6674
02:44:19,349 --> 02:44:19,359
So, reclaim of 25500 is over for shorts.
 

6675
02:44:19,359 --> 02:44:21,670
So, reclaim of 25500 is over for shorts.
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Basically, I'd say you

6676
02:44:21,670 --> 02:44:21,680
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Basically, I'd say you
 

6677
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:24,230
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Basically, I'd say you
want to be very careful. If we do this

6678
02:44:24,230 --> 02:44:24,240
want to be very careful. If we do this
 

6679
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:26,309
want to be very careful. If we do this
and hold, all right, then we're going to

6680
02:44:26,309 --> 02:44:26,319
and hold, all right, then we're going to
 

6681
02:44:26,319 --> 02:44:29,190
and hold, all right, then we're going to
leave shorts versus here trapped. And

6682
02:44:29,190 --> 02:44:29,200
leave shorts versus here trapped. And
 

6683
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:31,190
leave shorts versus here trapped. And
then this opens up this move here for a

6684
02:44:31,190 --> 02:44:31,200
then this opens up this move here for a
 

6685
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:33,590
then this opens up this move here for a
grind back. Like you, we've done a

6686
02:44:33,590 --> 02:44:33,600
grind back. Like you, we've done a
 

6687
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:34,950
grind back. Like you, we've done a
two-leg pullback. All right, the

6688
02:44:34,950 --> 02:44:34,960
two-leg pullback. All right, the
 

6689
02:44:34,960 --> 02:44:38,389
two-leg pullback. All right, the
pullbacks happened. We've lost IB. We've

6690
02:44:38,389 --> 02:44:38,399
pullbacks happened. We've lost IB. We've
 

6691
02:44:38,399 --> 02:44:40,150
pullbacks happened. We've lost IB. We've
lost previous week's value. We're

6692
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:40,160
lost previous week's value. We're
 

6693
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:42,389
lost previous week's value. We're
trading lower. If we start reclaiming

6694
02:44:42,389 --> 02:44:42,399
trading lower. If we start reclaiming
 

6695
02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:44,550
trading lower. If we start reclaiming
these levels, it means sellers didn't

6696
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:44,560
these levels, it means sellers didn't
 

6697
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,389
these levels, it means sellers didn't
come in aggressive enough to force us

6698
02:44:46,389 --> 02:44:46,399
come in aggressive enough to force us
 

6699
02:44:46,399 --> 02:44:48,790
come in aggressive enough to force us
lower. You don't want to be short. If we

6700
02:44:48,790 --> 02:44:48,800
lower. You don't want to be short. If we
 

6701
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:51,750
lower. You don't want to be short. If we
start reclaiming a level like this, all

6702
02:44:51,750 --> 02:44:51,760
start reclaiming a level like this, all
 

6703
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:52,870
start reclaiming a level like this, all
right, because we're going to get

6704
02:44:52,870 --> 02:44:52,880
right, because we're going to get
 

6705
02:44:52,880 --> 02:44:55,670
right, because we're going to get
squeezed out, you also don't want to be

6706
02:44:55,670 --> 02:44:55,680
squeezed out, you also don't want to be
 

6707
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:58,870
squeezed out, you also don't want to be
short if we start taking out all the

6708
02:44:58,870 --> 02:44:58,880
short if we start taking out all the
 

6709
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:00,950
short if we start taking out all the
lowhanging fruits. All right, remember

6710
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:00,960
lowhanging fruits. All right, remember
 

6711
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:02,469
lowhanging fruits. All right, remember
our low hanging fruits, we're starting

6712
02:45:02,469 --> 02:45:02,479
our low hanging fruits, we're starting
 

6713
02:45:02,479 --> 02:45:04,950
our low hanging fruits, we're starting
to take them out.

6714
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:04,960
to take them out.

value area low which means it's a very
 

6749
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:53,269
value area low which means it's a very
very discounted range. All right, we can

6750
02:45:53,269 --> 02:45:53,279
very discounted range. All right, we can
 

6751
02:45:53,279 --> 02:45:54,710
very discounted range. All right, we can
look at that. We talked about it right

6752

6754
02:45:56,630 --> 02:45:56,640
at the beginning
 

6755
02:45:56,640 --> 02:46:00,230

6759
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:08,070

Right. So, if we leave this, we are now

6760
02:46:08,070 --> 02:46:08,080
Right. So, if we leave this, we are now
 

6761
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:10,710
Right. So, if we leave this, we are now

Yeah, 400s is a big big big level. 400s

6770
02:46:24,070 --> 02:46:24,080
Yeah, 400s is a big big big level. 400s

and what's that? 350.
 

6773
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:30,389
and what's that? 350.
400s and 350 is a very very very very

big level. [snorts]

So, we don't want to keep adding short

6778
02:46:35,590 --> 02:46:35,600
So, we don't want to keep adding short
 

6779
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:37,110
So, we don't want to keep adding short
the closer we get to it. Think about

6780
02:46:37,110 --> 02:46:37,120
the closer we get to it. Think about
 

6781
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:39,110
the closer we get to it. Think about
riskreward. If you are adding short down

6782
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:39,120
riskreward. If you are adding short down
 

6783
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:41,590
riskreward. If you are adding short down
here as we're getting closer to target,

6784
02:46:41,590 --> 02:46:41,600
here as we're getting closer to target,
 

6785
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:44,150
here as we're getting closer to target,
your risk is getting bigger, your reward

6786
02:46:44,150 --> 02:46:44,160
your risk is getting bigger, your reward
 

6787
02:46:44,160 --> 02:46:52,870
your risk is getting bigger, your reward
is getting smaller.

6788
02:46:52,870 --> 02:46:52,880

It's very hard, man, cuz we're just in
 

6865
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:48,950

consolidation. Technically, yes. On the

6866
02:48:48,950 --> 02:48:48,960
consolidation. Technically, yes. On the

high. Yes, technically. But the biggest

6872
02:48:55,030 --> 02:48:55,040
high. Yes, technically. But the biggest
 

6873
02:48:55,040 --> 02:48:57,510
high. Yes, technically. But the biggest
swing points are here. This is why this

6874
02:48:57,510 --> 02:48:57,520
swing points are here. This is why this
 

6875
