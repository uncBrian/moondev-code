59
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,189
in that pocket at the moment. If we look
at the yearly profile, the profile that

60
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
this year. Here, if we move down into a
 

67
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,990

where we found bids on Friday and the
 

71
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,870
where we found bids on Friday and the
Friday before as well. So, this is your

72
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
Friday before as well. So, this is your
 

73
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,070
Friday before as well. So, this is your
thick area into 700s. Surprise, surprise

00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
into 700s. All right, and this is the
 

77
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,029
into 700s. All right, and this is the
old range rotation that we did back in

78
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
old range rotation that we did back in
 

79
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,270
old range rotation that we did back in
September and October. All right, this

80
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
September and October. All right, this
 

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,629
September and October. All right, this
was our range rotation set 700 to 25K

82
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
was our range rotation set 700 to 25K
 

83
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,990
was our range rotation set 700 to 25K
before we broke out. We're coming back

84
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
before we broke out. We're coming back
 

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,469
before we broke out. We're coming back
and retesting that. We are bearish in

86
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
and retesting that. We are bearish in
 

87
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,909
and retesting that. We are bearish in
this retest at the moment. Now, it's

88
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
this retest at the moment. Now, it's
 

89
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,909
this retest at the moment. Now, it's
possible bulls can take control. So far,

90
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
possible bulls can take control. So far,
 

91
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,990
possible bulls can take control. So far,
I'm not seeing enough to tell me that

92
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not seeing enough to tell me that
 

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,590
I'm not seeing enough to tell me that
they've taken control. I would need to

94
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:51,600
they've taken control. I would need to
 

95
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,990
they've taken control. I would need to
see bulls pivot over here, leaving bears

96
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
see bulls pivot over here, leaving bears
 

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,710
see bulls pivot over here, leaving bears

99
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,870
trapped there for a Santa Claus rally
into the new year. That's what we would

100
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
into the new year. That's what we would
 

101
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,589
into the new year. That's what we would
normally expect coming into November and

102
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
normally expect coming into November and
 

103
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,749
normally expect coming into November and
December. Um, hedge funds have not made

their money this year. Remember, retail

106
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520

107
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,110

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
one thing to be aware of is regardless
 

113

one thing to be aware of is regardless
of structure, if hedge funds start

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
of structure, if hedge funds start
 

115
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,390
of structure, if hedge funds start
turning this on, well, that's what

116
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
turning this on, well, that's what
 

117
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,749
turning this on, well, that's what
they're going to look for if they really

118
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
they're going to look for if they really

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
too much attention to it, but that is
 

133
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,909
too much attention to it, but that is
one of the trades that I was looking for

134
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
one of the trades that I was looking for
 

135
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,270
one of the trades that I was looking for

retest back to here. If we see sustained
 

141
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,670
retest back to here. If we see sustained
pressure, we need to build out time

142
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
pressure, we need to build out time
 

143
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,990
pressure, we need to build out time
because time will allow this to start

144
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
because time will allow this to start
 

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,230
because time will allow this to start
expanding and the 5day to come down with

00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
expanding and the 5day to come down with
 

147
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,110
expanding and the 5day to come down with
it if we're truly truly going to be

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
it if we're truly truly going to be
 

149
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,070
it if we're truly truly going to be
bearish. All right, so so far opening up

150
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
bearish. All right, so so far opening up
 

151
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,589
bearish. All right, so so far opening up
inside if we move down into the hourlys.

152
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
inside if we move down into the hourlys.
 

153
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,950
inside if we move down into the hourlys.
All right, what we need to pay attention

to
 

157
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,189
to
is where we are based on the previous

158
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
is where we are based on the previous
 

159
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,189
is where we are based on the previous

160
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
week and previous days. All right. So,
 

161
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,029
week and previous days. All right. So,
here's your previous week profile from

162
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
here's your previous week profile from
 

163
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,749
here's your previous week profile from
sun the previous Sunday all the way out.

164
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
sun the previous Sunday all the way out.

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,790
sun the previous Sunday all the way out.
Right now, we're opening up underneath

166
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
Right now, we're opening up underneath
 

167
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,029
Right now, we're opening up underneath
previous week value area low with a look

previous week value area low with a look
 

169
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,189
previous week value area low with a look
above in this little pocket and this

above in this little pocket and this
 

171
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,589
above in this little pocket and this
thick area. So, we just failed in

172
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
thick area. So, we just failed in
 

173
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,390
thick area. So, we just failed in
London. All right. In this pocket, a

174
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
London. All right. In this pocket, a
 

175
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,469
London. All right. In this pocket, a
very nice failure in that pocket. Now,

176
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
very nice failure in that pocket. Now,
 

177
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,230
very nice failure in that pocket. Now,
failing

178
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
failing
 

179
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,070
failing
previous week value area low coming down

180
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
previous week value area low coming down
 

181
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,070
previous week value area low coming down
to test the week before it. All right.

182
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
to test the week before it. All right.
 

183
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,790
to test the week before it. All right.
We have to be aware of this. This is a

184
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
We have to be aware of this. This is a
 

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,309
We have to be aware of this. This is a
sensitive level that we're now trading

186
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
sensitive level that we're now trading
 

187
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,630
sensitive level that we're now trading
in. We can create range rotation in here

188
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
in. We can create range rotation in here
 

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,350
in. We can create range rotation in here
because we have

190
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
because we have
 

191
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,310
because we have
this liquidity, this liquidity, and

192
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
this liquidity, this liquidity, and
 

193
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,550
this liquidity, this liquidity, and
Friday liquidity. All right, this is a

194
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
Friday liquidity. All right, this is a
 

195
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,389
Friday liquidity. All right, this is a
sensitive area. If this lets go, all

196
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
sensitive area. If this lets go, all
 

197
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,829
sensitive area. If this lets go, all
right, what am I thinking about? Well,

198
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
right, what am I thinking about? Well,
 

199
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,110
right, what am I thinking about? Well,
I'm very clearly I'm going to think

200
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm very clearly I'm going to think
 

201
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,430
I'm very clearly I'm going to think
about this. If we start letting go, I

202
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
about this. If we start letting go, I
 

203
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,110
about this. If we start letting go, I
think about this. But the ideal location

204
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
think about this. But the ideal location
 

205
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,870
think about this. But the ideal location
for that short was up here. This is the

206
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
for that short was up here. This is the
 

207
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,190
for that short was up here. This is the
worst location. Unfortunately, we are

208
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
worst location. Unfortunately, we are
 

209
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,430
worst location. Unfortunately, we are
opening up right in this sort of

210
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
opening up right in this sort of
 

211
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,750
opening up right in this sort of
potential support worst location. don't

212
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
potential support worst location. don't
 

213
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,509
potential support worst location. don't
really want to get short there. I'd

214
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
really want to get short there. I'd
 

215
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,350
really want to get short there. I'd
rather see a breakdown retest stay heavy

216
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
rather see a breakdown retest stay heavy
 

217
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,910
rather see a breakdown retest stay heavy
if I'm going to short that otherwise up

218
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
if I'm going to short that otherwise up
 

219
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,790
if I'm going to short that otherwise up
here. So, we need to be aware of the

220
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
here. So, we need to be aware of the
 

221
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,670
here. So, we need to be aware of the
previous week's rotation. All right. Any

222
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
previous week's rotation. All right. Any
 

223
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,910
previous week's rotation. All right. Any
hold above sort of 250 260 is it there?

224
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
hold above sort of 250 260 is it there?
 

225
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,230
hold above sort of 250 260 is it there?
Yeah, 280. All right. Might see a

226
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
Yeah, 280. All right. Might see a
 

227
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,030
Yeah, 280. All right. Might see a
bullish move back to 500. So, we don't

228
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
bullish move back to 500. So, we don't
 

229
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,030
bullish move back to 500. So, we don't
want to see bulls get above that and

230
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
want to see bulls get above that and
 

231
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,630
want to see bulls get above that and
hold or if you're a bear, you don't. If

232
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
hold or if you're a bear, you don't. If
 

233
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,910
hold or if you're a bear, you don't. If
we're going to see that, then we're

234
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
we're going to see that, then we're
 

235
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,750
we're going to see that, then we're
looking for a long back into here and

236
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
looking for a long back into here and
 

237
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,430
looking for a long back into here and
probably a short from down there because

238
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
probably a short from down there because
 

239
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,750
probably a short from down there because
we're still inside a rotation. All

240
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
we're still inside a rotation. All
 

241
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,630
we're still inside a rotation. All
right, we're still inside a rotation.

242
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
right, we're still inside a rotation.
 

243
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,470
right, we're still inside a rotation.
Friday's rotation. All right, decent

244
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
Friday's rotation. All right, decent
 

245
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,910
Friday's rotation. All right, decent
squeeze out on Friday, I don't think it

246
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
squeeze out on Friday, I don't think it
 

247
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,990
squeeze out on Friday, I don't think it
was anything more than a squeeze out.

248
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
was anything more than a squeeze out.
 

249
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,430
was anything more than a squeeze out.
All right, if you look at the inflows on

250
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
All right, if you look at the inflows on
 

251
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,870
All right, if you look at the inflows on
Friday, it was poor. There wasn't a lot

252
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
Friday, it was poor. There wasn't a lot
 

253
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,389
Friday, it was poor. There wasn't a lot
of buying it. It wasn't a broad market,

254
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
of buying it. It wasn't a broad market,
 

255
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,070
of buying it. It wasn't a broad market,
you know, it just it was a squeeze out.

256
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
you know, it just it was a squeeze out.
 

257
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,070
you know, it just it was a squeeze out.
That was it. It was shorts covering. All

258
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
That was it. It was shorts covering. All
 

259
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,870
That was it. It was shorts covering. All
right, we did eventually get this in

260
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
right, we did eventually get this in
 

261
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,470
right, we did eventually get this in
Discord together, which was nice. Or at

262
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
Discord together, which was nice. Or at
 

263
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,990
Discord together, which was nice. Or at
least everyone else in my Discord while

264
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
least everyone else in my Discord while
 

265
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,470
least everyone else in my Discord while
I was walking Luna got it. And we have

266
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
I was walking Luna got it. And we have
 

267
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,070
I was walking Luna got it. And we have
to be aware of these levels, don't we?

268
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
to be aware of these levels, don't we?
 

269
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,670
to be aware of these levels, don't we?
All right,

270
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
All right,
 

271
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,949
All right,
previous day value area high, value area

272
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
previous day value area high, value area
 

273
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,949
previous day value area high, value area
low. Like we said, we're trading near

274
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
low. Like we said, we're trading near
 

275
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,949
low. Like we said, we're trading near
the previous week value area lows and

276
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
the previous week value area lows and
 

277
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,790
the previous week value area lows and
the week before that value area lows.

the week before that value area lows.

So, we can ro range rotate in here. This

280
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
So, we can ro range rotate in here. This
 

281
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,430
So, we can ro range rotate in here. This
might look like nothing, but this is

282
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
might look like nothing, but this is
 

283
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,190
might look like nothing, but this is
984.

284
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
984.
 

285
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,949
984.
So, we're looking at 300 point range

286
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
So, we're looking at 300 point range
 

287
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,870
So, we're looking at 300 point range
rotation in here. That's what we're

288
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
rotation in here. That's what we're
 

289
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,550
rotation in here. That's what we're
looking at at the moment, folks, is a

290
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
looking at at the moment, folks, is a
 

291
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,509
looking at at the moment, folks, is a
300 point range rotation. If we do this,

292
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
300 point range rotation. If we do this,
 

293
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,190
300 point range rotation. If we do this,
maybe we get lucky and get a retest. But

294
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
maybe we get lucky and get a retest. But
 

295
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,269
maybe we get lucky and get a retest. But
unfortunately, the best location when

296
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
unfortunately, the best location when
 

297
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,710
unfortunately, the best location when
we're in range rotation would have been

298
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
we're in range rotation would have been
 

299
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,509
we're in range rotation would have been
short here, which was given beautifully

300
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
short here, which was given beautifully
 

301
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,670
short here, which was given beautifully
to London traders. If we look up here,

302
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
to London traders. If we look up here,
 

303
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,430
to London traders. If we look up here,
this was very, very nice. All right,

304
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
this was very, very nice. All right,
 

305
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,949
this was very, very nice. All right,
this is very nice up here. And think

306
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
this is very nice up here. And think
 

307
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,829
this is very nice up here. And think
about this one leg, two leg failure back

308
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
about this one leg, two leg failure back
 

309
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,829
about this one leg, two leg failure back
down to here. Can we trade under or do

310
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
down to here. Can we trade under or do
 

311
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,590
down to here. Can we trade under or do
we cla reclaim and do this for the rest

312
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
we cla reclaim and do this for the rest
 

313
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,870
we cla reclaim and do this for the rest
of the day? Those are the two things

314
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
of the day? Those are the two things
 

315
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,110
of the day? Those are the two things
that I'm thinking about at the moment.

316
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
that I'm thinking about at the moment.
 

317
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,190
that I'm thinking about at the moment.
So, I don't want to carry too much bias

318
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
So, I don't want to carry too much bias
 

319
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,030
So, I don't want to carry too much bias
into this because location is not good.

320
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
into this because location is not good.
 

321
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,190
into this because location is not good.
You can see since London, this is pretty

322
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
You can see since London, this is pretty
 

323
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,430
You can see since London, this is pretty
much a straight move downside. All

324
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
much a straight move downside. All
 

325
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,670
much a straight move downside. All
right. Unfortunately, that it is what it

326
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
right. Unfortunately, that it is what it
 

327
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,430
right. Unfortunately, that it is what it
is. That's what we the cards we've been

328
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
is. That's what we the cards we've been
 

329
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,389
is. That's what we the cards we've been
dealt with on a Monday morning.

330
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
dealt with on a Monday morning.
 

331
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,110
dealt with on a Monday morning.
Okay. So, you know what I'm looking for?

332
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
Okay. So, you know what I'm looking for?
 

333
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,190
Okay. So, you know what I'm looking for?
Let's have a look at this. Right. This

334
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
Let's have a look at this. Right. This
 

335
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,430
Let's have a look at this. Right. This
gray area is just the little bump that

336
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
gray area is just the little bump that
 

337
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,110
gray area is just the little bump that
we had from D

338
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
we had from D
 

339
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,670
we had from D
the edge of

340
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
the edge of
 

341
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,550
the edge of
sort of uh Sunday, Monday, Friday from

342
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
sort of uh Sunday, Monday, Friday from
 

343
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,630
sort of uh Sunday, Monday, Friday from
the 7th. So, two weeks ago, not last

344
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
the 7th. So, two weeks ago, not last
 

345
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,910
the 7th. So, two weeks ago, not last
week, the week before. So, I'm watching

346
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
week, the week before. So, I'm watching
 

347
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,829
week, the week before. So, I'm watching
that. All right, let's have a look at

348
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
that. All right, let's have a look at
 

349
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,550
that. All right, let's have a look at
the cues and the spiders because they're

350
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
the cues and the spiders because they're
 

351
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,150
the cues and the spiders because they're
actually pretty easy to see right now.

352
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160

 

353
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,670

Right. What I would be looking at, SPY

354
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
Right. What I would be looking at, SPY
 

355
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,670
Right. What I would be looking at, SPY
has two big levels here. 70 and 72 were

356
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
has two big levels here. 70 and 72 were
 

357
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,350
has two big levels here. 70 and 72 were
the big options levels. All right. If

358
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
the big options levels. All right. If
 

359
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,670
the big options levels. All right. If
start letting go of that with failure,

360
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
start letting go of that with failure,
 

361
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,030
start letting go of that with failure,
you're probably going to see a rotation

362
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
you're probably going to see a rotation
 

363
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,269
you're probably going to see a rotation
back down towards 666. All right. If

364
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
back down towards 666. All right. If
 

365
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,150
back down towards 666. All right. If
they hold 70s and reclaim 72s, then

366
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
they hold 70s and reclaim 72s, then
 

367
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,590
they hold 70s and reclaim 72s, then
there's probably a squeeze upside. So,

368
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
there's probably a squeeze upside. So,
 

369
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,509
there's probably a squeeze upside. So,
you can set price alerts on those if you

370
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
you can set price alerts on those if you
 

371
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,750
you can set price alerts on those if you
want. For Q's, the big level was the

372
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
want. For Q's, the big level was the
 

373
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,870
want. For Q's, the big level was the
600. That was your put wall. We opened

374
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
600. That was your put wall. We opened
 

375
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,110
600. That was your put wall. We opened
up under it. They reclaimed it. I don't

376
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
up under it. They reclaimed it. I don't
 

377
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,630
up under it. They reclaimed it. I don't
know if they've moved that gamma coming

378
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:02,640
know if they've moved that gamma coming
 

379
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,350
know if they've moved that gamma coming
into uh today, but we we'd have to see.

380
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
into uh today, but we we'd have to see.
 

381
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,269
into uh today, but we we'd have to see.
Uh filled this old gap, which we can now

382
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
Uh filled this old gap, which we can now
 

383
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,870
Uh filled this old gap, which we can now
get rid of. Thanks very much. See you

384
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
get rid of. Thanks very much. See you
 

385
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,990
get rid of. Thanks very much. See you
later. All right, so Q's

386
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
later. All right, so Q's
 

387
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,230
later. All right, so Q's
very much the same thing as we talked

388
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
very much the same thing as we talked
 

389
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,550
very much the same thing as we talked
about on NQ. Oh, don't do that.

390
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
about on NQ. Oh, don't do that.
 

391
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,550
about on NQ. Oh, don't do that.
In a range rotation, you can see here's

392
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
In a range rotation, you can see here's
 

393
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,870
In a range rotation, you can see here's
Friday squeeze up. We're opening up

394
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
Friday squeeze up. We're opening up
 

395
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,870
Friday squeeze up. We're opening up
inside of this. I'd say if a fail is

396
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
inside of this. I'd say if a fail is
 

397
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,710
inside of this. I'd say if a fail is
here, there's probably trade back down.

398
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
here, there's probably trade back down.
 

399
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,470
here, there's probably trade back down.
You can see maybe a look below and fail

400
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
You can see maybe a look below and fail
 

401
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,069
You can see maybe a look below and fail
for the trade back upside. So, range

402
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
for the trade back upside. So, range
 

403
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,269
for the trade back upside. So, range
rotation until it proves otherwise.

404
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
rotation until it proves otherwise.
 

405
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,870
rotation until it proves otherwise.
Dixie continues to drift higher. Okay,

trying to find a bid off those lows

408
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
trying to find a bid off those lows
 

409
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,829
trying to find a bid off those lows
and possible push right back into here.

415
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,150

How's that reacted? Yeah, we're starting

416
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
How's that reacted? Yeah, we're starting
 

417
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,710
How's that reacted? Yeah, we're starting
to find that bid I'm concerned about in

418
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
to find that bid I'm concerned about in
 

419
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,190
to find that bid I'm concerned about in
this green box, right? The big level is

420
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
this green box, right? The big level is
 

421
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,310
this green box, right? The big level is
way way higher, but it is starting

422
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
way way higher, but it is starting
 

423
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,230
way way higher, but it is starting
to find that bid. If this starts

424
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
to find that bid. If this starts
 

425
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,470
to find that bid. If this starts
breaking out,

426
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
breaking out,
 

427
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,030
breaking out,
I get very worried for this market. 30

years strong.
 

431
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,069
years strong.
Okay. Anyway, we'll keep an eye on that.

432
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
Okay. Anyway, we'll keep an eye on that.
 

433

previous days range. Nothing really to
see there. Google probably strong off

468
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
see there. Google probably strong off
 

469
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,269
see there. Google probably strong off
that Birkshire news. Yes. All right. So

470
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
that Birkshire news. Yes. All right. So
 

471
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,790
that Birkshire news. Yes. All right. So
people just starting to see that. It did

472
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
people just starting to see that. It did
 

473
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,150
people just starting to see that. It did
come out here, but maybe people didn't

474
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
come out here, but maybe people didn't
 

475
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,150
come out here, but maybe people didn't
really read it. All right, so there's

476
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
really read it. All right, so there's
 

477
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,230
really read it. All right, so there's
your news. Any pullbacks that hold,

478
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
your news. Any pullbacks that hold,
 

479
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,750
your news. Any pullbacks that hold,
we're going to see continued rotation.

480
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
we're going to see continued rotation.
 

481
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,230
we're going to see continued rotation.
Remember, this has all started from when

482
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
Remember, this has all started from when
 

483
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,069
Remember, this has all started from when
they got rid of that uh financial

484
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
they got rid of that uh financial
 

485
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,710
they got rid of that uh financial
decision when they were trying to cut up

486
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720

they've let them off and now we're in a

494
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
they've let them off and now we're in a
 

495
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,030
they've let them off and now we're in a
breakout. So relative strength in Google

496
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
breakout. So relative strength in Google
 

497
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,629
breakout. So relative strength in Google
and some of the market or the big

498
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
and some of the market or the big
 

499
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,910
and some of the market or the big
players in the market starting to buy

players in the market starting to buy
 

501
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,990
players in the market starting to buy

into it. Meta
still weak. All right. Inside previous

504
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
still weak. All right. Inside previous
 

505
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,069
still weak. All right. Inside previous
days range. This is very much like the

506
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
days range. This is very much like the
 

507
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,829
days range. This is very much like the
cues. If it can't reclaim this for the

508
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
cues. If it can't reclaim this for the
 

509
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,509
cues. If it can't reclaim this for the
squeeze, we come back and revisit this.

510
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
squeeze, we come back and revisit this.
 

511
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,030
squeeze, we come back and revisit this.
I'm not convinced we're quite done yet

512
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
I'm not convinced we're quite done yet
 

513
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,990
I'm not convinced we're quite done yet
on meta, but we will see. Microsoft that

514
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
on meta, but we will see. Microsoft that
 

515
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,470
on meta, but we will see. Microsoft that
looks pretty good. That looks pretty

516
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
looks pretty good. That looks pretty
 

517
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,949
looks pretty good. That looks pretty
good compared to some of the others. All

518
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
good compared to some of the others. All
 

519
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,750
good compared to some of the others. All
right. Range rotation push up Friday.

520
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
right. Range rotation push up Friday.
 

521
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,590
right. Range rotation push up Friday.
Can it hold to complete that move?

522
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
Can it hold to complete that move?
 

523
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,110
Can it hold to complete that move?
Remember, it's had relative weakness

524
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
Remember, it's had relative weakness
 

525
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,189
Remember, it's had relative weakness
since the earnings, right? So, it's just

526
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
since the earnings, right? So, it's just
 

527
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,990
since the earnings, right? So, it's just
a bid up since the earnings. But, uh, if

528
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
a bid up since the earnings. But, uh, if
 

529
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,990
a bid up since the earnings. But, uh, if
they fail to reclaim here,

530
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
they fail to reclaim here,
 

531
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,269
they fail to reclaim here,
this is failure, failure, failure, and

532
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
this is failure, failure, failure, and
 

533
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,870
this is failure, failure, failure, and
new lows coming. So, intraday looks okay

534
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
new lows coming. So, intraday looks okay
 

535
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,350
new lows coming. So, intraday looks okay
pre-market, but I'd be quite concerned

536
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
pre-market, but I'd be quite concerned
 

537
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,269
pre-market, but I'd be quite concerned
if I was holding a swing long in that.

538
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
if I was holding a swing long in that.
 

539
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,350
if I was holding a swing long in that.

Wednesday. All right, this is all to do
with Wednesday. Are we trimming profits

562
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
with Wednesday. Are we trimming profits
 

563
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,509
with Wednesday. Are we trimming profits
before Wednesday or does Wednesday start

564
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
before Wednesday or does Wednesday start
 

565
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,590
before Wednesday or does Wednesday start
the bigger move and the crash or are we

566
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
the bigger move and the crash or are we
 

567
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,110

all to play for at the moment, but we

00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
all to play for at the moment, but we
 

575
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,389
all to play for at the moment, but we
have to be aware of that coming into

have to be aware of that coming into
 

577
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,670
have to be aware of that coming into

not too bad pulling back after that big

580
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
not too bad pulling back after that big
 

581
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,870
not too bad pulling back after that big
drive up on uh Friday, but if we look at

582
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
drive up on uh Friday, but if we look at
 

583
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,110
drive up on uh Friday, but if we look at
the rest of the week, we've broken down.

584
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
the rest of the week, we've broken down.
 

585
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,949
the rest of the week, we've broken down.
The question is, does it hold range for

586
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
The question is, does it hold range for
 

587
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,550
The question is, does it hold range for
a retest of this level or are we just

588
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
a retest of this level or are we just
 

589
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,189
a retest of this level or are we just
going to see weakness?

590
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
going to see weakness?
 

591
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,749
going to see weakness?
So, overall, MAG isolate slightly weaker

592
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
So, overall, MAG isolate slightly weaker
 

593
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,069
So, overall, MAG isolate slightly weaker
outside of Google right now. Let's have

594
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
outside of Google right now. Let's have
 

595
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,590
outside of Google right now. Let's have
a look at these other ones affected.

596
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
a look at these other ones affected.
 

597
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,350
a look at these other ones affected.

Okay. So, Netflix at quarter bid yet?

604
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
Okay. So, Netflix at quarter bid yet?
 

605
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,230
Okay. So, Netflix at quarter bid yet?
Not really.

606
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240

 

607
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,829

Split is done. Is it? Is that just done

608
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
Split is done. Is it? Is that just done
 

609
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,030
Split is done. Is it? Is that just done
it split? Okay. Interesting. Wonder if

610
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
it split? Okay. Interesting. Wonder if
 

611
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,030
it split? Okay. Interesting. Wonder if
they rally off that or not.

612
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040

 

613
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,430

Okay.

615
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,310

How we doing for time? Four minutes

616
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
How we doing for time? Four minutes

619
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,470

So yeah, very aware of the range

620
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
So yeah, very aware of the range
 

621
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,230
So yeah, very aware of the range
rotation today. I would have loved to

622
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
rotation today. I would have loved to
 

623
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,509
rotation today. I would have loved to
have been short up here and it's a

624
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
have been short up here and it's a
 

625
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,949
have been short up here and it's a
perfect location for the short for that

626
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
perfect location for the short for that
 

627
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,389
perfect location for the short for that
look above and failure. I don't really

628
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
look above and failure. I don't really
 

629
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,749
look above and failure. I don't really
love being short here to have to come

630
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
love being short here to have to come
 

631
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,069
love being short here to have to come
underneath and fail.

632
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
underneath and fail.
 

633
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,110
underneath and fail.
So location is everything. I do think

634
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
So location is everything. I do think
 

635
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,069
So location is everything. I do think
we're uh slightly more bearish overall,

636
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
we're uh slightly more bearish overall,
 

637
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,790
we're uh slightly more bearish overall,
but very very possible that today is

638
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
but very very possible that today is
 

639
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,629
but very very possible that today is

695
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,270
early this morning, it's just we've lost
location. It's uh very very unfortunate,

location. It's uh very very unfortunate,
 

697
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,909
location. It's uh very very unfortunate,
but this is unfortunately powered it. So

698

and uh demand down here. We could pull
 

705
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,750
and uh demand down here. We could pull
this up so it matches.

706

this morning, you should have had a bit
of fun. That was a nice obvious rotation

714
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
of fun. That was a nice obvious rotation
 

715
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,789
of fun. That was a nice obvious rotation
off value. Like really clean off value.

716
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
off value. Like really clean off value.
 

717

00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
you're holding runners just to see if at
 

733
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,909
you're holding runners just to see if at

the market open they want to dump you
 

735
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,150

737
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,710

if if you get that. But for me, well,

738
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
if if you get that. But for me, well,
 

739
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,789
if if you get that. But for me, well,
I've missed it. It's it's happened in

740
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
I've missed it. It's it's happened in
 

741
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,870
I've missed it. It's it's happened in
London. It's happened in London.

742
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880

 

743
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,430

So, one minute left here, folks.

744
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440

 

745
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,110

See what we get.

746
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120

 

747
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,950

Yeah, the VIX's looking pretty uh

748
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
Yeah, the VIX's looking pretty uh
 

749
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,789
Yeah, the VIX's looking pretty uh
pretty dangerous right now. Put in a

750
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
pretty dangerous right now. Put in a
 

751
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,549
pretty dangerous right now. Put in a
sort of double bottom versus Friday's

752
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
sort of double bottom versus Friday's
 

753
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,390
sort of double bottom versus Friday's
lows gapping up and it's got those

754
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
lows gapping up and it's got those
 

755
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,549
lows gapping up and it's got those
previous day highs at 23 if it does

756
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
previous day highs at 23 if it does
 

757
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,070
previous day highs at 23 if it does
really want to go for it. But otherwise,

758
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
really want to go for it. But otherwise,
 

759
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,510
really want to go for it. But otherwise,
we're just going to go in a rotation

760
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
we're just going to go in a rotation
 

761
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,549
we're just going to go in a rotation
between PDL, PDC, and PDH on the VIX as

762
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
between PDL, PDC, and PDH on the VIX as
 

763
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,070
between PDL, PDC, and PDH on the VIX as
well. But if we go in a rotation up

764
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
well. But if we go in a rotation up
 

765
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,110
well. But if we go in a rotation up
here, it's uh well, let's just say it's

766
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
here, it's uh well, let's just say it's
 

767
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,190
here, it's uh well, let's just say it's
dangerous. Let's just put it that way.

768
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
dangerous. Let's just put it that way.
 

769
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,310
dangerous. Let's just put it that way.
It's very dangerous.

770
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
It's very dangerous.
 

771
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,830
It's very dangerous.
So, not looking to trade out the gate.

772
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
So, not looking to trade out the gate.
 

773
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,110
So, not looking to trade out the gate.
If they flush this out the gate, they're

774
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
If they flush this out the gate, they're
 

775
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,950
If they flush this out the gate, they're
going to probably do it without me.

776
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
going to probably do it without me.
 

777
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,710
going to probably do it without me.
But, uh, yeah, all time frames currently

778
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
But, uh, yeah, all time frames currently
 

779
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,510
But, uh, yeah, all time frames currently
bearish, selling down, but we're in a

780
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,520
bearish, selling down, but we're in a
 

781
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,390
bearish, selling down, but we're in a
bit of a range, but overall momentum's

782
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
bit of a range, but overall momentum's
 

783
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,310
bit of a range, but overall momentum's
been bearish.

784
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
been bearish.
 

785
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,590
been bearish.
So, good luck, folks. If you're one of

786
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
So, good luck, folks. If you're one of

So, good luck, folks. If you're one of
the people that's looking to trade the

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
the people that's looking to trade the

So all of the mag gapping down other

00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
So all of the mag gapping down other
 

795
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,350
So all of the mag gapping down other
than Google which is 350%

796
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
than Google which is 350%
 

797
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,669
than Google which is 350%
up right now like we talked about

798
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
up right now like we talked about
 

799
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,390
up right now like we talked about
Burkshire and Hatheraway Warren Buffett

800
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
Burkshire and Hatheraway Warren Buffett
 

801
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,390
Burkshire and Hatheraway Warren Buffett
buying into that selling his position in

buying into that selling his position in
 

803
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,470
buying into that selling his position in
Apple buying into Google that happened

804
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
Apple buying into Google that happened
 

805
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,149
Apple buying into Google that happened
probably he probably started buying

806
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
probably he probably started buying
 

807
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,270
probably he probably started buying
straight after that uh

808
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
straight after that uh
 

809
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,549
straight after that uh
uh decision from the courts to allow

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
uh decision from the courts to allow
 

811
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,909
uh decision from the courts to allow
them to keep everything together

812
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
them to keep everything together
 

813
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,830
them to keep everything together

So, flushing down here. You might get

818
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
So, flushing down here. You might get
 

819
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,630
So, flushing down here. You might get
followed through all the way down. We'll

820
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
followed through all the way down. We'll
 

821
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,390
followed through all the way down. We'll
have to see. Google's still running

822
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
have to see. Google's still running
 

823
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,669
have to see. Google's still running
upside.

824
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,679

 

825
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,710

And this is going to be tough because

826
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
And this is going to be tough because
 

827
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,029
And this is going to be tough because
I've lost location. All right. Into a

828
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
I've lost location. All right. Into a
 

829
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,510
I've lost location. All right. Into a
little bit of a bump here. This is where

830
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
little bit of a bump here. This is where
 

831
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,390
little bit of a bump here. This is where
we started to find a little bit of a bid

832
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
we started to find a little bit of a bid
 

833
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,230
we started to find a little bit of a bid
on Friday into these uh 60s down to

834
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
on Friday into these uh 60s down to
 

835
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,870
on Friday into these uh 60s down to
900s. So, if you were short, I would say

836
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
900s. So, if you were short, I would say
 

837
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,390
900s. So, if you were short, I would say
it wouldn't be a bad idea to cover a

838
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
it wouldn't be a bad idea to cover a
 

839
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,830
it wouldn't be a bad idea to cover a
little bit here.

840
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
little bit here.
 

841
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,310
little bit here.
There was a little bump here on Friday.

842
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
There was a little bump here on Friday.
 

843
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,590
There was a little bump here on Friday.
There you go. They're starting to cover

844
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
There you go. They're starting to cover
 

845
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,190
There you go. They're starting to cover
into it. So, probably should mark that

846
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
into it. So, probably should mark that
 

847
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,870
into it. So, probably should mark that
out. It's right here. You can see this

848
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
out. It's right here. You can see this
 

849
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,230
out. It's right here. You can see this
cluster here where we found a bump

850
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
cluster here where we found a bump
 

851
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,710
cluster here where we found a bump
on the profile right there. There you

852
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
on the profile right there. There you
 

853
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,110
on the profile right there. There you
go.

854
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
go.
 

855
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,590
go.
I'm actually going to remove that one.

856
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600

 

857
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:47,669

Just give this a chance to settle down.

858
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679

That thing is absolutely ripping faces.
Right. And there you go. So that bump

880
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
Right. And there you go. So that bump
 

881
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,390
Right. And there you go. So that bump
off uh Friday catching a bid so far.

We've already gone through the New York

884
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
We've already gone through the New York
 

885
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,630
We've already gone through the New York
open. Where's my New York open print.

886
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
open. Where's my New York open print.
 

887
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,630
open. Where's my New York open print.
Why am I not seeing that? Is it because

888
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
Why am I not seeing that? Is it because
 

889
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,710
Why am I not seeing that? Is it because
I'm not on a one minute? There we go. So

890
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm not on a one minute? There we go. So
 

891
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,070
I'm not on a one minute? There we go. So
already through the New York open print.

892
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
already through the New York open print.
 

893
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,830
already through the New York open print.
Coming back to potentially close this

894
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
Coming back to potentially close this
 

895
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,390
Coming back to potentially close this
gap straight away, I would say. Then we

896
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
gap straight away, I would say. Then we
 

897
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,990
gap straight away, I would say. Then we
can see what we do. But already

898
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
can see what we do. But already
 

899
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,750
can see what we do. But already
reclaiming previous day value area low.

900
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
reclaiming previous day value area low.
 

901
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,350
reclaiming previous day value area low.
So look below and fail. So potential

902
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
So look below and fail. So potential
 

903
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,350
So look below and fail. So potential
range rotation back up previous day

904
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
range rotation back up previous day
 

905
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,710
range rotation back up previous day
point of control, previous day value

906
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
point of control, previous day value
 

907
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,190
point of control, previous day value
area high after a gap fill. I'm not

908
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
area high after a gap fill. I'm not
 

909
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,710
area high after a gap fill. I'm not
particularly interested in this market

910
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
particularly interested in this market
 

911
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,669
particularly interested in this market
right now. I think it's uh somewhat

912
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
right now. I think it's uh somewhat
 

913
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,990
right now. I think it's uh somewhat
dangerous in this market at the moment.

914
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
dangerous in this market at the moment.
 

915
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,350
dangerous in this market at the moment.
I think we're going to go into major

916
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
I think we're going to go into major
 

917
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,669
I think we're going to go into major
range rotation.

918
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
range rotation.
 

919
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,270
range rotation.
That trigger through New York open. That

920
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
That trigger through New York open. That
 

921
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,549
That trigger through New York open. That
was probably your long while I was

922
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
was probably your long while I was
 

923
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,230
was probably your long while I was
giving you that readout. But there we

924
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
giving you that readout. But there we
 

925
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:07,110
giving you that readout. But there we
go.

926
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120

 

927
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,870

Let's see. 2070. See if catches a bid

928
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
Let's see. 2070. See if catches a bid
 

929
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,070
Let's see. 2070. See if catches a bid
there. So, you're probably going to gap

930
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
there. So, you're probably going to gap
 

931
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,310
there. So, you're probably going to gap
fill here.

932
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
fill here.
 

933
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,149
fill here.
It's good for a gap fill here at the

934
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
It's good for a gap fill here at the
 

935
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:43,110
It's good for a gap fill here at the
moment.

936
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120

 

937
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,870

Sorry folks, just having to change a few

Sorry folks, just having to change a few
 

939
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,909
Sorry folks, just having to change a few

961
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,710
New York low and the blue line next to
the previous day value area low. So look

962
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
the previous day value area low. So look
 

963
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,390
the previous day value area low. So look
below and fail just like we had at the

964
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
below and fail just like we had at the
 

965
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,750
below and fail just like we had at the
top side. So think about what we did in

966
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
top side. So think about what we did in
 

967
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,190
top side. So think about what we did in
London. We looked above previous day

968
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
London. We looked above previous day
 

969
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,029
London. We looked above previous day
value area high failed. We came back

970
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
value area high failed. We came back
 

971
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,390
value area high failed. We came back
down to the other side of value. Look

972
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
down to the other side of value. Look
 

973
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,430
down to the other side of value. Look
below it failed. This is uh hinting to

974
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
below it failed. This is uh hinting to
 

975
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,710
below it failed. This is uh hinting to
you that we're going to go into range

976
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
you that we're going to go into range
 

977
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,110
you that we're going to go into range
rotation. All right. We're trading

978
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
rotation. All right. We're trading
 

979
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,909
rotation. All right. We're trading
between each edge from Friday based on

980
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
between each edge from Friday based on
 

981
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,390
between each edge from Friday based on
value. So we're in a range rotating

982
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,400
value. So we're in a range rotating
 

983
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,070
value. So we're in a range rotating
market. It's telling you we're in a

984
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
market. It's telling you we're in a
 

985
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,909
market. It's telling you we're in a
range rotation market because it's

986
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
range rotation market because it's
 

987
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,750
range rotation market because it's
looked both sides and failed. Until we

988
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
looked both sides and failed. Until we
 

989
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,669
looked both sides and failed. Until we
get outside of that and we start, you

990
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
get outside of that and we start, you
 

991
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,590
get outside of that and we start, you
know, staying bullish or staying heavy

992
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
know, staying bullish or staying heavy
 

993
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,870
know, staying bullish or staying heavy
outside of it, then we will remain in a

994
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
outside of it, then we will remain in a
 

995
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,950
outside of it, then we will remain in a
liquidity building process, which as you

996
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
liquidity building process, which as you
 

997
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,430
liquidity building process, which as you
well know are my least favorite trades.

998
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
well know are my least favorite trades.
 

999
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,269
well know are my least favorite trades.
That's what we did for most of the time

1001
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,950
That's what we did for most of the time
last week. This is how we build

1002
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
last week. This is how we build
 

1003
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,549
last week. This is how we build
liquidity for bigger moves. And it would

1004
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
liquidity for bigger moves. And it would
 

1005
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,789
liquidity for bigger moves. And it would
not surprise me, folks, if we do this

1006
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
not surprise me, folks, if we do this
 

1007
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,029
not surprise me, folks, if we do this
all the way until Nvidia earnings. It

1008
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
all the way until Nvidia earnings. It
 

1009
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,149
all the way until Nvidia earnings. It
really wouldn't. if they want to build

1010
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
really wouldn't. if they want to build
 

1011
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,990
really wouldn't. if they want to build
liquidity out for the next three

1012
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
liquidity out for the next three
 

1013
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,230
liquidity out for the next three
sessions, it wouldn't surprise me.

1014
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
sessions, it wouldn't surprise me.
 

1015
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,470
sessions, it wouldn't surprise me.

Okay, so where are we looking at? Well,
 

1083
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,430
Okay, so where are we looking at? Well,
previous week value area low currently

1084
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
previous week value area low currently
 

1085
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,149
previous week value area low currently
sitting at 25180. Previous day point of

Those are probably some interesting

1090
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
Those are probably some interesting
 

1091
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,549
Those are probably some interesting
levels. We've got an old VWOP up there,

1092
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:46,559
levels. We've got an old VWOP up there,
 

1093
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,269
levels. We've got an old VWOP up there,
24-hour VWAP and lower time frame. So,

1094
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279
24-hour VWAP and lower time frame. So,
 

1095
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,269
24-hour VWAP and lower time frame. So,
we're probably bullish in a rotation up

1096
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
we're probably bullish in a rotation up
 

1097
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,710
we're probably bullish in a rotation up
to there. And then if it's going to

1098
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
to there. And then if it's going to
 

1099
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,230
to there. And then if it's going to
reclaim, we're probably going to go all

1100
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,240
reclaim, we're probably going to go all
 

1101
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,990
reclaim, we're probably going to go all
the way up to previous day value high to

1102
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000
the way up to previous day value high to
 

1103
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,669
the way up to previous day value high to
be quite honest because we've gone

1104
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
be quite honest because we've gone
 

1105
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,190
be quite honest because we've gone
straight down like we talked about

1106
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
straight down like we talked about
 

1107
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,070
straight down like we talked about
lacked structure. How we operate here

1108
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080
lacked structure. How we operate here
 

1109
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,230
lacked structure. How we operate here
and here now become important. But I

1110
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240
and here now become important. But I
 

1111
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,830
and here now become important. But I
would say you're better off playing the

1112
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:05,840
would say you're better off playing the
 

1113
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,669
would say you're better off playing the
edges. That was probably while I was

1114
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
edges. That was probably while I was
 

1115
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,110
edges. That was probably while I was
giving you the readouts. Unfortunately,

1116
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
giving you the readouts. Unfortunately,
 

1117
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,710
giving you the readouts. Unfortunately,
that was your buy opportunity. Sorry,

1118
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
that was your buy opportunity. Sorry,
 

1119
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,070
that was your buy opportunity. Sorry,
folks. Happened so quick this morning.

1120
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,080
folks. Happened so quick this morning.
 

1121
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,669
folks. Happened so quick this morning.
And if you did buy it, then you want to

1122
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
And if you did buy it, then you want to
 

1123
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,590
And if you did buy it, then you want to
be locking in some profits as we move

1124
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
be locking in some profits as we move
 

1125
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,190
be locking in some profits as we move
towards this previous day point of

1126
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,200
towards this previous day point of
 

1127
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,029
towards this previous day point of
control. So, uh 160, 180, those are big

1128
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:25,039
control. So, uh 160, 180, those are big
 

1129
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,350
control. So, uh 160, 180, those are big
levels. If you get consistent buying

1130
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,360
levels. If you get consistent buying
 

1131
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,789
levels. If you get consistent buying
through those levels, then you can look

1132
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
through those levels, then you can look
 

1133
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,669
through those levels, then you can look
for um what's that? 290s

1134
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:35,679

 

1135
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,310

so far seeing big old squeeze back up.

1136
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
so far seeing big old squeeze back up.
 

1137
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,310
so far seeing big old squeeze back up.
So they bought value. Buyers are saying,

1138
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
So they bought value. Buyers are saying,
 

1139
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,029
So they bought value. Buyers are saying,
"Hey, we're not going to lose Friday's

1140
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
"Hey, we're not going to lose Friday's
 

1141
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,789
"Hey, we're not going to lose Friday's
value right now. We're staying inside.

1142
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
value right now. We're staying inside.
 

1143
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,710
value right now. We're staying inside.
We're moving so quick. Bookmap cannot

1144
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
We're moving so quick. Bookmap cannot
 

1145
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,269
We're moving so quick. Bookmap cannot
keep up right now."

1146
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:49,279
keep up right now."
 

1147
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,029
keep up right now."
So already 220 points off those lows. We

1148
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
So already 220 points off those lows. We
 

1149
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,230
So already 220 points off those lows. We
are 7 minutes into the session, folks,

1150
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,240
are 7 minutes into the session, folks,
 

1151
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,029
are 7 minutes into the session, folks,
which means we found a bid at the end of

1152
00:27:59,029 --> 00:27:59,039
which means we found a bid at the end of
 

1153
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,230
which means we found a bid at the end of
minute one and we have uh ripped 222

1154
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
minute one and we have uh ripped 222
 

1155
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,470
minute one and we have uh ripped 222
points since then.

1156
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
points since then.
 

1157
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,389
points since then.
Absolute wild moves, but that's where

1158
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
Absolute wild moves, but that's where
 

1159
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,549
Absolute wild moves, but that's where
we're at. Okay, into previous week value

1160
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
we're at. Okay, into previous week value
 

1161
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,630
we're at. Okay, into previous week value
area high, previous day point of control

1162
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640
area high, previous day point of control
 

1163
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,870
area high, previous day point of control
here.

1164
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:12,880
here.
 

1165
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,870
here.
And uh these are very very very

1166
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:14,880
And uh these are very very very
 

1167
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,070
And uh these are very very very
sensitive areas. You do not sort of uh

1168
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
sensitive areas. You do not sort of uh
 

1169
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,070
sensitive areas. You do not sort of uh
want to be holding longs too much past

1170
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
want to be holding longs too much past
 

1171
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,510
want to be holding longs too much past
this or at least you want to be taking

1172
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,520
this or at least you want to be taking
 

1173
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,350
this or at least you want to be taking
some profits. So might very well fail

1174
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
some profits. So might very well fail
 

1175
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,350
some profits. So might very well fail
here.

1176
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360

 

1177
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,870

This is a big squeeze out. And how we

1178
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
This is a big squeeze out. And how we
 

1179
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,789
This is a big squeeze out. And how we
act here now becomes important. So look,

1180
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:30,799
act here now becomes important. So look,
 

1181
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,470
act here now becomes important. So look,
we've just gone from previous days value

1182
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
we've just gone from previous days value
 

1183
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,190
we've just gone from previous days value
look below and fail up to previous week

1184
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
look below and fail up to previous week
 

1185
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,149
look below and fail up to previous week
value area low. All right. If we reject

1186
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,159
value area low. All right. If we reject
 

1187
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,470
value area low. All right. If we reject
previous week value area low, they're

1188
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
previous week value area low, they're
 

1189
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,669
previous week value area low, they're
going to come down and retest some of

1190
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
going to come down and retest some of
 

1191
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,350
going to come down and retest some of
these key levels again because now we're

1192
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
these key levels again because now we're
 

1193
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,350
these key levels again because now we're
fighting between the weekly value and

1194
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
fighting between the weekly value and
 

1195
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,070
fighting between the weekly value and
the daily values.

1196
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,080
the daily values.
 

1197
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:58,630
the daily values.
Very, very key how we act now.

1198
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640

 

1199
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,909

Spy into its view up or sorry ES into

00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
Spy into its view up or sorry ES into
 

1201
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,269
Spy into its view up or sorry ES into
its view up here. Spies are actually

00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
its view up here. Spies are actually
 

1203
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,909
its view up here. Spies are actually
already through it as are the Q's. Big

1204
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
already through it as are the Q's. Big
 

1205
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,950
already through it as are the Q's. Big
still trading downside

1206
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
still trading downside
 

1207
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,470
still trading downside
and we are holding pretty well here.

1208
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
and we are holding pretty well here.
 

1209
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,149
and we are holding pretty well here.
It's pretty impressive. It's a decent

1210
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
It's pretty impressive. It's a decent
 

1211
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,190
It's pretty impressive. It's a decent
hold. Maybe if they can get a bid

1212
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
hold. Maybe if they can get a bid
 

1213
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,029
hold. Maybe if they can get a bid
through uh previous week if you're still

1214
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039
through uh previous week if you're still
 

1215
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,870
through uh previous week if you're still
long you might even get all the way up

1216
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:18,880
long you might even get all the way up
 

1217
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,389
long you might even get all the way up
here. But, uh, what I would say is if

1218
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
here. But, uh, what I would say is if
 

1219
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,630
here. But, uh, what I would say is if
you took that look below and fail, you

1220
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
you took that look below and fail, you
 

1221
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,389
you took that look below and fail, you
need to be taking some money off the

1222
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,399
need to be taking some money off the
 

1223
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,070
need to be taking some money off the
table into these moves. All right? You

1224
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
table into these moves. All right? You
 

1225
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,430
table into these moves. All right? You
need to be taking money off the table

1226
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
need to be taking money off the table
 

1227
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,789
need to be taking money off the table
into these moves because you're starting

1228
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
into these moves because you're starting
 

1229
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,430
into these moves because you're starting
to see some profit taking here.

1230
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440

 

1231
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,590

No trade for me. I'm missed that giving

1232
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:35,600
No trade for me. I'm missed that giving
 

1233
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,590
No trade for me. I'm missed that giving
you a readout. I'm not even convinced I

1234
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,600
you a readout. I'm not even convinced I
 

1235
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,950
you a readout. I'm not even convinced I
would have necessarily taken it. If I

1236
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
would have necessarily taken it. If I
 

1237
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,070
would have necessarily taken it. If I
did, it would have been small size

1238
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
did, it would have been small size
 

1239
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,830
did, it would have been small size
because, as we know, range rotation, my

1240
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:41,840
because, as we know, range rotation, my
 

1241
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,830
because, as we know, range rotation, my
least favorite trades. This is a

1242
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
least favorite trades. This is a
 

1243
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,149
least favorite trades. This is a
volatile market. We we can have, like we

1244
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
volatile market. We we can have, like we
 

1245
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,830
volatile market. We we can have, like we
said, we can have range rotation of 300

1246
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
said, we can have range rotation of 300
 

1247
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,389
said, we can have range rotation of 300
plus points here, folks.

1248
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399

Is that right? Let me check that out. I

1314
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:18,640
Is that right? Let me check that out. I
 

1315
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,029
Is that right? Let me check that out. I
think it is. Yeah. Previous day high is

1319
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,870

So some strong selling came in there and

1320
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
So some strong selling came in there and
 

1321
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,710
So some strong selling came in there and
they did not force this market lower. So

1322
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720
they did not force this market lower. So
 

1323
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,230
they did not force this market lower. So
they might get caught here if they want

1324
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,240
they might get caught here if they want
 

1325
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,029
they might get caught here if they want
to resqueeze this higher. They just

1326
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039
to resqueeze this higher. They just
 

1327
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,110
to resqueeze this higher. They just
spent the last 1 2 3 4 5 minutes trying

1328
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
spent the last 1 2 3 4 5 minutes trying
 

1329
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,870
spent the last 1 2 3 4 5 minutes trying
to sell. Haven't moved lower yet. So

1330
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:40,880
to sell. Haven't moved lower yet. So
 

1331
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,630
to sell. Haven't moved lower yet. So
just be aware of that. It's a battle

1332
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:42,640
just be aware of that. It's a battle
 

1333
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,630
just be aware of that. It's a battle
here as we trade into that previous week

1334
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,640
here as we trade into that previous week
 

1335
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,230
here as we trade into that previous week
value area low.

1336
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240

 

1337
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,750

And the longer we're here, the worse it

1338
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:49,760
And the longer we're here, the worse it
 

1339
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,310
And the longer we're here, the worse it
is for bears. Um because they would have

1340
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
is for bears. Um because they would have
 

1341
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,070
is for bears. Um because they would have
wanted a snap back down and they're not

1342
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,080
wanted a snap back down and they're not
 

1343
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,870
wanted a snap back down and they're not
seeing it yet. So back down to V up we

1344
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
seeing it yet. So back down to V up we
 

1345
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,389
seeing it yet. So back down to V up we
go. Back down to previous day point of

1346
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:58,399
go. Back down to previous day point of
 

1347
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,029
go. Back down to previous day point of
control we go. They're trying to force

1348
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
control we go. They're trying to force
 

1349
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,830
control we go. They're trying to force
the hand here. Still being absorbed so

1350
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:03,840
the hand here. Still being absorbed so
 

1351
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,789
the hand here. Still being absorbed so
far

1352
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
far
 

1353
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,549
far
again. No position for me yet. Just

1354
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:08,559
again. No position for me yet. Just
 

1355
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,830
again. No position for me yet. Just
waiting here. We can build out. If we

1356
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
waiting here. We can build out. If we
 

1357
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,430
waiting here. We can build out. If we
build out a shelf, I'll be interested or

1358
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,440
build out a shelf, I'll be interested or
 

1359
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,870
build out a shelf, I'll be interested or
something. But right now, just wondering

1360
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
something. But right now, just wondering
 

1361
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,110
something. But right now, just wondering
how big a rotation they're going to do.

1362
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,120
how big a rotation they're going to do.
 

1363
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,029
how big a rotation they're going to do.
Rejecting previous week value area low

Rejecting previous week value area low
 

1365
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,789
Rejecting previous week value area low
for now. Starting to see bears come in

1366
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799
for now. Starting to see bears come in
 

1367
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,190
for now. Starting to see bears come in
here with more strength.

here with more strength.
 

1369
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,149

We have an imbalance here into sort of
 

1371
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,029
We have an imbalance here into sort of
39 to 28. This is sort of the edge where

1372
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:29,039
39 to 28. This is sort of the edge where
 

1373
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,710
39 to 28. This is sort of the edge where
bulls will want to defend if they're

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
bulls will want to defend if they're

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:30,630
My wife's definitely going. It will just
be down to flights and timings for me.

1404
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640

 

1405
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,990

Okay, so we're back into this bump.

1406
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,000
Okay, so we're back into this bump.
 

1407
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,190
Okay, so we're back into this bump.
Look, make sure you're zooming out

1408
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
Look, make sure you're zooming out
 

1409
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,269
Look, make sure you're zooming out
higher time frame.

1410
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
higher time frame.
 

1411
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,990
higher time frame.
Let's uh Where are you guys? Make sure

1412
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
Let's uh Where are you guys? Make sure
 

1413
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,430
Let's uh Where are you guys? Make sure
you're zooming out higher time frame.

1414
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,440
you're zooming out higher time frame.
 

1415
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,789
you're zooming out higher time frame.
What we're looking at right now, we've

1416
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
What we're looking at right now, we've
 

1417
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,549
What we're looking at right now, we've
traded back into this thick area, right?

1418
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:44,559
traded back into this thick area, right?
 

1419
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,830
traded back into this thick area, right?
This is where we looked above and

1420
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
This is where we looked above and
 

1421
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,230
This is where we looked above and
failed. If we come back to here and sell

1422
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
failed. If we come back to here and sell
 

1423
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,870
failed. If we come back to here and sell
again, we go back range rotation again.

1424
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
again, we go back range rotation again.
 

1425
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,549
again, we go back range rotation again.
If we look above and fail, we go back

1426
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
If we look above and fail, we go back
 

1427
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,230
If we look above and fail, we go back
range rotation again. But if we can

1428
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,240
range rotation again. But if we can
 

1429
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,149
range rotation again. But if we can
start building liquidity above here,

1430
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,159
start building liquidity above here,
 

1431
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,269
start building liquidity above here,
right? This is why I'm trying to be

1432
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,279
right? This is why I'm trying to be
 

1433
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,669
right? This is why I'm trying to be
neutral. They might want to come all the

1434
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
neutral. They might want to come all the
 

1435
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,509
neutral. They might want to come all the
way up and revisit this up here into

1436
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
way up and revisit this up here into
 

1437
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,990
way up and revisit this up here into
500s because we're thin in here, aren't

1438
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
500s because we're thin in here, aren't
 

1439
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,590
500s because we're thin in here, aren't
we? Think about what we did Thursday.

1440
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,600
we? Think about what we did Thursday.
 

1441
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,990
we? Think about what we did Thursday.
That's a thin move, right? Bears are

1442
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
That's a thin move, right? Bears are
 

1443
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,230
That's a thin move, right? Bears are
trying to do this. If they don't do that

1444
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
trying to do this. If they don't do that
 

1445
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,790
trying to do this. If they don't do that
and bulls get above and defend, then the

1446
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:12,800
and bulls get above and defend, then the
 

1447
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,790
and bulls get above and defend, then the
next squeeze into here is possible. We

1448
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:14,800
next squeeze into here is possible. We
 

1449
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,349
next squeeze into here is possible. We
cannot rule that out. Cannot rule those

1450
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:17,359
cannot rule that out. Cannot rule those
 

1451
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,389
cannot rule that out. Cannot rule those
moves out. That's why I'm trying to be

1452
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,399
moves out. That's why I'm trying to be
 

1453
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,629
moves out. That's why I'm trying to be
neutral. Like I think bears have an

1454
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
neutral. Like I think bears have an
 

1455
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,589
neutral. Like I think bears have an
edge, but uh they can lose that edge if

1456
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:23,599
edge, but uh they can lose that edge if
 

1457
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,349
edge, but uh they can lose that edge if
they can't defend levels, right? Just

1458
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:25,359
they can't defend levels, right? Just
 

1459
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:33,669
they can't defend levels, right? Just
like we talked about in the newsletter.

1460
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:33,679

 

1461
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,030

Stronger selling back down towards this

1462
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,040
Stronger selling back down towards this
 

1463
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,430
Stronger selling back down towards this
imbalance. We're building out a sort of

1464
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,440
imbalance. We're building out a sort of
 

1465
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,310
imbalance. We're building out a sort of
sideways range here. Let's get uh this

1466
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
sideways range here. Let's get uh this
 

1467
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,230
sideways range here. Let's get uh this
on before I forget.

1468
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,240

 

1469
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,950

No, you don't want to do it. Come on.

1470
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:46,960
No, you don't want to do it. Come on.
 

1471
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,869
No, you don't want to do it. Come on.
There you go.

1472
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
There you go.
 

1473
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,909
There you go.
It's building out some volume here.

1474
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
It's building out some volume here.
 

1475
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,829
It's building out some volume here.
This is where bulls last came in and

1476
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
This is where bulls last came in and
 

1477
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,589
This is where bulls last came in and
defended these lows. Remember, there's a

1478
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:55,599
defended these lows. Remember, there's a
 

1479
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,510
defended these lows. Remember, there's a
little imbalance underneath here. All

1480
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
little imbalance underneath here. All
 

1481
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,270
little imbalance underneath here. All
depends if these bears want to sell

1482
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,280
depends if these bears want to sell
 

1483
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,349
depends if these bears want to sell
through this now and take us back down

1484
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
through this now and take us back down
 

1485
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,190
through this now and take us back down
or if bulls are going to defend it yet

1486
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
or if bulls are going to defend it yet
 

1487
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,190
or if bulls are going to defend it yet
again.

1488
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,200
again.
 

1489
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,990
again.
We are starting to build out this range

1490
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
We are starting to build out this range
 

1491
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,550
We are starting to build out this range
up here right now.

1492
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
up here right now.
 

1493
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,230
up here right now.
Okay. And if they fail this, we can come

1494
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,240
Okay. And if they fail this, we can come
 

1495
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,589
Okay. And if they fail this, we can come
right back to here. If they look below

1496
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:13,599
right back to here. If they look below
 

1497
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,510
right back to here. If they look below
and reclaim like they have twice already

1498
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
and reclaim like they have twice already
 

1499
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,109
and reclaim like they have twice already
and this is looks like third attempt to

1500
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
and this is looks like third attempt to
 

1501
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,870
and this is looks like third attempt to
hold it because we have an imbalance

1502
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:18,880
hold it because we have an imbalance
 

1503
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,430
hold it because we have an imbalance
here right on the order flow. There is a

1504
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
here right on the order flow. There is a
 

1505
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,510
here right on the order flow. There is a
big imbalance on this spike candle right

1506
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
big imbalance on this spike candle right
 

1507
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,270
big imbalance on this spike candle right
here which bulls are trying to defend.

1508
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,280
here which bulls are trying to defend.
 

1509
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,030
here which bulls are trying to defend.
So I'm just being patient overall right

1510
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,040
So I'm just being patient overall right
 

1511
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,829
So I'm just being patient overall right
now. We're in range rotation. Bulls have

1512
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:29,839
now. We're in range rotation. Bulls have
 

1513
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,829
now. We're in range rotation. Bulls have
taken control of those lows. So not

1514
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:31,839
taken control of those lows. So not
 

1515
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,910
taken control of those lows. So not
really looking for a bearish move unless

1516
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
really looking for a bearish move unless
 

1517
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,510
really looking for a bearish move unless
we see a big breakdown. And I'm not

1518
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
we see a big breakdown. And I'm not
 

1519
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,190
we see a big breakdown. And I'm not
going to buy high either. Unfortunately

1520
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,200
going to buy high either. Unfortunately
 

1521
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,349
going to buy high either. Unfortunately
I probably missed it. remember might

1522
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
I probably missed it. remember might
 

1523
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,790
I probably missed it. remember might
look like, "Oh, mate, you've only missed

1524
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:40,800
look like, "Oh, mate, you've only missed
 

1525
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,630
look like, "Oh, mate, you've only missed
15 minutes." Hey, in those 15 minutes,

1526
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
15 minutes." Hey, in those 15 minutes,
 

1527
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,069
15 minutes." Hey, in those 15 minutes,
we've moved 244 points.

1528
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079

 

1529
00:35:48,079 --> 00:36:08,470

Sounds good, Otus.

1530
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480

 

1531
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,190

It's testing these 200s.

1532
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200

 

1533
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,109

So, we sort of have an edge of volume

1534
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:15,119
So, we sort of have an edge of volume
 

1535
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,349
So, we sort of have an edge of volume
into 250s.

1536
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:17,359
into 250s.
 

1537
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,270
into 250s.
Uh, I know previous day value area highs

1538
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
Uh, I know previous day value area highs
 

1539
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,109
Uh, I know previous day value area highs
above that, but 250s looks like a big

1540
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:21,119
above that, but 250s looks like a big
 

1541
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,910
above that, but 250s looks like a big
level on the weekly.

1542
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920

 

1543
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,750

Just have to see. We'll have to see how

1544
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
Just have to see. We'll have to see how
 

1545
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:39,270
Just have to see. We'll have to see how
we go.

1546
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,280

 

1547
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,270

Nothing for me yet, folks. This looks

1548
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
Nothing for me yet, folks. This looks
 

1549
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,710
Nothing for me yet, folks. This looks
bullish, though. They've built, they've

1550
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
bullish, though. They've built, they've
 

1551
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,270
bullish, though. They've built, they've
trapped. Bears got caught twice there

1552
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280
trapped. Bears got caught twice there
 

1553
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,109
trapped. Bears got caught twice there
trying to force the breakdown in that

1554
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:47,119
trying to force the breakdown in that
 

1555
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,670
trying to force the breakdown in that
imbalance. And this might well complete

1556
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:49,680
imbalance. And this might well complete
 

1557
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,030
imbalance. And this might well complete
this rotation up to here now.

1558
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,040
this rotation up to here now.
 

1559
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,790
this rotation up to here now.
So, up to here, previous day. If you're

1560
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
So, up to here, previous day. If you're
 

1561
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,470
So, up to here, previous day. If you're
still long off this under here, uh maybe

1562
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
still long off this under here, uh maybe
 

1563
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,069
still long off this under here, uh maybe
you get lucky and you get all the way up

1564
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:00,079
you get lucky and you get all the way up
 

1565
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,030
you get lucky and you get all the way up
into this now.

1566
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,040
into this now.
 

1567
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,190
into this now.
So, previous day high and previous day

1568
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,200
So, previous day high and previous day
 

1569
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,390
So, previous day high and previous day
value high, try and get up towards 300.

1570
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
value high, try and get up towards 300.
 

1571
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,510
value high, try and get up towards 300.
It's still long. That's where you want

1572
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,520
It's still long. That's where you want
 

1573
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,109
It's still long. That's where you want
to try and get up towards. MAG is

1574
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
to try and get up towards. MAG is
 

1575
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,270
to try and get up towards. MAG is
starting to push here. So, Tesla now

1576
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,280
starting to push here. So, Tesla now
 

1577
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,910
starting to push here. So, Tesla now
1.72% green. Microsoft's now gone green.

1581
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,349
0.04 up% up there. Only just green. Same
as Meta only just gone green. Google the

1582
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
as Meta only just gone green. Google the
 

1583
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,710
as Meta only just gone green. Google the

1585
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,270

Uh Apple and Amazon just under 1% down

1586
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
Uh Apple and Amazon just under 1% down
 

1587
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,430
Uh Apple and Amazon just under 1% down
on the day. Nvidia just over 1% down on

1589
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,670
on the day. Nvidia just over 1% down on
the day. So you've got a mixed bag here,

1590
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
the day. So you've got a mixed bag here,
 

1591
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,870
the day. So you've got a mixed bag here,
folks. Right, you've got three of them

1592
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:32,880
folks. Right, you've got three of them
 

1593
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,510
folks. Right, you've got three of them
about a 1% down, two of them flat, and

1594
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,520
about a 1% down, two of them flat, and
 

1595
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,910
about a 1% down, two of them flat, and
two of them pushing.

1596
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
two of them pushing.
 

1597
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,990
two of them pushing.
And VIX is still falling back inside.

1598
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000
And VIX is still falling back inside.
 

1599
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,150
And VIX is still falling back inside.
Like I said, it can very well range

1600
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,160
Like I said, it can very well range
 

1601
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,150
Like I said, it can very well range
rotate today. It might look for this gap

1602
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
rotate today. It might look for this gap
 

1603
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,470
rotate today. It might look for this gap
fill on previous day low, which is what

1604
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,480
fill on previous day low, which is what
 

1605
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,150
fill on previous day low, which is what
sort of sitting 50% in the middle of,

1606
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,160
sort of sitting 50% in the middle of,
 

1607
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,069
sort of sitting 50% in the middle of,
but looks like it's coming back to earth

1608
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,079
but looks like it's coming back to earth
 

1609
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,230
but looks like it's coming back to earth
at the moment on the VIX. So why we

1610
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,240
at the moment on the VIX. So why we
 

1611
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,150
at the moment on the VIX. So why we
can't have too much bias and why we

1612
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,160
can't have too much bias and why we
 

1613
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,270
can't have too much bias and why we
talked about them this morning. Yes, I

1614
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,280
talked about them this morning. Yes, I
 

1615
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,630
talked about them this morning. Yes, I
would love to be bearish but the

1616
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:58,640
would love to be bearish but the
 

1617
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,470
would love to be bearish but the
location wasn't there. London had the

1618
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
location wasn't there. London had the
 

1619
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,109
location wasn't there. London had the
location. We looked below and we failed.

1620
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
location. We looked below and we failed.
 

1621
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,950
location. We looked below and we failed.
And that tells you rotational market.

1622
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
And that tells you rotational market.
 

1623
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,030
And that tells you rotational market.
So any of you caught it, you are sitting

1624
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
So any of you caught it, you are sitting
 

1625
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,030
So any of you caught it, you are sitting
very pretty right now. Very very pretty

1626
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040
very pretty right now. Very very pretty
 

1627
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:20,470
very pretty right now. Very very pretty

1628
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,480

 

1629
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,390

This is your next target. We get a bit

1630
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,400
This is your next target. We get a bit
 

1631
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,990
This is your next target. We get a bit
thicker up here as you can see the red

1632
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,000
thicker up here as you can see the red
 

1633
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,990
thicker up here as you can see the red
box, but if you can get up there, you'd

1634
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
box, but if you can get up there, you'd
 

1635
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:35,510
box, but if you can get up there, you'd
be very happy, I think.

they want to come all the way back for
 

1683
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,390
they want to come all the way back for

that, they can as well. I'd say, you
 

1685
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,030
that, they can as well. I'd say, you
know, you've had TP1, which was into

know, you've had TP1, which was into
 

1687
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,790
know, you've had TP1, which was into

this area here, previous day point

We're now bidding above that. So, your

1692
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:09,839
We're now bidding above that. So, your
 

1693
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,910
We're now bidding above that. So, your
next TP would be previous day value

1694
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
next TP would be previous day value
 

1695
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,510
next TP would be previous day value
high, previous day high, and then

1696
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,520
high, previous day high, and then
 

1697
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,430
high, previous day high, and then
GlobeEx and above that. Well, who knows?

1698
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
GlobeEx and above that. Well, who knows?
 

1699

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,270
Can't believe it. on on a Monday no news
day when everyone's waiting for

1714
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:33,280
day when everyone's waiting for
 

1715
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,349
day when everyone's waiting for
Wednesday. We uh could possibly do a 600

1716
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:35,359
Wednesday. We uh could possibly do a 600
 

1717
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,190
Wednesday. We uh could possibly do a 600
point move out the open.

1718
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,200
point move out the open.
 

1719
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,430
point move out the open.
[Laughter]

1720
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,440
[Laughter]
 

1721
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,069

There we go.
This is why you've got it doesn't matter

1724
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
This is why you've got it doesn't matter
 

1725
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,950
This is why you've got it doesn't matter
what you think, how mental the market

1726
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:46,960
what you think, how mental the market
 

1727
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,950
what you think, how mental the market
is. Uh you got to trade what's in front

1728
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
is. Uh you got to trade what's in front
 

1729

Nice contorted. Well done, mate. to 060
060 in here. Beautiful. Nice work.

060 in here. Beautiful. Nice work.
 

1735
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,230
060 in here. Beautiful. Nice work.
Okay, you're getting close.

1736
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,240

 

1737
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,230

You're getting close. They're trying to

1738
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,240
You're getting close. They're trying to
 

1739
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,390
You're getting close. They're trying to
find a bit of a bid in Nvidia, Amazon,

1740
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:12,400
find a bit of a bid in Nvidia, Amazon,
 

1741
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,990
find a bit of a bid in Nvidia, Amazon,
and Apple. Not Not yet, but they're

1742
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,000
and Apple. Not Not yet, but they're
 

1743
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,190
and Apple. Not Not yet, but they're
trying to. Uh Nvidia has clawed back

1744
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,200
trying to. Uh Nvidia has clawed back
 

1745
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,829
trying to. Uh Nvidia has clawed back
over 1% of its uh open so far. We'll

1746
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:21,839
over 1% of its uh open so far. We'll
 

1747
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,510
over 1% of its uh open so far. We'll
see.

1748
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,520

 

1749
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,109

There's probably a rotation back down

1750
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:29,119
There's probably a rotation back down
 

1751
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,630
There's probably a rotation back down
coming at some point. It's just uh when

1752
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:32,640
coming at some point. It's just uh when
 

1753
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,790
coming at some point. It's just uh when
when have they finished? And uh

1754
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:36,800
when have they finished? And uh
 

1755
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,150
when have they finished? And uh
you know me, I don't love

1756
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,160
you know me, I don't love
 

1757
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,710
you know me, I don't love
I don't love ranges and rotations and

1758
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:42,720
I don't love ranges and rotations and
 

1759
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,950
I don't love ranges and rotations and
stuff. And overall, this this is very

1760
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960
stuff. And overall, this this is very
 

1761
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,630
stuff. And overall, this this is very
very squeezy. This is like Friday, so I

1762
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
very squeezy. This is like Friday, so I
 

1763
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,030
very squeezy. This is like Friday, so I
don't want to be the same as Friday.

1764
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
don't want to be the same as Friday.
 

1765
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,349
don't want to be the same as Friday.
Looking to fade it. We had numerous

1766
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:51,359
Looking to fade it. We had numerous
 

1767
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,950
Looking to fade it. We had numerous
attempts Friday. Bulls stepped in. Bulls

1768
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
attempts Friday. Bulls stepped in. Bulls
 

1769
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,990
attempts Friday. Bulls stepped in. Bulls
are showing that they've stepped in

1770
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
are showing that they've stepped in
 

1771
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,030
are showing that they've stepped in
again now.

1772
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,040
again now.
 

1773
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,670
again now.
You could, well, not you could. I will

1774
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680
You could, well, not you could. I will
 

1775
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,750
You could, well, not you could. I will
argue that bulls have now put in a

1776
00:41:59,750 --> 00:41:59,760
argue that bulls have now put in a
 

1777
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,990
argue that bulls have now put in a
higher low on the hourly. They will need

1778
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,000
higher low on the hourly. They will need
 

1779
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,109
higher low on the hourly. They will need
to get a breakout above Globeex high and

1780
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:05,119
to get a breakout above Globeex high and
 

1781
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,950
to get a breakout above Globeex high and
above previous day high. And if they do

1782
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
above previous day high. And if they do
 

1783
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,990
above previous day high. And if they do
that, then we have to remain neutral

1784
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,000
that, then we have to remain neutral
 

1785
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,750
that, then we have to remain neutral
bias for the rest of the week until

1786
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:11,760
bias for the rest of the week until
 

1787
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,950
bias for the rest of the week until
there is a major major pivot.

1788
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:14,960
there is a major major pivot.
 

1789
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,589
there is a major major pivot.
And we basically what I'm saying is

1790
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:17,599
And we basically what I'm saying is
 

1791
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,589
And we basically what I'm saying is
above

1792
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:19,599
above
 

1793
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,670
above
previous day value area high, we're

1794
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:21,680
previous day value area high, we're
 

1795
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,670
previous day value area high, we're
going to go in range rotation to 500.

1796
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,680
going to go in range rotation to 500.
 

1797
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,950
going to go in range rotation to 500.
And then you're going to see liquidity

1798
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:24,960
And then you're going to see liquidity
 

1799
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,510
And then you're going to see liquidity
bu be built out between sort of 300,

1800
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,520
bu be built out between sort of 300,
 

1801
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,109
bu be built out between sort of 300,
250, 300 and 500. And in that area,

1802
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:31,119
250, 300 and 500. And in that area,
 

1803
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,430
250, 300 and 500. And in that area,
you're going to see a lot of traders uh

1804
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
you're going to see a lot of traders uh
 

1805
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,950
you're going to see a lot of traders uh
get very upset with each other because

1806
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:34,960
get very upset with each other because
 

1807
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,390
get very upset with each other because
you're going to see bears defending it

1808
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
you're going to see bears defending it
 

1809
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,950
you're going to see bears defending it
and bulls defending the lower side. And

1810
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
and bulls defending the lower side. And
 

1811
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,349
and bulls defending the lower side. And
we're not going to be in alignment on

1812
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:41,359
we're not going to be in alignment on
 

1813
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,990
we're not going to be in alignment on
multi-time frame. So what I'm looking at

1814
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
multi-time frame. So what I'm looking at
 

1815
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,829
multi-time frame. So what I'm looking at
that this morning, it's possible that

1816
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:45,839
that this morning, it's possible that
 

1817
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,430
that this morning, it's possible that
low this morning could form the start of

1818
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440
low this morning could form the start of
 

1819
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,950
low this morning could form the start of
a higher low. We don't know yet. It's

1820
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:48,960
a higher low. We don't know yet. It's
 

1821
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,670
a higher low. We don't know yet. It's
too early. But uh that's what they will

1822
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:51,680
too early. But uh that's what they will
 

1823
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,790
too early. But uh that's what they will
be looking to do.

1824
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:54,800
be looking to do.
 

1825
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,589
be looking to do.
More selling coming in here again. Do

1826
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
More selling coming in here again. Do
 

1827
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,829
More selling coming in here again. Do
they get their way? Some pretty big size

1828
00:42:59,829 --> 00:42:59,839
they get their way? Some pretty big size
 

1829
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,589
they get their way? Some pretty big size
coming in here on the tape.

1830
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
coming in here on the tape.
 

1831
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,109
coming in here on the tape.
Little bit of excess up there, but not a

1832
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:05,119
Little bit of excess up there, but not a
 

1833
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,470
Little bit of excess up there, but not a
lot. And I'm not sure they've completed

1834
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480
lot. And I'm not sure they've completed
 

1835
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,190
lot. And I'm not sure they've completed
their rotation. I think uh value is what

1836
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,200
their rotation. I think uh value is what
 

1837
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,390
their rotation. I think uh value is what
they want.

1838
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,400
they want.
 

1839
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,150
they want.
Value and previous day high looks like

1840
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
Value and previous day high looks like
 

1841
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:24,470
Value and previous day high looks like
what they want to me.

1842
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480

 

1843
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,230

big area here. We've started to get a

1844
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
big area here. We've started to get a
 

1845
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:34,150
big area here. We've started to get a
little bit denser here.

1846
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,160

 

1847
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,829

I'm not sure they're done with this.

I'm not sure they're done with this.
 

1849

I am not sure they're done with this
 

1851
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,950
I am not sure they're done with this
yet. Still seeing uh soaking on the tape

Here comes a little drive down.

Here comes a little drive down.
 

1857
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,109

I'm really not sure they're done with

I'm really not sure they're done with
 

1867
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,150
I'm really not sure they're done with
this. If they are, it might be a quick

1868
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,160
this. If they are, it might be a quick
 

1869
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,230
this. If they are, it might be a quick
wash that's soaked back off this level

1870
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
wash that's soaked back off this level
 

1871
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,990
wash that's soaked back off this level
because we built structure here now. So,

1872
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,000
because we built structure here now. So,
 

1873
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,670
because we built structure here now. So,
let in fact, let's draw this on for you.

1874
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:05,680
let in fact, let's draw this on for you.
 

1875
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,230
let in fact, let's draw this on for you.
So, you guys are ready.

1876
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,240
So, you guys are ready.
 

1877
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,109
So, you guys are ready.
Right, there's your structure.

1878
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
Right, there's your structure.
 

1879
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,950
Right, there's your structure.
And I'm still seeing soaking on the

1880
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
And I'm still seeing soaking on the
 

1881
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,309
And I'm still seeing soaking on the
tape. So, I'm just telling you what I'm

1882
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
tape. So, I'm just telling you what I'm
 

1883
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,910
tape. So, I'm just telling you what I'm
seeing. Again, no position for me, but

1884
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
seeing. Again, no position for me, but
 

1885
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,430
seeing. Again, no position for me, but
there is has been soaking on the tape

1886
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
there is has been soaking on the tape
 

1887
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,790
there is has been soaking on the tape
there. And you can see it again. Bears

1888
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:18,800
there. And you can see it again. Bears
 

1889
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,470
there. And you can see it again. Bears
tried to force their hand building

1890
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:20,480
tried to force their hand building
 

1891
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,790
tried to force their hand building
another sort of shelf here. I don't

1892
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
another sort of shelf here. I don't
 

1893
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,069
another sort of shelf here. I don't
think they've complete their rotation

1894
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
think they've complete their rotation
 

1895
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,589
think they've complete their rotation
yet. So I'm thinking I don't think

1896
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:25,599
yet. So I'm thinking I don't think
 

1897
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,589
yet. So I'm thinking I don't think
they're done that done yet. They want

1898
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:27,599
they're done that done yet. They want
 

1899
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,349
they're done that done yet. They want
value area high. Want previous day high.

1900
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
value area high. Want previous day high.
 

1901
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,190
value area high. Want previous day high.
Maybe they want GlobeEx. Like I said,

1902
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,200
Maybe they want GlobeEx. Like I said,
 

1903
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,510
Maybe they want GlobeEx. Like I said,
who knows? Maybe they want 500. I think

1904
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520
who knows? Maybe they want 500. I think
 

1905
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,790
who knows? Maybe they want 500. I think
it was Beu on Friday who was saying, can

1906
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:36,800
it was Beu on Friday who was saying, can
 

1907
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,109
it was Beu on Friday who was saying, can
they go 500? Maybe they do it. Structure

1908
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
they go 500? Maybe they do it. Structure
 

1909
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,190
they go 500? Maybe they do it. Structure
looks good. And you'd have to say she

1910
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:41,200
looks good. And you'd have to say she
 

1911
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,510
looks good. And you'd have to say she
looks right right now. I'm seeing

1912
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:43,520
looks right right now. I'm seeing
 

1913
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,069
looks right right now. I'm seeing
aggressive buying coming in. Microsoft

1914
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079
aggressive buying coming in. Microsoft
 

1915
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,910
aggressive buying coming in. Microsoft
gone back red. So the mixed bag

1916
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
gone back red. So the mixed bag
 

1917
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,710
gone back red. So the mixed bag
continues. VIX trying to find a little

1918
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,720
continues. VIX trying to find a little
 

1919
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,349
continues. VIX trying to find a little
bit of a bid, but I'm not convinced it's

1920
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:53,359
bit of a bid, but I'm not convinced it's
 

1921
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,270
bit of a bid, but I'm not convinced it's
come down low enough yet. But it's

1922
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,280
come down low enough yet. But it's
 

1923
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,430
come down low enough yet. But it's
trying to defend in front of 20s right

1924
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
trying to defend in front of 20s right
 

1925
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,230
trying to defend in front of 20s right
now. If we build a shelf here, this will

1926
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:00,240
now. If we build a shelf here, this will
 

1927
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,829
now. If we build a shelf here, this will
be like last week where, you know, maybe

1928
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
be like last week where, you know, maybe
 

1929
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,349
be like last week where, you know, maybe
there's a rotation out this shelf down

1930
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
there's a rotation out this shelf down
 

1931
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,109
there's a rotation out this shelf down
to this again and back and forth and

1932
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:05,119
to this again and back and forth and
 

1933
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,309
to this again and back and forth and
back and forth and back and forth. And

1934
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:06,319
back and forth and back and forth. And
 

1935
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,750
back and forth and back and forth. And
if they let go of this shelf down here

1936
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:07,760
if they let go of this shelf down here
 

1937
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,230
if they let go of this shelf down here
and if they defend it, we keep going.

1938
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
and if they defend it, we keep going.
 

1939
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,510
and if they defend it, we keep going.
Feels like Friday all over again.

1940
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,520

 

1941
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,190

There you go. Did you just say that

1942
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,200
There you go. Did you just say that
 

1943
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,750
There you go. Did you just say that
before I looked up? I've just seen your

1944
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:19,760
before I looked up? I've just seen your
 

1945
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,829
before I looked up? I've just seen your
comment. Bounced off demand and it may

1946
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
comment. Bounced off demand and it may
 

1947
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,550
comment. Bounced off demand and it may
be going to retest 25500, the low of the

1948
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:24,560
be going to retest 25500, the low of the
 

1949
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,630
be going to retest 25500, the low of the
breakout last week. Yeah. Did you say

1950
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,640
breakout last week. Yeah. Did you say
 

1951
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,950
breakout last week. Yeah. Did you say
that before before I even read I

1952
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:28,960
that before before I even read I
 

1953
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,870
that before before I even read I
remember you saying it on Friday. So I

1954
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
remember you saying it on Friday. So I
 

1955
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,069
remember you saying it on Friday. So I
was think I was just thinking about you

1956
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:32,079
was think I was just thinking about you
 

1957
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,910
was think I was just thinking about you
in my head how we had that discussion

1958
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:33,920
in my head how we had that discussion
 

1959
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,470
in my head how we had that discussion
Friday. You may well be right at the

1960
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
Friday. You may well be right at the
 

1961
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,750
Friday. You may well be right at the
moment. It looks more than possible,

1962
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
moment. It looks more than possible,
 

1963
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,670
moment. It looks more than possible,
doesn't it? Looks more than possible.

1964
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:43,680

 

1965
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,109

John Dennis, I'm done for the day.

1966
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
John Dennis, I'm done for the day.
 

1967
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,870
John Dennis, I'm done for the day.
3,800. Very nice, mate. Very, very nice.

1968
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
3,800. Very nice, mate. Very, very nice.
 

1969
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,390
3,800. Very nice, mate. Very, very nice.
Well, all of you have made money. Means

1970
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,400
Well, all of you have made money. Means
 

1971
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,550
Well, all of you have made money. Means
you took the failed the failed uh

1972
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
you took the failed the failed uh
 

1973
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,069
you took the failed the failed uh
breakdown, the look below, and fail and

1974
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
breakdown, the look below, and fail and
 

1975
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,309
breakdown, the look below, and fail and
the move back into value, which is it's

1976
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
the move back into value, which is it's
 

1977
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,990
the move back into value, which is it's
the best move to take in here. So, I

1978
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000
the best move to take in here. So, I
 

1979
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,910
the best move to take in here. So, I
have to be neutral. I I've missed it

1980
00:45:59,910 --> 00:45:59,920
have to be neutral. I I've missed it
 

1981
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,430
have to be neutral. I I've missed it
while I was calling everything out. So,

1982
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
while I was calling everything out. So,
 

1983
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,750
while I was calling everything out. So,
now I have to wait for the potentially

1984
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
now I have to wait for the potentially
 

1985
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,510
now I have to wait for the potentially
the rotation the other side. The harder

1986
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
the rotation the other side. The harder
 

1987
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,069
the rotation the other side. The harder
thing now is momentum is flying upside.

1988
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079

 

1989
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,109

Blessie. Let's see.

1990
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:15,119
Blessie. Let's see.
 

1991
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,630
Blessie. Let's see.
Little bit of excess on that last push

1992
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
Little bit of excess on that last push
 

1993
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,630
Little bit of excess on that last push
for the first time. Not a lot, but a

1994
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:18,640
for the first time. Not a lot, but a
 

1995
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,630
for the first time. Not a lot, but a
little bit. 116 up there. Where's the

1996
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,640
little bit. 116 up there. Where's the
 

1997
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,230
little bit. 116 up there. Where's the
delta? Where you at? What was that high

1998
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:22,240
delta? Where you at? What was that high
 

1999
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,589
delta? Where you at? What was that high
to 50s?

2000
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:25,599

 

2001
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,829

Not enough for me, but it's interesting.

2002
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
Not enough for me, but it's interesting.
 

2003
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,790
Not enough for me, but it's interesting.
Back down to the lower side again. Maybe

2004
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800
Back down to the lower side again. Maybe
 

2005
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,190
Back down to the lower side again. Maybe
they come down and revisit 61s. How we

2006
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200
they come down and revisit 61s. How we
 

2007
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,349
they come down and revisit 61s. How we
doing for time? 3 minutes until a new H1

2008
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:35,359
doing for time? 3 minutes until a new H1
 

2009
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:41,349
doing for time? 3 minutes until a new H1
H4. That would be interesting.

2010
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:41,359

 

2011
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,950

Retesting this low again. They're

2012
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:42,960
Retesting this low again. They're
 

2013
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,710
Retesting this low again. They're
finding bids here for now. No follow

2014
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:44,720
finding bids here for now. No follow
 

2015
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,309
finding bids here for now. No follow
through through that yet.

2016
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,319
through through that yet.
 

2017
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,829
through through that yet.
Very sensitive here. Back to that uh

2018
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:51,839
Very sensitive here. Back to that uh
 

2019
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,230
Very sensitive here. Back to that uh
flow zones. I'm not convinced they

2020
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,240
flow zones. I'm not convinced they
 

2021
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,150
flow zones. I'm not convinced they
finished the rotation yet.

2022
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:58,160

 

2023
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,670

They just whipped that edge, didn't

2024
00:46:59,670 --> 00:46:59,680
They just whipped that edge, didn't
 

2025
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,270
They just whipped that edge, didn't
they? No follow through back down to

2026
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
they? No follow through back down to
 

2027
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:09,349
they? No follow through back down to
this yet. So, we can draw this on.

2028
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:09,359

 

2029
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:14,390

Yeah, they're still soaking for now.

2030
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,400

 

2031
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,829

Say a bit of a flat top there. If they

2032
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:15,839
Say a bit of a flat top there. If they
 

2033
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,750
Say a bit of a flat top there. If they
break, it would be nasty. But let's see.

2034
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,760
break, it would be nasty. But let's see.
 

2035
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,270
break, it would be nasty. But let's see.
Back down to the edge of this range

2036
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
Back down to the edge of this range
 

2037
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,069
Back down to the edge of this range
again.

2038
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:22,079
again.
 

2039
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:28,790
again.
Still no follow through.

2040
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:28,800

 

2041
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,349

Very tight here.

2042
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:35,359

 

2043
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,230

Someone's going to get hurt soon.

2044
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240

 

2045
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,309

There's the downside pressure back to

2046
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:42,319
There's the downside pressure back to
 

2047
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,910
There's the downside pressure back to
the edge of this range again. They're if

2048
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:43,920
the edge of this range again. They're if
 

2049
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,670
the edge of this range again. They're if
they let go, they rotate down to here.

2050
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
they let go, they rotate down to here.
 

2051
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,550
they let go, they rotate down to here.
165s. I'm a bit cautious about taking

2052
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:48,560
165s. I'm a bit cautious about taking
 

2053
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,670
165s. I'm a bit cautious about taking
this because I'm not convinced we

2054
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
this because I'm not convinced we
 

2055
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,030
this because I'm not convinced we
finished the rotation to previous day

2056
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
finished the rotation to previous day
 

2057
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,390
finished the rotation to previous day
value area high. So, I know from a

2058
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
value area high. So, I know from a
 

2059
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,829
value area high. So, I know from a
technical standpoint, if we leave this

2060
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
technical standpoint, if we leave this
 

2061
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,230
technical standpoint, if we leave this
range, yes, we've been in a squeeze up.

2062
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
range, yes, we've been in a squeeze up.
 

2063
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,870
range, yes, we've been in a squeeze up.
Where's my pen gone? We have been in a

2064
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:58,880
Where's my pen gone? We have been in a
 

2065
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,550
Where's my pen gone? We have been in a
squeeze up. All right, we are leaving

2066
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:00,560
squeeze up. All right, we are leaving
 

2067
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,470
squeeze up. All right, we are leaving
this range. Maybe there's a trade back

2068
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:02,480
this range. Maybe there's a trade back
 

2069
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,910
this range. Maybe there's a trade back
down to here. The problem is for me,

2070
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
down to here. The problem is for me,
 

2071
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,910
down to here. The problem is for me,
we've left this low hanging fruit, which

2072
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:05,920
we've left this low hanging fruit, which
 

2073
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,670
we've left this low hanging fruit, which
doesn't which means it's not an A+ for

2074
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
doesn't which means it's not an A+ for
 

2075
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,309
doesn't which means it's not an A+ for
me. The difference between that and this

2076
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:10,319
me. The difference between that and this
 

2077
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,309
me. The difference between that and this
morning's play is this morning we came

2078
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:12,319
morning's play is this morning we came
 

2079
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,670
morning's play is this morning we came
outside of previous day value area high,

2080
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:15,680
outside of previous day value area high,
 

2081
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,150
outside of previous day value area high,
right? We came into

2082
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,160
right? We came into
 

2083
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,349
right? We came into
a volume, right, level where we bid off.

2084
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
a volume, right, level where we bid off.
 

2085
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,430
a volume, right, level where we bid off.
So, we took low hanging fruit, we found

2086
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:23,440
So, we took low hanging fruit, we found
 

2087
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,349
So, we took low hanging fruit, we found
demand, and we bid up. We haven't done

2088
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:25,359
demand, and we bid up. We haven't done
 

2089
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,790
demand, and we bid up. We haven't done
that the other side of this range yet,

2090
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:26,800
that the other side of this range yet,
 

2091
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,870
that the other side of this range yet,
which is why I'm not really looking to

2092
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:28,880
which is why I'm not really looking to
 

2093
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,190
which is why I'm not really looking to
trade it back downside yet because the

2094
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
trade it back downside yet because the
 

2095
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,670
trade it back downside yet because the
equivalent of that would have to be a

2096
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,680
equivalent of that would have to be a
 

2097
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,309
equivalent of that would have to be a
look above

2098
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
look above
 

2099
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,790
look above
this and a failure back in. And we've

2100
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
this and a failure back in. And we've
 

2101
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,309
this and a failure back in. And we've
not seen that. We are testing this

2102
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:40,319
not seen that. We are testing this
 

2103
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,910
not seen that. We are testing this
range. Like maybe there's a short down

2104
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:41,920
range. Like maybe there's a short down
 

2105
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,710
range. Like maybe there's a short down
here, but it's definitely not an A+.

2106
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:46,720

 

2107
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,990

No doubt about it. We've been in a

2108
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
No doubt about it. We've been in a
 

2109
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:57,030
No doubt about it. We've been in a
squeeze for 30 minutes here.

2110
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:57,040

 

2111
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,109

laidback. Hi fellas, on my trading view

2112
00:48:59,109 --> 00:48:59,119
laidback. Hi fellas, on my trading view
 

2113
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,190
laidback. Hi fellas, on my trading view
I'm using NQ1, but why are my numbers

2114
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,200
I'm using NQ1, but why are my numbers
 

2115
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,950
I'm using NQ1, but why are my numbers
different from Alex's? Uh, they

2116
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
different from Alex's? Uh, they
 

2117
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,950
different from Alex's? Uh, they
shouldn't be different. NQ1 is the same

2118
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:04,960
shouldn't be different. NQ1 is the same
 

2119
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,790
shouldn't be different. NQ1 is the same
as this. NQZ is the current contract.

2120
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:06,800
as this. NQZ is the current contract.
 

2121
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,710
as this. NQZ is the current contract.
NQ1 is just the rollover. They should be

2122
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,720
NQ1 is just the rollover. They should be
 

2123
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,030
NQ1 is just the rollover. They should be
exactly the same.

2124
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,040
exactly the same.
 

2125
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,430
exactly the same.
So maybe you've just got slight delay.

2126
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:13,440
So maybe you've just got slight delay.
 

2127
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,190
So maybe you've just got slight delay.
The delay should be 3 to six seconds.

2128
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,200
The delay should be 3 to six seconds.
 

2129
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,750
The delay should be 3 to six seconds.
I've got it set as the fastest humanly

2130
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
I've got it set as the fastest humanly
 

2131
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,430
I've got it set as the fastest humanly
or computer possible for YouTube.

2132
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440

 

2133
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,470

Raph, done for the day. 100 points and

2134
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:26,480
Raph, done for the day. 100 points and
 

2135
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,710
Raph, done for the day. 100 points and
50 for the runner. I love it, mate. So,

2136
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:28,720
50 for the runner. I love it, mate. So,
 

2137
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,829
50 for the runner. I love it, mate. So,
here you go. Maybe rotation here. I'd be

2138
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
here you go. Maybe rotation here. I'd be
 

2139
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,390
here you go. Maybe rotation here. I'd be
somewhat careful if you're really keen

2140
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:34,400
somewhat careful if you're really keen
 

2141
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,150
somewhat careful if you're really keen
on taking this. They will try and rotate

2142
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,160
on taking this. They will try and rotate
 

2143
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,589
on taking this. They will try and rotate
to here. They can try and hold these

2144
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:37,599
to here. They can try and hold these
 

2145
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,670
to here. They can try and hold these
pivots, which is why I'm not taking it

2146
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:39,680
pivots, which is why I'm not taking it
 

2147
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,190
pivots, which is why I'm not taking it
at the moment. Just looking at like the

2148
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,200
at the moment. Just looking at like the
 

2149
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,710
at the moment. Just looking at like the
imbalances and where we have that

2150
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:42,720
imbalances and where we have that
 

2151
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,069
imbalances and where we have that
cluster. But this is maybe a play. I

2152
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:46,079
cluster. But this is maybe a play. I
 

2153
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,390
cluster. But this is maybe a play. I
would class it as a C setup. It's not an

2154
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:48,400
would class it as a C setup. It's not an
 

2155
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,309
would class it as a C setup. It's not an
A plus. It's not even a B. It's probably

2156
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
A plus. It's not even a B. It's probably
 

2157
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,990
A plus. It's not even a B. It's probably
a C setup at the moment because we've

2158
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,000
a C setup at the moment because we've
 

2159
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,829
a C setup at the moment because we've
left low hanging fruit and we haven't

2160
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:53,839
left low hanging fruit and we haven't
 

2161
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,829
left low hanging fruit and we haven't
completed the rotation and we're going

2162
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
completed the rotation and we're going
 

2163
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,349
completed the rotation and we're going
against the grain. But maybe they're

2164
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
against the grain. But maybe they're
 

2165
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:04,549
against the grain. But maybe they're
going to do this move here for you guys.

2166
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:04,559

 

2167
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,990

New H1 coming in two 1 zero. All right,

2168
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,000
New H1 coming in two 1 zero. All right,
 

2169
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,750
New H1 coming in two 1 zero. All right,
this is what matters to me. This H1,

2170
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:09,760
this is what matters to me. This H1,
 

2171
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,710
this is what matters to me. This H1,
this H4. Now, if this H1H4 prints above

2172
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:12,720
this H4. Now, if this H1H4 prints above
 

2173
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,670
this H4. Now, if this H1H4 prints above
here and fails up here or even above

2174
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:15,680
here and fails up here or even above
 

2175
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,670
here and fails up here or even above
Globeex and we get like a nice long

2176
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:17,680
Globeex and we get like a nice long
 

2177
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,589
Globeex and we get like a nice long
wick, then I'd consider that trade back

2178
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
wick, then I'd consider that trade back
 

2179
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,349
wick, then I'd consider that trade back
downside. If we start printing above all

2180
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
downside. If we start printing above all
 

2181
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:30,069
downside. If we start printing above all
of this, then we're going to go 500s.

2182
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:30,079

 

2183
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,829

I'm just 500 away from passing my

2184
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:31,839
I'm just 500 away from passing my
 

2185
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,589
I'm just 500 away from passing my
funding ticks account, but now it's

2186
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
funding ticks account, but now it's
 

2187
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,190
funding ticks account, but now it's
looking hard for me. Hey, there's no

2188
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
looking hard for me. Hey, there's no
 

2189
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,750
looking hard for me. Hey, there's no
rush. There's no rush. Just wait for

2190
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,760
rush. There's no rush. Just wait for
 

2191
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,430
rush. There's no rush. Just wait for
your setup. If that setup's not today,

2192
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
your setup. If that setup's not today,
 

2193
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,430
your setup. If that setup's not today,
it will be tomorrow or the next day.

2194
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:41,440
it will be tomorrow or the next day.
 

2195
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,589
it will be tomorrow or the next day.
Don't worry about the money. All right?

2196
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:43,599
Don't worry about the money. All right?
 

2197
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,270
Don't worry about the money. All right?
But thinking about the money is the

2198
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:45,280
But thinking about the money is the
 

2199
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,349
But thinking about the money is the
trap. Sticking to the process is how you

2200
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:47,359
trap. Sticking to the process is how you
 

2201
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,670
trap. Sticking to the process is how you
make money trading. If you focus on your

2202
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:49,680
make money trading. If you focus on your
 

2203
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,230
make money trading. If you focus on your
P&L, you will lose.

2204
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
P&L, you will lose.
 

2205
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,910
P&L, you will lose.
Nice, Peter. All out for the long. Nice

2206
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:53,920
Nice, Peter. All out for the long. Nice
 

2207
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,589
Nice, Peter. All out for the long. Nice
work. Yeah, lots of you getting it.

2208
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:57,599
work. Yeah, lots of you getting it.
 

2209
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,630
work. Yeah, lots of you getting it.
Jack, you're short on resistance. Okay.

2210
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:00,640
Jack, you're short on resistance. Okay.
 

2211
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,710
Jack, you're short on resistance. Okay.
Not quite the level I'm at yet, but I

2212
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,720
Not quite the level I'm at yet, but I
 

2213
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,309
Not quite the level I'm at yet, but I
understand what you're looking for. But

2214
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:04,319
understand what you're looking for. But
 

2215
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,470
understand what you're looking for. But
like I said, I'm concerned we haven't

2216
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,480
like I said, I'm concerned we haven't
 

2217
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,030
like I said, I'm concerned we haven't
taken the low hanging fruit yet. We will

2218
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:09,040
taken the low hanging fruit yet. We will
 

2219
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,510
taken the low hanging fruit yet. We will
see. Vix is starting to find a bid in

2220
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
see. Vix is starting to find a bid in
 

2221
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:18,630
see. Vix is starting to find a bid in
front of 20.

2222
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640

 

2223
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,870

Let's see.

2224
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:20,880
Let's see.
 

2225
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,390
Let's see.
Back to these flow zones at the moment.

2226
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:22,400
Back to these flow zones at the moment.
 

2227
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,870
Back to these flow zones at the moment.
Let's move this.

2228
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:26,880

 

2229
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,109

This is your two ranges,

2230
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:29,119
This is your two ranges,
 

2231
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,349
This is your two ranges,
right? We've got volume here, volume

2232
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:31,359
right? We've got volume here, volume
 

2233
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,270
right? We've got volume here, volume
here. Rotation can happen here. If we

2234
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
here. Rotation can happen here. If we
 

2235
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,790
here. Rotation can happen here. If we
let go of this, there's a bigger snap

2236
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:34,800
let go of this, there's a bigger snap
 

2237
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,030
let go of this, there's a bigger snap
possible

2238
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:37,040
possible
 

2239
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,710
possible
because we didn't really build out much

2240
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
because we didn't really build out much
 

2241
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,309
because we didn't really build out much
structure on this drive up this morning.

2242
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:40,319
structure on this drive up this morning.
 

2243
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,549
structure on this drive up this morning.
It was like a straight squeeze up. All

2244
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:42,559
It was like a straight squeeze up. All
 

2245
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,150
It was like a straight squeeze up. All
the shorts entered at the lows and

2246
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:44,160
the shorts entered at the lows and
 

2247
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,230
the shorts entered at the lows and
they're all getting squeezed out. Here's

2248
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:46,240
they're all getting squeezed out. Here's
 

2249
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,910
they're all getting squeezed out. Here's
the move back to volume. Now, now it's

2250
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
the move back to volume. Now, now it's
 

2251
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,990
the move back to volume. Now, now it's
important what happens now for sentiment

2252
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
important what happens now for sentiment
 

2253
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,349
important what happens now for sentiment
now. Do bulls come and defend this area

2254
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:53,359
now. Do bulls come and defend this area
 

2255
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,349
now. Do bulls come and defend this area
where they successfully defended earlier

2256
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
where they successfully defended earlier
 

2257
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,109
where they successfully defended earlier
this morning and caught bids? Right,

2258
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:57,119
this morning and caught bids? Right,
 

2259
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,390
this morning and caught bids? Right,
that's what they will be looking to do.

2260
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,400
that's what they will be looking to do.
 

2261
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,829
that's what they will be looking to do.
If I was short, I'd be covering into

2262
00:51:59,829 --> 00:51:59,839
If I was short, I'd be covering into
 

2263
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,910
If I was short, I'd be covering into
this zone, holding runners in case we

2264
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:01,920
this zone, holding runners in case we
 

2265
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,430
this zone, holding runners in case we
break down below.

2266
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440

 

2267
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,190

This is previous week value area low.

2268
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,200
This is previous week value area low.
 

2269
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,790
This is previous week value area low.
We're finding a bid around that. So, you

2270
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:10,800
We're finding a bid around that. So, you
 

2271
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,549
We're finding a bid around that. So, you
can see this is big level and I would

2272
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:12,559
can see this is big level and I would
 

2273
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,390
can see this is big level and I would
expect rotation between these two zones

2274
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:14,400
expect rotation between these two zones
 

2275
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,589
expect rotation between these two zones
at the moment. Right. This is not as

2276
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:17,599
at the moment. Right. This is not as
 

2277
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,270
at the moment. Right. This is not as
good now because we've sort of built out

2278
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:19,280
good now because we've sort of built out
 

2279
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,670
good now because we've sort of built out
here. So, this level becomes key as a

2280
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:21,680
here. So, this level becomes key as a
 

2281
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,150
here. So, this level becomes key as a
over, under, flip below and fail also

2282
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:24,160
over, under, flip below and fail also
 

2283
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,309
over, under, flip below and fail also
available. The bulls will want to defend

2284
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:26,319
available. The bulls will want to defend
 

2285
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,910
available. The bulls will want to defend
this. Failing to defend this will allow

2286
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:27,920
this. Failing to defend this will allow
 

2287
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,069
this. Failing to defend this will allow
a bigger move lower. I'm going to remove

2288
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
a bigger move lower. I'm going to remove
 

2289
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,349
a bigger move lower. I'm going to remove
that because the way we built that

2290
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:31,359
that because the way we built that
 

2291
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,270
that because the way we built that
volume is not too pretty. So this is the

2292
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:33,280
volume is not too pretty. So this is the
 

2293
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,710
volume is not too pretty. So this is the
level that bulls want to defend that

2294
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:34,720
level that bulls want to defend that
 

2295
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:49,270
level that bulls want to defend that
we're coming into

2296
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:49,280

 

2297
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,710

starting to push now 2.90% up. So Tessa

2298
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:52,720
starting to push now 2.90% up. So Tessa
 

2299
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,309
starting to push now 2.90% up. So Tessa
and Google look strong. Everything else

2300
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:54,319
and Google look strong. Everything else
 

2301
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,870
and Google look strong. Everything else
has gone red on the day folks. So Tessa

2302
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:56,880
has gone red on the day folks. So Tessa
 

2303
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,349
has gone red on the day folks. So Tessa
and Google now the only two that are up.

2304
00:52:59,349 --> 00:52:59,359
and Google now the only two that are up.
 

2305
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,349
and Google now the only two that are up.
Everything else red on the day or meta's

2306
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:01,359
Everything else red on the day or meta's
 

2307
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,230
Everything else red on the day or meta's
flat. Back to your VW up here. This is

2308
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:04,240
flat. Back to your VW up here. This is
 

2309
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,069

the area bulls need to defend this gray

2310
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:06,079
the area bulls need to defend this gray
 

2311
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,470
the area bulls need to defend this gray
box. They will need to defend this area

2312
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
box. They will need to defend this area
 

2313
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,670
box. They will need to defend this area
if they're going to complete the

00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
if they're going to complete the
 

2315
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,549
if they're going to complete the
rotation of previous day high. Previous

00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:12,559
rotation of previous day high. Previous
 

2317
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,190
rotation of previous day high. Previous
day value area high. Failing to defend

2318
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,200
day value area high. Failing to defend
 

2319
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,870
day value area high. Failing to defend
this area will cause them to get in

2320
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:16,880
this area will cause them to get in
 

2321
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,150
this area will cause them to get in
trouble and mean everyone above this

2322
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160
trouble and mean everyone above this
 

2323
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,470
trouble and mean everyone above this

2325
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:35,190

Let's just see.

2326
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:35,200

 

2327
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,589

Very, very dangerous. Now, if bears now

Very, very dangerous. Now, if bears now
defend this range, right? If we trade

2338
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:50,240
defend this range, right? If we trade
 

2339
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,069

downside from this, if a retest stays

00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079
downside from this, if a retest stays
 

2341
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,510
downside from this, if a retest stays
heavy, we can go all the way back to

2342
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:53,520
heavy, we can go all the way back to
 

2343
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,309
heavy, we can go all the way back to
open. And we're starting to see selling

2344
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
open. And we're starting to see selling
 

2345
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,390
open. And we're starting to see selling
in the MAG. Not in Tesla and not in Goo,

2346
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:58,400
in the MAG. Not in Tesla and not in Goo,
 

2347
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,670
in the MAG. Not in Tesla and not in Goo,
but in everything else. Oh my gosh.

2348
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,680
but in everything else. Oh my gosh.
 

2349
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,470
but in everything else. Oh my gosh.
Well, that trade up there was the one I

2350
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:04,480
Well, that trade up there was the one I
 

2351
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,030
Well, that trade up there was the one I
wasn't convinced because it wasn't A+,

2352
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,040
wasn't convinced because it wasn't A+,
 

2353
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,750
wasn't convinced because it wasn't A+,
but we'll see. Big selling on the tape

2354
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:09,760
but we'll see. Big selling on the tape
 

2355
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,069
but we'll see. Big selling on the tape
at the moment. Want to just let this

2356
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:12,079
at the moment. Want to just let this
 

2357
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,670
at the moment. Want to just let this
calm down. If we're just going to get a

2358
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
calm down. If we're just going to get a
 

2359
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,510
calm down. If we're just going to get a
two-way take where we go up for 30

2360
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:15,520
two-way take where we go up for 30
 

2361
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,710
two-way take where we go up for 30
minutes and down for 30 minutes, it's

2362
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:16,720
minutes and down for 30 minutes, it's
 

2363
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,510
minutes and down for 30 minutes, it's
going to be pretty tough to trade based

2364
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:19,520
going to be pretty tough to trade based
 

2365
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:28,150
going to be pretty tough to trade based
on A+ setups and stuff.

2366
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:28,160

 

2367
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,270

Just going to get a bit more coffee

2368
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,280
Just going to get a bit more coffee
 

2369
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,790
Just going to get a bit more coffee
here. Let this settle down, folks. Be

2370
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800

2371
00:54:30,800 --> 00:55:14,069
here. Let this settle down, folks. Be
right back.

2372
00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:14,079

 

2373
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,069

Up to you. You have a think about it.

2374
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
Up to you. You have a think about it.
 

2375
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:23,990
Up to you. You have a think about it.
All right.

2376
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,000

 

2377
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,790

So, a bit of a shelf here into 70s.

2378
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:30,800

 

2379
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,549

Let's see. I just think we're in range

2380
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,559
Let's see. I just think we're in range
 

2381
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,230
Let's see. I just think we're in range
rotation. So, I just want to be really

2382
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,240
rotation. So, I just want to be really
 

2383
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,549
rotation. So, I just want to be really
cautious. And it's a Monday. Monday sets

2384
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:36,559
cautious. And it's a Monday. Monday sets
 

2385
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,230
cautious. And it's a Monday. Monday sets
the tone for the week. I think we're

2386
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
the tone for the week. I think we're
 

2387
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,470
the tone for the week. I think we're
waiting for Nvidia on Wednesday. I think

2388
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:40,480
waiting for Nvidia on Wednesday. I think
 

2389
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,069
waiting for Nvidia on Wednesday. I think
that's the big bigger move this week. We

2390
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
that's the big bigger move this week. We
 

2391
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,910
that's the big bigger move this week. We
had a massive week last week. So, I'm

2392
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:43,920
had a massive week last week. So, I'm
 

2393
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,990
had a massive week last week. So, I'm
not uh

2394
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
not uh
 

2395
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,230
not uh
I'm not in a crazy hurry, let's put it

2396
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,240
I'm not in a crazy hurry, let's put it
 

2397
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,750
I'm not in a crazy hurry, let's put it
that way.

2398
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:49,760
that way.
 

2399
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,510
that way.
to force my way in and out of this

2400
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:51,520
to force my way in and out of this
 

2401
00:55:51,520 --> 00:56:04,710
to force my way in and out of this
market at the moment.

2402
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:04,720

 

2403
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,910

It's starting to find a bid. It's going

2404
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
It's starting to find a bid. It's going
 

2405
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,710
It's starting to find a bid. It's going
to come and retest this shelf. And this

2406
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:08,720
to come and retest this shelf. And this
 

2407
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,190
to come and retest this shelf. And this
gray box is the key level. If bulls get

2408
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:11,200
gray box is the key level. If bulls get
 

2409
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,710
gray box is the key level. If bulls get
back through this, they can go back for

2410
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:12,720
back through this, they can go back for
 

2411
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,630
back through this, they can go back for
high of day. If bears defend this, then

2412
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:14,640
high of day. If bears defend this, then
 

2413
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,829
high of day. If bears defend this, then
they're going to look for a lower high

2414
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:15,839
they're going to look for a lower high
 

2415
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,990
they're going to look for a lower high
and a sell back down.

2416
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,000
and a sell back down.
 

2417
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,109
and a sell back down.
So, it's big big level here.

2418
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:21,119
So, it's big big level here.
 

2419
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,789
So, it's big big level here.
MAG is in a sell other than Tesla and

Google, which are holding gains. They've

2422
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:26,720
Google, which are holding gains. They've
 

2423
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,069
Google, which are holding gains. They've
squeezed right the way up, right?

2424
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
squeezed right the way up, right?
 

2425
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,870
squeezed right the way up, right?
Google's just just shy of 5 and a half%

2426
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
Google's just just shy of 5 and a half%
 

2427
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,030
Google's just just shy of 5 and a half%
up on the day. Let's let that sink in.

2428
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
up on the day. Let's let that sink in.
 

2429
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,349
up on the day. Let's let that sink in.
Five, five and a half% up on the day.

Five, five and a half% up on the day.
 

2431
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,829
Five, five and a half% up on the day.
It's a big move.

2432
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:37,839
It's a big move.
 

2433
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,190
It's a big move.
This is the key area. This is your

00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,200
This is the key area. This is your
 

2435
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,870
This is the key area. This is your
overunder now, which will dictate the

2436
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:40,880
overunder now, which will dictate the
 

2437
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,030
overunder now, which will dictate the
tone probably for the remainder of the

tone probably for the remainder of the
 

2439
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,950
tone probably for the remainder of the
morning. I would say there's so far

2440
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:44,960
morning. I would say there's so far
 

2441
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,990
morning. I would say there's so far

first push in have defended it.
 

2443
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,190
first push in have defended it.
Let's see how we go in here. If they

2444
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:51,200
Let's see how we go in here. If they
 

2445
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,789
Let's see how we go in here. If they
just squeeze right the way through, we

2446
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:52,799
just squeeze right the way through, we
 

2447
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,349
just squeeze right the way through, we
probably go back for high of day. If

2448
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
probably go back for high of day. If
 

2449
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,630
probably go back for high of day. If
they defend it, well, we'll have to see.

2450
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
they defend it, well, we'll have to see.
 

2451

Last push did leave excess from bulls up

there. I'm in a short now. Small size
 

2465
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,470
there. I'm in a short now. Small size
stop already in that last excess. Here

2466
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:20,480
stop already in that last excess. Here
 

2467
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,789
stop already in that last excess. Here
we go. Oh my god, this is moving fast.

2468
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:22,799
we go. Oh my god, this is moving fast.

Okay, cover some in here. Got a pivot

2472
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
Okay, cover some in here. Got a pivot
 

2473
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,950
Okay, cover some in here. Got a pivot
into here, which they might defend. And

2474
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:30,960
into here, which they might defend. And
 

2475
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,230
into here, which they might defend. And
let's see if we can get a runner to

00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:32,240
let's see if we can get a runner to
 

2477
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,789
let's see if we can get a runner to
break down. So, just taking this bare

2478
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:34,799
break down. So, just taking this bare
 

2479
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,630
break down. So, just taking this bare
flag once they left excess into that

2480
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:36,640

01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,000
at 90. Maybe it was a bit apprehensive
 

2601

This is a big level here. It's a

This is a big level here. It's a
 

2605
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,230
This is a big level here. It's a
battleground now. This is where bears

2606
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,240
battleground now. This is where bears
 

2607
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,750
battleground now. This is where bears
came flying in here. If you look at

2608
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:31,760
came flying in here. If you look at
 

2609
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,230
came flying in here. If you look at
bookmap above, right, we came flying in

2610
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,240
bookmap above, right, we came flying in
 

2611
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,789
bookmap above, right, we came flying in
here and we're really heavy there into

2612
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:36,799
here and we're really heavy there into
 

2613
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,430
here and we're really heavy there into
what's that level there? 106 there's a

2614
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
what's that level there? 106 there's a
 

2615
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,470
what's that level there? 106 there's a
331 lot and at the same level 109

2616
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
331 lot and at the same level 109
 

2617
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,109
331 lot and at the same level 109
there's a 225 lot. So they are the

2618
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
there's a 225 lot. So they are the
 

2619
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,630
there's a 225 lot. So they are the
control right now. So I guess maybe I

2620
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:46,640
control right now. So I guess maybe I
 

2621
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,829
control right now. So I guess maybe I
should have given it 10 more points

2622
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:47,839
should have given it 10 more points
 

2623
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,710
should have given it 10 more points
until 105

2624
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
until 105
 

2625
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,150
until 105

Just watching the footprint. So, we're

2634
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
Just watching the footprint. So, we're
 

2635
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,870
Just watching the footprint. So, we're
starting to repric. We're going to come

2636
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:02,880
starting to repric. We're going to come
 

2637
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,630
starting to repric. We're going to come
and test where these massive bears were,

2638
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
and test where these massive bears were,
 

2639
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,630
and test where these massive bears were,
where these 500 lots went through market

2640
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:06,640
where these 500 lots went through market
 

2641
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,870
where these 500 lots went through market
side. And if they reclaim this, a little

2642
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:08,880
side. And if they reclaim this, a little
 

2643
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,549
side. And if they reclaim this, a little
bit of a squeeze can happen, folks. All

2644
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
bit of a squeeze can happen, folks. All
 

2645
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,789
bit of a squeeze can happen, folks. All
right. So, bears came flying in here

2646
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:12,799
right. So, bears came flying in here
 

2647
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,950
right. So, bears came flying in here
between 90 and 100. And they might well

2648
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:14,960
between 90 and 100. And they might well
 

2649
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,309
between 90 and 100. And they might well
get squeezed out, which is why I'm done

2650
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
get squeezed out, which is why I'm done
 

2651
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,750
get squeezed out, which is why I'm done
with this trade at the moment just from

2652
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
with this trade at the moment just from
 

2653
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,349
with this trade at the moment just from
reading the tape. It's just from reading

2654
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
reading the tape. It's just from reading
 

2655
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,549
reading the tape. It's just from reading
the tape. All right. I know you're going

2657
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,510
the tape. All right. I know you're going
to be like, "Structure is still

2658
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:21,520
to be like, "Structure is still
 

2659
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,670
to be like, "Structure is still
bearish." I get that. I totally

2660
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:23,680
bearish." I get that. I totally
 

2661
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,430
bearish." I get that. I totally
understand that, but I don't want to get

2662
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:25,440
understand that, but I don't want to get
 

2663
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,270
understand that, but I don't want to get
caught in a squeeze back up like this.

2664
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:27,280
caught in a squeeze back up like this.
 

2665
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,430
caught in a squeeze back up like this.
So, it's just from reading the tape that

2666
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:29,440
So, it's just from reading the tape that
 

2667
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,829
So, it's just from reading the tape that
I've seen this.

2668
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839

 

2669
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,630

There we go. So, he he got one today.

2670
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:36,640
There we go. So, he he got one today.
 

2671
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,750
There we go. So, he he got one today.
Finally got one. You can see they're

2672
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
Finally got one. You can see they're
 

2673
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,950
Finally got one. You can see they're
starting to build a shelf out of this

2674
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:38,960
starting to build a shelf out of this
 

2675
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,710
starting to build a shelf out of this
low now. So, everything below this is

2676
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:40,720
low now. So, everything below this is
 

2677
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,910
low now. So, everything below this is
thin. And we're going to come retest

2678
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:41,920
thin. And we're going to come retest
 

2679
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,910
thin. And we're going to come retest
this now. And this can be a two-leg. And

2680
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
this now. And this can be a two-leg. And
 

2681
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,510
this now. And this can be a two-leg. And
if bears got trapped down there, which

2682
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:45,520
if bears got trapped down there, which
 

2683
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,510
if bears got trapped down there, which
we know they came flying in at 90 and

2684
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:47,520
we know they came flying in at 90 and
 

2685
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,750
we know they came flying in at 90 and
100 and below. If bulls reclaim this,

2686
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
100 and below. If bulls reclaim this,
 

2687
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,190
100 and below. If bulls reclaim this,
then they've still got that low hanging

2688
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
then they've still got that low hanging
 

2689
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,990
then they've still got that low hanging
fruit, which is why it was not an A+

2690
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,000
fruit, which is why it was not an A+
 

2691
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,349
fruit, which is why it was not an A+
trade, right? because there's still low

2692
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:55,359
trade, right? because there's still low
 

2693
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,349
trade, right? because there's still low
hanging fruit higher for them to go for

2694
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:57,359
hanging fruit higher for them to go for
 

2695
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,870
hanging fruit higher for them to go for
which is looks like they're trying to

2696
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:58,880
which is looks like they're trying to
 

2697
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,470
which is looks like they're trying to
get back up towards now. So that gray

2698
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
get back up towards now. So that gray
 

2699
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,030
get back up towards now. So that gray
box is your under over.

2700
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:05,040

 

2701
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:13,349

01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:42,799
that's where bears got stuck. So far
 

2785
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,710
that's where bears got stuck. So far
bears just resold into VWAP. I'm not

2786
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
bears just resold into VWAP. I'm not
 

2787
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,950
bears just resold into VWAP. I'm not
convinced here anymore. I've like taken

2788
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
convinced here anymore. I've like taken
 

2789
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,630
convinced here anymore. I've like taken
that trade off. Just going to wait now.

2790
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:48,640
that trade off. Just going to wait now.
 

2791
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,270
that trade off. Just going to wait now.
See what sets up next.

2792
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:53,280

 

2793
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,549

There you go. So they're defending it

2794
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:54,559
There you go. So they're defending it
 

2795
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:55,750
There you go. So they're defending it
like we just talked about. So look at

2796
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:55,760
like we just talked about. So look at
 

2797
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,349
like we just talked about. So look at
that wick. Where do we come down to? In

2798
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
that wick. Where do we come down to? In
 

2799
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,150
that wick. Where do we come down to? In
front of 110. Remember bears are stuck

2800
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160
front of 110. Remember bears are stuck
 

2801
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,910
front of 110. Remember bears are stuck
right now at sort of 90 to 100. I can

2802
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
right now at sort of 90 to 100. I can
 

2803
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,430
right now at sort of 90 to 100. I can
show you guys. Where is OBS? So I can

2804
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:07,440

2809
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,029
here. Um
this is why we covered. Are you into bit

2810
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:15,039
this is why we covered. Are you into bit
 

2811
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,270
this is why we covered. Are you into bit

2815
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,069
here.
Right. See these big orders here? Right.

2816
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:22,079
Right. See these big orders here? Right.
 

2817
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,589
Right. See these big orders here? Right.
These came in a bit later. Look at the

2818
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:23,599
These came in a bit later. Look at the
 

2819
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,190
These came in a bit later. Look at the
size on this. 224 331.

2820
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:27,200
size on this. 224 331.
 

2821
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,549
size on this. 224 331.
You guys see that? Do I need to squeeze

2822
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
You guys see that? Do I need to squeeze
 

2823
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,549
You guys see that? Do I need to squeeze
this over a bit?

2824
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:32,559

 

2825
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:33,990

Maybe you can see that now. These guys

2826
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,000
Maybe you can see that now. These guys
 

2827
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,589
Maybe you can see that now. These guys
here 224 331. Those are market selling.

2828
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:37,599
here 224 331. Those are market selling.
 

2829
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,069
here 224 331. Those are market selling.
We go to the lows or who who's at the

2830
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:40,079
We go to the lows or who who's at the
 

2831
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,470
We go to the lows or who who's at the
low of day? A market seller, right?

2832
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:42,480
low of day? A market seller, right?
 

2833
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,750
low of day? A market seller, right?
That's the end of the auction. No one

2834
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
That's the end of the auction. No one
 

2835
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,430
That's the end of the auction. No one
else wanted to sell. We squeeze back up.

2836
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:45,440
else wanted to sell. We squeeze back up.
 

2837
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,710
else wanted to sell. We squeeze back up.
We reclaim. We're holding bids above and

2838
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,720
We reclaim. We're holding bids above and
 

2839
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,029
We reclaim. We're holding bids above and
on this sort of rectangle box all the

2840
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
on this sort of rectangle box all the
 

2841
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,710
on this sort of rectangle box all the
time. We hold this. Now, where are we

2842
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:52,720
time. We hold this. Now, where are we
 

2843
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,910
time. We hold this. Now, where are we
going to revisit? They're going to try

2844
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:53,920
going to revisit? They're going to try
 

2845
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,309
going to revisit? They're going to try
and squeeze upside to where stronger

2846
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:56,319
and squeeze upside to where stronger
 

2847
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,750
and squeeze upside to where stronger
selling came in. Maybe this guy here,

2848
01:04:59,750 --> 01:04:59,760
selling came in. Maybe this guy here,
 

2849
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,950
selling came in. Maybe this guy here,
79. So, 80. So, all the time we hold 100

2850
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:02,960
79. So, 80. So, all the time we hold 100
 

2851
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,990
79. So, 80. So, all the time we hold 100
to 190, there's a potentially a trade

2852
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,000
to 190, there's a potentially a trade
 

2853
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,950
to 190, there's a potentially a trade
back up towards these guys here, 60 and

2854
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:08,960
back up towards these guys here, 60 and
 

2855
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,789
back up towards these guys here, 60 and
80, and then all the way up if they can

2856
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
80, and then all the way up if they can
 

2857
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,470
80, and then all the way up if they can
reclaim. So, that's why I'm out of the

2858
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:12,480
reclaim. So, that's why I'm out of the
 

2859
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,309
reclaim. So, that's why I'm out of the
shorts at the moment. Now, we're going

2860
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
shorts at the moment. Now, we're going
 

2861
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,069
shorts at the moment. Now, we're going
just let them battle because really,

2862
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:16,079
just let them battle because really,
 

2863
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,990
just let them battle because really,
where's the edge now? If we if we also

2864
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
where's the edge now? If we if we also
 

2865
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,390
where's the edge now? If we if we also
zoom out, forget map for a bit for a

2866
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:20,400
zoom out, forget map for a bit for a
 

2867
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,150
zoom out, forget map for a bit for a
minute. If we zoom out and we think

2868
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:22,160
minute. If we zoom out and we think
 

2869
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,069
minute. If we zoom out and we think
about where we are, we're right at the

2870
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:24,079
about where we are, we're right at the
 

2871
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,630
about where we are, we're right at the
mid.

2872
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:26,640
mid.
 

2873
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,990
mid.
You don't need a fib for this. You can

2874
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
You don't need a fib for this. You can
 

2875
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,829
You don't need a fib for this. You can
just look at it, right? We're right in

2876
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:29,839
just look at it, right? We're right in
 

2877
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,910
just look at it, right? We're right in
the sort of middle, right? The best edge

2878
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:31,920
the sort of middle, right? The best edge
 

2879
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,390
the sort of middle, right? The best edge
today. It was a short hit. It didn't

2880
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
today. It was a short hit. It didn't
 

2881
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,390
today. It was a short hit. It didn't
give me the A+. What was the A+? Take

2882
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:36,400
give me the A+. What was the A+? Take
 

2883
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,710
give me the A+. What was the A+? Take
that. Leave a wick. Trade down. That's

2884
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:38,720
that. Leave a wick. Trade down. That's
 

2885
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,870
that. Leave a wick. Trade down. That's
the A+. Take that low hanging fruit. It

2886
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
the A+. Take that low hanging fruit. It
 

2887
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,430
the A+. Take that low hanging fruit. It
didn't do it. So, I had to wait to make

2888
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:43,440
didn't do it. So, I had to wait to make
 

2889
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,950
didn't do it. So, I had to wait to make
sure enough were trapped. We took the

2890
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:44,960
sure enough were trapped. We took the
 

2891
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,309
sure enough were trapped. We took the
short down to here. We're now out

2892
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:46,319
short down to here. We're now out
 

2893
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,150
short down to here. We're now out
because we're not seeing strong selling.

2894
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:48,160
because we're not seeing strong selling.
 

2895
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,630
because we're not seeing strong selling.
We're seeing a battle developing here. I

2896
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:50,640
We're seeing a battle developing here. I
 

2897
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,390
We're seeing a battle developing here. I
don't want to trade in a range in the

2898
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,400
don't want to trade in a range in the
 

2899
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,950
don't want to trade in a range in the
midpoint between value area high, value

2900
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:54,960
midpoint between value area high, value
 

2901
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,630
midpoint between value area high, value
area low from previous day. We don't

2902
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,640
area low from previous day. We don't
 

2903
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,470
area low from previous day. We don't
want to trade in that range, right? We

2904
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:58,480
want to trade in that range, right? We
 

2905
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,309
want to trade in that range, right? We
want to trade up here ideally and down

2906
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
want to trade up here ideally and down
 

2907
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,670
want to trade up here ideally and down
here. Those of you who caught the longs,

2908
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:01,680
here. Those of you who caught the longs,
 

2909
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,270
here. Those of you who caught the longs,
great. Couldn't get the shorts up there,

2910
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:03,280
great. Couldn't get the shorts up there,
 

2911
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,670
great. Couldn't get the shorts up there,
got the continuation. That's it. We're

2912
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:05,680
got the continuation. That's it. We're
 

2913
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,349
got the continuation. That's it. We're
done until it gives us the next trade

2914
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:07,359
done until it gives us the next trade
 

2915
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,589
done until it gives us the next trade
set up. There's nothing for me right now

2916
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:09,599
set up. There's nothing for me right now
 

2917
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,270
set up. There's nothing for me right now
that's making me want to do anything. If

2918
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,280
that's making me want to do anything. If
 

2919
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,589
that's making me want to do anything. If
anything, I'd probably be thinking, can

2920
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:13,599
anything, I'd probably be thinking, can
 

2921
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,349
anything, I'd probably be thinking, can
bears get stuck and then trade upside,

2922
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
bears get stuck and then trade upside,
 

2923
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,109
bears get stuck and then trade upside,
but it goes against the high time frame

2924
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:17,119
but it goes against the high time frame
 

2925
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,870
but it goes against the high time frame
narrative. So, lots of like

2926
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
narrative. So, lots of like
 

2927
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,710
narrative. So, lots of like
not indecision. I'm trying to think what

2928
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:22,720
not indecision. I'm trying to think what
 

2929
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,470
not indecision. I'm trying to think what
a lack of confluence. That's the best

2930
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:24,480
a lack of confluence. That's the best
 

2931
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,750
a lack of confluence. That's the best
way of saying there is a lack of

2932
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:25,760
way of saying there is a lack of
 

2933
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,829
way of saying there is a lack of
confluence in the market at the moment.

2934
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:27,839
confluence in the market at the moment.
 

2935
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,670
confluence in the market at the moment.
Lack of confluence. How we can get rid

2936
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:29,680
Lack of confluence. How we can get rid
 

2937
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,470
Lack of confluence. How we can get rid
of these drawings. Clear drawings. There

2938
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:32,480
of these drawings. Clear drawings. There
 

2939
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,950
of these drawings. Clear drawings. There
we go. And you can also see that by the

2940
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:34,960
we go. And you can also see that by the
 

2941
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,309
we go. And you can also see that by the
mag, right? So, Google and Tesla flying

2942
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:38,319
mag, right? So, Google and Tesla flying
 

2943
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:41,829
mag, right? So, Google and Tesla flying
and you've got the rest of the mag down.

2944
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:41,839
and you've got the rest of the mag down.
 

2945
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,670
and you've got the rest of the mag down.
They're not doing they're not acting in

2946
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:43,680
They're not doing they're not acting in
 

2947
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,510
They're not doing they're not acting in
unison.

2948
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
unison.
 

2949
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:50,150
unison.
Not acting in unison.

2950
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160

 

2951
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,309

But VWAP is being defended. But 1901 100

2952
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
But VWAP is being defended. But 1901 100
 

2953
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,190
But VWAP is being defended. But 1901 100
is the level. So sellers big cells just

2954
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:57,200
is the level. So sellers big cells just
 

2955
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,870
is the level. So sellers big cells just
came in there again. So big seller just

2956
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:58,880
came in there again. So big seller just
 

2957
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,510
came in there again. So big seller just
came into 100 level and he got absorbed

2958
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,520
came into 100 level and he got absorbed
 

2959
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,670
came into 100 level and he got absorbed
again because bulls understand that if

2960
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:03,680
again because bulls understand that if
 

2961
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,630
again because bulls understand that if
they can defend this level here, they

2962
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:06,640
they can defend this level here, they
 

2963
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,309
they can defend this level here, they
can catch bears. If bears keep coming

2964
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
can catch bears. If bears keep coming
 

2965
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,910
can catch bears. If bears keep coming
flying in here like they just tried

2966
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:09,920
flying in here like they just tried
 

2967
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,230
flying in here like they just tried
again and they don't get this breakdown,

2968
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:12,240
again and they don't get this breakdown,
 

2969
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,829
again and they don't get this breakdown,
we can get that squeeze. But at the

2970
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:13,839
we can get that squeeze. But at the
 

2971
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:16,309
we can get that squeeze. But at the
moment there's no edge because structure

2972
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:16,319
moment there's no edge because structure
 

2973
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:19,510
moment there's no edge because structure
is this. Balls are defending this. Bears

2974
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:19,520
is this. Balls are defending this. Bears
 

2975
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,430
is this. Balls are defending this. Bears
are defending this. This is the rotation

2976
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:21,440
are defending this. This is the rotation
 

2977
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,829
are defending this. This is the rotation
zone. Balls get above that. There's a

2978
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
zone. Balls get above that. There's a
 

2979
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,789
zone. Balls get above that. There's a
breakout. Bears get under one n uh under

2980
01:07:26,789 --> 01:07:26,799
breakout. Bears get under one n uh under
 

2981
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:29,510
breakout. Bears get under one n uh under
90 and 100 maybe they get back down to

2982
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:29,520
90 and 100 maybe they get back down to
 

2983
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,670
90 and 100 maybe they get back down to
New York open. That's that's all there

2984
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:31,680
New York open. That's that's all there
 

2985
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,069
New York open. That's that's all there
is to do at the moment and just let them

2986
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:34,079
is to do at the moment and just let them
 

2987
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,309
is to do at the moment and just let them
battle it out in my mind. So back to

2988
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:36,319
battle it out in my mind. So back to
 

2989
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,710
battle it out in my mind. So back to
these 190s checking them. Bears coming

2990
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:38,720
these 190s checking them. Bears coming
 

2991
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,710
these 190s checking them. Bears coming
flying in here trying to force this

2992
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:40,720
flying in here trying to force this
 

2993
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,230
flying in here trying to force this
breakdown. They really want a breakdown

2994
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:42,240
breakdown. They really want a breakdown
 

2995
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,789
breakdown. They really want a breakdown
in this market. Back to PDC here, that

2996
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:44,799
in this market. Back to PDC here, that
 

2997
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:51,910
in this market. Back to PDC here, that
yellow line.

2998
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:51,920

 

2999
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,710

So, bears can take control of this

3000
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:54,720
So, bears can take control of this
 

3001
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,349
So, bears can take control of this
market if they sell through this and if

3002
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:57,359
market if they sell through this and if
 

3003
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,349
market if they sell through this and if
the uh absorption on the tape

3004
01:07:59,349 --> 01:07:59,359
the uh absorption on the tape
 

3005
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,190
the uh absorption on the tape
dissipates. But this is the level, isn't

3006
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:01,200
dissipates. But this is the level, isn't
 

3007
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:09,270
dissipates. But this is the level, isn't
it? 90 to 100 was the level.

3008
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280

 

3009
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,789

Go. They're trying to soak off it again

3010
01:08:10,789 --> 01:08:10,799
Go. They're trying to soak off it again
 

3011
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:17,430
Go. They're trying to soak off it again
these bulls.

3012
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:17,440

 

3013
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,149

But for me, this is a no trade area at

3014
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
But for me, this is a no trade area at
 

3015
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,189
But for me, this is a no trade area at
the moment while they battle out. Right,

3016
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:23,199
the moment while they battle out. Right,
 

3017
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,669
the moment while they battle out. Right,
we got that trade,

3018
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:25,679
we got that trade,
 

3019
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,110
we got that trade,
made the money. Lots of you made money

3020
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:27,120
made the money. Lots of you made money
 

3021
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,110
made the money. Lots of you made money
on the move back up. Some of you might

3022
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,120
on the move back up. Some of you might
 

3023
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,110
on the move back up. Some of you might
have taken a short before me, which is

3024
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
have taken a short before me, which is
 

3025
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,709
have taken a short before me, which is
fine. Just didn't set up for what I

3026
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:32,719
fine. Just didn't set up for what I
 

3027
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,030
fine. Just didn't set up for what I
wanted. Now, we're waiting. It's

3028
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:35,040
wanted. Now, we're waiting. It's
 

3029
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,430
wanted. Now, we're waiting. It's
possible. I can't rule out a move lower

3030
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
possible. I can't rule out a move lower
 

3031
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,990
possible. I can't rule out a move lower
here, but I'm not seeing them completely

3032
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:40,000
here, but I'm not seeing them completely
 

3033
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,550
here, but I'm not seeing them completely
take over of the tape yet.

3034
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560

 

3035
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,510

VIX is kind of in no man's land as well.

3036
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
VIX is kind of in no man's land as well.
 

3037
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,669
VIX is kind of in no man's land as well.
Back to these 90s we go again. This big

3038
01:08:49,669 --> 01:08:49,679
Back to these 90s we go again. This big
 

3039
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,550
Back to these 90s we go again. This big
level here. If bulls get out the way, we

3040
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560
level here. If bulls get out the way, we
 

3041
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,430
level here. If bulls get out the way, we
can flush. Back to 90s. Back to 90s.

3042
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:55,440
can flush. Back to 90s. Back to 90s.
 

3043
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,950
can flush. Back to 90s. Back to 90s.
Aggressive selling at these lows again

3044
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:56,960
Aggressive selling at these lows again
 

3045
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,870
Aggressive selling at these lows again
from bears.

3046
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:58,880
from bears.
 

3047
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,870
from bears.
Got to be someone soaking this tape

3048
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:00,880
Got to be someone soaking this tape
 

3049
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,390
Got to be someone soaking this tape
here. If he moves, a flush can happen

3050
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,400
here. If he moves, a flush can happen
 

3051
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,229
here. If he moves, a flush can happen
under 90s.

3052
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
under 90s.
 

3053
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,749
under 90s.
Last chance to loom for bulls otherwise

3054
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:07,759
Last chance to loom for bulls otherwise
 

3055
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:08,950
Last chance to loom for bulls otherwise
they're going to get washed out here.

3056
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:08,960
they're going to get washed out here.
 

3057
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,070
they're going to get washed out here.
It's probably going back towards that

3058
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,080
It's probably going back towards that
 

3059
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,910
It's probably going back towards that
pivot low. There you go. So washing

3060
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:11,920
pivot low. There you go. So washing
 

3061
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,829
pivot low. There you go. So washing
under 90s

3062
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839

 

3063
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,749

back to test the 90s. Bears will have to

3064
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
back to test the 90s. Bears will have to
 

3065
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,030
back to test the 90s. Bears will have to
step in here again. Otherwise, it's

3066
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:19,040
step in here again. Otherwise, it's
 

3067
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,030
step in here again. Otherwise, it's
basically a look below and fail. They're

3068
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:21,040
basically a look below and fail. They're
 

3069
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,550
basically a look below and fail. They're
stepping back in at 90s. So they're

3070
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560
stepping back in at 90s. So they're
 

3071
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,309
stepping back in at 90s. So they're
going to try and force this low now.

3072
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
going to try and force this low now.
 

3073
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,070
going to try and force this low now.
There's so many orders on the book here.

3074
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
There's so many orders on the book here.
 

3075
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,189
There's so many orders on the book here.
It's insane. Both sides of the tape.

3076
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:31,199
It's insane. Both sides of the tape.
 

3077
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:32,470
It's insane. Both sides of the tape.
Bears have got the edge at the moment

3078
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:32,480
Bears have got the edge at the moment
 

3079
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,390
Bears have got the edge at the moment
because we're under 90s and 100. Balls

3080
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
because we're under 90s and 100. Balls
 

3081
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,749
because we're under 90s and 100. Balls
will have the edge. If we go back over

3082
01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:35,759
will have the edge. If we go back over
 

3083
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,349
will have the edge. If we go back over
that, bears will get stuck. So bears

3084
01:09:37,349 --> 01:09:37,359
that, bears will get stuck. So bears
 

3085
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,510
that, bears will get stuck. So bears

3089
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,390
VWAP through the 90s, back down to this
pivot low. And if you snap that, you can

3090
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:44,400
pivot low. And if you snap that, you can
 

3091
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,149
pivot low. And if you snap that, you can
look for previous day value area low

3092
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:46,159
look for previous day value area low
 

3093
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:48,390
look for previous day value area low
again, which would be your cover point.

3094
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:48,400
again, which would be your cover point.
 

3095
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,990
again, which would be your cover point.
If you're still in the short, or you re

3096
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,000
If you're still in the short, or you re
 

3097
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,990
If you're still in the short, or you re
hit this short as we went sub 90. There

3098
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:52,000
hit this short as we went sub 90. There
 

3099
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,630
hit this short as we went sub 90. There
you go. So watch now. See how we get

3100
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:54,640
you go. So watch now. See how we get
 

3101
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,110
you go. So watch now. See how we get
thick. You'd want to see a failure under

3102
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
thick. You'd want to see a failure under
 

3103
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,950
thick. You'd want to see a failure under
60s now for a straight flush down to

01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
60s now for a straight flush down to
 

3105
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,390
60s now for a straight flush down to
here. And you want to be covering some

3106
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:00,400
here. And you want to be covering some
 

3107
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,149
here. And you want to be covering some
into here. And then you can hold runners

3108
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:02,159
into here. And then you can hold runners
 

3109
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,709
into here. And then you can hold runners
for breakdowns.

3110
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:04,719
for breakdowns.
 

3111
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,030
for breakdowns.
But this is the edge of value on the

3112
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,040
But this is the edge of value on the
 

3113
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,270
But this is the edge of value on the
current session where we are. So lots of

3114
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,280
current session where we are. So lots of
 

3115
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,950
current session where we are. So lots of
people will cover here and most will

3116
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:10,960
people will cover here and most will
 

3117
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,310
people will cover here and most will
probably cover into previous day value

3118
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:12,320
probably cover into previous day value
 

3119
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,870
probably cover into previous day value
area low.

3120
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
area low.
 

3121
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,630
area low.
Big still trying to find a bid. It's

3122
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:16,640
Big still trying to find a bid. It's
 

3123
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,470
Big still trying to find a bid. It's
kind of like up down up down up down.

3124
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
kind of like up down up down up down.
 

3125
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,070
kind of like up down up down up down.
Maybe an inverse head and shoulders or

3126
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:20,080
Maybe an inverse head and shoulders or

Maybe an inverse head and shoulders or
quasi starting to build out on a 5m

3128
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600

3129
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:28,950
quasi starting to build out on a 5m
minute. We we will see.

3130
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:28,960

 

3131
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,270

So it's the same level 90s and the 100.

3132
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
So it's the same level 90s and the 100.
 

3133
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,110
So it's the same level 90s and the 100.
If they reclaim 90s and 100 just like

3134
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
If they reclaim 90s and 100 just like
 

3135
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,870
If they reclaim 90s and 100 just like
before, alls will try and take the edge.

3136
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:36,880
before, alls will try and take the edge.
 

3137
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,950
before, alls will try and take the edge.
You can see we're see this shelf with

3138
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:38,960
You can see we're see this shelf with
 

3139
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,590
You can see we're see this shelf with
built volume straight back to 90s again.

3140
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:41,600
built volume straight back to 90s again.
 

3141
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,750
built volume straight back to 90s again.
This is the level bears need to defend

3142
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:43,760
This is the level bears need to defend
 

3143
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,430
This is the level bears need to defend
this. If they don't defend this, we will

3144
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:45,440
this. If they don't defend this, we will
 

3145
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,590
this. If they don't defend this, we will
go back into that rotational potential

3146
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
go back into that rotational potential
 

3147
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,270
go back into that rotational potential
squeeze back up to a previous day point

3148
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:49,280
squeeze back up to a previous day point
 

3149
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,350
squeeze back up to a previous day point
of control again.

3150
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:51,360

money to be made here. You're still

money to be made here. You're still
 

3159
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,390
money to be made here. You're still
trading in what's that? What's the range

trading in what's that? What's the range
 

3161
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,470
trading in what's that? What's the range
there from you can see 160 to it's a 100

really they should have defended this
 

3299
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,870

for the breakdown. They failed to defend
 

3301
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,110
for the breakdown. They failed to defend
90 to 100 for the breakdown on the

01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,120
90 to 100 for the breakdown on the
 

3303
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,950
90 to 100 for the breakdown on the

3305
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,030

3309
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,229

haven't seen follow through down here,

3310

haven't seen follow through down here,
 

3311
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,390
haven't seen follow through down here,
which is what they want. And you might

3312
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
which is what they want. And you might
 

3313
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,709
which is what they want. And you might
get a bit of a W here. And this can be

3314
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
get a bit of a W here. And this can be
 

3315
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,990
get a bit of a W here. And this can be
bullish rotation. And I I wouldn't put

3316
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:06,000
bullish rotation. And I I wouldn't put
 

3317
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,990
bullish rotation. And I I wouldn't put
it against them because why? because we

3318
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:08,000
it against them because why? because we
 

3319
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,070
it against them because why? because we
left lowhanging fruit.

3320
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,080
left lowhanging fruit.
 

3321
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,270
left lowhanging fruit.

3365
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,669
And you're going to see this rotation
over and over and over and over and

3366
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:05,679
over and over and over and over and
 

3367
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,709
over and over and over and over and
over. that strong selling that came back

01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
in here. Let's see if Mr. I'm going to
 

3371
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,390
in here. Let's see if Mr. I'm going to
soak everything you've got is still on

01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:12,400
soak everything you've got is still on
 

3373
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,709

3377
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,390

This is the key level. I'd say sort of

3408
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:01,920
This is the key level. I'd say sort of
 

3409
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,630
This is the key level. I'd say sort of
69. Let's call it 70. It's a bit of a

3412
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:07,360

01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,590
meme, isn't it? 69 is the key level.
That's where we left bearish excess

3414
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:09,600
That's where we left bearish excess
 

3415
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,750
That's where we left bearish excess

So, like I said, I am not touching these

3418
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:15,920
So, like I said, I am not touching these
 

3419
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,750
So, like I said, I am not touching these
areas, folks. I'm just calling out what

01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:21,040
going to get myself caught in these
 

3425
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,709
going to get myself caught in these

01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:22,719
areas. These are the areas where I'm
 

3427
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,750
areas. These are the areas where I'm
like, leave alone. We're not at the edge

3428
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:25,760
like, leave alone. We're not at the edge
 

3429
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,750
like, leave alone. We're not at the edge
anymore. We've we played the first

3430
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:27,760
anymore. We've we played the first
 

3431
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,550
anymore. We've we played the first
continuation. Remember, like we failed.

3432
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:30,560
continuation. Remember, like we failed.
 

3433
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,310
continuation. Remember, like we failed.
We effectively played the first bounce

3434
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
We effectively played the first bounce
 

3435
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,149
We effectively played the first bounce
short. Once they reclaimed, I was like,

3436
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
short. Once they reclaimed, I was like,
 

3437
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:35,110
short. Once they reclaimed, I was like,
"Okay, I'm done with it. They're going

3438
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:35,120
"Okay, I'm done with it. They're going
 

3439
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,750
"Okay, I'm done with it. They're going
to go into a battle." Maybe they rotate.

3440
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:37,760
to go into a battle." Maybe they rotate.
 

3441
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,950
to go into a battle." Maybe they rotate.
That's fine. They're going to rotate

3442
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
That's fine. They're going to rotate
 

3443
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,550
That's fine. They're going to rotate
without me if they do it. Maybe they

3444
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:40,560
without me if they do it. Maybe they
 

3445
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,990
without me if they do it. Maybe they
rotate. That's also fine. They can

3446
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:42,000
rotate. That's also fine. They can
 

3447
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,189
rotate. That's also fine. They can
rotate without me if they're going to do

3448
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:43,199
rotate without me if they're going to do
 

3449
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,229
rotate without me if they're going to do
it. I don't need every single trade. I

3450
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
it. I don't need every single trade. I
 

3451
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,350
it. I don't need every single trade. I
want the ones which are high

3452
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:47,360
want the ones which are high
 

3453
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:51,750
want the ones which are high
probability.

3454
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:51,760

 

3455

01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:56,000
So, there is definitely someone soaking
 

3459
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,229
So, there is definitely someone soaking

aggressive sell in.
But the rotations are very quick in

3466
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:06,800
But the rotations are very quick in
 

3467
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,950
But the rotations are very quick in
inside this inside this box here. So

3468
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:08,960
inside this inside this box here. So
 

3469
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,630
inside this inside this box here. So
this is sort of my leave alone box at

3474
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:14,239
that's my leave alone box. You could
 

3475
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:15,990
that's my leave alone box. You could
even argue value should be a leave alone

3476
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,000
even argue value should be a leave alone
 

3477
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,310
even argue value should be a leave alone

I won the beginning course and I
 

3503
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,350
I won the beginning course and I
completed it. Will the discount code at

3506
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:53,679
the end work on the full course and add
 

3507
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,390
the end work on the full course and add
on to I don't think it's a good question

3508
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:56,400
on to I don't think it's a good question
 

3509
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,390
on to I don't think it's a good question
go I don't think it will I think it's

3510
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:58,400
go I don't think it will I think it's
 

3511
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,470
go I don't think it will I think it's
separate and I think the sale you can

3512
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,480
separate and I think the sale you can
 

3513
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,070
separate and I think the sale you can
double check I think the sale course is

3514
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:04,080
double check I think the sale course is
 

3515
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,430
double check I think the sale course is
better because if you're doing the full

3516
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:05,440
better because if you're doing the full
 

3517
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,950
better because if you're doing the full
course

3518
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:06,960
course
 

3519
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,149
course
6120 it's probably like 150 off and if

3520
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:10,159
6120 it's probably like 150 off and if
 

3521
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:11,590
6120 it's probably like 150 off and if
you did the beginner course I think it's

3522
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:11,600
you did the beginner course I think it's
 

3523
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,590
you did the beginner course I think it's
100 off some some somewhere around like

3524
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:13,600
100 off some some somewhere around like
 

3525
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,430
100 off some some somewhere around like
that so I think the Black Friday sales

3526
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440
that so I think the Black Friday sales
 

3527
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,910
that so I think the Black Friday sales
probably saves you an extra 20 to 50

3528
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:17,920
probably saves you an extra 20 to 50
 

3529
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,149
probably saves you an extra 20 to 50

3555
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,910
every day just closed bookmap down. Oh
ninja trader. Oh that's a worry. I don't

3556

ninja trader. Oh that's a worry. I don't
 

3557
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,669
ninja trader. Oh that's a worry. I don't
know mate. That's that's a worry. Okay

3558
01:18:59,669 --> 01:18:59,679
know mate. That's that's a worry. Okay
 

3559

bulls are starting to take control. Come

3560
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
bulls are starting to take control. Come
 

3561
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,189
bulls are starting to take control. Come
back to this gray box now. Bulls are

3562
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:03,199
back to this gray box now. Bulls are
 

3563
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,790
back to this gray box now. Bulls are
starting to take control of this area

3564
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:04,800
starting to take control of this area
 

3565
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,310
starting to take control of this area
like we talked about. Bears just failed

3566
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:06,320
like we talked about. Bears just failed
 

3567
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,310
like we talked about. Bears just failed
to get that breakdown. And if you see

3568
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:08,320
to get that breakdown. And if you see
 

3569
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,030
to get that breakdown. And if you see
bullish rotation there is low hanging

3570
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:11,040
bullish rotation there is low hanging
 

3571
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,350

fruit left to go for up towards the high

3572
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:13,360
fruit left to go for up towards the high
 

3573
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,550
fruit left to go for up towards the high
of day. So here's the move back to

3574
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
of day. So here's the move back to
 

3575
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,149
of day. So here's the move back to
previous day point of control. This gray

3576
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
previous day point of control. This gray
 

3577
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,070
previous day point of control. This gray
box is your trigger. Here is a potential

3578
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:18,080
box is your trigger. Here is a potential
 

3579
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,229
box is your trigger. Here is a potential
W. If they start bidding above this,

3580
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:20,239
W. If they start bidding above this,
 

3581
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,750
W. If they start bidding above this,
they have a move back to this high of

3582
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
they have a move back to this high of
 

3583
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,910
they have a move back to this high of
day. There's no doubt about it. We've

3584
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:23,920
day. There's no doubt about it. We've
 

3585
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,590
day. There's no doubt about it. We've
just traded from the edge of range. They

3586
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:25,600
just traded from the edge of range. They
 

3587
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,030
just traded from the edge of range. They
might come to the edge of this. I said

3588
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:27,040
might come to the edge of this. I said
 

3589
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,990
might come to the edge of this. I said
I'm trying to leave this alone, but it's

3590
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,000
I'm trying to leave this alone, but it's
 

3591
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,630
I'm trying to leave this alone, but it's
uh it's moving very very quick on the

3592
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:32,640
uh it's moving very very quick on the
 

3593
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,430
uh it's moving very very quick on the
tape. The candles might not look big,

3594
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:35,440
tape. The candles might not look big,
 

3595
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,669
tape. The candles might not look big,
um, but they're of decent size and we

3596
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:37,679
um, but they're of decent size and we
 

3597
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:40,870
um, but they're of decent size and we
are moving fast on the tape. Your ATR

3598
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
are moving fast on the tape. Your ATR
 

3599
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,350
are moving fast on the tape. Your ATR
has been consistently up about 32 points

3600
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
has been consistently up about 32 points
 

3601
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,270
has been consistently up about 32 points
per M1 candle. That is significant

3602
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:45,280
per M1 candle. That is significant
 

3603
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,910
per M1 candle. That is significant
folks. Most retail traders use a 20 to

3604
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,920
folks. Most retail traders use a 20 to
 

3605
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,910
folks. Most retail traders use a 20 to
30 point stop. That will not work in

3606
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:49,920
30 point stop. That will not work in
 

3607
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,590
30 point stop. That will not work in
this market. You will get wicked out in

3608
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:51,600
this market. You will get wicked out in
 

3609
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,070
this market. You will get wicked out in
a second.

3610
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:54,080
a second.
 

3611
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,590
a second.
So let's see here back towards these

3612
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:55,600
So let's see here back towards these
 

3613
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,510
So let's see here back towards these
VWAPS which are flat on the day. We just

3614
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:57,520
VWAPS which are flat on the day. We just
 

3615
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,189
VWAPS which are flat on the day. We just
defended previous day point of control.

3616
01:19:59,189 --> 01:19:59,199
defended previous day point of control.
 

3617
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,669
defended previous day point of control.
I would say bulls potentially had the

3618
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:01,679
I would say bulls potentially had the
 

3619
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,750
I would say bulls potentially had the
ability to send this higher at this

3620
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:03,760
ability to send this higher at this
 

3621
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,750
ability to send this higher at this
point after bears failed to get their

3622
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
point after bears failed to get their
 

3623
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,350
point after bears failed to get their
rotation underneath this. So if bulls

3624
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,360
rotation underneath this. So if bulls
 

3625
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,590
rotation underneath this. So if bulls
defend sort of the edge of this, where's

3626
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:09,600
defend sort of the edge of this, where's
 

3627
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,350
defend sort of the edge of this, where's
that last area they came in? I'd say

3628
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
that last area they came in? I'd say
 

3629
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,149
that last area they came in? I'd say
bulls need to defend 25. If bulls defend

3630
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
bulls need to defend 25. If bulls defend
 

3631
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,310
bulls need to defend 25. If bulls defend
25s, there's probably a squeeze higher

3632
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
25s, there's probably a squeeze higher
 

3633
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,149
25s, there's probably a squeeze higher
here developing. If bulls can defend

3634
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:18,159
here developing. If bulls can defend
 

3635
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,630
here developing. If bulls can defend
25s, there's probably a squeeze higher

3636
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:20,640
25s, there's probably a squeeze higher
 

3637
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,790
25s, there's probably a squeeze higher
developing. That would be my guess. If

3638
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:22,800
developing. That would be my guess. If
 

3639
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,990
developing. That would be my guess. If
they can't defend 25s, then the range uh

3640
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,000
they can't defend 25s, then the range uh
 

3641
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,229
they can't defend 25s, then the range uh
gets rotated in more. But again, I'm not

3642
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
gets rotated in more. But again, I'm not
 

3643
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,070
gets rotated in more. But again, I'm not
trading this currently. I would consider

3644
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,080
trading this currently. I would consider
 

3645
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,310
trading this currently. I would consider
a trade back up if they look really

3646
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:32,320
a trade back up if they look really
 

3647
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:39,430
a trade back up if they look really
strong.

3648
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,440

 

3649
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,470

If they could defend 25s, maybe if I see

3650
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
If they could defend 25s, maybe if I see
 

3651
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,229
If they could defend 25s, maybe if I see
them soak 25, but you wouldn't want to

3652
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:44,239
them soak 25, but you wouldn't want to
 

3653
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,630
them soak 25, but you wouldn't want to
get knifed through, so let it defend a

3654
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:46,640
get knifed through, so let it defend a
 

3655
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,790
get knifed through, so let it defend a
bit, I would say.

3656
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:48,800
bit, I would say.
 

3657
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,229
bit, I would say.
That previous day point of control was

3658
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:50,239
That previous day point of control was
 

3659
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:54,390
That previous day point of control was
being defended by bears.

3660
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:54,400

 

3661
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,030

Where did they come flying in? Maybe

3662
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,040
Where did they come flying in? Maybe
 

3663
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,510
Where did they come flying in? Maybe
even as low as 10 again. I don't like

3664
01:20:59,510 --> 01:20:59,520
even as low as 10 again. I don't like
 

3665
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,030
even as low as 10 again. I don't like
that. Back down to 10 will allow

3666
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,040
that. Back down to 10 will allow
 

3667
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:09,110
that. Back down to 10 will allow
rotation.

3668
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120

 

3669
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,750

Ugly, ugly, ugly. But balls have the

3670
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
Ugly, ugly, ugly. But balls have the
 

3671
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,750
Ugly, ugly, ugly. But balls have the
chance here. They have the chance here

3672
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:13,760
chance here. They have the chance here
 

3673
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,390
chance here. They have the chance here
to do something.

3674
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
to do something.
 

3675
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,270
to do something.
25s ideally hold 10 at the worst case.

3676
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
25s ideally hold 10 at the worst case.
 

3677
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,149
25s ideally hold 10 at the worst case.
Under that, they're in trouble.

3678
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:22,159
Under that, they're in trouble.
 

3679
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,229
Under that, they're in trouble.
But you're just you're in this sort of

3680
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:24,239
But you're just you're in this sort of
 

3681
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,149
But you're just you're in this sort of
edge of this potential W. They might

3682
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
edge of this potential W. They might
 

3683
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:27,430
edge of this potential W. They might
come all the way down to here, which

3684
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:27,440
come all the way down to here, which
 

3685
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,709
come all the way down to here, which
would be not very nice, and it would

3686
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:28,719
would be not very nice, and it would
 

3687
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,709
would be not very nice, and it would
give bears a sniff to go lower. So,

3688
01:21:30,709 --> 01:21:30,719
give bears a sniff to go lower. So,
 

3689
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,790
give bears a sniff to go lower. So,
what's doing timing wise as well? 30

3690
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:32,800
what's doing timing wise as well? 30
 

3691
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,470
what's doing timing wise as well? 30
minute bar. those last 30 minute bar of

01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:36,480
minute bar. those last 30 minute bar of
 

3693
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,870

those last two bars. Oh god, it's very

3694
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
those last two bars. Oh god, it's very
 

3695
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,830
those last two bars. Oh god, it's very
ugly out here, folks. This is uh about

3696
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:41,840
ugly out here, folks. This is uh about
 

3697
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,750
ugly out here, folks. This is uh about
as bad as you get in terms of range

3698
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:43,760
as bad as you get in terms of range
 

3699
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,990
as bad as you get in terms of range
rotation, but I would say bulls

3700
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,000
rotation, but I would say bulls
 

3701
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,350
rotation, but I would say bulls
currently have the edge to go higher.

3702
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:51,360

 

3703
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,189

Bulls have the edge to go higher all the

3704
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:53,199
Bulls have the edge to go higher all the
 

3705
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,870
Bulls have the edge to go higher all the
time. They can defend. There's that 25

3706
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:54,880
time. They can defend. There's that 25
 

3707
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,189
time. They can defend. There's that 25
move we just talked about and they

3708
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:57,199
move we just talked about and they
 

3709
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,590
move we just talked about and they
defended it. If they defend that,

3710
01:21:59,590 --> 01:21:59,600
defended it. If they defend that,
 

3711
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,189
defended it. If they defend that,
they're fine. Otherwise, we go 110 and

3712
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:01,199
they're fine. Otherwise, we go 110 and
 

3713
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:11,270
they're fine. Otherwise, we go 110 and
then they're in trouble.

3714
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280

 

3715
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,830

for me. I'm interested in bullish moves
over here. If they held this and then

3786
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:40,480
over here. If they held this and then
 

3787
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,149
over here. If they held this and then
did it even better. Now bulls are stuck

did it even better. Now bulls are stuck
 

3789
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,830

possible this is a horrible uh market to

01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:40,800
book the delta on the uh on the DOM and
 

3853
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,790
book the delta on the uh on the DOM and
then on footprint I'm only really look I

3854
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:42,800
then on footprint I'm only really look I
 

3855
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,390
then on footprint I'm only really look I
only really care about the delta when

3856
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:44,400
only really care about the delta when
 

3857
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,990
only really care about the delta when
I'm looking at areas of interest I don't

3858
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:46,000
I'm looking at areas of interest I don't
 

3859
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,070
I'm looking at areas of interest I don't
care otherwise right I don't need to if

3860
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:48,080
care otherwise right I don't need to if
 

3861
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,350
care otherwise right I don't need to if
you look at it all the time you will

3862
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
you look at it all the time you will
 

3863
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,990
you look at it all the time you will
become exhausted because it's so much

3864
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:52,000
become exhausted because it's so much
 

3865
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,229
become exhausted because it's so much
data for your brain to absorb what I

3866
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:54,239
data for your brain to absorb what I
 

3867
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,149
data for your brain to absorb what I
care about is when we get into levels of

3868
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:56,159
care about is when we get into levels of
 

3869
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,990
care about is when we get into levels of
interest if I'm thinking about a trade

3870
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:58,000
interest if I'm thinking about a trade
 

3871
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,910
interest if I'm thinking about a trade
how we're acting in all of this right

3872
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:01,920
how we're acting in all of this right
 

3873
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,590
how we're acting in all of this right
it's less interesting you can see the

3874
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
it's less interesting you can see the
 

3875
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,910
it's less interesting you can see the
key areas like the 90 to 110 or 90 to

3876
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:07,920
key areas like the 90 to 110 or 90 to

01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,510
key areas like the 90 to 110 or 90 to

3879
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,189

01:26:11,189 --> 01:26:11,199
like even from this big down close
 

3881
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,830
like even from this big down close
candle PC on that was at 100 right and

3882
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:13,840
candle PC on that was at 100 right and
 

3883
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,550
candle PC on that was at 100 right and
if you look left was under over under

that 100 um and then if you look at the
 

3889
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,189
that 100 um and then if you look at the
lows we've got excess selling at the

3890
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:23,199
lows we've got excess selling at the
 

3891
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:24,550
lows we've got excess selling at the

3892
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:24,560
lows and if you look at the highs well
 

3893
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,470
lows and if you look at the highs well
we had a bit of excess buying up at

3894
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:26,480
we had a bit of excess buying up at
 

3895
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,750
we had a bit of excess buying up at
those highs into 50 at 10:29 this

3896
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760
those highs into 50 at 10:29 this
 

3897
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,189
those highs into 50 at 10:29 this
But we're just rotating between the two

3898
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:31,199
But we're just rotating between the two
 

3899
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:32,709
But we're just rotating between the two
extremes. No one's winning here. We're

3900
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:32,719
extremes. No one's winning here. We're
 

3901
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,830
extremes. No one's winning here. We're
just testing each level.

3902
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:35,840
just testing each level.
 

3903
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,390
just testing each level.
Cumulative delta, uh, I don't care about

3904
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:38,400
Cumulative delta, uh, I don't care about
 

3905
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,830
Cumulative delta, uh, I don't care about
so much. I care about more about the

3906
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:39,840
so much. I care about more about the
 

3907
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,110
so much. I care about more about the
delta on each chart. You could use

3908
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:41,120
delta on each chart. You could use
 

3909
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,189
delta on each chart. You could use
cumulative delta. I have it on a fivem

3910
01:26:43,189 --> 01:26:43,199
cumulative delta. I have it on a fivem
 

3911
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,790
cumulative delta. I have it on a fivem
minute, but I don't really reference it

3912
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
minute, but I don't really reference it
 

3913
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,310
minute, but I don't really reference it
much. You could use it if you were

3914
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
much. You could use it if you were
 

3915
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,550
much. You could use it if you were
looking for, you know, divergence

3916
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
looking for, you know, divergence
 

3917
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,149
looking for, you know, divergence
between the delta. But I'm more

3918
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:50,159
between the delta. But I'm more
 

3919
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:52,310
between the delta. But I'm more
interested in, you know, support and

3920
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,320
interested in, you know, support and
 

3921
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,629
interested in, you know, support and
resistance or supply and demand zones in

3922
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:54,639
resistance or supply and demand zones in
 

3923
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,310
resistance or supply and demand zones in
leaving excess and trading away from

3924
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:56,320
leaving excess and trading away from
 

3925
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,310
leaving excess and trading away from
that zone. or if I'm looking for a

3926
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:58,320
that zone. or if I'm looking for a
 

3927
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,390
that zone. or if I'm looking for a
pullback into say we're looking for that

3928
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:00,400
pullback into say we're looking for that
 

3929
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,070
pullback into say we're looking for that
first pullback like we did this morning

3930
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
first pullback like we did this morning
 

3931
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,750
first pullback like we did this morning
when I saw excess on those buyers up

3932
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:03,760
when I saw excess on those buyers up
 

3933
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,709
when I saw excess on those buyers up
there. You're not going to see enough

3934
01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:04,719
there. You're not going to see enough
 

3935
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,830
there. You're not going to see enough
info on cumulative delta. I don't think

3936
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:07,840
info on cumulative delta. I don't think
 

3937
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,510
info on cumulative delta. I don't think
unless you're looking for a trend or

3938
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:09,520
unless you're looking for a trend or
 

3939
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,149
unless you're looking for a trend or
reversion trade. Um

3940
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:12,159
reversion trade. Um
 

3941
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:15,270
reversion trade. Um
I'm more interested in a quicker moves

3942
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:15,280
I'm more interested in a quicker moves
 

3943
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:20,070
I'm more interested in a quicker moves
so to speak. So I'm I want more detail

3944
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:20,080
so to speak. So I'm I want more detail
 

3945
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,229
so to speak. So I'm I want more detail
than a CBD.

3946
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
than a CBD.
 

3947
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,310
than a CBD.
But you know each their own. It will

3948
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
But you know each their own. It will
 

3949
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,030
But you know each their own. It will
provide you good information. No doubt

3950
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,040
provide you good information. No doubt
 

3951
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,110
provide you good information. No doubt
about it.

3952
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:29,120
about it.
 

3953
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,189
about it.
But uh yeah, I'm more interested in

3954
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
But uh yeah, I'm more interested in
 

3955
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,990
But uh yeah, I'm more interested in
what's happening inside each candle in

3956
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:34,000
what's happening inside each candle in
 

3957
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:44,629
what's happening inside each candle in
in key areas.

3958
01:27:44,629 --> 01:27:44,639

 

3959
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:48,149

Um well, do you mean on winning

3960
01:27:48,149 --> 01:27:48,159
Um well, do you mean on winning
 

3961
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,149
Um well, do you mean on winning
percentages, Michael, or do you mean on

3962
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
percentages, Michael, or do you mean on
 

3963
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:51,750
percentages, Michael, or do you mean on
uh

3964
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:51,760
uh
 

3965
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,910
uh
uh do you mean on financial? I mean

3966
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:53,920
uh do you mean on financial? I mean
 

3967
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,550
uh do you mean on financial? I mean
definitely swing positions more.

3968
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:56,560
definitely swing positions more.
 

3969
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,189
definitely swing positions more.
not necessarily on winning percentages,

3970
01:27:59,189 --> 01:27:59,199
not necessarily on winning percentages,
 

3971
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:02,390
not necessarily on winning percentages,
but uh bigger growth obviously. I mean,

3972
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:02,400
but uh bigger growth obviously. I mean,
 

3973
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,870
but uh bigger growth obviously. I mean,
my biggest winner this year was a 500%

3974
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:04,880
my biggest winner this year was a 500%
 

3975
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,310
my biggest winner this year was a 500%
trade over two or three months.

3976
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:08,320
trade over two or three months.
 

3977
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,470
trade over two or three months.
So, like you will make more money in

3978
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:10,480
So, like you will make more money in
 

3979
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,709
So, like you will make more money in
swing positions because you're because

3980
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
swing positions because you're because
 

3981
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:14,470
swing positions because you're because
you're willing to sit in it, right? And

3982
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:14,480
you're willing to sit in it, right? And
 

3983
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,189
you're willing to sit in it, right? And
normally I'm net long. When I'm when I'm

3984
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:17,199
normally I'm net long. When I'm when I'm
 

3985
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,950
normally I'm net long. When I'm when I'm
in a swing position, I want to be long

3986
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:18,960
in a swing position, I want to be long
 

3987
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,629
in a swing position, I want to be long
as much as possible until we're going

3988
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:20,639
as much as possible until we're going
 

3989
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,070
as much as possible until we're going
into like a bearish market. And even

3990
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:22,080
into like a bearish market. And even
 

3991
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,990
into like a bearish market. And even
then, I'm very careful. Look, if I was

3992
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
then, I'm very careful. Look, if I was
 

3993
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,390
then, I'm very careful. Look, if I was
going to take a swing on SQ,

3994
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:26,400
going to take a swing on SQ,
 

3995
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,910
going to take a swing on SQ,
I'd want to be very careful right now.

3996
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:27,920
I'd want to be very careful right now.
 

3997
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,229
I'd want to be very careful right now.
But I'm happy to bid in long in big

3998
01:28:30,229 --> 01:28:30,239
But I'm happy to bid in long in big
 

3999

names overall because chances are over a
 

4001
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,229

20 year career, right? I can sit in them
 

4003

20 year career, right? I can sit in them
and they're going to go up if they're

4004
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:37,360

good names.

4006
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:39,280
good names.
 

4007
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,550

still long from 158. Again, I sold some
 

4019
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,790
still long from 158. Again, I sold some
into the 270s. That was uh PayPal was

4020
01:28:58,790 --> 01:28:58,800
into the 270s. That was uh PayPal was
 

4021
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,629
into the 270s. That was uh PayPal was
flat on the year. Took that off. My only

4022
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:00,639
flat on the year. Took that off. My only
 

4023
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,709
flat on the year. Took that off. My only
loser this year, which was a tiny loser,

4024
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:02,719
loser this year, which was a tiny loser,
 

4025
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,830
loser this year, which was a tiny loser,
was OCR. Everything else uh swing wise

4026
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:05,840
was OCR. Everything else uh swing wise
 

4027
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,750
was OCR. Everything else uh swing wise
has been a big winner. Not surprising

4028
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:07,760
has been a big winner. Not surprising
 

4029
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,350
has been a big winner. Not surprising
considering we've been in a very bullish

4030
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
considering we've been in a very bullish
 

4031
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,590
considering we've been in a very bullish
market, right? So, swing longs will pay

4032
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:11,600
market, right? So, swing longs will pay
 

4033
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,709
market, right? So, swing longs will pay
you much more than day trade longs

4034
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:14,719
you much more than day trade longs
 

4035
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:19,270
you much more than day trade longs
in terms of percentage gains.

4036
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,280

 

4037
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,470

you trade SQ options. That makes sense.

4038
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:22,480
you trade SQ options. That makes sense.
 

4039
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,110
you trade SQ options. That makes sense.
I mean, you probably get better.

Q's than you would on calls on SQ

4046
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:34,480
Q's than you would on calls on SQ
 

4047
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:43,350
Q's than you would on calls on SQ
because of how it's built.

4048
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:43,360

 

4049
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,629

Not going to try and guess on this

4066
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,080
Not going to try and guess on this
 

4067
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,310
Not going to try and guess on this
range. Yeah, I'd like I'm the same. I'm

4068
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:08,320
range. Yeah, I'd like I'm the same. I'm
 

4069
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,030
range. Yeah, I'd like I'm the same. I'm
not up as much as you, but range just

4070
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,040
not up as much as you, but range just
 

4071
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,629
not up as much as you, but range just
looks a bit messy. VIX is trying to get

looks a bit messy. VIX is trying to get
 

4073
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,110
looks a bit messy. VIX is trying to get
going here. Like you I'd look at this

4074
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:15,120
going here. Like you I'd look at this
 

4075
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,669
going here. Like you I'd look at this
and be like downside's coming. But like

4076
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:17,679
and be like downside's coming. But like
 

4077
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,669
and be like downside's coming. But like
there's been someone soaking the bid all

4078
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
there's been someone soaking the bid all
 

4079
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,270
there's been someone soaking the bid all
the day all day. It just depends if he

4080
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:21,280
the day all day. It just depends if he
 

4081
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,830
the day all day. It just depends if he
pulls if he pulls his bid. Yeah. Maybe

4082
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:23,840
pulls if he pulls his bid. Yeah. Maybe
 

4083
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,270
pulls if he pulls his bid. Yeah. Maybe
we trade outside current value area if

4084
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,280
we trade outside current value area if
 

4085
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,950
we trade outside current value area if
he pulls his bid. But do we look below

4086
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:28,960
he pulls his bid. But do we look below
 

4087
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,350
he pulls his bid. But do we look below
and fail outside of here? Right. Do we

4088
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:31,360
and fail outside of here? Right. Do we
 

4089
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,430
and fail outside of here? Right. Do we
look below and fail or do bears get that

4090
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:33,440
look below and fail or do bears get that
 

4091
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,350
look below and fail or do bears get that
full rotation? I don't know right now.

4092
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:35,360
full rotation? I don't know right now.
 

4093
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,590
full rotation? I don't know right now.
But all I do know is we've built a huge

4094
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:37,600
But all I do know is we've built a huge
 

4095
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,030
But all I do know is we've built a huge
amount of volume in here. We've been

4096
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:39,040
amount of volume in here. We've been
 

4097
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,950
amount of volume in here. We've been
here

4098
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:40,960

Bulls are not seeing that breakout. And
this is the range. And I'll tell you,

4106
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:50,400
this is the range. And I'll tell you,
 

4107
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,470
this is the range. And I'll tell you,
there's a lot of newbie traders who got

4108
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480
there's a lot of newbie traders who got
 

4109
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,470
there's a lot of newbie traders who got
short here and lost and got long here

4110
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:54,480
short here and lost and got long here
 

4111
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,830
short here and lost and got long here
and lost and tried to short here again

4112

this is how we build liquidity for a

4118
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:01,280
this is how we build liquidity for a
 

4119
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,870
this is how we build liquidity for a
bigger break. Either a breakout or a

4120
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:02,880
bigger break. Either a breakout or a
 

4121
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,870
bigger break. Either a breakout or a
fail breakout will come. It's a matter

4122
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
fail breakout will come. It's a matter
 

4123
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,629
fail breakout will come. It's a matter
of time whether we're here for it or

4124
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:06,639
of time whether we're here for it or
 

4125
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:11,669
of time whether we're here for it or
not.

01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:19,910
Jack, have you Here's a question for
you. Have you ever traded the um

4130

um
 

4135
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,629
um
for like the quantum names? I'm trying

4136
01:31:26,629 --> 01:31:26,639
for like the quantum names? I'm trying
 

4137
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,110
for like the quantum names? I'm trying
to think what they are

4138
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:29,120
to think what they are
 

4139
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,870
to think what they are
like the equivalent of being uh short

4140
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:32,880
like the equivalent of being uh short
 

4141
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,310
like the equivalent of being uh short
because they've got some names which are

4142
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:34,320
because they've got some names which are
 

4143
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:38,229
because they've got some names which are
like short IN short NQ short those kind

4144
01:31:38,229 --> 01:31:38,239
like short IN short NQ short those kind
 

4145
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,470
like short IN short NQ short those kind
of names or long them and you can take

4146
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:40,480
of names or long them and you can take
 

4147
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,070
of names or long them and you can take
the short side on them because they they

4148
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:42,080
the short side on them because they they
 

4149
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,910
the short side on them because they they
will pay

4150
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:43,920
will pay
 

4151
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,550
will pay
mega if you can time it well

4152
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:48,560

 

4153
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,709

like I was long GL and it didn't really

4154
01:31:50,709 --> 01:31:50,719
like I was long GL and it didn't really
 

4155
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,870
like I was long GL and it didn't really
pay much if we look at it right so I was

4156
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:52,880
pay much if we look at it right so I was
 

4157
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,430
pay much if we look at it right so I was
long GLL this here,

01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
long GLL this here,
 

4159
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,070
long GLL this here,
right? Why was I long this? I was long

4160
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,080
right? Why was I long this? I was long
 

4161
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,149
right? Why was I long this? I was long
this once gold faded, right? So, this is

4162
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:02,159
this once gold faded, right? So, this is
 

4163
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,070
this once gold faded, right? So, this is
a short gold ETF. I was long for this

4164
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,080
a short gold ETF. I was long for this
 

4165
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,709
a short gold ETF. I was long for this
move, but I mean that's nothing, you

4166
01:32:06,709 --> 01:32:06,719
move, but I mean that's nothing, you
 

4167
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:09,590
move, but I mean that's nothing, you
know? It just shows because it these all

4168
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:09,600
know? It just shows because it these all
 

4169
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,790
know? It just shows because it these all
in include like the theta and decay.

4170
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:12,800
in include like the theta and decay.
 

4171
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,430
in include like the theta and decay.
Same as SQ and TQS. People don't

4172
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:15,440
Same as SQ and TQS. People don't
 

4173
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,110
Same as SQ and TQS. People don't
understand that it won't it's triple

4174
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,120
understand that it won't it's triple
 

4175
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,750
understand that it won't it's triple
leverage, but it also uh includes the

4176
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:19,760
leverage, but it also uh includes the
 

4177
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:29,189
leverage, but it also uh includes the
options market.

4178
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:29,199

 

4179
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,590

Vick starting to try and go here through

4180
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:31,600
Vick starting to try and go here through
 

4181
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,270
Vick starting to try and go here through
the 21s. It's coming up to its higher

4182
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:33,280
the 21s. It's coming up to its higher
 

4183
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,189
the 21s. It's coming up to its higher
day and it's New York open. VIX is

4184
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:35,199
day and it's New York open. VIX is
 

4185
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:38,070
day and it's New York open. VIX is
trying to go here.

4186
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
trying to go here.
 

4187
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,470
trying to go here.
Got you, Jack. Yeah, makes sense. Makes

4188
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:40,480
Got you, Jack. Yeah, makes sense. Makes
 

4189
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:48,709
Got you, Jack. Yeah, makes sense. Makes
sense.

4190
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719

 

4191
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:53,510

Yeah, that's right. Locky.

4192
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:53,520

 

4193
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,390

All right, I'm just going to use a

4194
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:54,400
All right, I'm just going to use a
 

4195
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,669
All right, I'm just going to use a
bathroom here. Be careful. You're at the

4196
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:55,679
bathroom here. Be careful. You're at the
 

4197
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,110
bathroom here. Be careful. You're at the
edge of the range. Probably once I go,

4198
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
edge of the range. Probably once I go,
 

4199
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,390
edge of the range. Probably once I go,
you get a move. It's always the way.

4200
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:58,400
you get a move. It's always the way.
 

4201
01:32:58,400 --> 01:37:16,470
you get a move. It's always the way.
I'll be right back.

4202
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:16,480

 

4203
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,350

Okay. Still in this range.

4204
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
Okay. Still in this range.
 

4205
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,950
Okay. Still in this range.
Ball's probably just taken over the edge

4206
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:20,960
Ball's probably just taken over the edge
 

4207
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,149
Ball's probably just taken over the edge
here. Let me have a look. Obviously, I

4208
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:22,159
here. Let me have a look. Obviously, I
 

4209
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:23,590
here. Let me have a look. Obviously, I
haven't been here to read the order flow

4210
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:23,600
haven't been here to read the order flow
 

4211
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,590
haven't been here to read the order flow
for you. Yes.

4212
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:25,600
for you. Yes.
 

4213
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,990
for you. Yes.
Uh, yes. Above 80s, above 280s, bulls

4214
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,000
Uh, yes. Above 80s, above 280s, bulls
 

4215
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,790
Uh, yes. Above 80s, above 280s, bulls
have taken over the edge there. So

4216
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:32,800
have taken over the edge there. So
 

4217
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:38,390
have taken over the edge there. So
that's what balls need to defend now.

4218
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:38,400

 

4219
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:43,350

Right time. Yeah.

4220
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360

 

4221
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,870

And if you're struggling with this, if

4222
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:44,880
And if you're struggling with this, if
 

4223
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,070
And if you're struggling with this, if
you're looking at this getting chopped

4224
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:46,080
you're looking at this getting chopped
 

4225
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,790
you're looking at this getting chopped
up because you're struggling to identify

4226
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:48,800
up because you're struggling to identify
 

4227
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,390
up because you're struggling to identify
the edges of the range or anything like

4228
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:50,400
the edges of the range or anything like
 

4229
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,189
the edges of the range or anything like
that, just go to a higher time frame.

4230
01:37:53,189 --> 01:37:53,199
that, just go to a higher time frame.
 

4231
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:54,870
that, just go to a higher time frame.
All right? Just go to a higher time

4232
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
All right? Just go to a higher time
 

4233
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,830
All right? Just go to a higher time
frame. Don't get pulled into tick for

4234
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:57,840
frame. Don't get pulled into tick for
 

4235
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,950
frame. Don't get pulled into tick for
tick or anything like that. If you're

4236
01:37:58,950 --> 01:37:58,960
tick or anything like that. If you're
 

4237
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,629
tick or anything like that. If you're
struggling, you can just go to even an

4238
01:38:00,629 --> 01:38:00,639
struggling, you can just go to even an
 

4239
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:06,229
struggling, you can just go to even an
M5. Just zoom into this.

4240
01:38:06,229 --> 01:38:06,239

 

4241
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:07,750

All right, there's nothing to do here,

All right, there's nothing to do here,
 

4243
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,229
All right, there's nothing to do here,
folks. This is your range. You can see

folks. This is your range. You can see
 

4245
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,070
folks. This is your range. You can see
it on an M5. It's about as clear as you

4246
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:12,080
it on an M5. It's about as clear as you
 

4247
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,629
it on an M5. It's about as clear as you
can get. There's your range, right? Edge

can get. There's your range, right? Edge
 

4249

you're going to get, right? No need to

you're going to get, right? No need to
 

4257
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,750
you're going to get, right? No need to

Let's have a look at the mag. Google
still going. Google is still going.

Remember, they've got a lowhanging fruit

4268
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:37,199
Remember, they've got a lowhanging fruit
 

4269
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,830
Remember, they've got a lowhanging fruit
if they can get out of this range that

01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:39,840
if they can get out of this range that
 

4271
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,510
if they can get out of this range that
they've created. Bulls have low hanging

4272
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520
they've created. Bulls have low hanging
 

4273
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,709
they've created. Bulls have low hanging
fruit to go for higher. It's a big if,

4274
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:44,719
fruit to go for higher. It's a big if,
 

4275
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,870
fruit to go for higher. It's a big if,
but that's what they're looking to do.

Every push to the top of the range,

Every push to the top of the range,
guess what? It's being sold. Every push

01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,350
to the bottom of the range, guess what?
It's being bought. Once we get out of

It's being bought. Once we get out of
 

4285

It's being bought. Once we get out of
this range, this gray box, there is a

01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,030
this range, this gray box, there is a
completion up here. If the mag's going

4288
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,040
completion up here. If the mag's going
 

4289
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,790
completion up here. If the mag's going
to find a bit. I tell you what, Vicks

4290
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:58,800
to find a bit. I tell you what, Vicks
 

4291

push up
to VW up. So that gray box still holding

to VW up. So that gray box still holding
 

4311

to VW up. So that gray box still holding
them down. And back down we go. So we're

them down. And back down we go. So we're
 

4313
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,830
them down. And back down we go. So we're
going to test the 80s again. Look how

4314
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:35,840
going to test the 80s again. Look how
 

4315
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,149
going to test the 80s again. Look how
quickly it happens, right? It's crazy,

4316
01:39:38,149 --> 01:39:38,159
quickly it happens, right? It's crazy,
 

4317
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:40,709
quickly it happens, right? It's crazy,
isn't it? VIX instantly found a bid

4318
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:40,719
isn't it? VIX instantly found a bid
 

4319
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,870
isn't it? VIX instantly found a bid
there.

4320
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:44,880

 

4321
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,950

Range to range to range to range to

4322
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:46,960
Range to range to range to range to
 

4323
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,629
Range to range to range to range to
range to range to range. Is anything

4324
01:39:48,629 --> 01:39:48,639
range to range to range. Is anything
 

4325
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,310
range to range to range. Is anything
going to change? This is uh someone got

4326
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:50,320
going to change? This is uh someone got
 

4327
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,070
going to change? This is uh someone got
stuck up there on that last move. That

4328
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:52,080
stuck up there on that last move. That
 

4329
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:57,270
stuck up there on that last move. That
is for sure.

4330
01:39:57,270 --> 01:39:57,280

 

4331
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,510

We just test the 80s. Just shy of the

4332
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
We just test the 80s. Just shy of the
 

4333
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:10,390
We just test the 80s. Just shy of the
80s.

4334
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,400

 

4335
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,870

Back to the 15s.

4336
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:12,880
Back to the 15s.
 

4337
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,470
Back to the 15s.
Where did that big seller come in?

4338
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:16,480
Where did that big seller come in?
 

4339
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,590
Where did that big seller come in?
25s.

4340
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:19,600

 

4341
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:30,149

Oh.

4342
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:30,159

 

4343
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,070

still defending.

4344
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:32,080
still defending.
 

4345
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,830
still defending.
So, we protected the 80s. Like I said,

4346
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:33,840
So, we protected the 80s. Like I said,
 

4347
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,350
So, we protected the 80s. Like I said,
it bulls defend this maybe, but like I'm

4348
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:37,360
it bulls defend this maybe, but like I'm
 

4349
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,310
it bulls defend this maybe, but like I'm
not trading in this.

4350
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,320
not trading in this.
 

4351
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,990
not trading in this.
You can see like look how big this last

4352
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:42,000
You can see like look how big this last
 

4353
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:49,830
You can see like look how big this last
candle was. Huge 50 point candle.

4354
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:49,840

 

4355
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,030

I don't know what they're doing with

4356
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:51,040
I don't know what they're doing with
 

4357
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,149
I don't know what they're doing with
this market. I don't think they know

4358
01:40:52,149 --> 01:40:52,159
this market. I don't think they know
 

4359
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,430
this market. I don't think they know
what they're doing in this market right

4360
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:53,440
what they're doing in this market right
 

4361
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,910
what they're doing in this market right
now. Probably the biggest problem

4362
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:55,920
now. Probably the biggest problem
 

4363
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,510
now. Probably the biggest problem
they've got right now is that uh Google

4364
01:40:59,510 --> 01:40:59,520
they've got right now is that uh Google
 

4365
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,750
they've got right now is that uh Google
is printing. If Google wasn't printing,

4366
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:01,760
is printing. If Google wasn't printing,
 

4367
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,109
is printing. If Google wasn't printing,
they'd probably be in a cell right now

4368
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:03,119
they'd probably be in a cell right now
 

4369
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:09,430
they'd probably be in a cell right now
to be honest. Google's still at 5%.

4370
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440

 

4371
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,350

Bears want this lower at the moment, but

4372
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
Bears want this lower at the moment, but
 

4373
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,510
Bears want this lower at the moment, but
uh here's back to the 80s. This is where

4374
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:13,520
uh here's back to the 80s. This is where
 

4375
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,470
uh here's back to the 80s. This is where
bulls last defended. This is where balls

4376
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:16,480
bulls last defended. This is where balls
 

4377
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,629
bulls last defended. This is where balls
last defended. They're not going to have

4378
01:41:18,629 --> 01:41:18,639
last defended. They're not going to have
 

4379
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,470
last defended. They're not going to have
too many more opportunities. Like at

4380
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:20,480
too many more opportunities. Like at
 

4381
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,470
too many more opportunities. Like at
some point, one of these edges is going

4382
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:22,480
some point, one of these edges is going
 

4383
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,070
some point, one of these edges is going
to let go. That's what's going to

4384
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:24,080
to let go. That's what's going to
 

4385
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,229
to let go. That's what's going to
happen. So, back to the 80s. Defending

4386
01:41:26,229 --> 01:41:26,239
happen. So, back to the 80s. Defending
 

4387
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:28,310
happen. So, back to the 80s. Defending
the 80s. At some point, someone's going

4388
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
the 80s. At some point, someone's going
 

4389
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,709
the 80s. At some point, someone's going
to lose outside this edge. One of the

4390
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:30,719
to lose outside this edge. One of the
 

4391
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:43,750
to lose outside this edge. One of the
edges.

4392
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:43,760

 

4393
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,669

It's ugly out there. We expect this

4394
01:41:45,669 --> 01:41:45,679
It's ugly out there. We expect this
 

4395
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:47,030
It's ugly out there. We expect this
though. We expect this till Wednesday.

4396
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040
though. We expect this till Wednesday.
 

4397
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,870
though. We expect this till Wednesday.
To be quite honest, I expect this till

4398
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:48,880
To be quite honest, I expect this till
 

4399
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,870
To be quite honest, I expect this till
Wednesday

4400
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:52,880

 

4401
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,270

on an M15. Would I say there's a bull

4402
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:55,280
on an M15. Would I say there's a bull
 

4403
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,910
on an M15. Would I say there's a bull
flag?

4404
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:57,920
flag?
 

4405
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,149
flag?
No,

4406
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:00,159
No,
 

4407
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:09,990
No,
I would say it's just a range.

4408
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,000

 

4409
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,990

Back down to the low side again.

4410
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:16,000

 

4411
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,149

It's all Google. This is all Google

4412
01:42:18,149 --> 01:42:18,159
It's all Google. This is all Google

It's all Google. This is all Google
holding the market up. It's impressive.

4414
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,040

4415
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,950

to start buying it as a retail because
Burkshire and Hathaways announced that

Burkshire and Hathaways announced that

Burkshire and Hathaways announced that
they probably started buying it a month

4424
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:33,040
they probably started buying it a month
 

4425
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,830
they probably started buying it a month
ago, no, weeks ago. It's why it's been

4426
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:35,840
ago, no, weeks ago. It's why it's been
 

4427
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,189
ago, no, weeks ago. It's why it's been
printing upside. Oh, we're going to buy

4428
01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:37,199
printing upside. Oh, we're going to buy
 

4429
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:40,790
printing upside. Oh, we're going to buy
it now.

4430
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:40,800

 

4431
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:50,629

Okay, then.

4432
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:50,639

 

4433
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,510

Nothing's changed here. Big shelf here

and bears will try and defend Vup. And

4442
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:13,760
and bears will try and defend Vup. And
 

4443
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,910
and bears will try and defend Vup. And
if they fail, we go back to the gray box

4444
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:15,920
if they fail, we go back to the gray box
 

4445
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,669
if they fail, we go back to the gray box
and nothing's changed. Let's we can put

4446
01:43:17,669 --> 01:43:17,679
and nothing's changed. Let's we can put
 

4447
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,189
and nothing's changed. Let's we can put
a gray box the other side if it makes it

4448
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:19,199
a gray box the other side if it makes it
 

4449
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,030
a gray box the other side if it makes it
really easy for you. I take this as the

4450
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:21,040
really easy for you. I take this as the
 

4451
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,750
really easy for you. I take this as the
edge, but let me do it.

4452
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:25,760
edge, but let me do it.
 

4453
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,350
edge, but let me do it.
Right. And there's your range rotation

4454
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:27,360
Right. And there's your range rotation
 

4455
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,149
Right. And there's your range rotation
between these two plots. Right. Now,

4456
01:43:30,149 --> 01:43:30,159
between these two plots. Right. Now,
 

4457
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:41,189
between these two plots. Right. Now,
here to here.

4458
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199

 

4459
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:48,870

You're just leaving excess both sides.

4460
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:48,880

What's an M5? Five minute. A five minute

chart. So if you see hear me say M and
 

4465
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:55,430
chart. So if you see hear me say M and
then a number it's minute minute 5

4466
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:55,440
then a number it's minute minute 5
 

4467
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:58,629
then a number it's minute minute 5
minute 1 H1 would be hourly the hourly

4468
01:43:58,629 --> 01:43:58,639
minute 1 H1 would be hourly the hourly

01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:14,229

why do I feel like we're not going to

4472
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:14,239
why do I feel like we're not going to
 

4473
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:17,510
why do I feel like we're not going to
get another trade in this session

4474
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:17,520
get another trade in this session
 

4475
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,590
get another trade in this session
probably burning a lot of options right

4476
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:19,600
probably burning a lot of options right
 

4477
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,189
probably burning a lot of options right
now I would imagine where are we trading

4478
01:44:21,189 --> 01:44:21,199
now I would imagine where are we trading
 

4479
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:24,310
now I would imagine where are we trading
at on spy. Yeah, like I said early this

4480
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:24,320
at on spy. Yeah, like I said early this

That was a huge, huge level. So, so far
 

4485
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,390
That was a huge, huge level. So, so far
defending both sides of that by the

01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:13,199

 

4513
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,430

01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:38,070
stocks, Google and Tesla. Rest of the
market, not really.

4532
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:38,080

 

4533
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,790

And the battle continues. You're in no

4534
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:40,800
And the battle continues. You're in no
 

4535
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,030
And the battle continues. You're in no
man's land here. You are in absolute no

4536
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:43,040
man's land here. You are in absolute no
 

4537
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:54,629
man's land here. You are in absolute no
man's land.

4538
01:45:54,629 --> 01:45:54,639

 

4539
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,109

Can we get one more trade? Is he going

4540
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:57,119
Can we get one more trade? Is he going
 

4541
01:45:57,119 --> 01:46:02,070
Can we get one more trade? Is he going
to give us something?

4542
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:02,080

 

4543
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,590

Definitely still someone soaking the

4544
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:03,600
Definitely still someone soaking the
 

4545
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,950
Definitely still someone soaking the
tape this morning. So,

4546
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:06,960
tape this morning. So,
 

4547
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,390
tape this morning. So,
defending the edge of this range

4548
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:08,400
defending the edge of this range
 

4549
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,669
defending the edge of this range
definitely happening.

4550
01:46:11,669 --> 01:46:11,679
definitely happening.
 

4551
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:25,109
definitely happening.
Um, but same the other side of it.

4552
01:46:25,109 --> 01:46:25,119

 

4553
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:26,550

I wonder if there's a look below and

4554
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:26,560
I wonder if there's a look below and
 

4555
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:27,990
I wonder if there's a look below and
fail. That's what I'm wondering at the

4556
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:28,000
fail. That's what I'm wondering at the
 

4557
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,189
fail. That's what I'm wondering at the
moment. The bears feel like they win and

4558
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:31,199
moment. The bears feel like they win and
 

4559
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:36,390
moment. The bears feel like they win and
then get absorbed.

4560
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:36,400

 

4561
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,830

And we have got uh

4562
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:39,840
And we have got uh
 

4563
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,390
And we have got uh
Fed talk all day as well, haven't we?

4564
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:42,400
Fed talk all day as well, haven't we?
 

4565
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,750
Fed talk all day as well, haven't we?
Are they done? What time are they done?

4566
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:43,760
Are they done? What time are they done?
 

4567
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:53,910
Are they done? What time are they done?
Next one's on at one.

4568
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:53,920

 

4569
01:46:53,920 --> 01:47:14,950

There's 80s again.

4570
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:14,960

 

4571
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:27,750

The chop continues here, folks.

4572
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:27,760

 

4573
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,109

Sub 80s. Now back towards the edge of

4574
01:47:31,109 --> 01:47:31,119
Sub 80s. Now back towards the edge of
 

4575
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,109
Sub 80s. Now back towards the edge of
this gray box. This big node here, point

4576
01:47:33,109 --> 01:47:33,119
this gray box. This big node here, point
 

4577
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:34,470
this gray box. This big node here, point
of control on the day. Remember, this is

4578
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:34,480
of control on the day. Remember, this is
 

4579
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,109
of control on the day. Remember, this is
fair value. This is the most traded

4580
01:47:37,109 --> 01:47:37,119
fair value. This is the most traded
 

4581
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:43,910
fair value. This is the most traded
level so far on the day.

4582
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920

 

4583
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,510

Seeing some aggressive selling try and

4584
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:45,520
Seeing some aggressive selling try and
 

4585
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:48,149
Seeing some aggressive selling try and
step in here and not moving lower. So

4586
01:47:48,149 --> 01:47:48,159
step in here and not moving lower. So
 

4587
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:51,750
step in here and not moving lower. So
again, probably got someone soaking on

4588
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:51,760
again, probably got someone soaking on
 

4589
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:54,070
again, probably got someone soaking on
the bid for now.

4590
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:54,080
the bid for now.
 

4591
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:55,350
the bid for now.
And I wonder if they're going to do like

4592
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,360
And I wonder if they're going to do like
 

4593
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,709
And I wonder if they're going to do like
a look below and fail at some point

4594
01:47:58,709 --> 01:47:58,719
a look below and fail at some point
 

4595
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,149
a look below and fail at some point
because you got a lot of stops down here

4596
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:00,159
because you got a lot of stops down here
 

4597
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:01,510
because you got a lot of stops down here
at this point. So, do they just keep

4598
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:01,520
at this point. So, do they just keep
 

4599
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:03,590
at this point. So, do they just keep
defending it or do they do a little stop

4600
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:03,600
defending it or do they do a little stop
 

4601
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,149
defending it or do they do a little stop
hunting and turn around?

4602
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
hunting and turn around?
 

4603
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:08,149
hunting and turn around?
I don't know, folks. I don't know what

4604
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:08,159
I don't know, folks. I don't know what
 

4605
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,669
I don't know, folks. I don't know what
they're going to do. At the moment,

4606
01:48:09,669 --> 01:48:09,679
they're going to do. At the moment,
 

4607
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:14,229
they're going to do. At the moment,
they're defending it

4608
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:14,239

 

4609
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:19,430

right the way back up.

4610
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:19,440

 

4611
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:23,750

Oh, you got to laugh

4612
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:23,760

 

4613
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:28,870

back to the 80s.

4614
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:28,880

 

4615
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,990

I feel like they're going to do a look

4616
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:30,000
I feel like they're going to do a look
 

4617
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,149
I feel like they're going to do a look
below and fail. I don't think they can

4618
01:48:32,149 --> 01:48:32,159
below and fail. I don't think they can
 

4619
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,950
below and fail. I don't think they can
keep propping it here. If if their

4620
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:34,960
keep propping it here. If if their
 

4621
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,550
keep propping it here. If if their
intention is to go higher, it's almost

4622
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:36,560
intention is to go higher, it's almost
 

4623
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,950
intention is to go higher, it's almost
like they're going to have to let more

4624
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:38,960
like they're going to have to let more
 

4625
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:43,430
like they're going to have to let more
sells come into the market first,

4626
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440

 

4627
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,790

which would be a bit like this morning,

4628
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:44,800
which would be a bit like this morning,
 

4629
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,550
which would be a bit like this morning,
but in this current range basically

4630
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:46,560
but in this current range basically
 

4631
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,629
but in this current range basically
sweep the stops underneath this range

4632
01:48:48,629 --> 01:48:48,639
sweep the stops underneath this range
 

4633
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:52,149
sweep the stops underneath this range
and then turn around is possible.

4634
01:48:52,149 --> 01:48:52,159
and then turn around is possible.
 

4635
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:54,070
and then turn around is possible.
Can imagine that playing out. Can see

4636
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:54,080
Can imagine that playing out. Can see
 

4637
01:48:54,080 --> 01:49:03,990
Can imagine that playing out. Can see
that possibly happening.

4638
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,000

 

4639
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,950

Fix just looks dreadful.

4640
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:06,960
Fix just looks dreadful.
 

4641
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,470
Fix just looks dreadful.
Fix looks like it's going to go into a

4642
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:08,480
Fix looks like it's going to go into a
 

4643
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,950
Fix looks like it's going to go into a
cell rather than uh squeeze out here to

4644
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:10,960
cell rather than uh squeeze out here to
 

4645
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,310
cell rather than uh squeeze out here to
me in my eyes.

4646
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
me in my eyes.
 

4647
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,229
me in my eyes.
Yeah, location not ideal to do much

4648
01:49:16,229 --> 01:49:16,239
Yeah, location not ideal to do much
 

4649
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:18,310
Yeah, location not ideal to do much
right now. I would say if you're a range

4650
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,320
right now. I would say if you're a range
 

4651
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,350
right now. I would say if you're a range
trader, maybe you're enjoying this.

4652
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:19,360
trader, maybe you're enjoying this.
 

4653
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:23,270
trader, maybe you're enjoying this.
Maybe some of you really like it.

4654
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:23,280
Maybe some of you really like it.
 

4655
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,270
Maybe some of you really like it.
I'd say there's probably a sweep of

4656
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:25,280
I'd say there's probably a sweep of
 

4657
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,270
I'd say there's probably a sweep of
these stops probably coming at some

4658
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:27,280
these stops probably coming at some
 

4659
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:29,830
these stops probably coming at some
point. How we doing for time? We've got

4660
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:29,840
point. How we doing for time? We've got
 

4661
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,149
point. How we doing for time? We've got
a new hourly candle coming. So maybe in

4662
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:32,159
a new hourly candle coming. So maybe in
 

4663
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:35,350
a new hourly candle coming. So maybe in
here now we get a hourly sweep. Wouldn't

4664
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,360
here now we get a hourly sweep. Wouldn't
 

4665
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,709
here now we get a hourly sweep. Wouldn't
surprise me in the slightest. Did we

4666
01:49:36,709 --> 01:49:36,719
surprise me in the slightest. Did we
 

4667
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:39,510
surprise me in the slightest. Did we
just pop them there? Not quite.

4668
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:39,520
just pop them there? Not quite.
 

4669
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,189
just pop them there? Not quite.
I still think they're going to run these

4670
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:41,199
I still think they're going to run these
 

4671
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:42,950
I still think they're going to run these
before moving higher, but I could easily

4672
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:42,960
before moving higher, but I could easily
 

4673
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,550
before moving higher, but I could easily
be wrong. I think they probably want to

4674
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
be wrong. I think they probably want to
 

4675
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:47,030
be wrong. I think they probably want to
move higher today and they probably need

4676
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:47,040
move higher today and they probably need
 

4677
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,430
move higher today and they probably need
to come and sweep everyone out first if

4678
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:49,440
to come and sweep everyone out first if
 

4679
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,109
to come and sweep everyone out first if
they're going to do that move. And we've

4680
01:49:51,109 --> 01:49:51,119
they're going to do that move. And we've
 

4681
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:53,030
they're going to do that move. And we've
not really moved on the day. Like ENQ is

4682
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:53,040
not really moved on the day. Like ENQ is
 

4683
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,590
not really moved on the day. Like ENQ is
0.09% down on the day. We're basically

4684
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:55,600
0.09% down on the day. We're basically
 

4685
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:58,149
0.09% down on the day. We're basically
flat.

4686
01:49:58,149 --> 01:49:58,159
flat.
 

4687
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:00,870
flat.
So, we're not seeing sellers really take

4688
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
So, we're not seeing sellers really take
 

4689
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,229
So, we're not seeing sellers really take
control of the market right now. We're

4690
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:02,239
control of the market right now. We're
 

4691
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:04,629
control of the market right now. We're
seeing liquidity being built. And I know

4692
01:50:04,629 --> 01:50:04,639
seeing liquidity being built. And I know
 

4693
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:06,310
seeing liquidity being built. And I know
that we've got low hanging fruit higher.

4694
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:06,320
that we've got low hanging fruit higher.
 

4695
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,669
that we've got low hanging fruit higher.
We haven't got much low hanging fruit

4696
01:50:07,669 --> 01:50:07,679
We haven't got much low hanging fruit
 

4697
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:09,270
We haven't got much low hanging fruit
lower because we swept it this morning.

4698
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:09,280
lower because we swept it this morning.
 

4699
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,270
lower because we swept it this morning.
So, my bias

4700
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:11,280
So, my bias
 

4701
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,669
So, my bias
is sort of to go higher, but probably to

4702
01:50:13,669 --> 01:50:13,679
is sort of to go higher, but probably to
 

4703
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:15,189
is sort of to go higher, but probably to
go lower to go higher, if that makes

4704
01:50:15,189 --> 01:50:15,199
go lower to go higher, if that makes
 

4705
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:16,390
go lower to go higher, if that makes
sense. I think we probably want to come

4706
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:16,400
sense. I think we probably want to come
 

4707
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,229
sense. I think we probably want to come
under this and then maybe have

4708
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:18,239
under this and then maybe have
 

4709
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:20,470
under this and then maybe have
unfinished business here. But uh unless

4710
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:20,480
unfinished business here. But uh unless
 

4711
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,950
unfinished business here. But uh unless
we get major sell pressure start to take

4712
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:22,960
we get major sell pressure start to take
 

4713
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:24,870
we get major sell pressure start to take
over here and we back test it. You know,

4714
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:24,880
over here and we back test it. You know,
 

4715
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,310
over here and we back test it. You know,
if we break down and back test this,

4716
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:26,320
if we break down and back test this,
 

4717
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,910
if we break down and back test this,
maybe we come to here. But I'm not

4718
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:27,920
maybe we come to here. But I'm not
 

4719
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,350
maybe we come to here. But I'm not
wouldn't be surprised to see something

4720
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:29,360
wouldn't be surprised to see something
 

4721
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:32,470
wouldn't be surprised to see something
like this playing out.

4722
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:32,480
like this playing out.
 

4723
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:44,950
like this playing out.
We just have to see.

4724
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960

 

4725
01:50:44,960 --> 01:51:05,990

Back to the 100s.

4726
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,000

 

4727
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,510

AMD is about to happen. What do you

4728
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:07,520
AMD is about to happen. What do you
 

4729
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,550
AMD is about to happen. What do you
mean? Doesn't look like it's doing

4730
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:08,560
mean? Doesn't look like it's doing
 

4731
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,270
mean? Doesn't look like it's doing
anything. It's just literally at the

4732
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:11,280
anything. It's just literally at the
 

4733
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,790
anything. It's just literally at the
middle of nowhere of its current day

4734
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:12,800
middle of nowhere of its current day
 

4735
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,070
middle of nowhere of its current day
range. Not sure what you're what you're

4736
01:51:16,070 --> 01:51:16,080
range. Not sure what you're what you're
 

4737
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:25,669
range. Not sure what you're what you're
seeing. Doesn't look like much to me.

4738
01:51:25,669 --> 01:51:25,679

 

4739
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:34,550

Oh, nice. Haristston, nice work.

4740
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:34,560

 

4741
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,470

All right. Can they pop these stops and

4742
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:36,480
All right. Can they pop these stops and
 

4743
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:38,709
All right. Can they pop these stops and
then let's see what happens afterwards?

4744
01:51:38,709 --> 01:51:38,719
then let's see what happens afterwards?
 

4745
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,310
then let's see what happens afterwards?
So, yes is the answer. They're going to

4746
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:40,320
So, yes is the answer. They're going to
 

4747
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,750
So, yes is the answer. They're going to
pop these stops. There we go. All right.

4748
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:41,760
pop these stops. There we go. All right.
 

4749
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,109
pop these stops. There we go. All right.
This is what I thought would happen.

4750
01:51:43,109 --> 01:51:43,119
This is what I thought would happen.
 

4751
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:44,629
This is what I thought would happen.
Now, what happens next becomes

4752
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:44,639
Now, what happens next becomes
 

4753
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,950
Now, what happens next becomes
important.

4754
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:46,960
important.
 

4755
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,189
important.
What happens next becomes important

4756
01:51:49,189 --> 01:51:49,199
What happens next becomes important
 

4757
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:50,629
What happens next becomes important
because if they pop these stops and

4758
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
because if they pop these stops and
 

4759
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,870
because if they pop these stops and
start turning around, then everyone

4760
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:52,880
start turning around, then everyone
 

4761
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,390
start turning around, then everyone
who's just entered short for this

4762
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:54,400
who's just entered short for this
 

4763
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:57,589
who's just entered short for this
breakdown is going to get caught.

4764
01:51:57,589 --> 01:51:57,599
breakdown is going to get caught.
 

4765
01:51:57,599 --> 01:51:59,669
breakdown is going to get caught.
And if they defend this area that

4766
01:51:59,669 --> 01:51:59,679
And if they defend this area that
 

4767
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:01,109
And if they defend this area that
they've just built volume at for the

4768
01:52:01,109 --> 01:52:01,119
they've just built volume at for the
 

4769
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:03,910
they've just built volume at for the
last hour, then maybe we move lower. But

4770
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,920
last hour, then maybe we move lower. But
 

4771
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,870
last hour, then maybe we move lower. But
I would say if we reclaim it, then I

4772
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:06,880
I would say if we reclaim it, then I
 

4773
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,229
I would say if we reclaim it, then I
wouldn't want to be bearish. Let's say

4774
01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:08,239
wouldn't want to be bearish. Let's say
 

4775
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:14,310
wouldn't want to be bearish. Let's say
that way. If we reclaim it,

4776
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:14,320

 

4777
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,870

what's the previous day value area low?

4778
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:16,880
what's the previous day value area low?
 

4779
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,510
what's the previous day value area low?
25,000.

4780
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:19,520
25,000.
 

4781
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:23,030
25,000.
Let's see.

4782
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040

 

4783
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,550

So, New York open previous day value

4784
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:24,560
So, New York open previous day value
 

4785
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,629
So, New York open previous day value
area low here. This is the edge of the

4786
01:52:26,629 --> 01:52:26,639
area low here. This is the edge of the
 

4787
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,390
area low here. This is the edge of the
shelf that we've just broken out from.

4788
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:28,400
shelf that we've just broken out from.
 

4789
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,629
shelf that we've just broken out from.
How we at now becomes important. Are we

4790
01:52:30,629 --> 01:52:30,639
How we at now becomes important. Are we
 

4791
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:31,830
How we at now becomes important. Are we
going to trade all the way down into

4792
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:31,840
going to trade all the way down into
 

4793
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,589
going to trade all the way down into
this pocket? Or are we going to reclaim

4794
01:52:33,589 --> 01:52:33,599
this pocket? Or are we going to reclaim
 

4795
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,350
this pocket? Or are we going to reclaim
this? Is this just a big old trap and

4796
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:35,360
this? Is this just a big old trap and
 

4797
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,189
this? Is this just a big old trap and
we're going to squeeze back higher for

4798
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:37,199
we're going to squeeze back higher for
 

4799
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,629
we're going to squeeze back higher for
unfinished business? I don't know,

4800
01:52:38,629 --> 01:52:38,639
unfinished business? I don't know,
 

4801
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:41,589
unfinished business? I don't know,
folks. I have no idea. Can only react to

4802
01:52:41,589 --> 01:52:41,599
folks. I have no idea. Can only react to
 

4803
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:43,350
folks. I have no idea. Can only react to
the market. I can't guess the market. It

4804
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,360
the market. I can't guess the market. It
 

4805
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,189
the market. I can't guess the market. It
would not surprise me to see this

4806
01:52:45,189 --> 01:52:45,199
would not surprise me to see this
 

4807
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,350
would not surprise me to see this
reclaim the range and go right back up

4808
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:47,360
reclaim the range and go right back up
 

4809
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,589
reclaim the range and go right back up
to the upside if it does. Wouldn't

4810
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:49,599
to the upside if it does. Wouldn't
 

4811
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:54,950
to the upside if it does. Wouldn't
surprise me in the slightest.

4812
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:54,960

 

4813
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,109

IBH and IBL. They're the purple lines on

4814
01:52:57,109 --> 01:52:57,119
IBH and IBL. They're the purple lines on
 

4815
01:52:57,119 --> 01:53:00,149
IBH and IBL. They're the purple lines on
your chart, right? This is your IBL 56,

4816
01:53:00,149 --> 01:53:00,159
your chart, right? This is your IBL 56,
 

4817
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:02,870
your chart, right? This is your IBL 56,
IBH 254

4818
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:02,880
IBH 254
 

4819
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,950
IBH 254
or something, 255.

4820
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:04,960
or something, 255.
 

4821
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,709
or something, 255.
Purple lines on my chart are always the

4822
01:53:06,709 --> 01:53:06,719
Purple lines on my chart are always the
 

4823
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:13,030
Purple lines on my chart are always the
initial balance.

4824
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:13,040

 

4825
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,629

So, it hasn't reclaimed that range yet,

4826
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
So, it hasn't reclaimed that range yet,
 

4827
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:16,709
So, it hasn't reclaimed that range yet,
which we broke down from that sort of 60

4828
01:53:16,709 --> 01:53:16,719
which we broke down from that sort of 60
 

4829
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:19,430
which we broke down from that sort of 60
I guess is the level. VIX is starting to

4830
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:19,440
I guess is the level. VIX is starting to
 

4831
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,390
I guess is the level. VIX is starting to
try and push here. So bears are trying

4832
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:22,400
try and push here. So bears are trying
 

4833
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,070
try and push here. So bears are trying
to take control of this market right

4834
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:24,080
to take control of this market right
 

4835
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,870
to take control of this market right
now. We're right back to sort of where

4836
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:26,880
now. We're right back to sort of where
 

4837
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:35,990
now. We're right back to sort of where
we found a bid from this morning.

4838
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:36,000

 

4839
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,910

Wouldn't surprise me if they reclaim

4840
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:37,920
Wouldn't surprise me if they reclaim
 

4841
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,030
Wouldn't surprise me if they reclaim
this range. It wouldn't surprise me to

4842
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
this range. It wouldn't surprise me to
 

4843
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,510
this range. It wouldn't surprise me to
see a giant squeeze back out. Big if. It

4844
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:41,520
see a giant squeeze back out. Big if. It
 

4845
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,430
see a giant squeeze back out. Big if. It
is a big big if right now, but it would

4846
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:43,440
is a big big if right now, but it would
 

4847
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,950
is a big big if right now, but it would
not surprise me. Here's the retest of

4848
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:44,960
not surprise me. Here's the retest of
 

4849
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,750
not surprise me. Here's the retest of
this sort of range and let's see what

4850
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:47,760
this sort of range and let's see what
 

4851
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,350
this sort of range and let's see what
they do. Because if they reclaim this,

4852
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:49,360
they do. Because if they reclaim this,
 

4853
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,790
they do. Because if they reclaim this,
it would not surprise me to see a giant

4854
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:50,800
it would not surprise me to see a giant
 

4855
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,070
it would not surprise me to see a giant
squeeze. If they reject this, then

4856
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:52,080
squeeze. If they reject this, then
 

4857
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:54,229
squeeze. If they reject this, then
possibly we trade lower on the session.

4858
01:53:54,229 --> 01:53:54,239
possibly we trade lower on the session.
 

4859
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:56,070
possibly we trade lower on the session.
So far, no reclaim with this gray box.

4860
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:56,080
So far, no reclaim with this gray box.
 

4861
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,790
So far, no reclaim with this gray box.
So, bears are in control so far. And

4862
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:58,800
So, bears are in control so far. And
 

4863
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,550
So, bears are in control so far. And
this target would be uh previous day

4864
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:00,560
this target would be uh previous day
 

4865
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,229
this target would be uh previous day
value area low, initial balance low on

4866
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
value area low, initial balance low on
 

4867
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:04,149
value area low, initial balance low on
the day, and if we got very weak back

4868
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:04,159
the day, and if we got very weak back
 

4869
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:07,430
the day, and if we got very weak back
down into uh Friday's lows, I'd be very,

4870
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:07,440
down into uh Friday's lows, I'd be very,
 

4871
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,430
down into uh Friday's lows, I'd be very,
very cautious trading in here. For me, I

4872
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:09,440
very cautious trading in here. For me, I
 

4873
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,950
very cautious trading in here. For me, I
would not be surprised to see a short

4874
01:54:10,950 --> 01:54:10,960
would not be surprised to see a short
 

4875
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,709
would not be surprised to see a short
squeeze in this market. It really would

4876
01:54:12,709 --> 01:54:12,719
squeeze in this market. It really would
 

4877
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:15,189
squeeze in this market. It really would
not surprise me. They played at the

4878
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:15,199
not surprise me. They played at the
 

4879
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:17,589
not surprise me. They played at the
edges all day. This is your sort of

4880
01:54:17,589 --> 01:54:17,599
edges all day. This is your sort of
 

4881
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:20,470
edges all day. This is your sort of
level coming up into 60ish. Seeing some

4882
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:20,480
level coming up into 60ish. Seeing some
 

4883
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:23,030
level coming up into 60ish. Seeing some
selling into that so far. So, just

4884
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,040
selling into that so far. So, just
 

4885
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,510
selling into that so far. So, just
watching to see if they defend or if

4886
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:25,520
watching to see if they defend or if
 

4887
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:28,709
watching to see if they defend or if
they let a short squeeze happen here.

4888
01:54:28,709 --> 01:54:28,719
they let a short squeeze happen here.
 

4889
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:31,270
they let a short squeeze happen here.
Either way, very, very tricky kind of

4890
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:31,280
Either way, very, very tricky kind of
 

4891
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:33,430
Either way, very, very tricky kind of
day today

4892
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:33,440
day today
 

4893
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,270
day today
as we build liquidity. And like I said,

4894
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:35,280
as we build liquidity. And like I said,
 

4895
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,470
as we build liquidity. And like I said,
I wouldn't surprise you to see us do

4896
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:36,480
I wouldn't surprise you to see us do
 

4897
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,669
I wouldn't surprise you to see us do
this all the way to Wednesday. So,

4898
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
this all the way to Wednesday. So,
 

4899
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,070
this all the way to Wednesday. So,
here's the test towards sort of 60 at

4900
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,080
here's the test towards sort of 60 at
 

4901
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,990
here's the test towards sort of 60 at
the moment. That's just sort of over

4902
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,000
the moment. That's just sort of over
 

4903
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,910
the moment. That's just sort of over
under that gray box above you. Even the

4904
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:43,920
under that gray box above you. Even the
 

4905
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,070
under that gray box above you. Even the
point of control 80, you could use that.

4906
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:46,080
point of control 80, you could use that.
 

4907
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,669
point of control 80, you could use that.
we get above that balls probably take

4908
01:54:47,669 --> 01:54:47,679
we get above that balls probably take
 

4909
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:49,189
we get above that balls probably take
control of the session. You can see a

4910
01:54:49,189 --> 01:54:49,199
control of the session. You can see a
 

4911
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:52,709
control of the session. You can see a
bigger squeeze out if that happens.

4912
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:52,719
bigger squeeze out if that happens.
 

4913
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,629
bigger squeeze out if that happens.
And it can get violent here quickly both

4914
01:54:54,629 --> 01:54:54,639
And it can get violent here quickly both
 

4915
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:56,870
And it can get violent here quickly both
sides, right? Because you're going to

4916
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:56,880
sides, right? Because you're going to
 

4917
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,589
sides, right? Because you're going to
have one side's going to get stuck,

4918
01:54:59,589 --> 01:54:59,599
have one side's going to get stuck,
 

4919
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:01,109
have one side's going to get stuck,
right? They are going to get stuck. One

4920
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:01,119
right? They are going to get stuck. One
 

4921
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:05,109
right? They are going to get stuck. One
side is absolutely going to get stuck.

4922
01:55:05,109 --> 01:55:05,119
side is absolutely going to get stuck.
 

4923
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:07,350
side is absolutely going to get stuck.
So test of 60. Big buying coming in

4924
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:07,360
So test of 60. Big buying coming in
 

4925
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:10,149
So test of 60. Big buying coming in
here. Can they defend it? These bears.

4926
01:55:10,149 --> 01:55:10,159
here. Can they defend it? These bears.
 

4927
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:12,390
here. Can they defend it? These bears.
So this gray box is what we're testing.

4928
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:12,400
So this gray box is what we're testing.
 

4929
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,870
So this gray box is what we're testing.
60 to 80 is the level. Bulls reclaim

4930
01:55:14,870 --> 01:55:14,880
60 to 80 is the level. Bulls reclaim
 

4931
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,950
60 to 80 is the level. Bulls reclaim
that probably squeeze out that

4932
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:16,960
that probably squeeze out that
 

4933
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,310
that probably squeeze out that
definitely towards these highs and

4934
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:18,320
definitely towards these highs and
 

4935
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:19,830
definitely towards these highs and
probably at that point towards high day.

4936
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:19,840
probably at that point towards high day.
 

4937
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:21,350
probably at that point towards high day.
Bears defend this then they're going to

4938
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:21,360
Bears defend this then they're going to
 

4939
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:27,350
Bears defend this then they're going to
be looking for IB low

4940
01:55:27,350 --> 01:55:27,360

 

4941
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,470

and bears defending it so far.

4942
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:32,480

 

4943
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,189

It's still holding. These are the days

4944
01:55:35,189 --> 01:55:35,199
It's still holding. These are the days
 

4945
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:37,430
It's still holding. These are the days
that I'm least interested in trading. As

4946
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:37,440
that I'm least interested in trading. As
 

4947
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,550
that I'm least interested in trading. As
you well know, I like moves outside of

4948
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:40,560
you well know, I like moves outside of
 

4949
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,470
you well know, I like moves outside of
value. They're the best moves in my

4950
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:42,480
value. They're the best moves in my
 

4951
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:48,550
value. They're the best moves in my
mind.

4952
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:48,560

 

4953
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:50,229

Google pulling back about half a percent

4954
01:55:50,229 --> 01:55:50,239
Google pulling back about half a percent
 

4955
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:52,070
Google pulling back about half a percent
so far. So, are they done with it? I

4956
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:52,080
so far. So, are they done with it? I
 

4957
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:55,109
so far. So, are they done with it? I
doubt it, but we'll see.

4958
01:55:55,109 --> 01:55:55,119
doubt it, but we'll see.
 

4959
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:58,470
doubt it, but we'll see.
Okay, defending that range bears like

4960
01:55:58,470 --> 01:55:58,480
Okay, defending that range bears like
 

4961
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,629
Okay, defending that range bears like
successfully so far. defending that

4962
01:56:00,629 --> 01:56:00,639
successfully so far. defending that
 

4963
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:10,149
successfully so far. defending that
range. Well,

4964
01:56:10,149 --> 01:56:10,159

 

4965
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:11,990

there's day value area low into sort of

4966
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:12,000
there's day value area low into sort of
 

4967
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,390
there's day value area low into sort of
25,000. So, if I was a bear, I'd be

4968
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:14,400
25,000. So, if I was a bear, I'd be
 

4969
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,350
25,000. So, if I was a bear, I'd be
covering some into this box now down to

4970
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:17,360
covering some into this box now down to
 

4971
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,669
covering some into this box now down to
25K

4972
01:56:19,669 --> 01:56:19,679
25K
 

4973
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:22,470
25K
and then I'd be holding for low day and

4974
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:22,480
and then I'd be holding for low day and
 

4975
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:29,669
and then I'd be holding for low day and
I'm not in any of this at all.

4976
01:56:29,669 --> 01:56:29,679

 

4977
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:31,589

Bit of sell pressure coming on Goo here.

4978
01:56:31,589 --> 01:56:31,599
Bit of sell pressure coming on Goo here.
 

4979
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:33,990
Bit of sell pressure coming on Goo here.
Not a lot, but a little bit. And here's

4980
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:34,000
Not a lot, but a little bit. And here's
 

4981
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,589
Not a lot, but a little bit. And here's
your previous day value area low. Now,

4982
01:56:35,589 --> 01:56:35,599
your previous day value area low. Now,
 

4983
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:37,589
your previous day value area low. Now,
bulls will want to defend this. Fail to

4984
01:56:37,589 --> 01:56:37,599
bulls will want to defend this. Fail to
 

4985
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:38,790
bulls will want to defend this. Fail to
defend this. We're going to go New York

4986
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:38,800
defend this. We're going to go New York
 

4987
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:45,430
defend this. We're going to go New York
open I uh initial balance low.

4988
01:56:45,430 --> 01:56:45,440

 

4989
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,189

So, here's previous day value area low.

4990
01:56:47,189 --> 01:56:47,199
So, here's previous day value area low.
 

4991
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:48,629
So, here's previous day value area low.
So, I'd be covering some into this. If

4992
01:56:48,629 --> 01:56:48,639
So, I'd be covering some into this. If
 

4993
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:50,709
So, I'd be covering some into this. If
any of you took this move here, retest

4994
01:56:50,709 --> 01:56:50,719
any of you took this move here, retest
 

4995
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:52,790
any of you took this move here, retest
stayed heavy. Your cover is here and

4996
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:52,800
stayed heavy. Your cover is here and
 

4997
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,870
stayed heavy. Your cover is here and
here. and runners if you get lucky all

4998
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
here. and runners if you get lucky all
 

4999
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,629
here. and runners if you get lucky all
the way down to here. But I'd be

5000
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:56,639
the way down to here. But I'd be
 

5001
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:59,270
the way down to here. But I'd be
covering some into these pockets.

5002
01:56:59,270 --> 01:56:59,280
covering some into these pockets.
 

5003
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,750
covering some into these pockets.
The high time frame overall for me is is

5004
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:01,760
The high time frame overall for me is is
 

5005
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,109
The high time frame overall for me is is
bearish. It's just I think we're going

5006
01:57:03,109 --> 01:57:03,119
bearish. It's just I think we're going
 

5007
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:04,550
bearish. It's just I think we're going
to need to build out liquidity for a day

5008
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:04,560
to need to build out liquidity for a day
 

5009
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,310
to need to build out liquidity for a day
or two.

5010
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,320
or two.
 

5011
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:09,430
or two.
We are starting to set up the sort of H1

5012
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:09,440
We are starting to set up the sort of H1
 

5013
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,430
We are starting to set up the sort of H1
potential head and shoulder, but it's

5014
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:11,440
potential head and shoulder, but it's
 

5015
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,910
potential head and shoulder, but it's
very very risky.

5016
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
very very risky.
 

5017
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,070
very very risky.
Very very risky

5018
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:16,080
Very very risky
 

5019
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,589
Very very risky
trading inside of value looking for

5020
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:17,599
trading inside of value looking for
 

5021
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:20,950
trading inside of value looking for
something like that.

5022
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:20,960
something like that.
 

5023
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:22,870
something like that.
Okay, so bit of a bid on previous day

5024
01:57:22,870 --> 01:57:22,880
Okay, so bit of a bid on previous day
 

5025
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,070
Okay, so bit of a bid on previous day
value area low there

5026
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:26,080
value area low there
 

5027
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,149
value area low there
and I'd say 60s is the trigger for a

5028
01:57:28,149 --> 01:57:28,159
and I'd say 60s is the trigger for a
 

5029
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:31,030
and I'd say 60s is the trigger for a
squeeze. They get back above 60s as a

5030
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:31,040
squeeze. They get back above 60s as a
 

5031
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:32,870
squeeze. They get back above 60s as a
squeeze. Until then, bears are in

5032
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:32,880
squeeze. Until then, bears are in
 

5033
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,950
squeeze. Until then, bears are in
control until we get back above here.

5034
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:34,960
control until we get back above here.
 

5035
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,229
control until we get back above here.
Bears are in control and they can target

5036
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:36,239
Bears are in control and they can target
 

5037
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:38,790
Bears are in control and they can target
all the way down here if they want.

5038
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:38,800
all the way down here if they want.
 

5039
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:42,310
all the way down here if they want.
Back above 60s or back above 60 to 80s.

5040
01:57:42,310 --> 01:57:42,320
Back above 60s or back above 60 to 80s.
 

5041
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,390
Back above 60s or back above 60 to 80s.
Balls can take control of a of a squeeze

5042
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:44,400
Balls can take control of a of a squeeze
 

5043
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,910
Balls can take control of a of a squeeze
out. Nothing more than that, but just a

5044
01:57:45,910 --> 01:57:45,920
out. Nothing more than that, but just a
 

5045
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:49,350
out. Nothing more than that, but just a
squeeze out potentially.

5046
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:49,360
squeeze out potentially.
 

5047
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:53,830
squeeze out potentially.
Potentially.

5048
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:53,840

 

5049
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,030

Remember, it's Google that's been

starting to uh you're starting to see a
bit of profit taking in GooG here. This

5056
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:01,520
bit of profit taking in GooG here. This
 

5057
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,669
bit of profit taking in GooG here. This
can get violent. These are big moves,

5058
01:58:03,669 --> 01:58:03,679
can get violent. These are big moves,
 

5059
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:07,750

There's previous day value low coming

01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:31,280

 

5081
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,870

Just watching the order blow now. Lots

5082
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:32,880
Just watching the order blow now. Lots
 

5083
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,350
Just watching the order blow now. Lots
of bears came flying in at those lows.

5084
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:35,360
of bears came flying in at those lows.
 

5085
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,950
of bears came flying in at those lows.
They came absolutely flying in at that

5086
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:36,960
They came absolutely flying in at that
 

5087
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:39,030
They came absolutely flying in at that
New York open.

5088
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:39,040
New York open.
 

5089
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,430
New York open.
So if they don't get a print under that,

5090
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:41,440
So if they don't get a print under that,
 

5091
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,189
So if they don't get a print under that,
you might get that move back towards 60.

5092
01:58:43,189 --> 01:58:43,199
you might get that move back towards 60.
 

5093
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:45,030
you might get that move back towards 60.
And then how we at there is what really

5094
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:45,040
And then how we at there is what really
 

5095
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,310
And then how we at there is what really
matters for the rest of the day cuz

5096
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:46,320
matters for the rest of the day cuz
 

5097
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:47,830
matters for the rest of the day cuz
that's a range that they've created. It

5098
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:47,840
that's a range that they've created. It
 

5099
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,790
that's a range that they've created. It
looks very bearish right now though.

5100
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:52,800

 

5101
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:57,750

The bears call those lows for sure.

5102
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:57,760

 

5103
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:02,629

The 25,000 retest

5104
01:59:02,629 --> 01:59:02,639

 

5105
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:05,109

if they flush this

5106
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:05,119
if they flush this
 

5107
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:07,990
if they flush this
maybe low of day. Well, it should go low

5108
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:08,000
maybe low of day. Well, it should go low
 

5109
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,350
maybe low of day. Well, it should go low
of day if they flush this. If they can't

5110
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:09,360
of day if they flush this. If they can't
 

5111
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:10,870
of day if they flush this. If they can't
reclaim, you would expect initial

5112
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:10,880
reclaim, you would expect initial
 

5113
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,189
reclaim, you would expect initial
balance low to be tested.

5114
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:13,199
balance low to be tested.
 

5115
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:15,430
balance low to be tested.
This previous day value very low is kind

5116
01:59:15,430 --> 01:59:15,440
This previous day value very low is kind
 

5117
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:49,109
This previous day value very low is kind
of interesting level.

5118
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,119

 

5119
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:55,430

25,000 interesting level here.

5120
01:59:55,430 --> 01:59:55,440

 

5121
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:59,189

Shorts came in under 98. So back to

5122
01:59:59,189 --> 01:59:59,199
Shorts came in under 98. So back to
 

5123
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:01,830
Shorts came in under 98. So back to
previous day value area low. And if they

5124
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:01,840
previous day value area low. And if they
 

5125
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,430
previous day value area low. And if they
go back through this, they can might

5126
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:03,440
go back through this, they can might
 

5127
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,189
go back through this, they can might
want to revisit those 60s. This is the

5128
02:00:05,189 --> 02:00:05,199
want to revisit those 60s. This is the
 

5129
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:06,709
want to revisit those 60s. This is the
big, remember, it's the same level from

5130
02:00:06,709 --> 02:00:06,719
big, remember, it's the same level from
 

5131
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:08,470
big, remember, it's the same level from
this morning, folks. This is the same

5132
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:08,480
this morning, folks. This is the same
 

5133
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:10,629
this morning, folks. This is the same
level, previous day value area low. If

5134
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
level, previous day value area low. If
 

5135
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,310
level, previous day value area low. If
we trade under this, we can trade lower.

5136
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:12,320
we trade under this, we can trade lower.
 

5137
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:13,510
we trade under this, we can trade lower.
If we go back through it, we're back

5138
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:13,520
If we go back through it, we're back
 

5139
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,189
If we go back through it, we're back
into the internal range again. So,

5140
02:00:15,189 --> 02:00:15,199
into the internal range again. So,
 

5141
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:16,470
into the internal range again. So,
here's the start of a squeeze. Shorts

5142
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:16,480
here's the start of a squeeze. Shorts
 

5143
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,390
here's the start of a squeeze. Shorts
got caught there. And now, it's going to

5144
02:00:18,390 --> 02:00:18,400
got caught there. And now, it's going to
 

5145
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,070
got caught there. And now, it's going to
depend how we trade when we get up to

5146
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:20,080
depend how we trade when we get up to
 

5147
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,790
depend how we trade when we get up to
60s. Remember, 60s is the level here.

5148
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:22,800
60s. Remember, 60s is the level here.
 

5149
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,390
60s. Remember, 60s is the level here.
The bigger squeeze, this can still be a

5150
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:24,400
The bigger squeeze, this can still be a
 

5151
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:26,070
The bigger squeeze, this can still be a
look below and fail. This level up here

5152
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:26,080
look below and fail. This level up here
 

5153
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:30,470
look below and fail. This level up here
is what's important.

5154
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:30,480

 

5155
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,550

And if we reclaim all of that, oh my

5156
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:32,560
And if we reclaim all of that, oh my
 

5157
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,470
And if we reclaim all of that, oh my
god, it could get nasty. Like I said,

5158
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:34,480
god, it could get nasty. Like I said,
 

5159
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:36,229
god, it could get nasty. Like I said,
this is how we rotate. This is exactly

5160
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:36,239
this is how we rotate. This is exactly
 

5161
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:38,070
this is how we rotate. This is exactly
what you're seeing how we rotate and

5162
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:38,080
what you're seeing how we rotate and
 

5163
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,229
what you're seeing how we rotate and
catch people. Okay, so rotation,

5164
02:00:40,229 --> 02:00:40,239
catch people. Okay, so rotation,
 

5165
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:41,910
catch people. Okay, so rotation,
rotation, rotation, rotation, rotation,

5166
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:41,920
rotation, rotation, rotation, rotation,
 

5167
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,550
rotation, rotation, rotation, rotation,
rotation breakdown. This level becomes

5168
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,560
rotation breakdown. This level becomes
 

5169
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,709
rotation breakdown. This level becomes
important. If bulls defend this, if too

5170
02:00:46,709 --> 02:00:46,719
important. If bulls defend this, if too
 

5171
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:48,390
important. If bulls defend this, if too
many bears came in here, which is what's

5172
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:48,400
many bears came in here, which is what's
 

5173
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:50,470
many bears came in here, which is what's
happened so far, we retest this. We can

5174
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:50,480
happened so far, we retest this. We can
 

5175
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:52,550
happened so far, we retest this. We can
do rotation between here, or we can

5176
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:52,560
do rotation between here, or we can
 

5177
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:53,990
do rotation between here, or we can
reclaim and go on a big old short

5178
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:54,000
reclaim and go on a big old short
 

5179
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,830
reclaim and go on a big old short
squeeze if too many got caught there.

5180
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:55,840
squeeze if too many got caught there.
 

5181
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,430
squeeze if too many got caught there.
This can be a look below and fail on a

5182
02:00:57,430 --> 02:00:57,440
This can be a look below and fail on a
 

5183
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:58,950
This can be a look below and fail on a
reclaim of here. till that point it's

5184
02:00:58,950 --> 02:00:58,960
reclaim of here. till that point it's
 

5185
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,669
reclaim of here. till that point it's
technically bearish but this candle here

5186
02:01:01,669 --> 02:01:01,679
technically bearish but this candle here
 

5187
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:03,750
technically bearish but this candle here

They've not seen acceptance lower yet.
 

5207
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:23,990
They've not seen acceptance lower yet.
It is just yet but that's what I'm

5208
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:24,000
It is just yet but that's what I'm
 

5209
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,589
It is just yet but that's what I'm
seeing so far.

5211
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:31,510

But yeah, we're bearish on the tape, but

5212
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:31,520
But yeah, we're bearish on the tape, but
 

5213
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:33,750
But yeah, we're bearish on the tape, but
we're in a range rotation. So, I'm not

5214
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:33,760
we're in a range rotation. So, I'm not
 

5215
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:37,910
we're in a range rotation. So, I'm not
thinking about a trending environment.

5216
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:37,920

 

5217
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,030

Not thinking about a trending

5218
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:39,040

5219
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,950
Not thinking about a trending
environment.

5220
02:01:40,950 --> 02:01:40,960
environment.
 

5221
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:44,070
environment.
It's going to have to prove itself.

5222
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:44,080
It's going to have to prove itself.
 

5223
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:46,629
It's going to have to prove itself.
I hate that ENQ didn't get up to

Good work.

Good work.
I've had one one trade. That's it. I'm

I've had one one trade. That's it. I'm
just waiting to see if something else

just waiting to see if something else

just waiting to see if something else
will set up for me. Be nice if it would.

5241
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,390

I don't have a whole lot of edge here.

5242

I don't have a whole lot of edge here.

02:02:24,709 --> 02:02:24,719
ES are at 50day and initial balance low.
 

5253
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:26,790
ES are at 50day and initial balance low.
So they have relative weakness. That's

5254
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:26,800
So they have relative weakness. That's
 

5255
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,550
So they have relative weakness. That's
because Google and Tesla heavier awaited

5256
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:28,560
because Google and Tesla heavier awaited
 

5257
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:33,030
because Google and Tesla heavier awaited
in the cues.

5258
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:33,040

 

5259
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:37,750

5262
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:43,360

 

5263
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,030

are they really going to go for Friday's

5264
02:02:45,030 --> 02:02:45,040
are they really going to go for Friday's
 

5265
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,510
are they really going to go for Friday's
lows? Not getting back up to the highs

5266
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:47,520
lows? Not getting back up to the highs
 

5267
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,750
lows? Not getting back up to the highs
in New York. It's possible. It's not

what I think they're going to do, but uh

5270
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:51,440
what I think they're going to do, but uh
 

5271
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,910
what I think they're going to do, but uh
trying to remain flexible to the charts.

5272
02:02:53,910 --> 02:02:53,920
trying to remain flexible to the charts.
 

5273
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:55,990
trying to remain flexible to the charts.

5332
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:28,400
to this morning. If they get under this,
 

5333
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,990
to this morning. If they get under this,
there's a block here. If they get under

5334
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:30,000
there's a block here. If they get under
 

5335
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,270

700's possible, if they get there

5338
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:34,800
700's possible, if they get there
 

5339
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,310
700's possible, if they get there
without giving me the entry I wanted at

5340
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320
without giving me the entry I wanted at
 

5341
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:41,510
without giving me the entry I wanted at
the highs, I'll be a little bit miffed.

5342
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:41,520

 

5343
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:47,189

5346
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:50,320
No, just just spy and QQQ for me. I
 

5347
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:52,390
No, just just spy and QQQ for me. I
don't really trade any of the other ETFs

5348
02:04:52,390 --> 02:04:52,400
don't really trade any of the other ETFs
 

5349
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,310
don't really trade any of the other ETFs
like the metals, the energies. Very

5350
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:54,320
like the metals, the energies. Very
 

5351
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,550
like the metals, the energies. Very
occasionally. Like I said, I I did take

5352
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:56,560
occasionally. Like I said, I I did take
 

5353
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,870
occasionally. Like I said, I I did take
a long on goo earlier this year for the

5354
02:04:58,870 --> 02:04:58,880
a long on goo earlier this year for the
 

5355
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:08,149
a long on goo earlier this year for the
pull back on gold, but that was it.

5356
02:05:08,149 --> 02:05:08,159

 

5357
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:09,430

02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:09,440
Don't think they're done with this yet.
 

5359
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:15,589
Don't think they're done with this yet.
Still lots of selling

5360
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:15,599

 

5361
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:17,189

coming back down to that initial balance

5362
02:05:17,189 --> 02:05:17,199
coming back down to that initial balance
 

5363
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:20,229
coming back down to that initial balance
low

5364
02:05:20,229 --> 02:05:20,239

 

5365
02:05:20,239 --> 02:05:22,470

and that block there really under IB low

5366
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:22,480

02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:25,199
goes all the way down to 900. Yeah, down
 

5369
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:26,629
goes all the way down to 900. Yeah, down
to here it's possible and then under

5370
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:26,639
to here it's possible and then under
 

5371
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:28,790
to here it's possible and then under
that nothing until we get to Friday's

5372
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:28,800
that nothing until we get to Friday's
 

5373
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:32,470
that nothing until we get to Friday's
lows. So if they have set up

02:05:32,470 --> 02:05:32,480
lows. So if they have set up
 

5375
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:34,070
lows. So if they have set up
this sort of head and shoulder or this

5376
02:05:34,070 --> 02:05:34,080
this sort of head and shoulder or this
 

5377
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,790
this sort of head and shoulder or this
cup and handle to go lower without

5378
02:05:36,790 --> 02:05:36,800
cup and handle to go lower without
 

5379
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:39,910
cup and handle to go lower without
taking the uh previous day high out in

5380
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:39,920
taking the uh previous day high out in
 

5381
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:42,550
taking the uh previous day high out in

02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:21,589
cannot rule out a puke down to here
today. I'm not saying it does it, but

5412
02:06:21,589 --> 02:06:21,599
today. I'm not saying it does it, but
 

5413
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:24,229
today. I'm not saying it does it, but
just based on rules of engagement, you

5414
02:06:24,229 --> 02:06:24,239
just based on rules of engagement, you
 

5415
02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:31,189
just based on rules of engagement, you
can't rule it out. Can't rule it out.

5416
02:06:31,189 --> 02:06:31,199

 

5417
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:35,430

There's your IB.

5418
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:35,440

 

5419
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:37,830

Tape still heavy.

5420
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:37,840
Tape still heavy.
 

5421
02:06:37,840 --> 02:07:02,310
Tape still heavy.
Tape is still heavy here, folks.

5422
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:02,320

 

5423
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:03,990

Vick's really starting to get going now,

5424
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:04,000
Vick's really starting to get going now,
 

5425
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,870
Vick's really starting to get going now,
guys. It's into its next pivot. So, next

5426
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:06,880
guys. It's into its next pivot. So, next
 

5427
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:10,149
guys. It's into its next pivot. So, next
next stop for the VIX really is 22.

5428
02:07:10,149 --> 02:07:10,159
next stop for the VIX really is 22.
 

5429
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:12,870
next stop for the VIX really is 22.
If it gets over 22,

5430
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:12,880
If it gets over 22,
 

5431
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,510
If it gets over 22,
next stop is 23s

5432
02:07:15,510 --> 02:07:15,520
next stop is 23s
 

5433
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:17,830
next stop is 23s
and fast. So, just be aware of that.

5434
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:17,840
and fast. So, just be aware of that.
 

5435
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,709
and fast. So, just be aware of that.
We're very volatile. You are outside a

5436
02:07:20,709 --> 02:07:20,719
We're very volatile. You are outside a
 

5437
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:23,430
We're very volatile. You are outside a
previous day's value area low right now.

5438
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:23,440
previous day's value area low right now.
 

5439
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,149
previous day's value area low right now.
Just just remember that we have moved

5440
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:26,159
Just just remember that we have moved
 

5441
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:28,069
Just just remember that we have moved
outside of value. If they want to go for

5442
02:07:28,069 --> 02:07:28,079
outside of value. If they want to go for
 

5443
02:07:28,079 --> 02:07:30,629
outside of value. If they want to go for
the Friday lows, they can. I wanted be I

5444
02:07:30,629 --> 02:07:30,639
the Friday lows, they can. I wanted be I
 

5445
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:33,030
the Friday lows, they can. I wanted be I
wanted to be in shorts today for those

5446
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:33,040
wanted to be in shorts today for those
 

5447
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:35,910
wanted to be in shorts today for those
Friday lows off a push to the highs. But

5448
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:35,920
Friday lows off a push to the highs. But
 

5449
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,470
Friday lows off a push to the highs. But
uh

5450
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:38,480
uh
 

5451
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:39,910
uh
after what I saw this morning, I thought

5452
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:39,920
after what I saw this morning, I thought
 

5453
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:42,709
after what I saw this morning, I thought
maybe we'd save it for tomorrow. But

5454
02:07:42,709 --> 02:07:42,719
maybe we'd save it for tomorrow. But
 

5455
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:44,709
maybe we'd save it for tomorrow. But
we're breaking away from volume. We're

5456
02:07:44,709 --> 02:07:44,719
we're breaking away from volume. We're
 

5457
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:47,030
we're breaking away from volume. We're
looking lower. We're going to look down

5458
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:47,040
looking lower. We're going to look down
 

5459
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:49,750
looking lower. We're going to look down
to see if we can find fair value. Now,

5460
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:49,760
to see if we can find fair value. Now,
 

5461
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,510
to see if we can find fair value. Now,
that might be here. It might be down

5462
02:07:51,510 --> 02:07:51,520
that might be here. It might be down
 

5463
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:53,589
that might be here. It might be down
here. We don't know. It might be that

5464
02:07:53,589 --> 02:07:53,599
here. We don't know. It might be that
 

5465
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,430
here. We don't know. It might be that
they trade back upside. We don't know.

5466
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:55,440
they trade back upside. We don't know.
 

5467
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:57,030
they trade back upside. We don't know.
All we can do is react to what the

5468
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:57,040
All we can do is react to what the
 

5469
02:07:57,040 --> 02:08:02,069
All we can do is react to what the
market's doing.

5470
02:08:02,069 --> 02:08:02,079

 

5471
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:07,030

There's the squeeze back up.

5472
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:07,040

 

5473
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,270

Previous day value area low is an

5474
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:09,280
Previous day value area low is an
 

5475
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:12,310
Previous day value area low is an
important level now folks. Okay. If

5476
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:12,320
important level now folks. Okay. If
 

5477
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:14,470
important level now folks. Okay. If
we're under that, we are technically

5478
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:14,480
we're under that, we are technically
 

5479
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:17,030
we're under that, we are technically
potentially in a trend day uh lower,

5480
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:17,040
potentially in a trend day uh lower,
 

5481
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,709
potentially in a trend day uh lower,
especially if we move under IB. we

5482
02:08:18,709 --> 02:08:18,719
especially if we move under IB. we
 

5483
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:20,390
especially if we move under IB. we
reclaim previous day value area low.

5484
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:20,400
reclaim previous day value area low.
 

5485
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,750
reclaim previous day value area low.
This is a look below. Like one of you

5486
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:21,760
This is a look below. Like one of you
 

5487
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,790
This is a look below. Like one of you
just said that you were looking for a

5488
02:08:22,790 --> 02:08:22,800
just said that you were looking for a
 

5489
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:24,550
just said that you were looking for a
look below. This would be a look below.

5490
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:24,560
look below. This would be a look below.
 

5491
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,470
look below. This would be a look below.
Right now I'm not seeing enough shorts

5492
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
Right now I'm not seeing enough shorts
 

5493
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:29,910
Right now I'm not seeing enough shorts
caught at those lows, but it's possible.

5494
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:29,920
caught at those lows, but it's possible.
 

5495
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:31,910
caught at those lows, but it's possible.
We had like three micro drives in there

5496
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:31,920
We had like three micro drives in there
 

5497
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,109
We had like three micro drives in there
which you can't see in a one minute

5498
02:08:33,109 --> 02:08:33,119
which you can't see in a one minute
 

5499
02:08:33,119 --> 02:08:34,229
which you can't see in a one minute
tape, but if you look at the book map

5500
02:08:34,229 --> 02:08:34,239
tape, but if you look at the book map
 

5501
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:36,550
tape, but if you look at the book map
above me, you can see one, two, three.

5502
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:36,560
above me, you can see one, two, three.
 

5503
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,550
above me, you can see one, two, three.
There were some shorts down here. 85

5504
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:38,560
There were some shorts down here. 85
 

5505
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:41,030
There were some shorts down here. 85
lot, 50 lot, 97 lot. There's definitely

5506
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:41,040
lot, 50 lot, 97 lot. There's definitely
 

5507
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,709
lot, 50 lot, 97 lot. There's definitely
some absorbing going on down there. I'm

5508
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:42,719
some absorbing going on down there. I'm
 

5509
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:43,910
some absorbing going on down there. I'm
not sure they finished with the auction

5510
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:43,920
not sure they finished with the auction
 

5511
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:45,750
not sure they finished with the auction
yet, but let's see. We're going to find

5512
02:08:45,750 --> 02:08:45,760
yet, but let's see. We're going to find
 

5513
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:47,589
yet, but let's see. We're going to find
out soon enough, but I would be very

5514
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:47,599
out soon enough, but I would be very
 

5515
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:50,470
out soon enough, but I would be very
very uh

5516
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:50,480
very uh
 

5517
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:52,629
very uh
aware of your New York open and previous

5518
02:08:52,629 --> 02:08:52,639
aware of your New York open and previous
 

5519
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:58,470
aware of your New York open and previous
day value area low for your bias.

5520
02:08:58,470 --> 02:08:58,480

 

5521
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:00,550

Yeah, Richard, I was short this morning.

5522
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:00,560
Yeah, Richard, I was short this morning.
 

5523
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:01,990
Yeah, Richard, I was short this morning.
Yeah, we've lock we've locked in money

5524
02:09:01,990 --> 02:09:02,000
Yeah, we've lock we've locked in money
 

5525
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,550
Yeah, we've lock we've locked in money
this morning. Uh, everyone was long um

5526
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:04,560
this morning. Uh, everyone was long um
 

5527
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:05,990
this morning. Uh, everyone was long um
for that look below and fail this

5528
02:09:05,990 --> 02:09:06,000
for that look below and fail this
 

5529
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,229
for that look below and fail this
morning. I took where was I short? This

5530
02:09:08,229 --> 02:09:08,239
morning. I took where was I short? This
 

5531
02:09:08,239 --> 02:09:11,189
morning. I took where was I short? This
short first b first bounce short.

5532
02:09:11,189 --> 02:09:11,199
short first b first bounce short.
 

5533
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:13,270
short first b first bounce short.
This short. I wanted to be short above

5534
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:13,280
This short. I wanted to be short above
 

5535
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:14,709
This short. I wanted to be short above
here. That's what I was looking for

5536
02:09:14,709 --> 02:09:14,719
here. That's what I was looking for
 

5537
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:17,109
here. That's what I was looking for
today.

5538
02:09:17,109 --> 02:09:17,119
today.
 

5539
02:09:17,119 --> 02:09:18,629
today.
And now we're potentially in range

5540
02:09:18,629 --> 02:09:18,639
And now we're potentially in range
 

5541
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:21,910
And now we're potentially in range
rotation slash. We can be in a trend if

5542
02:09:21,910 --> 02:09:21,920
rotation slash. We can be in a trend if
 

5543
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,270
rotation slash. We can be in a trend if
we start letting go of this. All right.

5544
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:23,280
we start letting go of this. All right.
 

5545
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:24,550
we start letting go of this. All right.
If we start I just want to make this

5546
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:24,560
If we start I just want to make this
 

5547
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:27,830
If we start I just want to make this
clear. If we let go of this

5548
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:27,840
clear. If we let go of this
 

5549
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,870
clear. If we let go of this
and we let go of this, this can offer a

5550
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:30,880
and we let go of this, this can offer a
 

5551
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:35,430
and we let go of this, this can offer a
move here because if we zoom out,

5552
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:35,440

 

5553
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:38,550

that is possible. Cannot rule that out.

5554
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:38,560
that is possible. Cannot rule that out.
 

5555
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,990
that is possible. Cannot rule that out.
Uh Richard, I know I think you're in

5556
02:09:39,990 --> 02:09:40,000
Uh Richard, I know I think you're in
 

5557
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,430
Uh Richard, I know I think you're in
Discord, right? If you look in Discord,

5558
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:41,440
Discord, right? If you look in Discord,
 

5559
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,430
Discord, right? If you look in Discord,
look at what we look the two trades we

5560
02:09:43,430 --> 02:09:43,440
look at what we look the two trades we
 

5561
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:45,350
look at what we look the two trades we
talked about this morning. Both have

5562
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:45,360
talked about this morning. Both have
 

5563
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:48,149
talked about this morning. Both have
started happening.

5564
02:09:48,149 --> 02:09:48,159
started happening.
 

5565
02:09:48,159 --> 02:09:52,550
started happening.
In my discord,

5573
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:02,550
right, this to move lower into 24158
over the week and today probable range

5574
02:10:02,550 --> 02:10:02,560

rotation between them to create that
 

5577
02:10:04,079 --> 02:10:11,189
rotation between them to create that

5578
02:10:11,189 --> 02:10:11,199

 

5579
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:13,430

Vick's still going.

Nothing to bid off right now, folks. For

02:10:16,239 --> 02:10:18,709
those of you looking long, there's
nothing to bid off right now. We are

5586
02:10:18,709 --> 02:10:18,719
nothing to bid off right now. We are
 

5587
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:20,709
nothing to bid off right now. We are
outside of previous day value. We're at

02:10:20,709 --> 02:10:20,719
outside of previous day value. We're at
 

5589
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:22,310
outside of previous day value. We're at
initial balance low. We're at an area of

5590
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:22,320
initial balance low. We're at an area of
 

5591
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:25,350
initial balance low. We're at an area of
interest, but we can still trade lower

5592
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:25,360
interest, but we can still trade lower
 

5593
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:27,350

if it wants. MAG, remember, has been

5595

heavy other than Tesla and Google, which
 

5597
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:31,109
heavy other than Tesla and Google, which
have started pulling back off their

Just be aware of that. If you go in a

5602
02:10:34,709 --> 02:10:34,719
Just be aware of that. If you go in a
 

5603
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:36,709
Just be aware of that. If you go in a
squeeze, it will become very, very

5604
02:10:36,709 --> 02:10:36,719
squeeze, it will become very, very
 

5605
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:38,229
squeeze, it will become very, very
obvious.

5606
02:10:38,229 --> 02:10:38,239
obvious.
 

5607
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:40,709
obvious.
I'd be very, very cautious trying to

5608
02:10:40,709 --> 02:10:40,719
I'd be very, very cautious trying to
 

5609
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:42,550
I'd be very, very cautious trying to
pick bottoms. If we're breaking out

5610
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:42,560
pick bottoms. If we're breaking out
 

5611
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,310
pick bottoms. If we're breaking out
outside of previous day's value area

5612
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:44,320
outside of previous day's value area
 

5613
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:46,149
outside of previous day's value area
low, there are targets below. Remember,

5614
02:10:46,149 --> 02:10:46,159
low, there are targets below. Remember,
 

5615
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:47,910
low, there are targets below. Remember,
we've been in a heavy market. Friday was

5616
02:10:47,910 --> 02:10:47,920
we've been in a heavy market. Friday was
 

5617
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:49,990
we've been in a heavy market. Friday was
a short squeeze up. Today, we've gone in

5618
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:50,000
a short squeeze up. Today, we've gone in
 

5619
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:53,750
a short squeeze up. Today, we've gone in
some range rotation and we're in like a

5620
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:53,760
some range rotation and we're in like a
 

5621
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:55,750
some range rotation and we're in like a
an area where we've built well, an area

5622
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:55,760
an area where we've built well, an area
 

5623
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,350
an area where we've built well, an area
an area up here we've built lots of

5624
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:57,360
an area up here we've built lots of
 

5625
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:00,149
an area up here we've built lots of
liquidity. It just depends what their

5626
02:11:00,149 --> 02:11:00,159
liquidity. It just depends what their
 

5627
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:02,629
liquidity. It just depends what their
ambitions are. I would say before

5628
02:11:02,629 --> 02:11:02,639
ambitions are. I would say before
 

5629
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:05,350
ambitions are. I would say before
Wednesday before Wednesday what is their

5630
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:05,360
Wednesday before Wednesday what is their
 

5631
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:08,229
Wednesday before Wednesday what is their
ambition in this market before Wednesday

ambition in this market before Wednesday
 

5633
02:11:08,239 --> 02:11:20,550
ambition in this market before Wednesday
that's what matters

did any of you take this I'm actually

5640
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:26,880
did any of you take this I'm actually
 

5641
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:28,870
did any of you take this I'm actually
fairly surprised they let this work but

5642
02:11:28,870 --> 02:11:28,880
fairly surprised they let this work but
 

5643
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:31,109
fairly surprised they let this work but
did any of you take that I mean Very,

5644
02:11:31,109 --> 02:11:31,119
did any of you take that I mean Very,
 

5645
02:11:31,119 --> 02:11:35,109
did any of you take that I mean Very,
very nice. Tight risk for that move. I

5646
02:11:35,109 --> 02:11:35,119
very nice. Tight risk for that move. I
 

5647
02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:36,470
very nice. Tight risk for that move. I
didn't take it. I didn't think I didn't

5648
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:36,480
didn't take it. I didn't think I didn't
 

5649
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:39,510
didn't take it. I didn't think I didn't
think they'd give it to us.

5650
02:11:39,510 --> 02:11:39,520
think they'd give it to us.
 

5651
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,830
think they'd give it to us.
I thought maybe they'd test twice, but

5652
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:41,840
I thought maybe they'd test twice, but
 

5653
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:44,470
I thought maybe they'd test twice, but
there we go.

5654
02:11:44,470 --> 02:11:44,480
there we go.
 

5655
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,149
there we go.
But like, you know, I'm a little bit

5656
02:11:46,149 --> 02:11:46,159
But like, you know, I'm a little bit
 

5657
02:11:46,159 --> 02:11:48,229
But like, you know, I'm a little bit
more hesitant as a trader when we're

5658
02:11:48,229 --> 02:11:48,239
more hesitant as a trader when we're
 

5659
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:49,990
more hesitant as a trader when we're
trading in these kind of ranges. They're

5660
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,000
trading in these kind of ranges. They're
 

5661
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,750
trading in these kind of ranges. They're
not my favorite trades. I know they are

5662
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:51,760
not my favorite trades. I know they are
 

5663
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,750
not my favorite trades. I know they are
not my strong point. My strong point is

5664
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:53,760
not my strong point. My strong point is
 

5665
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,589
not my strong point. My strong point is
when we move outside of these areas.

5666
02:11:55,589 --> 02:11:55,599
when we move outside of these areas.
 

5667
02:11:55,599 --> 02:11:57,510
when we move outside of these areas.
This is where you would see last week,

5668
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:57,520
This is where you would see last week,
 

5669
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:59,430
This is where you would see last week,
Tuesday, and was it Thursday? Tuesday

5670
02:11:59,430 --> 02:11:59,440
Tuesday, and was it Thursday? Tuesday
 

5671
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:00,709
Tuesday, and was it Thursday? Tuesday
and Thursday last week where we caught

5672
02:12:00,709 --> 02:12:00,719
and Thursday last week where we caught
 

5673
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:05,750
and Thursday last week where we caught
two 300 point bangers

5674
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:05,760

 

5675
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,589

in three micros. You took the short on

5676
02:12:07,589 --> 02:12:07,599
in three micros. You took the short on
 

5677
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:09,430
in three micros. You took the short on
the Russell around there. Nice. So, lots

5678
02:12:09,430 --> 02:12:09,440
the Russell around there. Nice. So, lots
 

5679
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:11,830
the Russell around there. Nice. So, lots
of you got it. Good work. Good work.

5680
02:12:11,830 --> 02:12:11,840
of you got it. Good work. Good work.
 

5681
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,669
of you got it. Good work. Good work.
Good work. As long as you're trading

5682
02:12:13,669 --> 02:12:13,679
Good work. As long as you're trading
 

5683
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:16,790
Good work. As long as you're trading
your plan, it's all that matters.

5684
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:16,800
your plan, it's all that matters.
 

5685
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,950
your plan, it's all that matters.
Remember, I'm I'm human. I can call

5686
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:18,960
Remember, I'm I'm human. I can call
 

5687
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:21,430
Remember, I'm I'm human. I can call
stuff, but when I know that something is

5688
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:21,440
stuff, but when I know that something is
 

5689
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:24,790
stuff, but when I know that something is
not my uh my strong point, I have to at

5690
02:12:24,790 --> 02:12:24,800
not my uh my strong point, I have to at
 

5691
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:27,030
not my uh my strong point, I have to at
least be

5692
02:12:27,030 --> 02:12:27,040
least be
 

5693
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,950
least be
aware of it. Like I talk about, get get

5694
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:28,960
aware of it. Like I talk about, get get
 

5695
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,310
aware of it. Like I talk about, get get
around the golf course with an eight eye

5696
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:30,320
around the golf course with an eight eye
 

5697
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:31,510
around the golf course with an eight eye
and I'm not trying to get the driver

5698
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:31,520
and I'm not trying to get the driver
 

5699
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:34,870
and I'm not trying to get the driver
out, you know, in a uh in a bunker.

5700
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:34,880
out, you know, in a uh in a bunker.
 

5701
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:38,950
out, you know, in a uh in a bunker.
Let's put it that way, right?

5702
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:38,960
Let's put it that way, right?
 

5703
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,990
Let's put it that way, right?
Market's moving fast here. The tape is

5704
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:42,000
Market's moving fast here. The tape is
 

5705
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,510
Market's moving fast here. The tape is
moving very very quick. Up, down, up,

5706
02:12:43,510 --> 02:12:43,520
moving very very quick. Up, down, up,
 

5707
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:45,830
moving very very quick. Up, down, up,
down, up, down. This is a battle

5708
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:45,840
down, up, down. This is a battle
 

5709
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:49,830
down, up, down. This is a battle
starting to develop here.

5710
02:12:49,830 --> 02:12:49,840

 

5711
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:52,069

I'd be very cognizant of that uh

5712
02:12:52,069 --> 02:12:52,079
I'd be very cognizant of that uh
 

5713
02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:55,430
I'd be very cognizant of that uh
previous day value area low and New York

5714
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:55,440
previous day value area low and New York
 

5715
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:57,510
previous day value area low and New York
open. That is a massive, massive area.

5716
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:57,520
open. That is a massive, massive area.
 

5717
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:00,950
open. That is a massive, massive area.
If they reclaim that,

5718
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:00,960
If they reclaim that,
 

5719
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:02,709
If they reclaim that,
then are probably all the way back up to

5720
02:13:02,709 --> 02:13:02,719
then are probably all the way back up to
 

5721
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:09,189
then are probably all the way back up to
64s.

5722
02:13:09,189 --> 02:13:09,199

 

5723
02:13:09,199 --> 02:13:12,550

So, I see bulls try and come in here.

5724
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:12,560
So, I see bulls try and come in here.
 

5725
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:14,069
So, I see bulls try and come in here.
They are trying to come in here to get

5726
02:13:14,069 --> 02:13:14,079
They are trying to come in here to get
 

5727
02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:15,510
They are trying to come in here to get
back towards previous day value area

5728
02:13:15,510 --> 02:13:15,520
back towards previous day value area
 

5729
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:17,030
back towards previous day value area
low. Bears are defending very, very

5730
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:17,040
low. Bears are defending very, very
 

5731
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:24,950
low. Bears are defending very, very
well. Man, this tape's moving so quick.

5732
02:13:24,950 --> 02:13:24,960

 

5733
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:27,589

So maybe a 25,000 check and if they get

5734
02:13:27,589 --> 02:13:27,599
So maybe a 25,000 check and if they get
 

5735
02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:30,149
So maybe a 25,000 check and if they get
through that maybe a squeeze to 25,60 is

5736
02:13:30,149 --> 02:13:30,159
through that maybe a squeeze to 25,60 is
 

5737
02:13:30,159 --> 02:13:31,189
through that maybe a squeeze to 25,60 is
basically what I'm saying. If they

5738
02:13:31,189 --> 02:13:31,199
basically what I'm saying. If they
 

5739
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:36,790
basically what I'm saying. If they
defend that, maybe new low of day.

5740
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:36,800

 

5741
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:37,910

So they're trying to get up to that

5742
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:37,920
So they're trying to get up to that
 

5743
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:42,229
So they're trying to get up to that
25,000 like we just talked about.

5744
02:13:42,229 --> 02:13:42,239
25,000 like we just talked about.
 

5745
02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:43,750
25,000 like we just talked about.
And if they get back inside previous

5746
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:43,760
And if they get back inside previous
 

5747
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:44,950
And if they get back inside previous
day's value, it's going to be a look

5748
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:44,960
day's value, it's going to be a look
 

5749
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,390
day's value, it's going to be a look
look below and fail, right? If they get

5750
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:46,400
look below and fail, right? If they get
 

5751
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:48,149
look below and fail, right? If they get
back inside of previous days value, it's

5752
02:13:48,149 --> 02:13:48,159
back inside of previous days value, it's
 

5753
02:13:48,159 --> 02:13:49,669
back inside of previous days value, it's
possibly a look below and fail. Here's

5754
02:13:49,669 --> 02:13:49,679
possibly a look below and fail. Here's
 

5755
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:51,430
possibly a look below and fail. Here's
previous day's value. If they get back

5756
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:51,440
previous day's value. If they get back
 

5757
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:54,310
previous day's value. If they get back
inside of this that I could imagine it's

5758
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:54,320
inside of this that I could imagine it's
 

5759
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:56,229
inside of this that I could imagine it's
not the best excess here, but I could

5760
02:13:56,229 --> 02:13:56,239
not the best excess here, but I could
 

5761
02:13:56,239 --> 02:13:59,030
not the best excess here, but I could
imagine if if they can get back inside

5762
02:13:59,030 --> 02:13:59,040
imagine if if they can get back inside
 

5763
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,870
imagine if if they can get back inside
this why bears will want to defend this

5764
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:00,880
this why bears will want to defend this
 

5765
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:02,629
this why bears will want to defend this
for a breakdown. Bulls will want to

5766
02:14:02,629 --> 02:14:02,639
for a breakdown. Bulls will want to
 

5767
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:04,870
for a breakdown. Bulls will want to
reclaim this for a move back to this

5768
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:04,880
reclaim this for a move back to this
 

5769
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:06,709
reclaim this for a move back to this
area.

5770
02:14:06,709 --> 02:14:06,719
area.
 

5771
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:09,750
area.
This is why these days are definitely

5772
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:09,760
This is why these days are definitely
 

5773
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,910
This is why these days are definitely
not my favorite days to trade. When we

5774
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:11,920
not my favorite days to trade. When we
 

5775
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,350
not my favorite days to trade. When we
move outside of these days, they become

5776
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:13,360
move outside of these days, they become
 

5777
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:20,950
move outside of these days, they become
my favorite days to trade.

5778
02:14:20,950 --> 02:14:20,960

 

5779
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,950

So, as a whole, the mag right now is

5780
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:22,960
So, as a whole, the mag right now is
 

5781
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:26,390
So, as a whole, the mag right now is
flat. Even with Tesla 2.80% up and

5782
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:26,400
flat. Even with Tesla 2.80% up and
 

5783
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:29,270
flat. Even with Tesla 2.80% up and
Google 4% up, the mag as a whole is flat

5784
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:29,280
Google 4% up, the mag as a whole is flat
 

5785
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:33,270
Google 4% up, the mag as a whole is flat
because everything else is selling.

5786
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:33,280

 

5787
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:37,350

No worries, Jack.

5788
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:37,360

 

5789
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:40,550

Yeah, no worries, Jack. Uh, what did you

5790
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:40,560
Yeah, no worries, Jack. Uh, what did you
 

5791
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:42,629
Yeah, no worries, Jack. Uh, what did you
take, Jack? You were short today. Are

5792
02:14:42,629 --> 02:14:42,639
take, Jack? You were short today. Are
 

5793
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:45,189
take, Jack? You were short today. Are
you Are you long off IB? Sorry, I might

5794
02:14:45,189 --> 02:14:45,199
you Are you long off IB? Sorry, I might
 

5795
02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:47,030
you Are you long off IB? Sorry, I might
have forgotten. The tape's moving quick.

5796
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:47,040
have forgotten. The tape's moving quick.
 

5797
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,550
have forgotten. The tape's moving quick.
Here we go. So, here's the test of

5798
02:14:48,550 --> 02:14:48,560
Here we go. So, here's the test of
 

5799
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:50,229
Here we go. So, here's the test of
25,000. They're trying to test that New

5800
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:50,239
25,000. They're trying to test that New
 

5801
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:52,310
25,000. They're trying to test that New
York open previous day value area low.

5802
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:52,320
York open previous day value area low.
 

5803
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:55,030
York open previous day value area low.
If they get through here, okay, then a

5804
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:55,040
If they get through here, okay, then a
 

5805
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:57,990
If they get through here, okay, then a
move to 60 is possible. Bears might come

5806
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:58,000
move to 60 is possible. Bears might come
 

5807
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,910
move to 60 is possible. Bears might come
flying in here, folks. All right. They

5808
02:14:59,910 --> 02:14:59,920
flying in here, folks. All right. They
 

5809
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:01,350
flying in here, folks. All right. They
might come flying in here, the bears,

5810
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:01,360
might come flying in here, the bears,
 

5811
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:02,629
might come flying in here, the bears,
and just be like, "What do you think

5812
02:15:02,629 --> 02:15:02,639
and just be like, "What do you think
 

5813
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:04,229
and just be like, "What do you think
you're doing? We're going lower." We

5814
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:04,239
you're doing? We're going lower." We
 

5815
02:15:04,239 --> 02:15:06,950
you're doing? We're going lower." We
don't know.

5816
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:06,960
don't know.
 

5817
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,910
don't know.
This a massive level as we come into the

5818
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:09,920
This a massive level as we come into the
 

5819
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:16,390
This a massive level as we come into the
come into these levels.

5820
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:16,400

 

5821
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:17,750

At the moment, they've not even been

5822
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:17,760
At the moment, they've not even been
 

5823
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:20,310
At the moment, they've not even been
able to test 25,000. Bears defending 90s

5824
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:20,320
able to test 25,000. Bears defending 90s
 

5825
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,229
able to test 25,000. Bears defending 90s
at the moment. So, not even into the

5826
02:15:22,229 --> 02:15:22,239
at the moment. So, not even into the
 

5827
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:25,270
at the moment. So, not even into the
25,000s yet. They might not let them

5828
02:15:25,270 --> 02:15:25,280
25,000s yet. They might not let them
 

5829
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:26,790
25,000s yet. They might not let them
into there. They might keep defending

5830
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:26,800
into there. They might keep defending
 

5831
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:29,189
into there. They might keep defending
it.

5832
02:15:29,189 --> 02:15:29,199
it.
 

5833
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:30,790
it.
Little bit of bullish excess on that

5834
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:30,800
Little bit of bullish excess on that
 

5835
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:33,109
Little bit of bullish excess on that
last move up.

5836
02:15:33,109 --> 02:15:33,119
last move up.
 

5837
02:15:33,119 --> 02:15:39,910
last move up.
Let's see.

5838
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:39,920

 

5839
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:41,270

Google really starting to sell here,

5840
02:15:41,270 --> 02:15:41,280
Google really starting to sell here,
 

5841
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,030
Google really starting to sell here,
folks. be be a little bit careful. It's

5842
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:43,040
folks. be be a little bit careful. It's
 

5843
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,830
folks. be be a little bit careful. It's
now only 3.83% up. Remember about 10

5844
02:15:45,830 --> 02:15:45,840
now only 3.83% up. Remember about 10
 

5845
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:48,390
now only 3.83% up. Remember about 10
minutes ago it was 5 and a half% up. So

5846
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:48,400
minutes ago it was 5 and a half% up. So
 

5847
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:49,750
minutes ago it was 5 and a half% up. So
you're starting to see that pullback on

5848
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:49,760
you're starting to see that pullback on
 

5849
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:52,069
you're starting to see that pullback on
the Google

5850
02:15:52,069 --> 02:15:52,079
the Google
 

5851
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:54,390
the Google
retesting towards these lows now. Now

5852
02:15:54,390 --> 02:15:54,400
retesting towards these lows now. Now
 

5853
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:55,669
retesting towards these lows now. Now
this is where it's going to get very

5854
02:15:55,669 --> 02:15:55,679
this is where it's going to get very
 

5855
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:56,870
this is where it's going to get very
very tricky. They're going to build out

5856
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:56,880
very tricky. They're going to build out
 

5857
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,629
very tricky. They're going to build out
a range here and you know the

5858
02:15:58,629 --> 02:15:58,639
a range here and you know the
 

5859
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:00,310
a range here and you know the
battlegrounds. I've given you the B

5860
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:00,320
battlegrounds. I've given you the B
 

5861
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:02,709
battlegrounds. I've given you the B
battlegrounds. Basically IB low to

5862
02:16:02,709 --> 02:16:02,719
battlegrounds. Basically IB low to
 

5863
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,030
battlegrounds. Basically IB low to
previous day value area low. Those are

5864
02:16:05,030 --> 02:16:05,040
previous day value area low. Those are
 

5865
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:07,750
previous day value area low. Those are
the battlegrounds. Someone is going to

5866
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:07,760
the battlegrounds. Someone is going to
 

5867
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:10,069
the battlegrounds. Someone is going to
get hurt. Here is the squeeze up towards

5868
02:16:10,069 --> 02:16:10,079
get hurt. Here is the squeeze up towards
 

5869
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:11,669
get hurt. Here is the squeeze up towards
25,000.

5870
02:16:11,669 --> 02:16:11,679
25,000.
 

5871
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:14,069
25,000.
Can they get through 25,000? This is the

5872
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:14,079
Can they get through 25,000? This is the
 

5873
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:15,990
Can they get through 25,000? This is the
question now.

5874
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:16,000
question now.
 

5875
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,550
question now.
If they can, we're going to go uh tens

5876
02:16:18,550 --> 02:16:18,560
If they can, we're going to go uh tens
 

5877
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,109
If they can, we're going to go uh tens
and then 60s for those of you long. So,

5878
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:21,119
and then 60s for those of you long. So,
 

5879
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:24,550
and then 60s for those of you long. So,
if they can bid over this,

5880
02:16:24,550 --> 02:16:24,560
if they can bid over this,
 

5881
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:26,069
if they can bid over this,
like we talked about, if they can bid

5882
02:16:26,069 --> 02:16:26,079
like we talked about, if they can bid
 

5883
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:28,149
like we talked about, if they can bid
over this, this is available. If they

5884
02:16:28,149 --> 02:16:28,159
over this, this is available. If they
 

5885
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:30,709
over this, this is available. If they
defend this, they will look for a wash.

5886
02:16:30,709 --> 02:16:30,719
defend this, they will look for a wash.
 

5887
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:33,830
defend this, they will look for a wash.
This is your rotation. IBL to previous

5888
02:16:33,830 --> 02:16:33,840
This is your rotation. IBL to previous
 

5889
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,669
This is your rotation. IBL to previous
day value area low. Here you go. So,

5890
02:16:35,669 --> 02:16:35,679
day value area low. Here you go. So,
 

5891
02:16:35,679 --> 02:16:37,589
day value area low. Here you go. So,
here's the squeeze through. Can they

5892
02:16:37,589 --> 02:16:37,599
here's the squeeze through. Can they
 

5893
02:16:37,599 --> 02:16:39,190
here's the squeeze through. Can they
hold above it? It's not just the

5894
02:16:39,190 --> 02:16:39,200
hold above it? It's not just the
 

5895
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,030
hold above it? It's not just the
squeeze, it's the hold above it. Here's

5896
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:41,040
squeeze, it's the hold above it. Here's
 

5897
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,950
squeeze, it's the hold above it. Here's
2510s.

5898
02:16:42,950 --> 02:16:42,960
2510s.
 

5899
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:44,389
2510s.
Very important. Now, for those of you

5900
02:16:44,389 --> 02:16:44,399
Very important. Now, for those of you
 

5901
02:16:44,399 --> 02:16:47,270
Very important. Now, for those of you
long, lock some in because you don't

5902
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:47,280
long, lock some in because you don't
 

5903
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:49,429
long, lock some in because you don't
know if they sell this. And if they hold

5904
02:16:49,429 --> 02:16:49,439
know if they sell this. And if they hold
 

5905
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:52,230
know if they sell this. And if they hold
the dip back into it, then you look good

5906
02:16:52,230 --> 02:16:52,240
the dip back into it, then you look good
 

5907
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:55,349
the dip back into it, then you look good
for a move to 25,000. And where's this?

5908
02:16:55,349 --> 02:16:55,359
for a move to 25,000. And where's this?
 

5909
02:16:55,359 --> 02:17:00,389
for a move to 25,000. And where's this?
60 to 80.

5910
02:17:00,389 --> 02:17:00,399

 

5911
02:17:00,399 --> 02:17:02,309

Big buying came in there. So, shorts

5912
02:17:02,309 --> 02:17:02,319
Big buying came in there. So, shorts
 

5913
02:17:02,319 --> 02:17:04,950
Big buying came in there. So, shorts
getting squeezed out here.

5914
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:04,960
getting squeezed out here.
 

5915
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,509
getting squeezed out here.
And the buyers have won this rotation.

5916
02:17:07,509 --> 02:17:07,519
And the buyers have won this rotation.
 

5917
02:17:07,519 --> 02:17:09,509
And the buyers have won this rotation.
So they need to hold a pullback now. The

5918
02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:09,519
So they need to hold a pullback now. The
 

5919
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:11,910
So they need to hold a pullback now. The
buyers must hold a pullback now.

5920
02:17:11,910 --> 02:17:11,920
buyers must hold a pullback now.
 

5921
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:13,190
buyers must hold a pullback now.
Otherwise, it's nothing more than a

5922
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:13,200
Otherwise, it's nothing more than a
 

5923
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:14,549
Otherwise, it's nothing more than a
short squeeze. Buyers need to hold a

5924
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:14,559
short squeeze. Buyers need to hold a
 

5925
02:17:14,559 --> 02:17:16,469
short squeeze. Buyers need to hold a
pullback if we're going to go up towards

5926
02:17:16,469 --> 02:17:16,479
pullback if we're going to go up towards
 

5927
02:17:16,479 --> 02:17:18,870
pullback if we're going to go up towards
those 60s.

5928
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:18,880
those 60s.
 

5929
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:20,309
those 60s.
Otherwise, it's just a squeeze out,

5930
02:17:20,309 --> 02:17:20,319
Otherwise, it's just a squeeze out,
 

5931
02:17:20,319 --> 02:17:22,309
Otherwise, it's just a squeeze out,
right? So buyers must hold a pullback to

5932
02:17:22,309 --> 02:17:22,319
right? So buyers must hold a pullback to
 

5933
02:17:22,319 --> 02:17:24,230
right? So buyers must hold a pullback to
create some structure. And ideally, that

5934
02:17:24,230 --> 02:17:24,240
create some structure. And ideally, that
 

5935
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,230
create some structure. And ideally, that
pullback would be around the value area

5936
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:26,240
pullback would be around the value area
 

5937
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:27,429
pullback would be around the value area
low. You wouldn't want to see it go

5938
02:17:27,429 --> 02:17:27,439
low. You wouldn't want to see it go
 

5939
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:28,870
low. You wouldn't want to see it go
lower than that. Really, definitely not

5940
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:28,880
lower than that. Really, definitely not
 

5941
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:33,190
lower than that. Really, definitely not
lower than New York open.

5942
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:33,200

 

5943
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:37,509

So you look good. You look good.

5944
02:17:37,509 --> 02:17:37,519
So you look good. You look good.
 

5945
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:39,349
So you look good. You look good.
Hold on to your runners if you can. Make

5946
02:17:39,349 --> 02:17:39,359
Hold on to your runners if you can. Make
 

5947
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:40,629
Hold on to your runners if you can. Make
sure you've paid yourself like we always

5948
02:17:40,629 --> 02:17:40,639
sure you've paid yourself like we always
 

5949
02:17:40,639 --> 02:17:42,629
sure you've paid yourself like we always
talk about. But here you go. All right.

5950
02:17:42,629 --> 02:17:42,639
talk about. But here you go. All right.
 

5951
02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:45,270
talk about. But here you go. All right.
Now, I'm in this long at this point. Can

5952
02:17:45,270 --> 02:17:45,280
Now, I'm in this long at this point. Can
 

5953
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:48,629
Now, I'm in this long at this point. Can
we get up to 60s?

5954
02:17:48,629 --> 02:17:48,639
we get up to 60s?
 

5955
02:17:48,639 --> 02:17:52,309
we get up to 60s?
Can we get up to 60s?

5956
02:17:52,309 --> 02:17:52,319
Can we get up to 60s?
 

5957
02:17:52,319 --> 02:17:54,549
Can we get up to 60s?
Can we get up to 60s is 40s. I'd love to

5958
02:17:54,549 --> 02:17:54,559
Can we get up to 60s is 40s. I'd love to
 

5959
02:17:54,559 --> 02:17:57,990
Can we get up to 60s is 40s. I'd love to
get to 60s and 80s if possible.

5960
02:17:57,990 --> 02:17:58,000
get to 60s and 80s if possible.
 

5961
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,509
get to 60s and 80s if possible.
I got to move my book mat so I can see

5962
02:17:59,509 --> 02:17:59,519
I got to move my book mat so I can see
 

5963
02:17:59,519 --> 02:18:00,950
I got to move my book mat so I can see
the order flow. Look how quickly it

5964
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:00,960
the order flow. Look how quickly it
 

5965
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:02,309
the order flow. Look how quickly it
moves. I can't even see the order flow.

5966
02:18:02,309 --> 02:18:02,319
moves. I can't even see the order flow.
 

5967
02:18:02,319 --> 02:18:05,110
moves. I can't even see the order flow.
It's so quick right now. 50s 10 more

5968
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:05,120
It's so quick right now. 50s 10 more
 

5969
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:06,469
It's so quick right now. 50s 10 more
points if possible. Moving my stop up

5970
02:18:06,469 --> 02:18:06,479
points if possible. Moving my stop up
 

5971
02:18:06,479 --> 02:18:08,549
points if possible. Moving my stop up
with it because this is short squeezy.

5972
02:18:08,549 --> 02:18:08,559
with it because this is short squeezy.
 

5973
02:18:08,559 --> 02:18:10,389
with it because this is short squeezy.
Okay, stopped out there on the little

5974
02:18:10,389 --> 02:18:10,399
Okay, stopped out there on the little
 

5975
02:18:10,399 --> 02:18:12,309
Okay, stopped out there on the little
piece of it. We want to still hold a

5976
02:18:12,309 --> 02:18:12,319
piece of it. We want to still hold a
 

5977
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:19,589
piece of it. We want to still hold a
pullback. So, let's see.

5978
02:18:19,589 --> 02:18:19,599

 

5979
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:21,509

I want to see this hold pull back if I'm

5980
02:18:21,509 --> 02:18:21,519
I want to see this hold pull back if I'm
 

5981
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:23,830
I want to see this hold pull back if I'm
going to get any more size into this.

5982
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:23,840
going to get any more size into this.
 

5983
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:26,469
going to get any more size into this.
Looks good. Looks good. They just

5984
02:18:26,469 --> 02:18:26,479
Looks good. Looks good. They just
 

5985
02:18:26,479 --> 02:18:27,910
Looks good. Looks good. They just
retrapped there. That's not deep enough

5986
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:27,920
retrapped there. That's not deep enough
 

5987
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:30,230
retrapped there. That's not deep enough
for me to re-enter, but uh it looks good

5988
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:30,240
for me to re-enter, but uh it looks good
 

5989
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:32,629
for me to re-enter, but uh it looks good
for everyone long from lots of you long

5990
02:18:32,629 --> 02:18:32,639
for everyone long from lots of you long
 

5991
02:18:32,639 --> 02:18:33,910
for everyone long from lots of you long
from down here. Even if you use a little

5992
02:18:33,910 --> 02:18:33,920
from down here. Even if you use a little
 

5993
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:36,950
from down here. Even if you use a little
trend line, look, very nice and simple,

5994
02:18:36,950 --> 02:18:36,960
trend line, look, very nice and simple,
 

5995
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:39,030
trend line, look, very nice and simple,
right? Shame we haven't built liquidity

5996
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:39,040
right? Shame we haven't built liquidity
 

5997
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:41,030
right? Shame we haven't built liquidity
here. That's what would be really nice.

5998
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:41,040
here. That's what would be really nice.
 

5999
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:43,589
here. That's what would be really nice.
But this is your TP. And if you get

6000
02:18:43,589 --> 02:18:43,599
But this is your TP. And if you get
 

6001
02:18:43,599 --> 02:18:45,669
But this is your TP. And if you get
through this hive day, and I'm not

6002
02:18:45,669 --> 02:18:45,679
through this hive day, and I'm not
 

6003
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:47,270
through this hive day, and I'm not
joking. If you get through this gray

6004
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:47,280
joking. If you get through this gray
 

6005
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:50,070
joking. If you get through this gray
level, you can go 55s and then hive day.

6006
02:18:50,070 --> 02:18:50,080
level, you can go 55s and then hive day.
 

6007
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:51,750
level, you can go 55s and then hive day.
And I'm absolutely dead serious about

6008
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:51,760
And I'm absolutely dead serious about
 

6009
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:53,270
And I'm absolutely dead serious about
that because we're in a rotational

6010
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:53,280
that because we're in a rotational
 

6011
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:57,509
that because we're in a rotational
market, right? If bears fail,

6012
02:18:57,509 --> 02:18:57,519
market, right? If bears fail,
 

6013
02:18:57,519 --> 02:18:58,790
market, right? If bears fail,
they failed to break down with

6014
02:18:58,790 --> 02:18:58,800
they failed to break down with
 

6015
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:01,270
they failed to break down with
conviction under here. They got stuck.

6016
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:01,280
conviction under here. They got stuck.
 

6017
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:03,429
conviction under here. They got stuck.
We've squeezed back over. We need to

6018
02:19:03,429 --> 02:19:03,439
We've squeezed back over. We need to
 

6019
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:05,669
We've squeezed back over. We need to
hold a pullback here. Really, you'd want

6020
02:19:05,669 --> 02:19:05,679
hold a pullback here. Really, you'd want
 

6021
02:19:05,679 --> 02:19:07,509
hold a pullback here. Really, you'd want
to see a pullback hold this. This is

6022
02:19:07,509 --> 02:19:07,519
to see a pullback hold this. This is
 

6023
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:10,070
to see a pullback hold this. This is
your TP, then this, and then high of

6024
02:19:10,070 --> 02:19:10,080
your TP, then this, and then high of
 

6025
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:12,629
your TP, then this, and then high of
day. And I'm deadly serious. This can be

6026

day. And I'm deadly serious. This can be
 

6027
02:19:12,639 --> 02:19:14,870
day. And I'm deadly serious. This can be
really nasty in a rotational market.

6028
02:19:14,870 --> 02:19:14,880
really nasty in a rotational market.
 

6029
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:29,910
really nasty in a rotational market.
It's why you don't short lows.

respect the structure. This is a big
shelf. Starts at 60. It gets a bit

6040
02:19:41,509 --> 02:19:41,519
shelf. Starts at 60. It gets a bit
 

6041
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:43,349
shelf. Starts at 60. It gets a bit
thicker into sort of 7780 which is

6042
02:19:43,349 --> 02:19:43,359
thicker into sort of 7780 which is
 

6043
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:45,110
thicker into sort of 7780 which is
probably where it's about to revisit.

6044
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:45,120
probably where it's about to revisit.
 

6045

big trouble. All right. So the shorts at
 

6053
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:52,309
big trouble. All right. So the shorts at
the lows are at trouble. We're going to

6054
02:19:52,309 --> 02:19:52,319
the lows are at trouble. We're going to
 

6055
02:19:52,319 --> 02:19:54,469
the lows are at trouble. We're going to
use their pain to here. If we use shorts

6056
02:19:54,469 --> 02:19:54,479
use their pain to here. If we use shorts
 

6057
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:56,790
use their pain to here. If we use shorts
in here's pain. I'm looking for a

6058
02:19:56,790 --> 02:19:56,800
in here's pain. I'm looking for a
 

6059
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:59,110
in here's pain. I'm looking for a
re-entry here unfortunately. If we use

6060
02:19:59,110 --> 02:19:59,120
re-entry here unfortunately. If we use
 

6061
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,790
re-entry here unfortunately. If we use
shorts in here as pain, we will rotate

6062
02:20:00,790 --> 02:20:00,800
shorts in here as pain, we will rotate
 

6063
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,950
shorts in here as pain, we will rotate
between here. If we break out of this

6064
02:20:02,950 --> 02:20:02,960
between here. If we break out of this
 

6065
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:04,950
between here. If we break out of this
guy, we're going to go for high of day.

6066
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:04,960
guy, we're going to go for high of day.

must must must. It's your point of
control. It's the most traded area of

6078
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:19,280
control. It's the most traded area of
 

6079
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:20,710
control. It's the most traded area of
the day. You can see the volume shelf

6080
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:20,720
the day. You can see the volume shelf
 

6081
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:23,830

here. must TP some out here
 

6083
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:25,910
here. must TP some out here
because this is a squeeze and they can

6084
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:25,920
because this is a squeeze and they can
 

6085
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:29,910
because this is a squeeze and they can
pull all the way back down to 25,000.

6086
02:20:29,910 --> 02:20:29,920
pull all the way back down to 25,000.

25,000. That's where I was looking to
 

6091
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:36,150
25,000. That's where I was looking to
read on after I sold that last push. So,

6092
02:20:36,150 --> 02:20:36,160
read on after I sold that last push. So,
 

6093
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:38,389
read on after I sold that last push. So,

86 86 to 82 and bulls came flying in

6102
02:20:49,349 --> 02:20:49,359
86 86 to 82 and bulls came flying in
 

6103
02:20:49,359 --> 02:20:52,309
86 86 to 82 and bulls came flying in
from 98 to 07 and we've got a ton of

from 98 to 07 and we've got a ton of
 

6105
02:20:52,319 --> 02:20:54,389
from 98 to 07 and we've got a ton of
imbalances on this push up. All right,

6106
02:20:54,389 --> 02:20:54,399
imbalances on this push up. All right,
 

6107

02:22:20,389 --> 02:22:20,399
got to pay yourself,
 

6179
02:22:20,399 --> 02:22:22,710
got to pay yourself,
right? We're lacking

6180
02:22:22,710 --> 02:22:22,720
right? We're lacking
 

6181
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,150
right? We're lacking
structure. If you're looking at Have I

6182
02:22:24,150 --> 02:22:24,160
structure. If you're looking at Have I
 

6183
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:26,469
structure. If you're looking at Have I
got you on book map now? Yes. Can you

6184
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:26,479
got you on book map now? Yes. Can you
 

6185
02:22:26,479 --> 02:22:28,070
got you on book map now? Yes. Can you
see that? Hope you can. We are lacking

6186
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:28,080
see that? Hope you can. We are lacking
 

6187
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:31,590
see that? Hope you can. We are lacking
structure since here. This guy here, see

6188
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:31,600
structure since here. This guy here, see
 

6189
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:34,150
structure since here. This guy here, see
this guy here? This was the break. We're

6190
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,160
this guy here? This was the break. We're
 

6191
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,309
this guy here? This was the break. We're
lacking structure. That's uh almost 100

6192
02:22:36,309 --> 02:22:36,319
lacking structure. That's uh almost 100
 

6193
02:22:36,319 --> 02:22:38,230
lacking structure. That's uh almost 100
points back down. All right, so just be

6194
02:22:38,230 --> 02:22:38,240
points back down. All right, so just be
 

6195
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:40,309
points back down. All right, so just be
smart. Doesn't mean it can't keep going.

6196
02:22:40,309 --> 02:22:40,319
smart. Doesn't mean it can't keep going.
 

6197
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:41,990
smart. Doesn't mean it can't keep going.
It can, but I don't want you guys giving

6198
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:42,000
It can, but I don't want you guys giving
 

6199
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,150
It can, but I don't want you guys giving
a 100 points back. You'll be very upset

6200
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,160
a 100 points back. You'll be very upset
 

6201
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,670
a 100 points back. You'll be very upset
if you give a full 100 points back

6202
02:22:45,670 --> 02:22:45,680
if you give a full 100 points back
 

6203
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:59,990
if you give a full 100 points back
without taking some profits.

6204
02:22:59,990 --> 02:23:00,000

 

6205
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,590

Big buying up here at the top, which is

6206
02:23:01,590 --> 02:23:01,600
Big buying up here at the top, which is
 

6207
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:03,030
Big buying up here at the top, which is
not what you want to see. So just be

6208
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:03,040
not what you want to see. So just be
 

6209
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:06,389
not what you want to see. So just be
careful.

6210
02:23:06,389 --> 02:23:06,399

 

6211
02:23:06,399 --> 02:23:07,910

Yeah, Dex, that was it was you that

6212
02:23:07,910 --> 02:23:07,920
Yeah, Dex, that was it was you that
 

6213
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,110
Yeah, Dex, that was it was you that
called it, right? You were looking for a

6214
02:23:09,110 --> 02:23:09,120
called it, right? You were looking for a
 

6215
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:11,429
called it, right? You were looking for a
look below the eye below. And I was

6216
02:23:11,429 --> 02:23:11,439
look below the eye below. And I was
 

6217
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:14,230
look below the eye below. And I was
saying to you, just be careful. Um, but

6218
02:23:14,230 --> 02:23:14,240
saying to you, just be careful. Um, but
 

6219
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:17,110
saying to you, just be careful. Um, but
it was you absolutely you nailed it. You

6220
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:17,120
it was you absolutely you nailed it. You
 

6221
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:18,469
it was you absolutely you nailed it. You
nailed it. It did exactly what you

6222
02:23:18,469 --> 02:23:18,479
nailed it. It did exactly what you
 

6223
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:20,309
nailed it. It did exactly what you
wanted.

6224
02:23:20,309 --> 02:23:20,319
wanted.
 

6225
02:23:20,319 --> 02:23:23,030
wanted.
It did do what you wanted and it did it

6226
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:23,040
It did do what you wanted and it did it
 

6227
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:26,550
It did do what you wanted and it did it
did leave some excess down there. Um, if

6228
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:26,560
did leave some excess down there. Um, if
 

6229
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:29,510
did leave some excess down there. Um, if
we look at these lows,

6230
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:29,520
we look at these lows,
 

6231
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,110
we look at these lows,
it's these guys that got caught. Look,

6232
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:31,120
it's these guys that got caught. Look,
 

6233
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:32,389
it's these guys that got caught. Look,
all these guys getting caught at the

6234
02:23:32,389 --> 02:23:32,399
all these guys getting caught at the
 

6235
02:23:32,399 --> 02:23:34,070
all these guys getting caught at the
lows. This is what you want to see. It's

6236
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:34,080
lows. This is what you want to see. It's
 

6237
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,550
lows. This is what you want to see. It's
beautiful. And then, like I said, it was

6238
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:36,560
beautiful. And then, like I said, it was
 

6239
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:38,230
beautiful. And then, like I said, it was
moving quick. You can't see it in a one

6240
02:23:38,230 --> 02:23:38,240
moving quick. You can't see it in a one
 

6241
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:40,630
moving quick. You can't see it in a one
minute chart, but at these lows, they

6242
02:23:40,630 --> 02:23:40,640
minute chart, but at these lows, they
 

6243
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:43,429
minute chart, but at these lows, they
had three attempts to move lower um in

6244
02:23:43,429 --> 02:23:43,439
had three attempts to move lower um in
 

6245
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:45,429
had three attempts to move lower um in
this in this one minute candle.

6246
02:23:45,429 --> 02:23:45,439
this in this one minute candle.
 

6247
02:23:45,439 --> 02:23:47,750
this in this one minute candle.
Basically, from 1120

6248
02:23:47,750 --> 02:23:47,760
Basically, from 1120
 

6249
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:53,910
Basically, from 1120
to 11:2130. So, where's 1120?

6250
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:53,920
to 11:2130. So, where's 1120?
 

6251
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,429
to 11:2130. So, where's 1120?
This candle here, they had three

6252
02:23:55,429 --> 02:23:55,439
This candle here, they had three
 

6253
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:57,110
This candle here, they had three
attempts to move lower within that

6254
02:23:57,110 --> 02:23:57,120
attempts to move lower within that
 

6255
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:59,510
attempts to move lower within that
candle. That's when order flow is

6256
02:23:59,510 --> 02:23:59,520
candle. That's when order flow is
 

6257
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,190
candle. That's when order flow is
useful. Like I said, I'm more interested

6258
02:24:01,190 --> 02:24:01,200
useful. Like I said, I'm more interested
 

6259
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,670
useful. Like I said, I'm more interested
when we're at levels of interest, how we

6260
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:03,680
when we're at levels of interest, how we
 

6261
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:04,870
when we're at levels of interest, how we
operate. I don't want to look at it all

6262
02:24:04,870 --> 02:24:04,880
operate. I don't want to look at it all
 

6263
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:06,710
operate. I don't want to look at it all
the time. You're starting to see a

6264
02:24:06,710 --> 02:24:06,720
the time. You're starting to see a
 

6265
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:08,389
the time. You're starting to see a
pullback to point of control. Now, they

6266
02:24:08,389 --> 02:24:08,399
pullback to point of control. Now, they
 

6267
02:24:08,399 --> 02:24:10,469
pullback to point of control. Now, they
can hold.

6268
02:24:10,469 --> 02:24:10,479
can hold.
 

6269
02:24:10,479 --> 02:24:13,429
can hold.
Guess what they can do? Guess what they

6270
02:24:13,429 --> 02:24:13,439
Guess what they can do? Guess what they
 

6271
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:15,590
Guess what they can do? Guess what they
can do. All right, it's told you that's

6272
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:15,600
can do. All right, it's told you that's
 

6273
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:17,030
can do. All right, it's told you that's
what it likes to do. They can do this.

6274
02:24:17,030 --> 02:24:17,040
what it likes to do. They can do this.
 

6275
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,630
what it likes to do. They can do this.
They can also come down to here and find

6276
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:18,640
They can also come down to here and find
 

6277
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:20,790
They can also come down to here and find
a bid, but they can hold this now and

6278
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:20,800
a bid, but they can hold this now and
 

6279
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:22,710
a bid, but they can hold this now and
box in for a while and build out more

6280
02:24:22,710 --> 02:24:22,720
box in for a while and build out more
 

6281
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:25,670
box in for a while and build out more
liquidity. And if they do that, what are

6282
02:24:25,670 --> 02:24:25,680
liquidity. And if they do that, what are
 

6283
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:27,030
liquidity. And if they do that, what are
they building? They're building one of

6284
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:27,040
they building? They're building one of
 

6285
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:35,750
they building? They're building one of
these intraday. So just be smart.

6286
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:35,760

 

6287
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:39,110

You're welcome everyone.

6288
02:24:39,110 --> 02:24:39,120
You're welcome everyone.
 

6289
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:41,750
You're welcome everyone.
It's it's moving quick. So when you

6290
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:41,760
It's it's moving quick. So when you
 

6291
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:44,230
It's it's moving quick. So when you
catch it when you catch a squeeze, you

6292
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:44,240
catch it when you catch a squeeze, you
 

6293
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,950
catch it when you catch a squeeze, you
know, if you took uh who is it? Sorry,

6294
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:46,960
know, if you took uh who is it? Sorry,
 

6295
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:48,870
know, if you took uh who is it? Sorry,
Dex. Dex took the look below and fail.

6296
02:24:48,870 --> 02:24:48,880
Dex. Dex took the look below and fail.
 

6297
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:50,230
Dex. Dex took the look below and fail.
So he would have got in somewhere around

6298
02:24:50,230 --> 02:24:50,240
So he would have got in somewhere around
 

6299
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:51,990
So he would have got in somewhere around
here. I'd assume there's Keep it simple.

6300
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:52,000
here. I'd assume there's Keep it simple.
 

6301
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,270
here. I'd assume there's Keep it simple.
Trend line break. Whatever you want to

6306
02:24:58,230 --> 02:24:58,240
previous day low. Even if you took
 

6307
02:24:58,240 --> 02:24:59,910
previous day low. Even if you took
previous day value area low, reclaim.

6308

All right. Look how quickly it went.

6310
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:01,120
All right. Look how quickly it went.
 

6311
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:03,510
All right. Look how quickly it went.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

6312
02:25:03,510 --> 02:25:03,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
 

6313
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:07,270
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Seven minutes straight up. Straight up.

6314
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,280
Seven minutes straight up. Straight up.
 

6315
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:08,790
Seven minutes straight up. Straight up.
I was I was thinking this was going to

6316
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:08,800
I was I was thinking this was going to
 

6317
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:11,030
I was I was thinking this was going to
come down, stop me out, and then repick

6318
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:11,040
come down, stop me out, and then repick
 

6319
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:12,550
come down, stop me out, and then repick
me up because I had a limit sitting here

6320
02:25:12,550 --> 02:25:12,560
me up because I had a limit sitting here
 

6321
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:16,469
me up because I had a limit sitting here
for it, but it it didn't. So be it. It

6322
02:25:16,469 --> 02:25:16,479
for it, but it it didn't. So be it. It
 

6323
02:25:16,479 --> 02:25:18,630
for it, but it it didn't. So be it. It
is what it is.

6324
02:25:18,630 --> 02:25:18,640
is what it is.
 

6325
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:20,790
is what it is.
Yeah, Bulls have taken control. Uh,

6326
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:20,800
Yeah, Bulls have taken control. Uh,
 

6327
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:22,790
Yeah, Bulls have taken control. Uh,
you've got 25 minutes left. Bulls have

6328

6481
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:36,230
right? So, be smart. your locations when
we're in rotation are so important. So I

6482
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:36,240
we're in rotation are so important. So I
 

6483
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:38,230
we're in rotation are so important. So I
say to newer traders like trending

6484
02:28:38,230 --> 02:28:38,240
say to newer traders like trending
 

6485
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:39,990
say to newer traders like trending
markets when we get days which are

6486
02:28:39,990 --> 02:28:40,000
markets when we get days which are
 

6487
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,910
markets when we get days which are
trending when we're breaking out of a

6488
02:28:41,910 --> 02:28:41,920
trending when we're breaking out of a
 

6489
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:44,389
trending when we're breaking out of a
range they're easier to trade because if

6490
02:28:44,389 --> 02:28:44,399
range they're easier to trade because if
 

6491
02:28:44,399 --> 02:28:46,710
range they're easier to trade because if
you buy the pullback is way more likely

6492
02:28:46,710 --> 02:28:46,720
you buy the pullback is way more likely
 

6493
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:49,750
you buy the pullback is way more likely
to be nice for you. If you buy late

6494
02:28:49,750 --> 02:28:49,760
to be nice for you. If you buy late
 

6495
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:51,110
to be nice for you. If you buy late
because you're a newer trader and you

6496
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:51,120
because you're a newer trader and you
 

6497
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:52,710
because you're a newer trader and you
miss it. It's still more likely to be

6498
02:28:52,710 --> 02:28:52,720
miss it. It's still more likely to be
 

6499
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:54,150
miss it. It's still more likely to be
nice to you if you're trading in the

6500
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:54,160
nice to you if you're trading in the
 

6501
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:55,830
nice to you if you're trading in the
direction of the trade. If you are late

6502
02:28:55,830 --> 02:28:55,840
direction of the trade. If you are late
 

6503
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:58,389
direction of the trade. If you are late
on a ranging market it will hurt you. If

6504
02:28:58,389 --> 02:28:58,399
on a ranging market it will hurt you. If
 

6505
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:00,870
on a ranging market it will hurt you. If
you were late and took short here it

6506
02:29:00,870 --> 02:29:00,880
you were late and took short here it
 

6507
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:02,389
you were late and took short here it
will hurt you. If you're late and get

6508
02:29:02,389 --> 02:29:02,399
will hurt you. If you're late and get
 

6509
02:29:02,399 --> 02:29:04,150
will hurt you. If you're late and get
long here, there's a good chance it will

6510
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:04,160
long here, there's a good chance it will
 

6511
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:05,990
long here, there's a good chance it will
hurt you. If you were late and got long

6512
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:06,000
hurt you. If you were late and got long
 

6513
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,790
hurt you. If you were late and got long
here, you got hurt. Same in here. Short

6514
02:29:08,790 --> 02:29:08,800
here, you got hurt. Same in here. Short
 

6515
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:10,710

6517
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:12,550
here, hurt. Long there, hurt. Short

6518
02:29:12,550 --> 02:29:12,560
there, hurt. Long there, hurt. Right?

Because they don't understand. You trade

6592
02:31:05,030 --> 02:31:05,040

 

6593
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:06,950

150 is here. Oh my god, these shorts are

6594
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:06,960
150 is here. Oh my god, these shorts are
 

6595
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:28,550
150 is here. Oh my god, these shorts are
absolutely cooked.

6596
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:28,560

 

6597
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:32,870

How long we got left? 20 minutes.

How long we got left? 20 minutes.
 

6599
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:35,270
How long we got left? 20 minutes.
20 minutes. This thing's flying. This is

6600
02:31:35,270 --> 02:31:35,280
20 minutes. This thing's flying. This is
 

6601
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:45,590
20 minutes. This thing's flying. This is
just another giant short squeeze.

6602
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:45,600

 

6603
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:48,469

looking for buy. Uh, you're very late.

6604
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:48,479
looking for buy. Uh, you're very late.
 

6605
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:50,230
looking for buy. Uh, you're very late.
You don't want to be buying up here.

6606
02:31:50,230 --> 02:31:50,240
You don't want to be buying up here.
 

6607
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:51,429
You don't want to be buying up here.
Like we talked about, you're in the

6608
02:31:51,429 --> 02:31:51,439
Like we talked about, you're in the
 

6609
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:52,950
Like we talked about, you're in the
middle of the chop range now from

6610
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:52,960
middle of the chop range now from
 

6611
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:55,429
middle of the chop range now from
earlier. Look left. You can see the

6612
02:31:55,429 --> 02:31:55,439
earlier. Look left. You can see the
 

6613
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:58,309
earlier. Look left. You can see the
rotations from earlier. The buy was down

6614
02:31:58,309 --> 02:31:58,319
rotations from earlier. The buy was down
 

6615
02:31:58,319 --> 02:32:02,309
rotations from earlier. The buy was down
here on the reclaim of this, right? This

6616
02:32:02,309 --> 02:32:02,319
here on the reclaim of this, right? This
 

6617
02:32:02,319 --> 02:32:04,870
here on the reclaim of this, right? This
was your look below, look below value,

6618
02:32:04,870 --> 02:32:04,880
was your look below, look below value,
 

6619
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:07,670
was your look below, look below value,
came back upside. That was the buy.

6620
02:32:07,670 --> 02:32:07,680
came back upside. That was the buy.
 

6621
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,990
came back upside. That was the buy.
Maybe if you're want to trade range, you

6622
02:32:09,990 --> 02:32:10,000
Maybe if you're want to trade range, you
 

6623
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,070
Maybe if you're want to trade range, you
can think about a buy to here or to this

6624
02:32:12,070 --> 02:32:12,080
can think about a buy to here or to this
 

6625
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:14,070
can think about a buy to here or to this
shelf.

6626
02:32:14,070 --> 02:32:14,080
shelf.
 

6627
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:16,630
shelf.
I would argue it could do something like

6628
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:16,640
I would argue it could do something like
 

6629
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,630
I would argue it could do something like
this if it really wanted. So, I don't

6630
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:18,640
this if it really wanted. So, I don't
 

6631
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:19,590
this if it really wanted. So, I don't
know how you're going to manage your

6632
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:19,600
know how you're going to manage your
 

6633
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:21,429
know how you're going to manage your
risk on that, but yeah, you definitely

02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:48,790
07 and one closed in like 1980 or 1979,

02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:38,309
when I was 25
or 26. 26.

6942
02:39:38,309 --> 02:39:38,319
or 26. 26.
 

6943
02:39:38,319 --> 02:39:43,830
or 26. 26.
I was 26. 26 or 27. Um, I got screwed to

6944
02:39:43,830 --> 02:39:43,840
I was 26. 26 or 27. Um, I got screwed to
 

6945
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:45,429
I was 26. 26 or 27. Um, I got screwed to
be honest. I was self-employed working

6946
02:39:45,429 --> 02:39:45,439
be honest. I was self-employed working
 

6947
02:39:45,439 --> 02:39:49,990
be honest. I was self-employed working
as a um DJ and a music producer. So, I

6948
02:39:49,990 --> 02:39:50,000
as a um DJ and a music producer. So, I
 

6949
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,429
as a um DJ and a music producer. So, I
got a horrible interest rate for the

6950
02:39:51,429 --> 02:39:51,439
got a horrible interest rate for the
 

6951
02:39:51,439 --> 02:39:53,270
got a horrible interest rate for the
first year because they wouldn't I

6952
02:39:53,270 --> 02:39:53,280
first year because they wouldn't I
 

6953
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:56,469
first year because they wouldn't I
couldn't get an interest rate elsewhere.

6954
02:39:56,469 --> 02:39:56,479
couldn't get an interest rate elsewhere.
 

6955
02:39:56,479 --> 02:39:58,870
couldn't get an interest rate elsewhere.
I I put a good chunk down, put like 30%

6956
02:39:58,870 --> 02:39:58,880
I I put a good chunk down, put like 30%
 

6957
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:00,950
I I put a good chunk down, put like 30%
down, saved up. Me and my wife lived in

6958
02:40:00,950 --> 02:40:00,960
down, saved up. Me and my wife lived in
 

6959
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:03,670
down, saved up. Me and my wife lived in
a tiny little flat in Stratford, ate

6960
02:40:03,670 --> 02:40:03,680
a tiny little flat in Stratford, ate
 

6961
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:05,910
a tiny little flat in Stratford, ate
literally noodles for a year and saved

6962
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:05,920
literally noodles for a year and saved
 

6963
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:08,230
literally noodles for a year and saved
up um to because I knew we got to get in

6964
02:40:08,230 --> 02:40:08,240
up um to because I knew we got to get in
 

6965
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:09,270
up um to because I knew we got to get in
the market now because it's only going

6966
02:40:09,270 --> 02:40:09,280
the market now because it's only going
 

6967
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:11,190
the market now because it's only going
to get harder and we've been fortunate

6968
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:11,200
to get harder and we've been fortunate
 

6969
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:14,790
to get harder and we've been fortunate
enough to be able to um you know, pay it

6970
02:40:14,790 --> 02:40:14,800
enough to be able to um you know, pay it
 

6971
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:17,830
enough to be able to um you know, pay it
off. Um which we did when the interest

6972
02:40:17,830 --> 02:40:17,840
off. Um which we did when the interest
 

6973
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:21,110
off. Um which we did when the interest
rates got put up to 9%. our mortgage

6974
02:40:21,110 --> 02:40:21,120
rates got put up to 9%. our mortgage
 

6975
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:22,950
rates got put up to 9%. our mortgage
repayment jumped from like 600 600 700

6976
02:40:22,950 --> 02:40:22,960
repayment jumped from like 600 600 700
 

6977
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:26,710
repayment jumped from like 600 600 700
to like something outrageous like uh

6978
02:40:26,710 --> 02:40:26,720
to like something outrageous like uh
 

6979
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:30,230
to like something outrageous like uh
like 1,400 a month while we were living

6980
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:30,240
like 1,400 a month while we were living
 

6981
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:32,710
like 1,400 a month while we were living
in America paying uh bills here. And

6982
02:40:32,710 --> 02:40:32,720
in America paying uh bills here. And
 

6983
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:35,190
in America paying uh bills here. And
when I say 1,400 I mean sterling. So it

6984
02:40:35,190 --> 02:40:35,200
when I say 1,400 I mean sterling. So it
 

6985
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:37,750
when I say 1,400 I mean sterling. So it
was more like $2,200.

6986
02:40:37,750 --> 02:40:37,760
was more like $2,200.
 

6987
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:39,510
was more like $2,200.
So we paid it off as quickly as we can

6988
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:39,520
So we paid it off as quickly as we can
 

6989
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:42,150
So we paid it off as quickly as we can
but it's got to be tough. It's it's very

6990
02:40:42,150 --> 02:40:42,160
but it's got to be tough. It's it's very
 

6991
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:47,990
but it's got to be tough. It's it's very
tough out there.

6992
02:40:47,990 --> 02:40:48,000

 

6993
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,429

Okay. Okay, so here's your previous week

6994
02:40:49,429 --> 02:40:49,439
Okay. Okay, so here's your previous week
 

6995
02:40:49,439 --> 02:40:50,950
Okay. Okay, so here's your previous week
value area low. You're still you still

6996
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:50,960
value area low. You're still you still
 

6997
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:52,309
value area low. You're still you still
look good. I don't like how they've

6998
02:40:52,309 --> 02:40:52,319
look good. I don't like how they've
 

6999
02:40:52,319 --> 02:40:53,590
look good. I don't like how they've
built this structure. But if you're long

7000
02:40:53,590 --> 02:40:53,600
built this structure. But if you're long
 

7001
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:55,429
built this structure. But if you're long
from the lows, it's good. At some point,

7002
02:40:55,429 --> 02:40:55,439
from the lows, it's good. At some point,
 

7003
02:40:55,439 --> 02:40:57,030
from the lows, it's good. At some point,
we're likely to do this move here

7004
02:40:57,030 --> 02:40:57,040
we're likely to do this move here
 

7005
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:58,550
we're likely to do this move here
because we built this structure out in a

7006
02:40:58,550 --> 02:40:58,560
because we built this structure out in a
 

7007
02:40:58,560 --> 02:41:00,230
because we built this structure out in a
horrible fashion. But if they come all

7008
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:00,240
horrible fashion. But if they come all
 

7009
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:02,309
horrible fashion. But if they come all
the way up here, then you guys have the

7010
02:41:02,309 --> 02:41:02,319
the way up here, then you guys have the
 

7011
02:41:02,319 --> 02:41:04,230
the way up here, then you guys have the
best trade of the day. Other than that

7012
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:04,240
best trade of the day. Other than that
 

7013
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:06,389
best trade of the day. Other than that
open one. If you took that and this and

7014
02:41:06,389 --> 02:41:06,399
open one. If you took that and this and
 

7015
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:08,070
open one. If you took that and this and
it goes all the way up, it's the best

7016
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:08,080
it goes all the way up, it's the best
 

7017
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:10,150
it goes all the way up, it's the best
trade of the day. I'd say this is even

7018
02:41:10,150 --> 02:41:10,160
trade of the day. I'd say this is even
 

7019
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:12,070
trade of the day. I'd say this is even
better. That's a fantastic trade. But

7020
02:41:12,070 --> 02:41:12,080
better. That's a fantastic trade. But
 

7021
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:14,070
better. That's a fantastic trade. But
just be careful. I would not be long

7022
02:41:14,070 --> 02:41:14,080
just be careful. I would not be long
 

7023
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,349
just be careful. I would not be long
here. The way they've built this, this

7024
02:41:15,349 --> 02:41:15,359
here. The way they've built this, this
 

7025
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:17,030
here. The way they've built this, this
is very dangerous. No one's been swept

7026
02:41:17,030 --> 02:41:17,040
is very dangerous. No one's been swept
 

7027
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:18,550
is very dangerous. No one's been swept
out. They can come right back down to

7028
02:41:18,550 --> 02:41:18,560
out. They can come right back down to
 

7029
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:19,990
out. They can come right back down to
this after taking these highs. They can

7030
02:41:19,990 --> 02:41:20,000
this after taking these highs. They can
 

7031
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:21,349
this after taking these highs. They can
come right back down before they go

7032
02:41:21,349 --> 02:41:21,359
come right back down before they go
 

7033
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:22,790
come right back down before they go
higher. They can come back down here,

7034
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:22,800
higher. They can come back down here,
 

7035
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:24,550
higher. They can come back down here,
get trapped and go lower. I don't want

7036
02:41:24,550 --> 02:41:24,560
get trapped and go lower. I don't want
 

7037
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:25,990
get trapped and go lower. I don't want
to trade in this range. For me

7038
02:41:25,990 --> 02:41:26,000
to trade in this range. For me
 

7039
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,830
to trade in this range. For me
personally, I maintain that here and I

7040
02:41:27,830 --> 02:41:27,840
personally, I maintain that here and I
 

7041
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:29,670
personally, I maintain that here and I
maintain it here. This is a dangerous

7042
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:29,680
maintain it here. This is a dangerous
 

7043
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:31,429
maintain it here. This is a dangerous
spot to be caught in. But if you are

7044
02:41:31,429 --> 02:41:31,439
spot to be caught in. But if you are
 

7045
02:41:31,439 --> 02:41:33,510
spot to be caught in. But if you are
long off those lows, you look really

7046
02:41:33,510 --> 02:41:33,520
long off those lows, you look really
 

7047
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:34,870
long off those lows, you look really
good. You can just keep holding your

7048
02:41:34,870 --> 02:41:34,880
good. You can just keep holding your
 

7049
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:46,870
good. You can just keep holding your
runner. It looks really good.

7050
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:46,880

 

7051
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:49,349

7117
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:09,590

it would be rewarding you for bad
trading. These are the kind of areas you

02:43:41,030 --> 02:43:41,040
trading. These are the kind of areas you
 

7137
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:43,750
trading. These are the kind of areas you
don't want to trade in. We've just

7138
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:43,760
don't want to trade in. We've just
 

7139
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:45,429
don't want to trade in. We've just
walked this whole thing up. We squeezed

7140
02:43:45,429 --> 02:43:45,439
walked this whole thing up. We squeezed
 

7141
02:43:45,439 --> 02:43:47,190
walked this whole thing up. We squeezed
and then we walked without washing

7142
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:47,200
and then we walked without washing
 

7143
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:50,230
and then we walked without washing
anyone out. You do not want to be a new

7144
02:43:50,230 --> 02:43:50,240
anyone out. You do not want to be a new
 

7145
02:43:50,240 --> 02:44:18,389
anyone out. You do not want to be a new
long at these highs.

7146
02:44:18,389 --> 02:44:18,399

 

7147
02:44:18,399 --> 02:44:21,349

Anyone that's emailed me, I'll um I'll

All right, Vic still coming down side.

7158
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:30,880
All right, Vic still coming down side.
 

7159
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:32,710
All right, Vic still coming down side.
You still look good to hold on. Like I

7160
02:44:32,710 --> 02:44:32,720
You still look good to hold on. Like I
 

7161
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:34,309
You still look good to hold on. Like I
said, I wouldn't be a new money long

7162
02:44:34,309 --> 02:44:34,319
said, I wouldn't be a new money long
 

7163
02:44:34,319 --> 02:44:35,910
said, I wouldn't be a new money long
here, but if you are already long, you

7164
02:44:35,910 --> 02:44:35,920
here, but if you are already long, you
 

7165
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:41,830
here, but if you are already long, you
look good to try and hold.

7166
02:44:41,830 --> 02:44:41,840

 

7167
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:43,990

Yeah, can it can keep going. Um, the

7168
02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:44,000
Yeah, can it can keep going. Um, the
 

7169
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,950
Yeah, can it can keep going. Um, the
only thing I'd say is like

7170
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:46,960
only thing I'd say is like
 

7171
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:49,830
only thing I'd say is like
when you see these, right, no one's been

7172
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:49,840
when you see these, right, no one's been
 

7173
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:52,550
when you see these, right, no one's been
stopped out, right? So, anyone who's

7174
02:44:52,550 --> 02:44:52,560
stopped out, right? So, anyone who's
 

7175
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:54,870
stopped out, right? So, anyone who's
chased has so far been rewarded.

7176
02:44:54,870 --> 02:44:54,880
chased has so far been rewarded.
 

7177
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:56,389
chased has so far been rewarded.
Remember the long entry was down here.

7178
02:44:56,389 --> 02:44:56,399
Remember the long entry was down here.
 

7179
02:44:56,399 --> 02:44:59,590
Remember the long entry was down here.
They've been rewarded in this pocket. It

7180
02:44:59,590 --> 02:44:59,600
They've been rewarded in this pocket. It
 

7181
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:01,429
They've been rewarded in this pocket. It
would not it doesn't have to do it, but

7182
02:45:01,429 --> 02:45:01,439
would not it doesn't have to do it, but
 

7183
02:45:01,439 --> 02:45:03,269
would not it doesn't have to do it, but
it would not surprise me to see this

7184
02:45:03,269 --> 02:45:03,279
it would not surprise me to see this
 

7185
02:45:03,279 --> 02:45:05,030
it would not surprise me to see this
snap everyone out or at least half of

7186
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:05,040
snap everyone out or at least half of
 

7187
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:07,429
snap everyone out or at least half of
them out into some of this, right? If he

7188
02:45:07,429 --> 02:45:07,439
them out into some of this, right? If he
 

7189
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:08,950
them out into some of this, right? If he
doesn't protect this straight down into

7190
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:08,960
doesn't protect this straight down into
 

7191
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:10,469
doesn't protect this straight down into
here before bidding back up, which is

7192
02:45:10,469 --> 02:45:10,479
here before bidding back up, which is
 

7193
02:45:10,479 --> 02:45:11,830
here before bidding back up, which is
why you don't want to enter the long up

7194
02:45:11,830 --> 02:45:11,840
why you don't want to enter the long up
 

7195
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:14,230
why you don't want to enter the long up
here. Think about how fast this move the

7196
02:45:14,230 --> 02:45:14,240
here. Think about how fast this move the
 

7197
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:15,910
here. Think about how fast this move the
moment, look at the look at what happens

7198
02:45:15,910 --> 02:45:15,920
moment, look at the look at what happens
 

7199
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:18,550
moment, look at the look at what happens
the moment people realize, oh, we're not

7200
02:45:18,550 --> 02:45:18,560
the moment people realize, oh, we're not
 

7201
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:20,070
the moment people realize, oh, we're not
trending lower. I said it can trend

7202
02:45:20,070 --> 02:45:20,080
trending lower. I said it can trend
 

7203
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:22,550
trending lower. I said it can trend
lower versus this. This is the key how

7204
02:45:22,550 --> 02:45:22,560
lower versus this. This is the key how
 

7205
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:24,950
lower versus this. This is the key how
we operate in here. The moment bears

7206
02:45:24,950 --> 02:45:24,960
we operate in here. The moment bears
 

7207
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:26,790
we operate in here. The moment bears
lose this battle. Look at the size of

7208
02:45:26,790 --> 02:45:26,800
lose this battle. Look at the size of
 

7209
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:28,469
lose this battle. Look at the size of
these candles.

7210
02:45:28,469 --> 02:45:28,479
these candles.
 

7211
02:45:28,479 --> 02:45:29,990
these candles.
All right, no look back. That's the

7212
02:45:29,990 --> 02:45:30,000
All right, no look back. That's the
 

7213
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:33,110
All right, no look back. That's the
squeeze. There's the rebid.

7214
02:45:33,110 --> 02:45:33,120
squeeze. There's the rebid.
 

7215
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:34,790
squeeze. There's the rebid.
And that's a grind up. This can come

7216
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:34,800
And that's a grind up. This can come
 

7217
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:36,469
And that's a grind up. This can come
right back down to here if it wants to,

7218
02:45:36,469 --> 02:45:36,479
right back down to here if it wants to,
 

7219
02:45:36,479 --> 02:45:37,590
right back down to here if it wants to,
right? And you're starting to see this

7220
02:45:37,590 --> 02:45:37,600
right? And you're starting to see this
 

7221
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:39,030
right? And you're starting to see this
now. It's going to start washing out

7222
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:39,040
now. It's going to start washing out
 

7223
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:41,429
now. It's going to start washing out
probably the late longs. We are building

7224
02:45:41,429 --> 02:45:41,439
probably the late longs. We are building
 

7225
02:45:41,439 --> 02:45:42,950
probably the late longs. We are building
volume here, but it would not surprise

7226
02:45:42,950 --> 02:45:42,960
volume here, but it would not surprise
 

7227
02:45:42,960 --> 02:45:44,389
volume here, but it would not surprise
me to see this come down to here before

7228
02:45:44,389 --> 02:45:44,399
me to see this come down to here before
 

7229
02:45:44,399 --> 02:45:45,830
me to see this come down to here before
it finds a bid because this has been

7230
02:45:45,830 --> 02:45:45,840
it finds a bid because this has been
 

7231
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:49,590
it finds a bid because this has been
very, very aggressive.

7232
02:45:49,590 --> 02:45:49,600

 

7233
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:51,190

All you have to do, remember, all you're

7234
02:45:51,190 --> 02:45:51,200
All you have to do, remember, all you're
 

7235
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:53,990
All you have to do, remember, all you're
doing is in trading really to make it

7236
02:45:53,990 --> 02:45:54,000
doing is in trading really to make it
 

7237
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,389
doing is in trading really to make it
really simple, is trying to identify a

7238
02:45:56,389 --> 02:45:56,399
really simple, is trying to identify a
 

7239
02:45:56,399 --> 02:46:00,389
really simple, is trying to identify a
good location to enter into trade in and

7240
02:46:00,389 --> 02:46:00,399
good location to enter into trade in and
 

7241
02:46:00,399 --> 02:46:01,510
good location to enter into trade in and
waiting for it to come into that

7242
02:46:01,510 --> 02:46:01,520
waiting for it to come into that
 

7243
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:03,910
waiting for it to come into that
location and then watching how we

7244
02:46:03,910 --> 02:46:03,920
location and then watching how we
 

7245
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:05,830
location and then watching how we
operate in that location. Does it give

7246
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:05,840
operate in that location. Does it give
 

7247
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:08,870
operate in that location. Does it give
you a hint that you're right? Does it

7248
02:46:08,870 --> 02:46:08,880
you a hint that you're right? Does it
 

7249
02:46:08,880 --> 02:46:10,469
you a hint that you're right? Does it
give you that idea of like, yeah, we're

7250
02:46:10,469 --> 02:46:10,479
give you that idea of like, yeah, we're
 

7251
02:46:10,479 --> 02:46:12,950
give you that idea of like, yeah, we're
going to go higher, get involved. Yeah,

7252
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:12,960
going to go higher, get involved. Yeah,
 

7253
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:14,790
going to go higher, get involved. Yeah,
we've caught buyers offside. We're going

7254
02:46:14,790 --> 02:46:14,800
we've caught buyers offside. We're going
 

7255
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:17,670
we've caught buyers offside. We're going
to go lower. Get involved. and trying to

7256
02:46:17,670 --> 02:46:17,680
to go lower. Get involved. and trying to
 

7257
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:20,550
to go lower. Get involved. and trying to
leave it alone when you're not in a

7258
02:46:20,550 --> 02:46:20,560
leave it alone when you're not in a
 

7259
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:23,590
leave it alone when you're not in a
location of interest. And currently, you

7260
02:46:23,590 --> 02:46:23,600
location of interest. And currently, you
 

7261
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:25,590
location of interest. And currently, you
could argue, right, you can absolutely

7262
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:25,600
could argue, right, you can absolutely
 

7263
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:27,110
could argue, right, you can absolutely
argue that they are holding the top of

7264
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:27,120
argue that they are holding the top of
 

7265
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:29,190
argue that they are holding the top of
this shelf. But you got to ask yourself

7266
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:29,200
this shelf. But you got to ask yourself
 

7267
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:30,950
this shelf. But you got to ask yourself
if the best buying location, well,

7268
02:46:30,950 --> 02:46:30,960
if the best buying location, well,
 

7269
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:32,389
if the best buying location, well,
technically was here, but I would say

7270
02:46:32,389 --> 02:46:32,399
technically was here, but I would say
 

7271
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:35,349
technically was here, but I would say
here is when we confirm. And then maybe

7272
02:46:35,349 --> 02:46:35,359
here is when we confirm. And then maybe
 

7273
02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:37,910
here is when we confirm. And then maybe
here if you're really [\h__\h] brave

7274
02:46:37,910 --> 02:46:37,920
here if you're really [\h__\h] brave
 

7275
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:39,670
here if you're really [\h__\h] brave
because you're not, you know, I don't

7276
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:39,680
because you're not, you know, I don't
 

7277
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:41,269
because you're not, you know, I don't
know where you have your stop there, but

7278
02:46:41,269 --> 02:46:41,279
know where you have your stop there, but
 

7279
02:46:41,279 --> 02:46:43,750
know where you have your stop there, but
maybe you bid P,

7280
02:46:43,750 --> 02:46:43,760
maybe you bid P,
 

7281
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:45,590
maybe you bid P,
but here is not the best buying

7282
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:45,600
but here is not the best buying
 

7283
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,590
but here is not the best buying
location. In fact, it's the second worst

7284
02:46:47,590 --> 02:46:47,600
location. In fact, it's the second worst
 

7285
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,510
location. In fact, it's the second worst
buying location of the day after here

7286
02:46:49,510 --> 02:46:49,520
buying location of the day after here
 

7287
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:51,750
buying location of the day after here
where all the buyers got stuck earlier.

7288
02:46:51,750 --> 02:46:51,760
where all the buyers got stuck earlier.
 

7289
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:53,670
where all the buyers got stuck earlier.
So, even if you buy this and it goes

7290
02:46:53,670 --> 02:46:53,680
So, even if you buy this and it goes
 

7291
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:57,110
So, even if you buy this and it goes
higher, right? You're not being rewarded

7292
02:46:57,110 --> 02:46:57,120
higher, right? You're not being rewarded
 

7293
02:46:57,120 --> 02:46:58,870
higher, right? You're not being rewarded
for necessarily buying in a good

7294
02:46:58,870 --> 02:46:58,880
for necessarily buying in a good
 

7295
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:01,030
for necessarily buying in a good
location. And okay, you can argue, like

7296
02:47:01,030 --> 02:47:01,040
location. And okay, you can argue, like
 

7297
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:02,309
location. And okay, you can argue, like
I said, that there's a bit of a shelf

7298
02:47:02,309 --> 02:47:02,319
I said, that there's a bit of a shelf
 

7299
02:47:02,319 --> 02:47:03,910
I said, that there's a bit of a shelf
here, but I would argue this is a

7300
02:47:03,910 --> 02:47:03,920
here, but I would argue this is a
 

7301
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:06,870
here, but I would argue this is a
subprime buying location.

7302
02:47:06,870 --> 02:47:06,880
subprime buying location.
 

7303
02:47:06,880 --> 02:47:09,030
subprime buying location.
I would much rather be long down here

7304
02:47:09,030 --> 02:47:09,040
I would much rather be long down here
 

7305
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:11,830
I would much rather be long down here
for that rotation, and I'd much rather

7306
02:47:11,830 --> 02:47:11,840
for that rotation, and I'd much rather
 

7307
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:15,590
for that rotation, and I'd much rather
be short like here or that rotation. And

7308
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:15,600
be short like here or that rotation. And
 

7309
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:17,990
be short like here or that rotation. And
I'd much rather leave this alone for me

7310
02:47:17,990 --> 02:47:18,000
I'd much rather leave this alone for me
 

7311
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,510
I'd much rather leave this alone for me
personally. Maybe you guys like playing

7312
02:47:19,510 --> 02:47:19,520
personally. Maybe you guys like playing
 

7313
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:22,469
personally. Maybe you guys like playing
these and by all means, I'm not trying

7314
02:47:22,469 --> 02:47:22,479
these and by all means, I'm not trying
 

7315
02:47:22,479 --> 02:47:23,830
these and by all means, I'm not trying
to put you off. I'm trying to make you

7316
02:47:23,830 --> 02:47:23,840
to put you off. I'm trying to make you
 

7317
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:25,590
to put you off. I'm trying to make you
understand like especially in a

7318
02:47:25,590 --> 02:47:25,600
understand like especially in a
 

7319
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:27,429
understand like especially in a
rotational market, how important the

7320
02:47:27,429 --> 02:47:27,439
rotational market, how important the
 

7321
02:47:27,439 --> 02:47:37,670
rotational market, how important the
location is.

7322
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:37,680

 

7323
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:40,389

Oh my god.

7324
02:47:40,389 --> 02:47:40,399
Oh my god.
 

7325
02:47:40,399 --> 02:47:42,870
Oh my god.
I had to record something I saw someone

7326
02:47:42,870 --> 02:47:42,880
I had to record something I saw someone
 

7327
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:45,590
I had to record something I saw someone
post. This is what he said. I'm gonna

post. This is what he said. I'm gonna
play this in the mic and see if you can

7330
02:47:46,950 --> 02:47:46,960
play this in the mic and see if you can
 

7331
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:50,389
play this in the mic and see if you can
hear it. I have never heard.

Watch my language. I've never heard
 

7335

Watch my language. I've never heard
someone so wrong and lie so much.

02:47:54,790 --> 02:47:54,800
someone so wrong and lie so much.
 

7337
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:56,710
someone so wrong and lie so much.
Hopefully you can hear this. There's no

their pain to trade the opposite way to

trading is, right? We're using people's
 

7477
02:51:19,279 --> 02:51:22,070
trading is, right? We're using people's
pain to get to the next destination. And

7478
02:51:22,070 --> 02:51:22,080
pain to get to the next destination. And
 

7479
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:24,950
pain to get to the next destination. And
all we're doing ever is moving from a

7481
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:27,190
all we're doing ever is moving from a
place of fair value to a place of

02:51:27,190 --> 02:51:27,200
place of fair value to a place of
 

7483
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,349
place of fair value to a place of
imbalance to look for va value. It's the

7484
02:51:29,349 --> 02:51:29,359
imbalance to look for va value. It's the
 

7485
02:51:29,359 --> 02:51:32,070
imbalance to look for va value. It's the
same same lesson as I talk about when

7486
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:32,080
same same lesson as I talk about when

02:52:42,070 --> 02:52:42,080
take our profits into 30K. Okay. So,
 

7547
02:52:42,080 --> 02:52:43,910
take our profits into 30K. Okay. So,
this was where the last buyer existed.

7548
02:52:43,910 --> 02:52:43,920
this was where the last buyer existed.
 

7549
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:46,230
this was where the last buyer existed.
The last buyer bought at 30K up here.

7550
02:52:46,230 --> 02:52:46,240
The last buyer bought at 30K up here.
 

7551
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:48,389
The last buyer bought at 30K up here.
Then we went down into the middle and we

7552
02:52:48,389 --> 02:52:48,399
Then we went down into the middle and we
 

7553
02:52:48,399 --> 02:52:52,870
Then we went down into the middle and we
found fair value in here because buyers,

7554
02:52:52,870 --> 02:52:52,880
found fair value in here because buyers,
 

7555
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:56,070
found fair value in here because buyers,
right, buyers and sellers both agreed

7556
02:52:56,070 --> 02:52:56,080
right, buyers and sellers both agreed
 

7557
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:58,550
right, buyers and sellers both agreed
that this was a fair price for a while.

7558
02:52:58,550 --> 02:52:58,560
that this was a fair price for a while.
 

7559
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:00,150
that this was a fair price for a while.
All right, for this period of time here

7560
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:00,160
All right, for this period of time here
 

7561
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:03,510
All right, for this period of time here
about an hour and that's noted by the

7562
02:53:03,510 --> 02:53:03,520
about an hour and that's noted by the
 

7563
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:05,590
about an hour and that's noted by the
point of control. All right, and by the

7564
02:53:05,590 --> 02:53:05,600
point of control. All right, and by the
 

7565
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:07,590
point of control. All right, and by the
range rotation. Now, something changed

7566
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:07,600
range rotation. Now, something changed
 

7567
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:10,550
range rotation. Now, something changed
in the market right here. Right here,

7568
02:53:10,550 --> 02:53:10,560
in the market right here. Right here,
 

7569
02:53:10,560 --> 02:53:12,309
in the market right here. Right here,
something changed. It could be as simple

7570
02:53:12,309 --> 02:53:12,319
something changed. It could be as simple
 

7571
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:16,630
something changed. It could be as simple
as a new watch became available to sell

7572
02:53:16,630 --> 02:53:16,640
as a new watch became available to sell
 

7573
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:18,790
as a new watch became available to sell
or maybe an article came out saying,

7574
02:53:18,790 --> 02:53:18,800
or maybe an article came out saying,
 

7575
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:21,110
or maybe an article came out saying,
"Hey, the Rolex Dainer is not very good

7576
02:53:21,110 --> 02:53:21,120
"Hey, the Rolex Dainer is not very good
 

7577
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:22,950
"Hey, the Rolex Dainer is not very good
and these are the these are the reasons

7578
02:53:22,950 --> 02:53:22,960
and these are the these are the reasons
 

7579
02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:25,750
and these are the these are the reasons
why." All right, whatever happened at

7580
02:53:25,750 --> 02:53:25,760
why." All right, whatever happened at
 

7581
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:27,990
why." All right, whatever happened at
this point here, people were like, "Oh

7582
02:53:27,990 --> 02:53:28,000
this point here, people were like, "Oh
 

7583
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:29,510
this point here, people were like, "Oh
my god, I don't want to own this

7584
02:53:29,510 --> 02:53:29,520
my god, I don't want to own this
 

7585
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:33,030
my god, I don't want to own this
anymore. Sell this now." Well, so they

7586
02:53:33,030 --> 02:53:33,040
anymore. Sell this now." Well, so they
 

7587
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:35,110
anymore. Sell this now." Well, so they
sold it and we get more supply on the

7588
02:53:35,110 --> 02:53:35,120
sold it and we get more supply on the
 

7589
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:36,790
sold it and we get more supply on the
market and a lack of demand. So, we move

7590
02:53:36,790 --> 02:53:36,800
market and a lack of demand. So, we move
 

7591
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:40,309
market and a lack of demand. So, we move
from balance to imbalance and we find

7592
02:53:40,309 --> 02:53:40,319
from balance to imbalance and we find
 

7593
02:53:40,319 --> 02:53:42,230
from balance to imbalance and we find
value again at the same level because

7594
02:53:42,230 --> 02:53:42,240
value again at the same level because
 

7595
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:45,510
value again at the same level because
there's still buyers hanging around down

7596
02:53:45,510 --> 02:53:45,520
there's still buyers hanging around down
 

7597
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:47,030
there's still buyers hanging around down
here who are willing to buy. And then

7598
02:53:47,030 --> 02:53:47,040
here who are willing to buy. And then
 

7599
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:49,510
here who are willing to buy. And then
guess what? We went back to balance and

7600
02:53:49,510 --> 02:53:49,520
guess what? We went back to balance and
 

7601
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:51,750
guess what? We went back to balance and
this time buyers were like, well, I

7602
02:53:51,750 --> 02:53:51,760
this time buyers were like, well, I
 

7603
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:53,269
this time buyers were like, well, I
missed buying here. I'm going to buy

7604
02:53:53,269 --> 02:53:53,279
missed buying here. I'm going to buy
 

7605
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:55,110
missed buying here. I'm going to buy
here this time. And we come back up to

7606
02:53:55,110 --> 02:53:55,120
here this time. And we come back up to
 

7607
02:53:55,120 --> 02:53:56,790
here this time. And we come back up to
here. And these buyers from here, if the

7608
02:53:56,790 --> 02:53:56,800
here. And these buyers from here, if the
 

7609
02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:58,230
here. And these buyers from here, if the
Rolex are now selling at, I don't know,

7610
02:53:58,230 --> 02:53:58,240
Rolex are now selling at, I don't know,
 

7611
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:00,550
Rolex are now selling at, I don't know,
let's call it 28,000. And you've got

some buyers who might want to buy

7614
02:54:02,790 --> 02:54:02,800
some buyers who might want to buy
 

7615
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:04,870
some buyers who might want to buy
28,000, but anyone who is sensible

7616
02:54:04,870 --> 02:54:04,880
28,000, but anyone who is sensible
 

7617
02:54:04,880 --> 02:54:06,950
28,000, but anyone who is sensible
bought 25,000 down the bottom. All

right? And that is all the market is

7620
02:54:09,910 --> 02:54:09,920
right? And that is all the market is
 

7621
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:12,469
right? And that is all the market is
doing. Take your algo, stick it up,

you close down your business or

7864
03:00:10,790 --> 03:00:10,800

 

7865
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:12,309

Anyway,

7866
03:00:12,309 --> 03:00:12,319
Anyway,
 

7867
03:00:12,319 --> 03:00:15,990
Anyway,
bankruptcy. There we go. Thank you. Um,

7868
03:00:15,990 --> 03:00:16,000
bankruptcy. There we go. Thank you. Um,
 

7869
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:17,990
bankruptcy. There we go. Thank you. Um,
lots of bankruptcies this year. We still

7870
03:00:17,990 --> 03:00:18,000
lots of bankruptcies this year. We still
 

7871
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,070
lots of bankruptcies this year. We still
got two months left. Lots of

7872
03:00:20,070 --> 03:00:20,080
got two months left. Lots of
 

7873
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:21,429
got two months left. Lots of
bankruptcies. And I think next year will

7874
03:00:21,429 --> 03:00:21,439
bankruptcies. And I think next year will
 

7875
03:00:21,439 --> 03:00:23,910
bankruptcies. And I think next year will
be worse. So, what does that mean? Well,

7876
03:00:23,910 --> 03:00:23,920
be worse. So, what does that mean? Well,
 

7877
03:00:23,920 --> 03:00:27,269
be worse. So, what does that mean? Well,
turn keys, turnkey companies. When you

7878
03:00:27,269 --> 03:00:27,279
turn keys, turnkey companies. When you
 

7879
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:29,910
turn keys, turnkey companies. When you
go bankrupt, what happens is your assets

7880
03:00:29,910 --> 03:00:29,920
go bankrupt, what happens is your assets
 

7881
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:33,110
go bankrupt, what happens is your assets
are taken by said bank, said company and

7882
03:00:33,110 --> 03:00:33,120
are taken by said bank, said company and
 

7883
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:36,469
are taken by said bank, said company and
they're sold off, all right, to in turn

7884
03:00:36,469 --> 03:00:36,479
they're sold off, all right, to in turn
 

7885
03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:39,510
they're sold off, all right, to in turn
keys. So let's say let's say I have a

7886
03:00:39,510 --> 03:00:39,520
keys. So let's say let's say I have a
 

7887
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:43,349
keys. So let's say let's say I have a
music studio and I go bankrupt, okay?

7888
03:00:43,349 --> 03:00:43,359
music studio and I go bankrupt, okay?
 

7889
03:00:43,359 --> 03:00:46,790
music studio and I go bankrupt, okay?
Then I declare bankruptcy, the bank will

7890
03:00:46,790 --> 03:00:46,800
Then I declare bankruptcy, the bank will
 

7891
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:48,630
Then I declare bankruptcy, the bank will
then take that music studio off me and

7892
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:48,640
then take that music studio off me and
 

7893
03:00:48,640 --> 03:00:51,269
then take that music studio off me and
they will sell the assets available in

7894
03:00:51,269 --> 03:00:51,279
they will sell the assets available in
 

7895
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:53,030
they will sell the assets available in
that music studio to claw back some of

7896
03:00:53,030 --> 03:00:53,040
that music studio to claw back some of
 

7897
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,110
that music studio to claw back some of
the money. So like my synthesizers, my

7898
03:00:55,110 --> 03:00:55,120
the money. So like my synthesizers, my
 

7899
03:00:55,120 --> 03:00:57,269
the money. So like my synthesizers, my
computers, my desk, etc. etc. You're

7900
03:00:57,269 --> 03:00:57,279
computers, my desk, etc. etc. You're
 

7901
03:00:57,279 --> 03:00:58,389
computers, my desk, etc. etc. You're
going to have that with lots of

7902
03:00:58,389 --> 03:00:58,399
going to have that with lots of
 

7903
03:00:58,399 --> 03:01:00,630
going to have that with lots of
companies going on, which means, as

7904
03:01:00,630 --> 03:01:00,640
companies going on, which means, as
 

7905
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:02,309
companies going on, which means, as
horrible as it sounds, and I know it's

7906
03:01:02,309 --> 03:01:02,319
horrible as it sounds, and I know it's
 

7907
03:01:02,319 --> 03:01:03,750
horrible as it sounds, and I know it's
awful, but this is how you get a

7908
03:01:03,750 --> 03:01:03,760
awful, but this is how you get a
 

7909
03:01:03,760 --> 03:01:05,750
awful, but this is how you get a
transfer of wealth if you are cash

7910
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:05,760
transfer of wealth if you are cash
 

7911
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:07,349
transfer of wealth if you are cash
positive and you're able to take

7912
03:01:07,349 --> 03:01:07,359
positive and you're able to take
 

7913
03:01:07,359 --> 03:01:08,950
positive and you're able to take
advantage

7914
03:01:08,950 --> 03:01:08,960
advantage
 

7915
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:12,469
advantage
of things like said Rolex when they're

7916
03:01:12,469 --> 03:01:12,479
of things like said Rolex when they're
 

7917
03:01:12,479 --> 03:01:15,110
of things like said Rolex when they're
on sale and hold for a few years. So, in

7918
03:01:15,110 --> 03:01:15,120
on sale and hold for a few years. So, in
 

7919
03:01:15,120 --> 03:01:18,309
on sale and hold for a few years. So, in
this case, it would be a company, right?

7920
03:01:18,309 --> 03:01:18,319
this case, it would be a company, right?
 

7921
03:01:18,319 --> 03:01:19,990
this case, it would be a company, right?

If we go into
one week,

still offer huge day trading
opportunities. Okay, and bare markets

8032

opportunities. Okay, and bare markets
 

8033
03:04:20,479 --> 03:04:22,630
opportunities. Okay, and bare markets
take time to develop. I'm just going to

8034
03:04:22,630 --> 03:04:22,640
take time to develop. I'm just going to
 

8035
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:23,910
take time to develop. I'm just going to
point this out to you. What does this

8036
03:04:23,910 --> 03:04:23,920
point this out to you. What does this

8039
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:46,150

Possible.

8040
03:04:46,150 --> 03:04:46,160

 

8041
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:47,990

Possible.

8042
03:04:47,990 --> 03:04:48,000
Possible.
 

8043
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,870
Possible.
This takes time to develop, right? And

8044
03:04:50,870 --> 03:04:50,880
This takes time to develop, right? And
 

8045
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:52,550
This takes time to develop, right? And
it's it's not too late to liquidate. It

8046
03:04:52,550 --> 03:04:52,560
it's it's not too late to liquidate. It
 

8047
03:04:52,560 --> 03:04:53,830
it's it's not too late to liquidate. It
gives you an opportunity to liquidate.

8048
03:04:53,830 --> 03:04:53,840
gives you an opportunity to liquidate.
 

8049
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:55,269
gives you an opportunity to liquidate.
This panic gives you an opportunity to

8050
03:04:55,269 --> 03:04:55,279
This panic gives you an opportunity to
 

8051
03:04:55,279 --> 03:04:57,269
This panic gives you an opportunity to
liquidate. It gives you an opportunity

8052
03:04:57,269 --> 03:04:57,279
liquidate. It gives you an opportunity
 

8053
03:04:57,279 --> 03:04:59,750
liquidate. It gives you an opportunity
to liquidate. That is the night night

8054
03:04:59,750 --> 03:04:59,760
to liquidate. That is the night night
 

8055
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:02,389
to liquidate. That is the night night
scenario, right? Before we start going

8056
03:05:02,389 --> 03:05:02,399
scenario, right? Before we start going
 

8057
03:05:02,399 --> 03:05:06,389
scenario, right? Before we start going
the other way, it takes a long time. So

8058
03:05:06,389 --> 03:05:06,399
the other way, it takes a long time. So
 

8059
03:05:06,399 --> 03:05:08,309
the other way, it takes a long time. So
the trading opportunity even in bare

8060
03:05:08,309 --> 03:05:08,319
the trading opportunity even in bare
 

8061
03:05:08,319 --> 03:05:21,269
the trading opportunity even in bare
markets is is amazing. for day trading

8062
03:05:21,269 --> 03:05:21,279

 

8063
03:05:21,279 --> 03:05:23,269

April 25.

03:05:23,269 --> 03:05:23,279
April 25.
 

8065
03:05:23,279 --> 03:05:38,389
April 25.
Not saying it has to happen.

8066
03:05:38,389 --> 03:05:38,399

 

8067
03:05:38,399 --> 03:05:40,710

Very similar. The structure being built

8068
03:05:40,710 --> 03:05:40,720
Very similar. The structure being built
 

8069
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:44,550
Very similar. The structure being built
out is not dissimilar at all. But hey,

8070
03:05:44,550 --> 03:05:44,560
out is not dissimilar at all. But hey,
 

8071
03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:46,630
out is not dissimilar at all. But hey,
we will see.

8072
03:05:46,630 --> 03:05:46,640
we will see.
 

8073
03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:47,990
we will see.
I'm not one of those guys that wants to

I'm not one of those guys that wants to
call a [\h__\h] huge short and all this

8077
03:05:52,240 --> 03:05:53,910
call a [\h__\h] huge short and all this
nonsense. We just trade what's in front

8078
03:05:53,910 --> 03:05:53,920
nonsense. We just trade what's in front
 

8079
03:05:53,920 --> 03:06:09,349
nonsense. We just trade what's in front
of us, right? That's all we have to do.

8080
03:06:09,349 --> 03:06:09,359

 

8081
03:06:09,359 --> 03:06:11,429

reason Jamie Diamond is worried about
 

8087
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:18,630
reason Jamie Diamond is worried about
the bonds and the treasuries

the bonds and the treasuries
 

8089

edge of it. you're at point of previous
 

8105
03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:38,950
edge of it. you're at point of previous
day point of control.

8106
03:06:38,950 --> 03:06:38,960

So rejected uh Asia low into 25200.

8108
03:06:42,710 --> 03:06:42,720
So rejected uh Asia low into 25200.
 

8109
03:06:42,720 --> 03:06:44,389
So rejected uh Asia low into 25200.
You're dancing back into the range. If

8110
03:06:44,389 --> 03:06:44,399
You're dancing back into the range. If
 

8111
03:06:44,399 --> 03:06:47,590
You're dancing back into the range. If
they build liquidity here,

8112
03:06:47,590 --> 03:06:47,600
they build liquidity here,
 

8113
03:06:47,600 --> 03:06:50,550
they build liquidity here,
if they are able to hold uh this edge in

8114
03:06:50,550 --> 03:06:50,560
if they are able to hold uh this edge in
 

8115
03:06:50,560 --> 03:06:52,070
if they are able to hold uh this edge in
here,

8116
03:06:52,070 --> 03:06:52,080
here,
 

8117
03:06:52,080 --> 03:06:54,309
here,
the 50s,

8118
03:06:54,309 --> 03:06:54,319
the 50s,
 

8119
03:06:54,319 --> 03:06:57,429
the 50s,
they can shoot for a high. If they fail

8120
03:06:57,429 --> 03:06:57,439
they can shoot for a high. If they fail
 

8121
03:06:57,439 --> 03:06:58,950
they can shoot for a high. If they fail
this, you're probably going to rotate

8122
03:06:58,950 --> 03:06:58,960
this, you're probably going to rotate
 

8123
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:01,910
this, you're probably going to rotate
back into here. So you're in lunch now

8124
03:07:01,910 --> 03:07:01,920
back into here. So you're in lunch now
 

8125
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:03,190
back into here. So you're in lunch now
as well, so who knows what they're going

8126
03:07:03,190 --> 03:07:03,200
as well, so who knows what they're going
 

8127
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:06,710
as well, so who knows what they're going
to do with it. recent top. Um, so you're

8128
03:07:06,710 --> 03:07:06,720
to do with it. recent top. Um, so you're
 

8129
03:07:06,720 --> 03:07:09,349
to do with it. recent top. Um, so you're
in from 200. You're about 50 points up.

8130
03:07:09,349 --> 03:07:09,359
in from 200. You're about 50 points up.
 

8131
03:07:09,359 --> 03:07:11,110
in from 200. You're about 50 points up.
If if you complete this rotation,

8132
03:07:11,110 --> 03:07:11,120
If if you complete this rotation,
 

8133
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:12,550
If if you complete this rotation,
remember you got both VWOPS underneath

8134
03:07:12,550 --> 03:07:12,560
remember you got both VWOPS underneath
 

8135
03:07:12,560 --> 03:07:13,910
remember you got both VWOPS underneath
you. But if you can complete the

8136
03:07:13,910 --> 03:07:13,920
you. But if you can complete the
 

8137
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:16,070
you. But if you can complete the
rotation

8138
03:07:16,070 --> 03:07:16,080
rotation
 

8139
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:20,550
rotation
under 130, I'd be looking for 100s.

8140
03:07:20,550 --> 03:07:20,560
under 130, I'd be looking for 100s.
 

8141
03:07:20,560 --> 03:07:22,790
under 130, I'd be looking for 100s.
Yeah. And then 80s and back into the

8142
03:07:22,790 --> 03:07:22,800
Yeah. And then 80s and back into the
 

8143
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:24,630
Yeah. And then 80s and back into the
same area as yesterday. But I think

8144
03:07:24,630 --> 03:07:24,640
same area as yesterday. But I think
 

8145
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:26,309
same area as yesterday. But I think
bulls have a chance to step in in that

8146
03:07:26,309 --> 03:07:26,319
bulls have a chance to step in in that
 

8147
03:07:26,319 --> 03:07:29,030
bulls have a chance to step in in that
in that area. But VIX has started to try

8148
03:07:29,030 --> 03:07:29,040
in that area. But VIX has started to try
 

8149
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:30,469
in that area. But VIX has started to try
and find a bit of a bid. But yeah, I

8150
03:07:30,469 --> 03:07:30,479
and find a bit of a bid. But yeah, I
 

8151
03:07:30,479 --> 03:07:35,510
and find a bit of a bid. But yeah, I
think we're just into the chopping slot.

8152
03:07:35,510 --> 03:07:35,520

 

8153
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:39,110

short from 180. It's just the only thing

8154
03:07:39,110 --> 03:07:39,120
short from 180. It's just the only thing
 

8155
03:07:39,120 --> 03:07:40,630
short from 180. It's just the only thing
now is just sort of fighting momentum,

8156
03:07:40,630 --> 03:07:40,640
now is just sort of fighting momentum,
 

8157
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:43,750
now is just sort of fighting momentum,
but you are uh

8158
03:07:43,750 --> 03:07:43,760
but you are uh
 

8159
03:07:43,760 --> 03:07:45,510
but you are uh
you are liable to sweep some of these

8160
03:07:45,510 --> 03:07:45,520
you are liable to sweep some of these
 

8161
03:07:45,520 --> 03:07:46,870
you are liable to sweep some of these
guys like we talked about, right? None

8162
03:07:46,870 --> 03:07:46,880
guys like we talked about, right? None
 

8163
03:07:46,880 --> 03:07:48,309
guys like we talked about, right? None
of these balls got hurt. They're likely

8164
03:07:48,309 --> 03:07:48,319
of these balls got hurt. They're likely
 

8165
03:07:48,319 --> 03:07:50,389
of these balls got hurt. They're likely
to get hurt. This is the edge of range.

8166
03:07:50,389 --> 03:07:50,399
to get hurt. This is the edge of range.
 

8167
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:52,309
to get hurt. This is the edge of range.
We've had no acceptance above here twice

8168
03:07:52,309 --> 03:07:52,319
We've had no acceptance above here twice
 

8169
03:07:52,319 --> 03:07:53,590
We've had no acceptance above here twice
today. So, we're probably going to trade

8170
03:07:53,590 --> 03:07:53,600
today. So, we're probably going to trade
 

8171
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:58,469
today. So, we're probably going to trade
back down to this side of this gray box.

8172
03:07:58,469 --> 03:07:58,479
back down to this side of this gray box.
 

8173
03:07:58,479 --> 03:08:00,710
back down to this side of this gray box.
So, as long as long as you're managing

8174
03:08:00,710 --> 03:08:00,720
So, as long as long as you're managing
 

8175
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:09,429
So, as long as long as you're managing
your position, you look good.

8176
03:08:09,429 --> 03:08:09,439

 

8177
03:08:09,439 --> 03:08:10,950

You never know. All right. You never

8178
03:08:10,950 --> 03:08:10,960
You never know. All right. You never
 

8179
03:08:10,960 --> 03:08:13,110
You never know. All right. You never
know. Maybe maybe you get that move.

8180
03:08:13,110 --> 03:08:13,120
know. Maybe maybe you get that move.
 

8181
03:08:13,120 --> 03:08:16,950
know. Maybe maybe you get that move.
Hopefully.

8182
03:08:16,950 --> 03:08:16,960

 

8183
03:08:16,960 --> 03:08:18,150

Yeah, that's one of your favorite

8184
03:08:18,150 --> 03:08:18,160
Yeah, that's one of your favorite
 

8185
03:08:18,160 --> 03:08:21,590
Yeah, that's one of your favorite

8186
03:08:21,590 --> 03:08:21,600
setups, Adam. It's okay. You'll get

Um, I'm going to get out of here. That

8190
03:08:24,790 --> 03:08:24,800
Um, I'm going to get out of here. That
 

8191
03:08:24,800 --> 03:08:26,710
Um, I'm going to get out of here. That
was a decent trading session. Nicely

8192
03:08:26,710 --> 03:08:26,720
was a decent trading session. Nicely
 

8193
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:29,030
was a decent trading session. Nicely
green on the day again.

8194
03:08:29,030 --> 03:08:29,040
green on the day again.
 

8195
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:31,590
green on the day again.
And no one asked me though. Is anyone

8196
03:08:31,590 --> 03:08:31,600
And no one asked me though. Is anyone
 

8197
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:33,590
And no one asked me though. Is anyone
here trading a legacy account on Funded

8198
03:08:33,590 --> 03:08:33,600
here trading a legacy account on Funded
 

8199
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:36,710
here trading a legacy account on Funded
Next? Before I go,

8200
03:08:36,710 --> 03:08:36,720
Next? Before I go,
 

8201
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:38,309
Next? Before I go,
does anyone here have a legacy account

8202
03:08:38,309 --> 03:08:38,319
does anyone here have a legacy account
 

8203
03:08:38,319 --> 03:08:48,309
does anyone here have a legacy account
on them?

8204
03:08:48,309 --> 03:08:48,319

 

8205
03:08:48,319 --> 03:08:49,590

Doesn't look like it. None of you are

8206
03:08:49,590 --> 03:08:49,600
Doesn't look like it. None of you are
 

8207
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:53,990
Doesn't look like it. None of you are
answering, so probably not.

8208
03:08:53,990 --> 03:08:54,000

 

8209
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,070

You trade the rapids.

8210
03:08:56,070 --> 03:08:56,080
You trade the rapids.
 

8211
03:08:56,080 --> 03:08:58,309
You trade the rapids.
Garbs, do you Well, maybe you trade with

8212
03:08:58,309 --> 03:08:58,319
Garbs, do you Well, maybe you trade with
 

8213
03:08:58,319 --> 03:09:00,710
Garbs, do you Well, maybe you trade with
them. Maybe you'll know. Oh, you just

8214
03:09:00,710 --> 03:09:00,720
them. Maybe you'll know. Oh, you just
 

8215
03:09:00,720 --> 03:09:03,429
them. Maybe you'll know. Oh, you just
started as well. Okay. I've got one pass

8216
03:09:03,429 --> 03:09:03,439
started as well. Okay. I've got one pass
 

8217
03:09:03,439 --> 03:09:05,429
started as well. Okay. I've got one pass
and I'm at day five and I'm up five and

8218
03:09:05,429 --> 03:09:05,439
and I'm at day five and I'm up five and
 

8219
03:09:05,439 --> 03:09:07,269
and I'm at day five and I'm up five and
a half grand, but it's on a legacy

8220
03:09:07,269 --> 03:09:07,279
a half grand, but it's on a legacy
 

8221
03:09:07,279 --> 03:09:09,030
a half grand, but it's on a legacy
account.

8222
03:09:09,030 --> 03:09:09,040
account.
 

8223
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:10,950
account.
Can I ignore the fiveday payouts and

8224
03:09:10,950 --> 03:09:10,960
Can I ignore the fiveday payouts and
 

8225
03:09:10,960 --> 03:09:12,710
Can I ignore the fiveday payouts and
just trade to 30 days straight and then

8226
03:09:12,710 --> 03:09:12,720
just trade to 30 days straight and then
 

8227
03:09:12,720 --> 03:09:15,590
just trade to 30 days straight and then
pull it all out or do I have to pull out

8228
03:09:15,590 --> 03:09:15,600
pull it all out or do I have to pull out
 

8229
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:17,190
pull it all out or do I have to pull out
when it's available? Do I have to do

8230
03:09:17,190 --> 03:09:17,200
when it's available? Do I have to do
 

8231
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:18,790
when it's available? Do I have to do
like a payout sequence? Does that make

8232
03:09:18,790 --> 03:09:18,800
like a payout sequence? Does that make
 

8233
03:09:18,800 --> 03:09:20,230
like a payout sequence? Does that make
sense? Or can I just trade straight to

8234
03:09:20,230 --> 03:09:20,240
sense? Or can I just trade straight to
 

8235
03:09:20,240 --> 03:09:23,349
sense? Or can I just trade straight to
30 days?

8236
03:09:23,349 --> 03:09:23,359
30 days?
 

8237
03:09:23,359 --> 03:09:25,030
30 days?
You might get that sell, Antonio. You

8238
03:09:25,030 --> 03:09:25,040
You might get that sell, Antonio. You
 

8239
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:27,670
You might get that sell, Antonio. You
might you might get your turbo paid for

8240
03:09:27,670 --> 03:09:27,680
might you might get your turbo paid for
 

8241
03:09:27,680 --> 03:09:29,750
might you might get your turbo paid for
here. This is your my first TP would be

8242
03:09:29,750 --> 03:09:29,760
here. This is your my first TP would be
 

8243
03:09:29,760 --> 03:09:32,790
here. This is your my first TP would be
here in this low volume area here. And

8244
03:09:32,790 --> 03:09:32,800
here in this low volume area here. And
 

8245
03:09:32,800 --> 03:09:34,070
here in this low volume area here. And
if you sell through this, you're going

8246
03:09:34,070 --> 03:09:34,080
if you sell through this, you're going
 

8247
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:37,110
if you sell through this, you're going
to get that move back down

8248
03:09:37,110 --> 03:09:37,120
to get that move back down
 

8249
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:43,190
to get that move back down
hopefully towards the 100s if not 80s.

8250
03:09:43,190 --> 03:09:43,200

 

8251
03:09:43,200 --> 03:09:44,950

If I can ignore it, I'd be tempted to

8252
03:09:44,950 --> 03:09:44,960
If I can ignore it, I'd be tempted to
 

8253
03:09:44,960 --> 03:09:46,630
If I can ignore it, I'd be tempted to
just take a very small payout and then

8254
03:09:46,630 --> 03:09:46,640
just take a very small payout and then
 

8255
03:09:46,640 --> 03:09:51,670
just take a very small payout and then
just trade try and build this up.

8256
03:09:51,670 --> 03:09:51,680

 

8257
03:09:51,680 --> 03:09:53,269

Yeah, they're trying to defend this low

8258
03:09:53,269 --> 03:09:53,279
Yeah, they're trying to defend this low
 

8259
03:09:53,279 --> 03:09:55,110
Yeah, they're trying to defend this low
ball node. That's why I say my first TP

8260
03:09:55,110 --> 03:09:55,120
ball node. That's why I say my first TP
 

8261
03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:57,030
ball node. That's why I say my first TP
would be here where we just pulled back

8262
03:09:57,030 --> 03:09:57,040
would be here where we just pulled back
 

8263
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:58,630
would be here where we just pulled back
into

8264
03:09:58,630 --> 03:09:58,640
into
 

8265
03:09:58,640 --> 03:10:00,150
into
there. Strong selling down there and it

8266
03:10:00,150 --> 03:10:00,160
there. Strong selling down there and it
 

8267
03:10:00,160 --> 03:10:01,670
there. Strong selling down there and it
got absorbed. So there's a buyer on the

8268
03:10:01,670 --> 03:10:01,680
got absorbed. So there's a buyer on the
 

8269
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:03,269
got absorbed. So there's a buyer on the
tape even in lunch. Just be aware of

8270
03:10:03,269 --> 03:10:03,279
tape even in lunch. Just be aware of
 

8271
03:10:03,279 --> 03:10:05,510
tape even in lunch. Just be aware of
that. Strong selling into this. There's

8272
03:10:05,510 --> 03:10:05,520
that. Strong selling into this. There's
 

8273
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:07,750
that. Strong selling into this. There's
a low volume node here and there is a

8274
03:10:07,750 --> 03:10:07,760
a low volume node here and there is a
 

8275
03:10:07,760 --> 03:10:11,269
a low volume node here and there is a
passive buyer sat here absorbing for now

8276
03:10:11,269 --> 03:10:11,279
passive buyer sat here absorbing for now
 

8277
03:10:11,279 --> 03:10:13,190
passive buyer sat here absorbing for now
on that last move down. He just absorbed

8278
03:10:13,190 --> 03:10:13,200
on that last move down. He just absorbed
 

8279
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:20,150
on that last move down. He just absorbed
it. Just be aware of that.

8280
03:10:20,150 --> 03:10:20,160

 

8281
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:21,990

No worries, L. Yeah, no worries. I'm

8282
03:10:21,990 --> 03:10:22,000
No worries, L. Yeah, no worries. I'm
 

8283
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,349
No worries, L. Yeah, no worries. I'm

8284
03:10:23,349 --> 03:10:23,359
here every day. So, whatever you need,
 

8285
03:10:23,359 --> 03:10:25,990
here every day. So, whatever you need,
I'm here. Thanks, Daniela. I'm just

8286
03:10:25,990 --> 03:10:26,000
I'm here. Thanks, Daniela. I'm just
 

8287
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:27,670
I'm here. Thanks, Daniela. I'm just
going to wait for I think Garbs is just

8288
03:10:27,670 --> 03:10:27,680
going to wait for I think Garbs is just
 

8289
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:30,309
going to wait for I think Garbs is just
having a look for me. See if Garbs can

8290
03:10:30,309 --> 03:10:30,319
having a look for me. See if Garbs can
 

8291
03:10:30,319 --> 03:10:35,590
having a look for me. See if Garbs can
figure it out. I couldn't figure it out.

8292
03:10:35,590 --> 03:10:35,600

 

8293
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:37,269

The reason we don't have a code and I

8294
03:10:37,269 --> 03:10:37,279
The reason we don't have a code and I
 

8295
03:10:37,279 --> 03:10:39,110
The reason we don't have a code and I
haven't promoted them yet is I have not

8296
03:10:39,110 --> 03:10:39,120
haven't promoted them yet is I have not
 

8297
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:40,710
haven't promoted them yet is I have not
taken a payout with them yet. Okay, so I

8298
03:10:40,710 --> 03:10:40,720
taken a payout with them yet. Okay, so I
 

8299
03:10:40,720 --> 03:10:41,990
taken a payout with them yet. Okay, so I
want to make sure everything is good

8300
03:10:41,990 --> 03:10:42,000
want to make sure everything is good
 

8301
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:43,590
want to make sure everything is good
with them first before we start talking

8302
03:10:43,590 --> 03:10:43,600
with them first before we start talking
 

8303
03:10:43,600 --> 03:10:45,110
with them first before we start talking
about them too much in stream. So this

8304
03:10:45,110 --> 03:10:45,120
about them too much in stream. So this
 

8305
03:10:45,120 --> 03:10:47,910
about them too much in stream. So this
would be my first account

8306
03:10:47,910 --> 03:10:47,920
would be my first account
 

8307
03:10:47,920 --> 03:10:51,510
would be my first account
and I think yeah I will be uh basically

8308
03:10:51,510 --> 03:10:51,520
and I think yeah I will be uh basically
 

8309
03:10:51,520 --> 03:10:57,590
and I think yeah I will be uh basically
I could take 2,00 5 6 7 8 2,800 out

8310
03:10:57,590 --> 03:10:57,600
I could take 2,00 5 6 7 8 2,800 out
 

8311
03:10:57,600 --> 03:10:59,510
I could take 2,00 5 6 7 8 2,800 out
after my first five days which is good

8312
03:10:59,510 --> 03:10:59,520
after my first five days which is good
 

8313
03:10:59,520 --> 03:11:03,030
after my first five days which is good
but I could also swing big now I've

8314
03:11:03,030 --> 03:11:03,040
but I could also swing big now I've
 

8315
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:04,870
but I could also swing big now I've
built a buffer

8316
03:11:04,870 --> 03:11:04,880
built a buffer
 

8317
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:10,950
built a buffer
if they allow it

8318
03:11:10,950 --> 03:11:10,960

 

8319
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:13,349

protected VUP. the view up in that low

8320
03:11:13,349 --> 03:11:13,359
protected VUP. the view up in that low
 

8321
03:11:13,359 --> 03:11:16,790
protected VUP. the view up in that low
volume node. It's just here, right?

8322
03:11:16,790 --> 03:11:16,800
volume node. It's just here, right?
 

8323
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:20,710
volume node. It's just here, right?
This sort of 30s

8324
03:11:20,710 --> 03:11:20,720

 

8325
03:11:20,720 --> 03:11:23,030

down to 16s. If you get failures

8341
03:11:35,439 --> 03:11:36,550
through 30s and make a new low. You're
good. They're trying to force it.

8342
03:11:36,550 --> 03:11:36,560
good. They're trying to force it.

8345
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,230
There's big sellers coming in here. They
are trying to force it. This is twice at

8346
03:11:40,230 --> 03:11:40,240
are trying to force it. This is twice at
 

8347
03:11:40,240 --> 03:11:42,389
are trying to force it. This is twice at
the same level now. Big sellers have

8348
03:11:42,389 --> 03:11:42,399
the same level now. Big sellers have
 

8349
03:11:42,399 --> 03:11:44,550
the same level now. Big sellers have
stepped in. So, I would take a TP here

8350
03:11:44,550 --> 03:11:44,560
stepped in. So, I would take a TP here
 

8351
03:11:44,560 --> 03:11:46,630
stepped in. So, I would take a TP here
if you haven't already and then try and

8352
03:11:46,630 --> 03:11:46,640
if you haven't already and then try and
 

8353
03:11:46,640 --> 03:11:48,150
if you haven't already and then try and
hold to see if you can get a flush,

8354
03:11:48,150 --> 03:11:48,160
hold to see if you can get a flush,
 

8355
03:11:48,160 --> 03:11:49,510
hold to see if you can get a flush,
which looks like they're trying to force

8356
03:11:49,510 --> 03:11:49,520
which looks like they're trying to force
 

8357
03:11:49,520 --> 03:11:53,590

03:14:08,630 --> 03:14:08,640
TPT. So, let's say you have a 50K
 

8445
03:14:08,640 --> 03:14:11,590
TPT. So, let's say you have a 50K
account. If you hit a 50 grand winner

8446
03:14:11,590 --> 03:14:11,600
account. If you hit a 50 grand winner
 

8447
03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:14,229

day one, you're going to take all of

day one, you're going to take all of
 

8449
03:14:14,239 --> 03:14:18,150
day one, you're going to take all of
that out above the buffer at a 8020

8450
03:14:18,150 --> 03:14:18,160
that out above the buffer at a 8020

03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:37,670
buyer leaves the tape, then you'll get
continuation lower. But if if he soaks

Yeah. Still soaking that same level.

8541
03:16:26,800 --> 03:16:30,150
Discord, I will hop in later. All I want
to say before I go and I remind you, the

8542
03:16:30,150 --> 03:16:30,160
to say before I go and I remind you, the
 

8543
03:16:30,160 --> 03:16:32,550
to say before I go and I remind you, the
conditions are range rotating

8544
03:16:32,550 --> 03:16:32,560
conditions are range rotating
 

8545
03:16:32,560 --> 03:16:34,950
conditions are range rotating
conditions. You've got to be careful in

8546
03:16:34,950 --> 03:16:34,960
conditions. You've got to be careful in
 

8547
03:16:34,960 --> 03:16:37,190
conditions. You've got to be careful in
range rotating conditions. If you join

8548
03:16:37,190 --> 03:16:37,200
range rotating conditions. If you join
 

8549
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:39,670
range rotating conditions. If you join
something late looking for a trend, you

8550
03:16:39,670 --> 03:16:39,680
something late looking for a trend, you
 

8551
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:42,710
something late looking for a trend, you
are likely to get hurt. All right, just

8552
03:16:42,710 --> 03:16:42,720
are likely to get hurt. All right, just
 

8553
03:16:42,720 --> 03:16:44,950
are likely to get hurt. All right, just
remember that location in R range

8554
03:16:44,950 --> 03:16:44,960
remember that location in R range
 

8555
03:16:44,960 --> 03:16:47,190
remember that location in R range
rotating conditions is probably more

8556
03:16:47,190 --> 03:16:47,200
rotating conditions is probably more
 

8557
03:16:47,200 --> 03:16:49,429
rotating conditions is probably more
important than any other condition. All

8558
03:16:49,429 --> 03:16:49,439
important than any other condition. All
 

8559
03:16:49,439 --> 03:16:51,910
important than any other condition. All
right, location is always important, but

8560
03:16:51,910 --> 03:16:51,920
right, location is always important, but
 

8561
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:54,070
right, location is always important, but
because in range rotation you don't have

8562
03:16:54,070 --> 03:16:54,080
because in range rotation you don't have
 

8563
03:16:54,080 --> 03:16:56,389
because in range rotation you don't have
as much momentum, location matters. All

8564
03:16:56,389 --> 03:16:56,399
as much momentum, location matters. All
 

8565
03:16:56,399 --> 03:16:58,309
as much momentum, location matters. All
right, so make sure you understand that.

8566
03:16:58,309 --> 03:16:58,319
right, so make sure you understand that.
 

8567
03:16:58,319 --> 03:17:00,309
right, so make sure you understand that.
Also make sure that you understand that

8568
03:17:00,309 --> 03:17:00,319
Also make sure that you understand that
 

8569
03:17:00,319 --> 03:17:03,030
Also make sure that you understand that
when we are finding someone stuck like

8570
03:17:03,030 --> 03:17:03,040
when we are finding someone stuck like
 

8571
03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:05,830
when we are finding someone stuck like
we had where's my mouse down here. These

8572
03:17:05,830 --> 03:17:05,840
we had where's my mouse down here. These
 

8573
03:17:05,840 --> 03:17:08,070
we had where's my mouse down here. These
moves here are very very very big. These

8574
03:17:08,070 --> 03:17:08,080
moves here are very very very big. These
 

8575
03:17:08,080 --> 03:17:10,630
moves here are very very very big. These
are 40 point 30 to 40 point candles,

8576
03:17:10,630 --> 03:17:10,640
are 40 point 30 to 40 point candles,
 

8577
03:17:10,640 --> 03:17:12,229
are 40 point 30 to 40 point candles,
right? It' be the same. If we get buyers

8578
03:17:12,229 --> 03:17:12,239
right? It' be the same. If we get buyers
 

8579
03:17:12,239 --> 03:17:14,150
right? It' be the same. If we get buyers
stuck and they do 30 to 40 point candles

8580
03:17:14,150 --> 03:17:14,160
stuck and they do 30 to 40 point candles
 

8581
03:17:14,160 --> 03:17:16,469
stuck and they do 30 to 40 point candles
down, you're going to get hurt. A 30

8582
03:17:16,469 --> 03:17:16,479
down, you're going to get hurt. A 30
 

8583
03:17:16,479 --> 03:17:18,790
down, you're going to get hurt. A 30
point stop in this market is probably

8584
03:17:18,790 --> 03:17:18,800
point stop in this market is probably
 

8585
03:17:18,800 --> 03:17:20,070
point stop in this market is probably
not going to be enough unless you're

8586
03:17:20,070 --> 03:17:20,080
not going to be enough unless you're
 

8587
03:17:20,080 --> 03:17:21,990
not going to be enough unless you're
able to be very very accurate using

8588
03:17:21,990 --> 03:17:22,000
able to be very very accurate using
 

8589
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:25,510
able to be very very accurate using
orderflow. So size down, right? Size

8590
03:17:25,510 --> 03:17:25,520
orderflow. So size down, right? Size
 

8591
03:17:25,520 --> 03:17:28,389
orderflow. So size down, right? Size
down. And um I'll see you all tomorrow.

8595
03:17:31,200 --> 03:17:34,550
We'll go again. Same thing tomorrow. And
uh where we close today will matter.

8596
03:17:34,550 --> 03:17:34,560
uh where we close today will matter.
 

8597
03:17:34,560 --> 03:17:36,550
uh where we close today will matter.
Looking at that daily chart, it is going

8598
03:17:36,550 --> 03:17:36,560
Looking at that daily chart, it is going
 

8599
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:38,309
Looking at that daily chart, it is going
to matter. Where we close today matters.

8600

to matter. Where we close today matters.
 

8601
03:17:38,319 --> 03:17:40,150
to matter. Where we close today matters.
Are we going to get close outside of

03:17:40,150 --> 03:17:40,160
Are we going to get close outside of
 

8603
03:17:40,160 --> 03:17:41,510
Are we going to get close outside of
that previous week range or we just

8604
03:17:41,510 --> 03:17:41,520
that previous week range or we just
 

8605
03:17:41,520 --> 03:17:43,349
that previous week range or we just
going to close back inside of it and

8606
03:17:43,349 --> 03:17:43,359
going to close back inside of it and
 

8607
03:17:43,359 --> 03:17:46,229
going to close back inside of it and
rotate until Wednesday is out the way?

8608
03:17:46,229 --> 03:17:46,239
rotate until Wednesday is out the way?
 

8609
03:17:46,239 --> 03:17:48,550
rotate until Wednesday is out the way?
Which is what I think is a good chance

8610
03:17:48,550 --> 03:17:48,560
Which is what I think is a good chance
 

8611
03:17:48,560 --> 03:17:50,070
Which is what I think is a good chance
of happening because Nvidia's coming

8612
03:17:50,070 --> 03:17:50,080

03:17:53,279 --> 03:17:54,950
Wednesday afternoon. How we act into
that will be key. Can they trap enough

8616
03:17:54,950 --> 03:17:54,960
that will be key. Can they trap enough
 

8617
03:17:54,960 --> 03:17:57,670
that will be key. Can they trap enough
people and use an outlier print is what
