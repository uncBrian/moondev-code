Okay, there we go. Sorry team. Yeah, my

Okay, there we go. Sorry team. Yeah, my

Okay, there we go. Sorry team. Yeah, my

00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
uh like I was saying when volume wasn't

uh like I was saying when volume wasn't
on, my PC overnight has done a full

00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
on, my PC overnight has done a full
 

7
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,869
on, my PC overnight has done a full
restart without telling me. So, I've

8
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
restart without telling me. So, I've
 

9
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,390
restart without telling me. So, I've
lost all my settings. So, there we go.

10
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
lost all my settings. So, there we go.
 

11
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,670
lost all my settings. So, there we go.
That's why this has happened. So, let's

12
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
That's why this has happened. So, let's
 

13
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,630
That's why this has happened. So, let's
get through this because we're running

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
get through this because we're running
 

15

get through this because we're running
out of time here. Right, failed

17
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,869
out of time here. Right, failed
breakout. There's your range. We're back

19
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,630

would have liked to seen this dig a

32
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
would have liked to seen this dig a
 

33
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,670
would have liked to seen this dig a
little bit deeper, but we didn't. Right

34
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
little bit deeper, but we didn't. Right
 

35
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,030
little bit deeper, but we didn't. Right
here, 50-day and 20 and yes, and 20-day

36
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
here, 50-day and 20 and yes, and 20-day
 

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,949

mean reversion. Still no sound.

38
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
mean reversion. Still no sound.
 

39
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,910
mean reversion. Still no sound.
No, you've got sound, Chad. Uh, everyone

40
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
No, you've got sound, Chad. Uh, everyone
 

41
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,509
No, you've got sound, Chad. Uh, everyone
can hear me now. Um,

42
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
can hear me now. Um,
 

43
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,710
can hear me now. Um,
all right. So, 50 day and 20 day, and

44
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
all right. So, 50 day and 20 day, and
 

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,229
all right. So, 50 day and 20 day, and
we're founding a bid on this low

46
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
we're founding a bid on this low
 

47
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,110
we're founding a bid on this low
here. All right. So, if we find a bid

48
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
here. All right. So, if we find a bid
 

49
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,110
here. All right. So, if we find a bid
here, then potentially this can be a

50
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
here, then potentially this can be a
 

51
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,710
here, then potentially this can be a
daily higher low to move higher. We

52
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
daily higher low to move higher. We
 

53
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,710
daily higher low to move higher. We
can't rule it out. Is it ideal? No. We'd

54
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
can't rule it out. Is it ideal? No. We'd
 

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,270
can't rule it out. Is it ideal? No. We'd
like to see that happen in New York, but

56
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
like to see that happen in New York, but
 

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,950
like to see that happen in New York, but
we get what we've uh been dealt with

58
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
we get what we've uh been dealt with
 

59
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,070
we get what we've uh been dealt with
right now. We've traded right back

60
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
right now. We've traded right back
 

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,390
right now. We've traded right back
inside range. Uh, this is possibly the

62
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
inside range. Uh, this is possibly the
 

63
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,390
inside range. Uh, this is possibly the
one of the worst charts I've seen. I'm

64
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
one of the worst charts I've seen. I'm
 

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,909
one of the worst charts I've seen. I'm
just being really honest with you. Uh,

66
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
just being really honest with you. Uh,
 

67
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,710
just being really honest with you. Uh,
failed breakouts both sides back into a

68
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
failed breakouts both sides back into a
 

69
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,110
failed breakouts both sides back into a
multi-week channel. Um, and range is not

70
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
multi-week channel. Um, and range is not
 

71
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,670
multi-week channel. Um, and range is not
what you want to see. All right, so

72
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
what you want to see. All right, so
 

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,189
what you want to see. All right, so
right here,

80
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
value. All right. So, value, if you
 

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,510
value. All right. So, value, if you
think about this, value moved down,

82
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
think about this, value moved down,
 

83
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,629
think about this, value moved down,
value moved down, value moved sideways,

84
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
value moved down, value moved sideways,
 

85
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,749
value moved down, value moved sideways,
value moved down, value moved up, value

86
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
value moved down, value moved up, value
 

87
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,670
value moved down, value moved up, value
moved up, and now we're just inside this

88
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
moved up, and now we're just inside this
 

89
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,350
moved up, and now we're just inside this
same level. We can't find acceptance

90
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
same level. We can't find acceptance
 

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,070
same level. We can't find acceptance
above. We can't find acceptance below in

92
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
above. We can't find acceptance below in
 

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,749
above. We can't find acceptance below in
this exact zone. We've spent 3 weeks,

94
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
this exact zone. We've spent 3 weeks,
 

95
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,590
this exact zone. We've spent 3 weeks,
right? So, no migration either way. It's

96
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
right? So, no migration either way. It's
 

97
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,110
right? So, no migration either way. It's
trying to figure it out at the moment.

98
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
trying to figure it out at the moment.
 

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,830
trying to figure it out at the moment.
So, we want to be very, very careful. Uh

100
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
So, we want to be very, very careful. Uh
 

101
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,390
So, we want to be very, very careful. Uh
if we put on a developing profile of

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
if we put on a developing profile of
 

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:35,670
if we put on a developing profile of
this week,

104
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680

 

105
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,670

you can see

106
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
you can see
 

107
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,070
you can see
we're right back inside and we're inside

108
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
we're right back inside and we're inside
 

109
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,670
we're right back inside and we're inside
this week's point. Well, we're right at

110
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
this week's point. Well, we're right at
 

111
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,830
this week's point. Well, we're right at
this week's point of control. So, I'll

112
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
this week's point of control. So, I'll
 

113
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,430
this week's point of control. So, I'll
be watching that rotation up to previous

114
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
be watching that rotation up to previous
 

115
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,990
be watching that rotation up to previous
day value area high. All right, 723s. If

116
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
day value area high. All right, 723s. If
 

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,830
day value area high. All right, 723s. If
they fail 723s, we're probably going to

118
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
they fail 723s, we're probably going to
 

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,670
they fail 723s, we're probably going to
come back down to value. These are the

120
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
come back down to value. These are the
 

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,029
come back down to value. These are the
opportunities today. It's just a

122
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
opportunities today. It's just a
 

123
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,189
opportunities today. It's just a
rotation till it proves otherwise into

124
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
rotation till it proves otherwise into
 

125
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,350
rotation till it proves otherwise into
here may well be a fade back down to

126
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
here may well be a fade back down to
 

127
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,870
here may well be a fade back down to
there. You can see we could not get

128
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
there. You can see we could not get
 

129
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,469
there. You can see we could not get
under previous week's value area low.

130
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
under previous week's value area low.
 

131
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,990
under previous week's value area low.
There was a wick down but we reclaimed

132
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
There was a wick down but we reclaimed
 

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,070
There was a wick down but we reclaimed
it. We're straight back up. I was

134
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
it. We're straight back up. I was
 

135
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,830
it. We're straight back up. I was
attempting to short that back down there

136
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
attempting to short that back down there
 

137
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,590
attempting to short that back down there
last night but took the stop. Um so

138
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
last night but took the stop. Um so
 

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,670
last night but took the stop. Um so
reclaim a value rotations in here

140
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
reclaim a value rotations in here
 

141
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,629
reclaim a value rotations in here
outside of here. Well, we can argue that

142
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
outside of here. Well, we can argue that
 

143
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,150
outside of here. Well, we can argue that
we can come all the way back up to these

144
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
we can come all the way back up to these
 

145
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,749
we can come all the way back up to these
highs again. All right. So if we start

146
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
highs again. All right. So if we start
 

147
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,390
highs again. All right. So if we start
printing above value on current week and

148
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
printing above value on current week and
 

149
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,990
printing above value on current week and
previous week and previous day, if we

150
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
previous week and previous day, if we
 

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,710
previous week and previous day, if we
start basing and holding these sort of

152
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
start basing and holding these sort of
 

153
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,390
start basing and holding these sort of
700 750s, 720 750s, then we can think

154
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
700 750s, 720 750s, then we can think
 

155
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,070
700 750s, 720 750s, then we can think
about that move higher. But if they look

156
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
about that move higher. But if they look
 

157
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,550
about that move higher. But if they look
above into here and fail again, we're

158
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
above into here and fail again, we're
 

159
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,830
above into here and fail again, we're
coming right back down to the other side

160
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
coming right back down to the other side
 

161
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,990
coming right back down to the other side
of value and this will just continue to

162
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
of value and this will just continue to
 

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,830
of value and this will just continue to
wash and rotate until they're ready with

164
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
wash and rotate until they're ready with
 

165
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,189
wash and rotate until they're ready with
it. So super super careful today, folks,

166
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
it. So super super careful today, folks,
 

167
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,469
it. So super super careful today, folks,
while we're trading back inside that

168
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
while we're trading back inside that
 

169
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,390
while we're trading back inside that
range. If we look at GlobeEx, you can

170
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
range. If we look at GlobeEx, you can
 

171
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,990
range. If we look at GlobeEx, you can
see what I'm talking about. Right,

172
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
see what I'm talking about. Right,
 

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,070
see what I'm talking about. Right,
there's the look above and fail on FOMC.

174
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
there's the look above and fail on FOMC.
 

175
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,909
there's the look above and fail on FOMC.
Those who traded FOMC with me will know

176
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
Those who traded FOMC with me will know
 

177
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,749
Those who traded FOMC with me will know
I said no more longs up here. We were

178
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
I said no more longs up here. We were
 

179
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,230
I said no more longs up here. We were
long from here for the drive. I was

180
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
long from here for the drive. I was
 

181
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,830
long from here for the drive. I was
expecting a two-le pull back here to

182
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
expecting a two-le pull back here to
 

183
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,309
expecting a two-le pull back here to
hold. We came into Globex and they puked

184
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
hold. We came into Globex and they puked
 

185
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,070
hold. We came into Globex and they puked
the whole thing. Now we've reclaimed

186
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
the whole thing. Now we've reclaimed
 

187
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,830
the whole thing. Now we've reclaimed
value. Get out the way. So you can see

188
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
value. Get out the way. So you can see
 

189
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,589
value. Get out the way. So you can see
here that's your look below and fail.

190
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
here that's your look below and fail.
 

191
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,830
here that's your look below and fail.
Here's the box trigger box and back

192
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
Here's the box trigger box and back
 

193
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,550
Here's the box trigger box and back
inside. So messy, messy, messy, folks.

194
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
inside. So messy, messy, messy, folks.
 

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,469
inside. So messy, messy, messy, folks.
That's uh this is just what we've got.

196
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
That's uh this is just what we've got.
 

197
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,469
That's uh this is just what we've got.
Can only can only play what's in front

198
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
Can only can only play what's in front
 

199
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,390
Can only can only play what's in front
of us, right? We can only play what is

200
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
of us, right? We can only play what is
 

201
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,150
of us, right? We can only play what is
in front of us. But you know, this is

202
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
in front of us. But you know, this is
 

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,469
in front of us. But you know, this is
very, very thin. Gap fill will be all

204
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
very, very thin. Gap fill will be all
 

205
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,230
very, very thin. Gap fill will be all
the way back up to 800. Basically, I

206
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
the way back up to 800. Basically, I
 

207
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,510
the way back up to 800. Basically, I
wouldn't rule that out right now with

208
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
wouldn't rule that out right now with
 

209
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,629
wouldn't rule that out right now with
how we're moving. Let's have a quick

210
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
how we're moving. Let's have a quick
 

211
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,150
how we're moving. Let's have a quick
look.

212
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
look.
 

213
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,230
look.
Going to leave the ES. We can have a

214
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
Going to leave the ES. We can have a
 

215
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,909
Going to leave the ES. We can have a
very quick look, but you see, same kind

216
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
very quick look, but you see, same kind
 

217
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,510
very quick look, but you see, same kind
of thing. All right, it's trying to

218
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
of thing. All right, it's trying to
 

219
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,749
of thing. All right, it's trying to
reclaim and get up to gap fill. If we

220
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
reclaim and get up to gap fill. If we
 

221
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,110
reclaim and get up to gap fill. If we
think about this as a fib, it's the

222
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
think about this as a fib, it's the
 

223
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,390
think about this as a fib, it's the
other thing we need to be careful of

224
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
other thing we need to be careful of
 

225
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,110
other thing we need to be careful of
right now. All right, from the high to

226
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
right now. All right, from the high to
 

227
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,430
right now. All right, from the high to
the low, we're into golden zone. Full

228
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
the low, we're into golden zone. Full
 

229
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,550
the low, we're into golden zone. Full
retracement is there 891. going gaffful.

230
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
retracement is there 891. going gaffful.
 

231
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,550
retracement is there 891. going gaffful.
Uh, what I want to be very careful of is

232
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
Uh, what I want to be very careful of is
 

233
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,629
Uh, what I want to be very careful of is
this right here. I've talked about this

234
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
this right here. I've talked about this
 

235
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,710
this right here. I've talked about this
numerous times. 82 85 88 90. All right.

236
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
numerous times. 82 85 88 90. All right.
 

237
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,710
numerous times. 82 85 88 90. All right.
82

238
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
82
 

239
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,270
82
down here gamma 85

240
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280

 

241
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,710

gamma 90 and then 700s. All right. So,

242
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
gamma 90 and then 700s. All right. So,
 

243
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,550
gamma 90 and then 700s. All right. So,
cool wall here. Put wall here. Rotation.

244
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
cool wall here. Put wall here. Rotation.
 

245
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,070
cool wall here. Put wall here. Rotation.
Rotation, rotation, rotation under here.

246
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
Rotation, rotation, rotation under here.
 

247
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,309
Rotation, rotation, rotation under here.
Definitely under 80. There's actually

248
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
Definitely under 80. There's actually
 

249
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,710
Definitely under 80. There's actually
not much in terms of put walls down

250
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
not much in terms of put walls down
 

251
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,710
not much in terms of put walls down
here. So, if we start losing 82s, it's

252
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
here. So, if we start losing 82s, it's
 

253
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,390
here. So, if we start losing 82s, it's
actually going to get pretty bad. But,

254
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
actually going to get pretty bad. But,
 

255
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,469
actually going to get pretty bad. But,
uh, we've got cool walls, 88, 90, and

256
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
uh, we've got cool walls, 88, 90, and
 

257
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,710
uh, we've got cool walls, 88, 90, and
definitely 700. There's huge lots up

258
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
definitely 700. There's huge lots up
 

259
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,949
definitely 700. There's huge lots up
here on 700. So, we we will just see.

260
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
here on 700. So, we we will just see.
 

261
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,790
here on 700. So, we we will just see.
We'll just see how we go. Uh, let's have

262
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
We'll just see how we go. Uh, let's have
 

263
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,149
We'll just see how we go. Uh, let's have
a quick look at the VIX and then the

264
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
a quick look at the VIX and then the
 

265
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,670
a quick look at the VIX and then the
mag, and then we've got to jump into it.

266
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
mag, and then we've got to jump into it.
 

267
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,350
mag, and then we've got to jump into it.
I don't think I've even got Ninja open

268
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
I don't think I've even got Ninja open
 

269
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,870
I don't think I've even got Ninja open
yet. Let me just get that booting up

270
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
yet. Let me just get that booting up
 

271
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,350
yet. Let me just get that booting up
while we're doing this.

272
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
while we're doing this.
 

273
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,949
while we're doing this.
Uh

274
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
Uh
 

275
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,710
Uh
so VIX,

276
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720

 

277
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,350

same story here. You can see we've

278
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
same story here. You can see we've
 

279
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,949
same story here. You can see we've
peaked out trading in between levels. Um

280
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
peaked out trading in between levels. Um
 

281
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,230
peaked out trading in between levels. Um
fill in this gap. If we start losing uh

282
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
fill in this gap. If we start losing uh
 

283
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,790
fill in this gap. If we start losing uh
16s and rolling over into low 15s, then

284
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
16s and rolling over into low 15s, then
 

285
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,269
16s and rolling over into low 15s, then
market can just go on a slow low

286
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
market can just go on a slow low
 

287
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,310
market can just go on a slow low
volatility grind back up. Sorry guys,

288
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
volatility grind back up. Sorry guys,
 

289
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,230
volatility grind back up. Sorry guys,
give me one second. Just trying to get

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
give me one second. Just trying to get
 

291
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,470
give me one second. Just trying to get
in up while we're doing this.

292
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
No, doesn't want to play ball. Of
 

295
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:41,350
No, doesn't want to play ball. Of
course, it doesn't

296
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360

 

297
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,150

Okay, sorry. Mag

Incredible. Apple gapping up around
 

307
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,910
Incredible. Apple gapping up around
previous day high again. Still boxed in.

308
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
previous day high again. Still boxed in.
 

309
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,470
previous day high again. Still boxed in.
If we start to break, though. All right.

310
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
If we start to break, though. All right.
 

311
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,829
If we start to break, though. All right.
If we start to break, you can see

312
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
If we start to break, you can see
 

313
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,590
If we start to break, you can see
Apple's trying to curl. If we start to

314
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
Apple's trying to curl. If we start to
 

315
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,310
Apple's trying to curl. If we start to
break, we might be going back to the top

316
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
break, we might be going back to the top
 

317
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,750
break, we might be going back to the top
side here on Apple. Uh Amazon, that's a

318
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
side here on Apple. Uh Amazon, that's a
 

319
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,150
side here on Apple. Uh Amazon, that's a
gap down back into range. Nothing to see

320
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
gap down back into range. Nothing to see
 

321
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,470
gap down back into range. Nothing to see
here. Okay, fail breakout above, failed

322
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
here. Okay, fail breakout above, failed
 

323
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,550

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
breakout below. This is your base. This
 

325
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,389
breakout below. This is your base. This
is the rotation. That's an ugly looking

326
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
is the rotation. That's an ugly looking
 

327
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,069
is the rotation. That's an ugly looking
chart.

Goo flat. You can see it's trying to

330
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
Goo flat. You can see it's trying to
 

331
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,470
Goo flat. You can see it's trying to
curl with built liquidity here. question

332
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
curl with built liquidity here. question
 

333
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,230
curl with built liquidity here. question
is can it break out previous day high,

334
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
is can it break out previous day high,
 

335
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,949
is can it break out previous day high,
previous week high for a continuation

336
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
previous week high for a continuation
 

337
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,710
previous week high for a continuation
opening up flat but that's looking a bit

338
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
opening up flat but that's looking a bit
 

339
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,590
opening up flat but that's looking a bit
more bullish meta uh this won't look

340
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
more bullish meta uh this won't look
 

341
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,829
more bullish meta uh this won't look
good right this got hammered uh with

342
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
good right this got hammered uh with
 

343
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,230
good right this got hammered uh with
Oracle so

344
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
Oracle so
 

345
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,230

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
small position waiting to see how this
 

355
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,910
small position waiting to see how this
sort of works out but back into this low

356
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
sort of works out but back into this low
 

357
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,750
sort of works out but back into this low
range if we start losing this then we're

358
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
range if we start losing this then we're
 

359
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,310
range if we start losing this then we're
going straight back down to those 580s

360
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
going straight back down to those 580s

00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519

 

363
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,949

gapping down. That doesn't look good

364
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
gapping down. That doesn't look good
 

365
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,269
gapping down. That doesn't look good
either. Nvidia. Okay, this got smashed

366
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
either. Nvidia. Okay, this got smashed
 

367
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,350
either. Nvidia. Okay, this got smashed
on Oracle. You can see there's your gap

368
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
on Oracle. You can see there's your gap
 

369
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,509
on Oracle. You can see there's your gap
down. Oracle had earnings yesterday. The

370
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
down. Oracle had earnings yesterday. The
 

371
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,790
down. Oracle had earnings yesterday. The
earnings are actually good, but

372
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
earnings are actually good, but
 

373
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,230
earnings are actually good, but
everyone's adamant on selling at the

374
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
everyone's adamant on selling at the
 

375
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,509
everyone's adamant on selling at the
moment. I'm actually watching to see if

376
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
moment. I'm actually watching to see if
 

377
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,910
moment. I'm actually watching to see if
Oracle starts holding a bit of a bid

378
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
Oracle starts holding a bit of a bid
 

379
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,990
Oracle starts holding a bit of a bid
after it will be SSR this morning when

380
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
after it will be SSR this morning when
 

381
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,509
after it will be SSR this morning when
it opens up. And Tesla, all right,

382
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
it opens up. And Tesla, all right,
 

383
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,870
it opens up. And Tesla, all right,
gapping down as well. So, MAD doesn't

384
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
gapping down as well. So, MAD doesn't
 

385
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,310
gapping down as well. So, MAD doesn't
look too good. I'll show you Oracle.

386
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
look too good. I'll show you Oracle.
 

387
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,910
look too good. I'll show you Oracle.
There's Oracle. All right. So, there's

388
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
There's Oracle. All right. So, there's
 

389
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,069
There's Oracle. All right. So, there's
the push yesterday on earnings. There's

390
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
the push yesterday on earnings. There's
 

391
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,550
the push yesterday on earnings. There's
the sell. Um, but we know we have a gap

392
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
the sell. Um, but we know we have a gap
 

393
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,430
the sell. Um, but we know we have a gap
fill into 87s.

394
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
fill into 87s.
 

395
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,509
fill into 87s.
What have I got here? We've got a gap

396
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
What have I got here? We've got a gap
 

397
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,350
What have I got here? We've got a gap
fill.

398
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
fill.
 

399
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,829
fill.
Is it 8778? God, gone the wrong way

400
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
Is it 8778? God, gone the wrong way
 

401
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,190
Is it 8778? God, gone the wrong way
around. So, I'm watching this to see if

402
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
around. So, I'm watching this to see if
 

403
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,350
around. So, I'm watching this to see if
once we fill the gap, we find a bid on

404
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
once we fill the gap, we find a bid on
 

405
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,350
once we fill the gap, we find a bid on
Oracle or not. Uh, it's one thing I'm

406
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
Oracle or not. Uh, it's one thing I'm
 

407
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,269
Oracle or not. Uh, it's one thing I'm
aware of right now. Remember, we've this

408
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
aware of right now. Remember, we've this
 

409
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,670
aware of right now. Remember, we've this
move is ridiculous.

410
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
move is ridiculous.
 

411
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,190
move is ridiculous.
Um, but if they want to keep selling it,

412
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
Um, but if they want to keep selling it,
 

413
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,870
Um, but if they want to keep selling it,
they will. We're now down 40 45%. If we

414
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
they will. We're now down 40 45%. If we
 

415
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,590
they will. We're now down 40 45%. If we
fill that gap, we'll be down 50%. So, if

416
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
fill that gap, we'll be down 50%. So, if
 

417
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,069
fill that gap, we'll be down 50%. So, if
we get into there, I will consider it.

418
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
we get into there, I will consider it.
 

419
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,990
we get into there, I will consider it.
It's got to It's got to start I mean, I

420
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
It's got to It's got to start I mean, I
 

421
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,190
It's got to It's got to start I mean, I
was looking for it to put a higher low

422
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
was looking for it to put a higher low
 

423
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,870
was looking for it to put a higher low
here and it didn't. So, if we get down

424
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
here and it didn't. So, if we get down
 

425
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,949
here and it didn't. So, if we get down
to here and we start basing, I'll

426
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
to here and we start basing, I'll
 

427
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,389
to here and we start basing, I'll
consider it, but I'm not going to buy

428
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
consider it, but I'm not going to buy
 

429
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,350
consider it, but I'm not going to buy
the knife in case we uh start rolling

430
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
the knife in case we uh start rolling
 

431
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,030
the knife in case we uh start rolling
over the market. The one thing that I

432
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
over the market. The one thing that I
 

433
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,670
over the market. The one thing that I
would say is watching the 10year and 30

434
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
would say is watching the 10year and 30
 

435
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,030
would say is watching the 10year and 30
years. All right, they had the chance to

436
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
years. All right, they had the chance to
 

437
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,310
years. All right, they had the chance to
do this breakout. We've been talking

438
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
do this breakout. We've been talking
 

439
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,150
do this breakout. We've been talking
about it for months on here. All right.

440
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
about it for months on here. All right.
 

441
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,910
about it for months on here. All right.
Yesterday we broke out. We're already

442
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
Yesterday we broke out. We're already
 

443
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,670
Yesterday we broke out. We're already
trading back inside. That's what's

444
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
trading back inside. That's what's
 

445
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,350
trading back inside. That's what's
allowing this market to cool off a bit

446
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
allowing this market to cool off a bit
 

447
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,710
allowing this market to cool off a bit
as in to like regain some control. If we

448
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
as in to like regain some control. If we
 

449
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,030
as in to like regain some control. If we
did this, all right, and that held, this

450
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
did this, all right, and that held, this
 

451
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,030
did this, all right, and that held, this
market would be puking right now. So,

452
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
market would be puking right now. So,
 

453
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,030
market would be puking right now. So,
worth having one eye on that today, I

454
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
worth having one eye on that today, I
 

455
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,190
worth having one eye on that today, I
would say.

456
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200

 

457
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,470

All right. So, Magnog looking too good.

458
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
All right. So, Magnog looking too good.
 

459
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,629
All right. So, Magnog looking too good.
Bit of a mixed bag. Apple relative

460
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
Bit of a mixed bag. Apple relative
 

461
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,389
Bit of a mixed bag. Apple relative
strength because why it hasn't got much

462
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
strength because why it hasn't got much
 

463
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,990
strength because why it hasn't got much
exposure to uh to the chips like we

464
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
exposure to uh to the chips like we
 

465
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,310
exposure to uh to the chips like we
always talk about no exposure to chip

466
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
always talk about no exposure to chip
 

467
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:02,230
always talk about no exposure to chip
names right let's pull this down

468
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240

 

469
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,150

hopefully I haven't lost everything else

470
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
hopefully I haven't lost everything else
 

471
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,150
hopefully I haven't lost everything else
let's share this stream quickly how long

472
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
let's share this stream quickly how long
 

473
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:20,310
let's share this stream quickly how long
we've got one minute left.

474
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320

 

475
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,949

Sorry folks, it's a pain. I don't know

476
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
Sorry folks, it's a pain. I don't know
 

477
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,670
Sorry folks, it's a pain. I don't know
if any of you have this when

478
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
if any of you have this when
 

479
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,710
if any of you have this when
your PC just restarts

480
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
your PC just restarts
 

481
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,310
your PC just restarts
and closes everything down without

482
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
and closes everything down without
 

483
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,629
and closes everything down without
saving. It's uh it's got to be the most

484
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
saving. It's uh it's got to be the most
 

485
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,430
saving. It's uh it's got to be the most
annoying thing about PCs.

486
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
annoying thing about PCs.
 

487
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,629
annoying thing about PCs.
Okay, so let's have a look. Not yet at

488
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
Okay, so let's have a look. Not yet at
 

489
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,150
Okay, so let's have a look. Not yet at
previous day value high. We want to be

490
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
previous day value high. We want to be
 

491
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,350
previous day value high. We want to be
careful around here. Remember, we found

492
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
careful around here. Remember, we found
 

493
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,310
careful around here. Remember, we found
a bid all week around these 600s. We've

494
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
a bid all week around these 600s. We've
 

495
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,030
a bid all week around these 600s. We've
reclaimed point of control.

496
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
reclaimed point of control.
 

497
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,030
reclaimed point of control.
So, we want to be somewhat cautious. I

498
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
So, we want to be somewhat cautious. I
 

499
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,550
So, we want to be somewhat cautious. I

This level here was where we found a bid
 

561
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,110
This level here was where we found a bid
all week long. Uh we did it the same

all week long. Uh we did it the same
 

563
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,629
all week long. Uh we did it the same
yesterday as well, but if they don't

still inside value, so I want to be

Give this a chance to settle down.

582
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000

 

583
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,910

Right. All of magn now red other than

This thing looks heavy but uh who knows?

588
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
This thing looks heavy but uh who knows?
 

589
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,230
This thing looks heavy but uh who knows?
We are at that key level but wouldn't

590
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
We are at that key level but wouldn't
 

591
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,470
We are at that key level but wouldn't
surprise me if they puke this under be

592
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
surprise me if they puke this under be
 

593
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,310
surprise me if they puke this under be
right down to previous week value area

594
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
right down to previous week value area
 

595
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,870
right down to previous week value area
low. So small snapshot is possible here.

596
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
low. So small snapshot is possible here.
 

597
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,710
low. So small snapshot is possible here.
It would just be a continuation if you

598
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
It would just be a continuation if you
 

599
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,389
It would just be a continuation if you
take it. It's beyond my uh parameters.

600
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
take it. It's beyond my uh parameters.
 

601
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,230
take it. It's beyond my uh parameters.
But if we do lose this, I wouldn't be

602
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
But if we do lose this, I wouldn't be
 

603
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,749
But if we do lose this, I wouldn't be
surprised for them to retest this level

604
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
surprised for them to retest this level
 

605
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,550
surprised for them to retest this level
here. They do lose this. The problem is

606
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
here. They do lose this. The problem is
 

607
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,910
here. They do lose this. The problem is
this is all in one candle and they can

608
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
this is all in one candle and they can
 

609
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,350
this is all in one candle and they can
squeeze straight back up here. And this

610
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
squeeze straight back up here. And this
 

611
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,470
squeeze straight back up here. And this
is what they've been doing all week

612
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
is what they've been doing all week
 

613
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,949
is what they've been doing all week
long. I'm just going to personally I'm

614
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
long. I'm just going to personally I'm
 

615
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,870
long. I'm just going to personally I'm
going to let this settle down for 5 to

616
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
going to let this settle down for 5 to
 

617
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,269
going to let this settle down for 5 to
15 minutes because we've had huge moves

618
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
15 minutes because we've had huge moves
 

619
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,509
15 minutes because we've had huge moves
overnight

620
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
overnight
 

621
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,030
overnight
and I want to see where the liquidity

622
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
and I want to see where the liquidity
 

623
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:12,150
and I want to see where the liquidity
comes in in the New York session.

624
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160

 

625
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,829

So holding previous week point control

626
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
So holding previous week point control
 

627
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,909
So holding previous week point control
the same level that they held all week

628
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
the same level that they held all week
 

629
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,750
the same level that they held all week
but we have lost current week's point of

630
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
but we have lost current week's point of
 

631
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,309
but we have lost current week's point of
control. We're finding a bid of current

632
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
control. We're finding a bid of current
 

633
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,189
control. We're finding a bid of current
weeks value area low right now which is

634
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
weeks value area low right now which is
 

635
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,870
weeks value area low right now which is
also previous week point control. So

636
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
also previous week point control. So
 

637
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,270
also previous week point control. So
it's very very tight around here. buyers

638
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
it's very very tight around here. buyers
 

639
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,029
it's very very tight around here. buyers

641
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,630
did just got get caught there trying to
bid above 600 or 609 again. I want to

642
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
bid above 600 or 609 again. I want to
 

643
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,270

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
let this settle down. I don't think
 

645
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,630
let this settle down. I don't think
people will be too sure what to do with

646
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
people will be too sure what to do with
 

647
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,230
people will be too sure what to do with
this. I think the market's in fear. Um

648
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
this. I think the market's in fear. Um
 

649
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,549
this. I think the market's in fear. Um

662
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
don't know if anyone watched it. I felt
 

663
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,549
don't know if anyone watched it. I felt
like he looked very upset and very

664
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
like he looked very upset and very
 

665
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,549

uncomfortable. The fact of the matter
 

667
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,270
uncomfortable. The fact of the matter
is, uh, the jobs market is bad and

668
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
is, uh, the jobs market is bad and
 

669
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,950
is, uh, the jobs market is bad and
that's going to cause a major problem

670
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
that's going to cause a major problem
 

671
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,789
that's going to cause a major problem
for him. So, you've got no one in jobs.

672
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
for him. So, you've got no one in jobs.
 

673
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,230
for him. So, you've got no one in jobs.
People in jobs are trying to stay in

674
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
People in jobs are trying to stay in
 

675
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,669
People in jobs are trying to stay in
their jobs. No one's moving jobs.

676
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679

There's no job creation. He blamed that

678
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
There's no job creation. He blamed that
 

679
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,710
There's no job creation. He blamed that
a lot of that on AI. And then for the

680
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
a lot of that on AI. And then for the
 

681
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,070
a lot of that on AI. And then for the
first time, he started talking about the

682
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
first time, he started talking about the
 

683
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,150
first time, he started talking about the
tariffs calling causing inflation, which

684
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
tariffs calling causing inflation, which
 

685
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,990
tariffs calling causing inflation, which
is everyone said that doesn't happen.

686
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000

Well, it does. And um, inflation's been
steady. Right back to VWAP. Back under

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
steady. Right back to VWAP. Back under
 

691
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,470
steady. Right back to VWAP. Back under
current value area low. Back under

692
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
current value area low. Back under
 

693
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,789
current value area low. Back under
current week value area low. The next

694
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
current week value area low. The next
 

695
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,549
current week value area low. The next
level underneath you is previous day

696
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
level underneath you is previous day
 

697
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,470
level underneath you is previous day
value area low. Under that we found a

698
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
value area low. Under that we found a
 

699
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,830
value area low. Under that we found a
bid. Oh, we found a bid in GlobeEx from

700
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
bid. Oh, we found a bid in GlobeEx from
 

701

703
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,070
five. You want to watch 550 to 470.
That's where they found a bid. If

704
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
That's where they found a bid. If
 

705
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,190
That's where they found a bid. If
they're going to do a higher low,

706
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
they're going to do a higher low,
 

707
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,470
they're going to do a higher low,
they're going to need to hold that. If

708
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
they're going to need to hold that. If
 

709
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,830
they're going to need to hold that. If
they don't hold that, we're going right

710
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
they don't hold that, we're going right
 

711
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,270
they don't hold that, we're going right
the way back down to the lows. And we've

712
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
the way back down to the lows. And we've
 

713
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,510
the way back down to the lows. And we've
got an old naked point of control much,

714
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
got an old naked point of control much,
 

715
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,710
got an old naked point of control much,
much lower that I've been talking about

716
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
much lower that I've been talking about
 

717
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,029
much lower that I've been talking about
for a while.

718
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039

731
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,390
watching that very, very carefully
as an overunder.

732
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400

 

733
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,310

It's under it right now, but it's a huge

It's under it right now, but it's a huge
 

735
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,150
It's under it right now, but it's a huge
level. Let me mark this on. It's lost

736
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
level. Let me mark this on. It's lost
 

737
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,350
level. Let me mark this on. It's lost
that as well. Jeez Louise, what a pain.

742
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
back down to previous day value area
 

743
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,830
back down to previous day value area
low. If we start losing this, then we've

744
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
low. If we start losing this, then we've
 

745
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,750
low. If we start losing this, then we've
got previous day lows we can come for.

746
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
got previous day lows we can come for.
 

747
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,510
got previous day lows we can come for.
this. We're still in a range. Every time

748
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
this. We're still in a range. Every time
 

749
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,510
this. We're still in a range. Every time
we've done this in New York session

750
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
we've done this in New York session
 

751
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,870
we've done this in New York session
before, we've drifted straight back

752
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
before, we've drifted straight back
 

753
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,549
before, we've drifted straight back
upside. This is why I'm being very, very

754
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
upside. This is why I'm being very, very
 

755
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,549
upside. This is why I'm being very, very
cautious cuz I don't think this market

756
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
cautious cuz I don't think this market
 

757
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,070
cautious cuz I don't think this market
is really too sure what to do. We've got

758
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
is really too sure what to do. We've got
 

759
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,750
is really too sure what to do. We've got
a fail break at the high, fail break at

760
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
a fail break at the high, fail break at
 

761
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,510
a fail break at the high, fail break at
the low. If we're going to put in a

762
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
the low. If we're going to put in a
 

763
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,950
the low. If we're going to put in a
higher low on like an hourly, now is the

764
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
higher low on like an hourly, now is the
 

765
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,390
higher low on like an hourly, now is the
time to do it. All right, if we think

766
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
time to do it. All right, if we think
 

767
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,789
time to do it. All right, if we think
about this, if this market is adamant

768
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
about this, if this market is adamant
 

769
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,270
about this, if this market is adamant
and pushing up, all right, then this is

770
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
and pushing up, all right, then this is
 

771
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,350
and pushing up, all right, then this is
the area where shorts got stuck. This is

772
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
the area where shorts got stuck. This is
 

773
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,630
the area where shorts got stuck. This is
the area that they would need to

774
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,640
the area that they would need to
 

775
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,230
the area that they would need to
protect. This is your value from

776
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
protect. This is your value from
 

777

protect. This is your value from
yesterday. So look below here, fail

778
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
yesterday. So look below here, fail
 

779
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,390
yesterday. So look below here, fail
reclaim can allow this move. Uh if we go

780
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
reclaim can allow this move. Uh if we go
 

781
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,390
reclaim can allow this move. Uh if we go
into here, I would say that's very very

782
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
into here, I would say that's very very
 

783
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,710
into here, I would say that's very very
bearish because we're building liquidity

784
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
bearish because we're building liquidity
 

785

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
players make the decision on what they
 

797

players make the decision on what they
want to do.

798
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
want to do.
 

799
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,110
want to do.

going to print and they actually think
 

809
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,029
going to print and they actually think
it's quantitive easing, then you know

this is what we're going to do. When we
 

827
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,110
this is what we're going to do. When we
failed both sides of the range, it's

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
failed both sides of the range, it's

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,110
failed both sides of the range, it's
ugly.

830
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
ugly.

All right. And when Very dangerous,

852
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
All right. And when Very dangerous,
 

853
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,630
All right. And when Very dangerous,
they're tank it when he's done. All

854
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
they're tank it when he's done. All
 

855
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,470
they're tank it when he's done. All
right. So, this was all before it

856
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
right. So, this was all before it
 

857
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,909
right. So, this was all before it
happening. We were long all the way up

858
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
happening. We were long all the way up
 

859
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,750
happening. We were long all the way up
to that point up to previous week value

860
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
to that point up to previous week value
 

861
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,669
to that point up to previous week value
area high. Right. We just play momentum

862
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
area high. Right. We just play momentum
 

863
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,310
area high. Right. We just play momentum
longs all the way up. And then my call

864
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
longs all the way up. And then my call
 

865
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,549
longs all the way up. And then my call
for overnight was one of two things to

866
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
for overnight was one of two things to
 

867
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,310
for overnight was one of two things to
happen. All right, here we go. And we

868
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
happen. All right, here we go. And we
 

869
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,789
happen. All right, here we go. And we
did it. All right. So, either of those

870
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
did it. All right. So, either of those
 

871
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,909
did it. All right. So, either of those
things. I would have preferred they were

872
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
things. I would have preferred they were
 

873
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,590
things. I would have preferred they were
bullish, but we've we've done the wash

874
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
bullish, but we've we've done the wash
 

875
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,029
bullish, but we've we've done the wash
and now we've reclaimed that level. So,

876
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
and now we've reclaimed that level. So,
 

877
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,870
and now we've reclaimed that level. So,
we need to be careful. Now, this is why

878
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
we need to be careful. Now, this is why
 

879
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,470
we need to be careful. Now, this is why
it's important to just wait. Sometimes

880
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
it's important to just wait. Sometimes
 

881
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,909
it's important to just wait. Sometimes
you just got to know when it's a waiting

882
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
you just got to know when it's a waiting
 

883
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,630
you just got to know when it's a waiting
game. At the moment, unfortunately,

884
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
game. At the moment, unfortunately,
 

885
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:20,390
game. At the moment, unfortunately,
it's now a waiting game.

886
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400

 

887
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,870

So, sellers keep coming in under 590.

888
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880
So, sellers keep coming in under 590.
 

889
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,110
So, sellers keep coming in under 590.
Buyers keep coming in over 590. And we

890
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
Buyers keep coming in over 590. And we
 

891
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,630
Buyers keep coming in over 590. And we
are not moving.

892
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640

 

893
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,750

Just lost my cumulative delta as well.

894
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760
Just lost my cumulative delta as well.
 

895
00:22:33,760 --> 00:23:00,470
Just lost my cumulative delta as well.
Gosh, back on.

896
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480

 

897
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,390

Let me save this before it loses

898
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
Let me save this before it loses
 

899
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,470
Let me save this before it loses
everything.

900
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
everything.
 

901
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,390
everything.
There we go.

902
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,400
There we go.
 

903
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,710
There we go.
Okay. All right. So, holding previous

904
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
Okay. All right. So, holding previous
 

905
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,510
Okay. All right. So, holding previous
days value, reclaiming previous week's

906
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
days value, reclaiming previous week's
 

907
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,230
days value, reclaiming previous week's
value, holding current week's value. Uh,

908
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240
value, holding current week's value. Uh,
 

909
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,149
value, holding current week's value. Uh,
next move will be up to previous day and

current week's uh point of control,
 

913
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,990
current week's uh point of control,
which would be 634. That's the most

914
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000
which would be 634. That's the most
 

915
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,630
which would be 634. That's the most
traded level so far. In that last drive

916
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
traded level so far. In that last drive
 

917
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,230
traded level so far. In that last drive
up, we did just trap a load of bulls up

up, we did just trap a load of bulls up
 

919
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,789
up, we did just trap a load of bulls up

1009
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,029
What are we doing market? Can you make
your mind up?

1010

1011
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,549

Is there any follow-through downside?

1012
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
Is there any follow-through downside?
 

1013
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,230
Is there any follow-through downside?
They've got the opportunity because

1014
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
They've got the opportunity because
 

1015
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,470
They've got the opportunity because
they've got buyers caught above and

1016
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,480
they've got buyers caught above and
 

1017
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,070
they've got buyers caught above and
definitely above point of control. So

1018
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
definitely above point of control. So
 

1019
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,750
definitely above point of control. So
sellers are attempting to take control

1020
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:27,760
sellers are attempting to take control
 

1021
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,510
sellers are attempting to take control
of this market here for a breakdown. I

1022
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
of this market here for a breakdown. I
 

1023
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,149
of this market here for a breakdown. I
can see it in the tape starting. So I

1024
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
can see it in the tape starting. So I
 

1025
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,830
can see it in the tape starting. So I
want to just see if we get underneath

1026
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
want to just see if we get underneath
 

1027
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,070
want to just see if we get underneath
that value.

1028
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
that value.
 

1029
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,390
that value.
How do we act?

1030
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
How do we act?
 

1031
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,390
How do we act?
Do we get underneath this value? Is this

1032
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400
Do we get underneath this value? Is this
 

1033
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,190
Do we get underneath this value? Is this
a snap? So in here on the tape, buyers

1034
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
a snap? So in here on the tape, buyers
 

1035
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,430
a snap? So in here on the tape, buyers
have come in numerous times, aggressive

1036
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
have come in numerous times, aggressive
 

1037
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,789
have come in numerous times, aggressive
buyers, market buyers, and we've not

1038
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
buyers, market buyers, and we've not
 

1039
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,070
buyers, market buyers, and we've not
gone higher. There's passive selling

1040
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
gone higher. There's passive selling
 

1041
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,909
gone higher. There's passive selling
happening here. We're not breaking

1042
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
happening here. We're not breaking
 

1043
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,350
happening here. We're not breaking
outside of value. I'm trying to be

1044
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
outside of value. I'm trying to be
 

1045
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,390
outside of value. I'm trying to be
patient because I don't want to get

1046
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
patient because I don't want to get
 

1047
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,470
patient because I don't want to get
caught. If we break outside of value,

1048
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
caught. If we break outside of value,
 

1049
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,390
caught. If we break outside of value,
I'll consider this here for a move to

1050
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
I'll consider this here for a move to
 

1051
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,549
I'll consider this here for a move to
previous day low and previous week value

1052
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
previous day low and previous week value
 

1053
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,710
previous day low and previous week value
low. I want to be careful of that move

1054
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
low. I want to be careful of that move
 

1055
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,870
low. I want to be careful of that move
there.

1056
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880

 

1057
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,789

the end of this auction, we did get a

1058
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
the end of this auction, we did get a
 

1059
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,029
the end of this auction, we did get a
seller slightly offside at 65. So, we're

1060
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
seller slightly offside at 65. So, we're
 

1061
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,230
seller slightly offside at 65. So, we're
going to have to trade under him.

1062
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
going to have to trade under him.
 

1063
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,669
going to have to trade under him.

1066
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:17,039
of the market's still selling. And bid
 

1067
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,510
of the market's still selling. And bid
now 3% down.

1068
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520

00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
Trapped bar at 620. Yeah, I'd say
 

1073
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,390
Trapped bar at 620. Yeah, I'd say
actually everyone over 606 is trapped.

1074
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,400
actually everyone over 606 is trapped.
 

1075
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,549
actually everyone over 606 is trapped.
Everyone over 606 is trapped. So, if you

1076
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
Everyone over 606 is trapped. So, if you
 

1077
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,590
Everyone over 606 is trapped. So, if you
look at uh

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,070

Right. Look at all this buying.

1092
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080

 

1093
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,510

If we go to a one minute, you'll see it

1094
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
If we go to a one minute, you'll see it
 

1095
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,430
If we go to a one minute, you'll see it
really clear. All these guys over here

1096
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
really clear. All these guys over here
 

1097
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,430
really clear. All these guys over here
trapped. Here comes a sell. All right.

1098
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
trapped. Here comes a sell. All right.
 

1099
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,909
trapped. Here comes a sell. All right.
So, here's previous day value area low.

1100
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
So, here's previous day value area low.
 

1101
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,549
So, here's previous day value area low.
Important. What happens now?

1102
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559
Important. What happens now?
 

1103
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,310
Important. What happens now?
So, they saved it again. So, shorts have

1104
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,320
So, they saved it again. So, shorts have
 

1105
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,510
So, they saved it again. So, shorts have
come flying in there trying to get the

1106
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
come flying in there trying to get the
 

1107
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,110
come flying in there trying to get the
breakdown. So, why I'm waiting for

1108
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
breakdown. So, why I'm waiting for
 

1109
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,110
breakdown. So, why I'm waiting for
confirmation. I want to see us go under

1110
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
confirmation. I want to see us go under
 

1111
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,590
confirmation. I want to see us go under
it and hold under it. So, there's a

1112
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
it and hold under it. So, there's a
 

1113
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,750
it and hold under it. So, there's a
passive buyer sat a previous day value

1114
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:27,760
passive buyer sat a previous day value
 

1115
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,230
passive buyer sat a previous day value
low. There's a passive seller sat at 610

1116
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
low. There's a passive seller sat at 610
 

1117
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,230
low. There's a passive seller sat at 610
and above. That's your range right now.

1118
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
and above. That's your range right now.
 

1119
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,269
and above. That's your range right now.
So 560 to 610. Look at that. Say this is

1120
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
So 560 to 610. Look at that. Say this is
 

1121
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:54,230
So 560 to 610. Look at that. Say this is
why we wait. Exactly why we wait.

1122
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240

 

1123
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,909

Range actually not too big. Still only

1124
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
Range actually not too big. Still only
 

1125
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,269
Range actually not too big. Still only
94 points. just going back and forth.

1126
00:27:59,269 --> 00:27:59,279
94 points. just going back and forth.
 

1127
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:07,669
94 points. just going back and forth.
Microsoft has caught a bid.

1132
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,200

1138
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520

trapped, are they? Cuz we can still
 

1253
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,110
trapped, are they? Cuz we can still
break down here and make a new low. If

1254
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,120
break down here and make a new low. If
 

1255
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,669
break down here and make a new low. If
we move over it, then yes. But

1256

You when you're calling levels, you

1266
00:31:59,750 --> 00:31:59,760
You when you're calling levels, you
 

1267
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,110
You when you're calling levels, you
better understand if we're above it or

1268
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,120
better understand if we're above it or
 

1269
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,870
better understand if we're above it or

There's a big difference, right? So, I'm
 

1289
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,070
There's a big difference, right? So, I'm
going to leave value. So, this short

1290
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
going to leave value. So, this short
 

1291
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,389

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:13,910
Okay, so I'm down to tiny tiny tiny tiny
size. I want to still risk 27s here.

1406
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:13,920

 

1407
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,750

Sellers come in at around 25. So he's

1408
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
Sellers come in at around 25. So he's
 

1409
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,430
Sellers come in at around 25. So he's
looking at the same level of me. Sort of

1410
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
looking at the same level of me. Sort of
 

1411
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,310
looking at the same level of me. Sort of
27ish.

1412
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,320

 

1413
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,230

He's moved down. He's Oh, he's jostling

1414
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,240
He's moved down. He's Oh, he's jostling
 

1415
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,109
He's moved down. He's Oh, he's jostling
down now. Okay, let's see.

1416
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
down now. Okay, let's see.
 

1417
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,630
down now. Okay, let's see.
Down to tiny size here. If we get

1418
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
Down to tiny size here. If we get
 

1419
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,470
Down to tiny size here. If we get
expansion lower, great. But uh this has

1420
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
expansion lower, great. But uh this has
 

1421
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,390
expansion lower, great. But uh this has
been a big move. expecting some little

1422
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,400
been a big move. expecting some little
 

1423
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,550
been a big move. expecting some little
push back and then a roll over for a

1424
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
push back and then a roll over for a
 

1425
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,670
push back and then a roll over for a
retest and then if we're going to come

1426
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
retest and then if we're going to come
 

1427
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,069
retest and then if we're going to come
into GlobeEx all the way down here.

1428
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
into GlobeEx all the way down here.
 

1429
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,670
into GlobeEx all the way down here.
Market's really really rolling now.

1430
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:39,680
Market's really really rolling now.
 

1431
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,750
Market's really really rolling now.
Starting to get aggressive, but I don't

1432
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:41,760
Starting to get aggressive, but I don't
 

1433
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,150
Starting to get aggressive, but I don't
don't want to add any size down here.

1434
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
don't want to add any size down here.
 

1435
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,030
don't want to add any size down here.
I'm down to tiny tiny micros here. So, I

1436
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
I'm down to tiny tiny micros here. So, I
 

1437
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,630
I'm down to tiny tiny micros here. So, I
need a push back up for me to get

1438
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
need a push back up for me to get
 

1439
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,550
need a push back up for me to get
involved with any more size. But we've

1440
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:50,560
involved with any more size. But we've
 

1441
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,230
involved with any more size. But we've
hit most of the targets. Previous week

1442
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,240
hit most of the targets. Previous week
 

1443
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,390
hit most of the targets. Previous week
value low now being taken. If we're

1444
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
value low now being taken. If we're
 

1445
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,990
value low now being taken. If we're
going to expand underneath previous week

1446
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,000
going to expand underneath previous week
 

1447
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,069
going to expand underneath previous week
value low, I can think about that naked

1448
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
value low, I can think about that naked
 

1449
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,589
value low, I can think about that naked
point of control that I've been banging

1450
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
point of control that I've been banging
 

1451
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,109
point of control that I've been banging
on about. So 25200s I think it was and

1452
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:03,119
on about. So 25200s I think it was and
 

1453
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,190
on about. So 25200s I think it was and
24900s. 25200s 24 900s. Globeex is 2580s

1454
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200
24900s. 25200s 24 900s. Globeex is 2580s
 

1455
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,150
24900s. 25200s 24 900s. Globeex is 2580s
down here. Okay, here's the move back

1456
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,160
down here. Okay, here's the move back
 

1457
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,750
down here. Okay, here's the move back
upside. So I'm watching here to see how

1458
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
upside. So I'm watching here to see how
 

1459
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,829
upside. So I'm watching here to see how
we act at 25, not just cuz it's previous

1460
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
we act at 25, not just cuz it's previous
 

1461
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:16,870
we act at 25, not just cuz it's previous
day low because this is where some

1462
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:16,880
day low because this is where some
 

1463
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,150
day low because this is where some
buyers came in and got themselves

1464
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,160
buyers came in and got themselves
 

1465
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,750
buyers came in and got themselves
caught.

1466
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
caught.
 

1467
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,270
caught.
So we're holding previous week's value

1468
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
So we're holding previous week's value
 

1469
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,230
So we're holding previous week's value
at the moment.

1470
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,240

 

1471
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,589

Big buyers coming in here getting

1472
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:29,599
Big buyers coming in here getting
 

1473
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,270
Big buyers coming in here getting
themselves caught again. Can they get

1474
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,280
themselves caught again. Can they get
 

1475
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,829
themselves caught again. Can they get
one more lift higher? Don't really want

1476
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:33,839
one more lift higher? Don't really want
 

1477
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,990
one more lift higher? Don't really want
to add here. Market's losing every level

1478
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
to add here. Market's losing every level
 

1479
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,910
to add here. Market's losing every level
though.

1480
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
though.
 

1481
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,349
though.
You really got to get higher for me to

1482
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:39,359
You really got to get higher for me to
 

1483
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,270
You really got to get higher for me to
be interested

1484
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
be interested
 

1485
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:55,430
be interested
and then add

1486
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440

 

1487
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,510

So back to yeah. So there you go.

1488
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:57,520
So back to yeah. So there you go.
 

1489
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,030
So back to yeah. So there you go.
Holding previous week's value. So I'd

1490
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
Holding previous week's value. So I'd
 

1491
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,109
Holding previous week's value. So I'd
say all the way up to 26 is possible for

1492
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
say all the way up to 26 is possible for
 

1493
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,190
say all the way up to 26 is possible for
relief and then how they at there will

1494
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,200
relief and then how they at there will
 

1495
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:19,109
relief and then how they at there will
become key.

1496
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:19,119

 

1497
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,870

So they hold value again. Here is the

1498
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:20,880
So they hold value again. Here is the
 

1499
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,270
So they hold value again. Here is the
question. If not, we're going to snap.

1500
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,280
question. If not, we're going to snap.
 

1501
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,710
question. If not, we're going to snap.
Here's previous week value area low

1502
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:24,720
Here's previous week value area low
 

1503
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,950
Here's previous week value area low
being tested again. The weekly buyers

1504
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:26,960
being tested again. The weekly buyers
 

1505
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,349
being tested again. The weekly buyers
are trying to hold this here.

1506
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:33,359

 

1507
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,230

Please come a bit higher first.

1508
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,240
Please come a bit higher first.
 

1509
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,829
Please come a bit higher first.
Push was a bit weak into that whole

1510
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
Push was a bit weak into that whole
 

1511
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:48,230
Push was a bit weak into that whole
number.

1512
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240

 

1513
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,750

Love to get a bit more size on. Don't

1514
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:49,760
Love to get a bit more size on. Don't
 

1515
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,790
Love to get a bit more size on. Don't
think you're going to let me. Are you?

1516
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
think you're going to let me. Are you?
 

1517
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,310
think you're going to let me. Are you?
These bids stacking up here at 50s. I

1518
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,320
These bids stacking up here at 50s. I
 

1519
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,349
These bids stacking up here at 50s. I
just think they're just going to snap

1520
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:53,359
just think they're just going to snap
 

1521
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,349
just think they're just going to snap
and wipe them.

1522
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359

 

1523
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:07,270

There's the flush.

1524
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280

 

1525
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,670

Careful here now. There's a bit of a

1526
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:09,680
Careful here now. There's a bit of a
 

1527
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,950
Careful here now. There's a bit of a
battle here, but we are outside of

1528
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
battle here, but we are outside of
 

1529
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,710
battle here, but we are outside of
previous week's value. I think we still

1530
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:12,720
previous week's value. I think we still
 

1531
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,950
previous week's value. I think we still
move lower now again back to GlobeEx low

1532
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
move lower now again back to GlobeEx low
 

1533
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,750
move lower now again back to GlobeEx low
by the looks of it. Here we go. There's

1534
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:17,760
by the looks of it. Here we go. There's
 

1535
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,670
by the looks of it. Here we go. There's
an imbalance here, by the way, 440 to

1536
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:19,680
an imbalance here, by the way, 440 to
 

1537
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,430
an imbalance here, by the way, 440 to
420. to be aware of that if you're still

1538
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
420. to be aware of that if you're still
 

1539
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,829
420. to be aware of that if you're still
in

1540
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:23,839
in
 

1541
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,270
in
really starting to sell. Really nice

1542
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,280
really starting to sell. Really nice
 

1543
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,829
really starting to sell. Really nice
sell now outside of value. It's

1544
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:27,839
sell now outside of value. It's
 

1545
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,349
sell now outside of value. It's
important that first five 10 minutes,

1546
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359
important that first five 10 minutes,
 

1547
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,030
important that first five 10 minutes,
whatever it was, to let those players

1548
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,040
whatever it was, to let those players
 

1549
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,710
whatever it was, to let those players
make their minds up, not join in until

1550
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
make their minds up, not join in until
 

1551
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:40,710
make their minds up, not join in until
we got outside of the value area.

1552
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:40,720

 

1553
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,390

I'm just a bit annoyed that we didn't

1554
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
I'm just a bit annoyed that we didn't
 

1555
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,990
I'm just a bit annoyed that we didn't
get a bit further up for a retest up

1556
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,000
get a bit further up for a retest up
 

1557
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,510
get a bit further up for a retest up
here. It's what I would have really

1558
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:45,520
here. It's what I would have really
 

1559
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,430
here. It's what I would have really
liked to have seen to resize into it,

1560
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:47,440
liked to have seen to resize into it,
 

1561
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,750
liked to have seen to resize into it,
but uh it is what it is. It's going to

1562
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:49,760
but uh it is what it is. It's going to
 

1563
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,310
but uh it is what it is. It's going to
be a a smaller win. Would have liked to

1564
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
be a a smaller win. Would have liked to
 

1565
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,910
be a a smaller win. Would have liked to
have been um huge win. I never really

1566
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
have been um huge win. I never really
 

1567
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,030
have been um huge win. I never really
sized in.

1568
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040

 

1569
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,589

Don't chase. By the way, folks, if if

1570
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
Don't chase. By the way, folks, if if
 

1571
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,510
Don't chase. By the way, folks, if if
you didn't take the uh breakdown of

1572
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:05,520
you didn't take the uh breakdown of
 

1573
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,030
you didn't take the uh breakdown of
value here, which we kept talking about,

1574
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,040
value here, which we kept talking about,
 

1575
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,829
value here, which we kept talking about,
we need to see

1576
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:09,839
we need to see
 

1577
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,589
we need to see
the move outside. I drew it for you

1578
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:11,599
the move outside. I drew it for you
 

1579
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,829
the move outside. I drew it for you
enough times here. Anywhere here, you

1580
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:13,839
enough times here. Anywhere here, you
 

1581
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,109
enough times here. Anywhere here, you
can join TP1, TP2. I'm now looking for

1582
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:17,119
can join TP1, TP2. I'm now looking for
 

1583
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,109
can join TP1, TP2. I'm now looking for
this. And really this and really

1584
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
this. And really this and really
 

1585
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,190
this. And really this and really
this. And where's the other green level?

1586
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,200
this. And where's the other green level?
 

1587
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,589
this. And where's the other green level?
Or maybe that's it. Nine. Where's that

1588
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:25,599
Or maybe that's it. Nine. Where's that
 

1589
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,910
Or maybe that's it. Nine. Where's that
naked point of control? Yeah, that level

1590
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:27,920
naked point of control? Yeah, that level
 

1591
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,150
naked point of control? Yeah, that level
here. 950 I think is doable. It's a

1592
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,160
here. 950 I think is doable. It's a
 

1593
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,510
here. 950 I think is doable. It's a
naked point of control on a weekly,

1594
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:31,520
naked point of control on a weekly,
 

1595
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,910
naked point of control on a weekly,
which we've never gone back to if we

1596
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:33,920
which we've never gone back to if we
 

1597
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,349
which we've never gone back to if we
really sell. Doesn't have to be today,

1598
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:37,359
really sell. Doesn't have to be today,
 

1599
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,310
really sell. Doesn't have to be today,
but I think 950 is possible.

1600
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,320
but I think 950 is possible.
 

1601
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,230
but I think 950 is possible.
Doesn't have to be today. Can be

1602
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
Doesn't have to be today. Can be
 

1603
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,190
Doesn't have to be today. Can be
tomorrow, next week.

1604
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
tomorrow, next week.
 

1605
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,589
tomorrow, next week.
But yeah, no reason to fully cover yet.

1606
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:49,599

 

1607
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,270

Still, still we drop. Right, this is the

1608
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,280
Still, still we drop. Right, this is the
 

1609
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,270
Still, still we drop. Right, this is the
imbalance from last night down into 20

1610
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280
imbalance from last night down into 20
 

1611
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,990
imbalance from last night down into 20
that I talked about. There's a a buy

1612
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,000
that I talked about. There's a a buy
 

1613
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,430
that I talked about. There's a a buy
side imbalance here where we found a bid

1614
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
side imbalance here where we found a bid
 

1615
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,790
side imbalance here where we found a bid
last night. So, we're repricing some of

1616
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800
last night. So, we're repricing some of
 

1617
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:07,910
last night. So, we're repricing some of
this. Might see a reaction here.

1618
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920

 

1619
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,670

Where did I enter? I entered once I saw

1620
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:09,680
Where did I enter? I entered once I saw
 

1621
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,950
Where did I enter? I entered once I saw
this break. I was a little bit late,

1622
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:12,960
this break. I was a little bit late,
 

1623
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,470
this break. I was a little bit late,
right? I was watching this. I actually

1624
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
right? I was watching this. I actually
 

1625
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,390
right? I was watching this. I actually
entered about here.

1626
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
entered about here.
 

1627
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,190
entered about here.
Let's have a look. Entry was Yeah. 4550

1628
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,200
Let's have a look. Entry was Yeah. 4550
 

1629
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,150
Let's have a look. Entry was Yeah. 4550
is where I got in.

1630
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
is where I got in.
 

1631
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,829
is where I got in.
I really wanted to retest 26s. So, here

1632
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
I really wanted to retest 26s. So, here
 

1633
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,710
I really wanted to retest 26s. So, here
26es here. We had lots of buyers come

1634
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
26es here. We had lots of buyers come
 

1635
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,790
26es here. We had lots of buyers come
in, fail, and I was hoping this would

1636
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
in, fail, and I was hoping this would
 

1637
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,630
in, fail, and I was hoping this would
come back in and I would just slam these

1638
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:34,640
come back in and I would just slam these
 

1639
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,710
come back in and I would just slam these
guys back down. But, we never got back

1640
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:36,720
guys back down. But, we never got back
 

1641
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,790
guys back down. But, we never got back
to that level. So all I got was this

1642
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:38,800
to that level. So all I got was this
 

1643
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,510
to that level. So all I got was this
original position in

1644
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,520
original position in
 

1645
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,230
original position in
and would really have liked that to come

1646
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
and would really have liked that to come
 

1647
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,670
and would really have liked that to come
a little bit higher and then I could

1648
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
a little bit higher and then I could
 

1649
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,589
a little bit higher and then I could
have used their pain to go lower. But it

1650
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:47,599
have used their pain to go lower. But it
 

1651
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,430
have used their pain to go lower. But it
is what it is. Still a really nice

1652
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
is what it is. Still a really nice
 

1653
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,630
is what it is. Still a really nice
trade. The key was if you like it didn't

1654
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
trade. The key was if you like it didn't
 

1655
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,910
trade. The key was if you like it didn't
tell you it didn't tell I told you

1656
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:53,920
tell you it didn't tell I told you
 

1657
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,430
tell you it didn't tell I told you
numerous times wait for us to move

1658
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
numerous times wait for us to move
 

1659
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,670
numerous times wait for us to move
outside of value and if we stay heavy on

1660
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
outside of value and if we stay heavy on
 

1661
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,390
outside of value and if we stay heavy on
a retest right we need confirmation.

1662
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:00,400
a retest right we need confirmation.
 

1663
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,230
a retest right we need confirmation.
This candle here was it. That was it.

1664
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:02,240
This candle here was it. That was it.
 

1665
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,309
This candle here was it. That was it.
We're moving away now. Right. Really

1666
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:04,319
We're moving away now. Right. Really
 

1667
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,790
We're moving away now. Right. Really
simple. Range created. moving away from

1668
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:06,800
simple. Range created. moving away from
 

1669
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,710
simple. Range created. moving away from
range.

1670
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:08,720
range.
 

1671
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,309
range.
What were the flow zones doing? Sell.

1672
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
What were the flow zones doing? Sell.
 

1673
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,910
What were the flow zones doing? Sell.
We're in a cell. We just had to leave

1674
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
We're in a cell. We just had to leave
 

1675
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,150
We're in a cell. We just had to leave
this range. Once we left that range,

1676
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,160
this range. Once we left that range,
 

1677
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,870
this range. Once we left that range,
this guy right here, everything started

1678
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
this guy right here, everything started
 

1679
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,750
this guy right here, everything started
to play out.

1680
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:19,760
to play out.
 

1681
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,109
to play out.
Still coming low. We're going to we're

1682
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:21,119
Still coming low. We're going to we're
 

1683
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,750
Still coming low. We're going to we're
going to come and take GlobeEx now,

1684
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
going to come and take GlobeEx now,
 

1685
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,910
going to come and take GlobeEx now,
[\h__\h] I mean, it's really good.

1686
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
[\h__\h] I mean, it's really good.
 

1687
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,670
[\h__\h] I mean, it's really good.
Like, I shouldn't be complaining. I just

1688
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
Like, I shouldn't be complaining. I just
 

1689
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:35,349
Like, I shouldn't be complaining. I just
never got the size on I wanted.

1690
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359

 

1691
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,190

Green otter. A friend of mine joined

1692
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,200
Green otter. A friend of mine joined
 

1693
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,550
Green otter. A friend of mine joined
today. They asked if it's always this

1694
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560
today. They asked if it's always this
 

1695
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,990
today. They asked if it's always this
easy. I mean,

1696
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,000
easy. I mean,
 

1697
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,230
easy. I mean,
when we're out of like some of you would

1698
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240
when we're out of like some of you would
 

1699
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,069
when we're out of like some of you would
have been here for weeks, months, some

1700
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079
have been here for weeks, months, some
 

1701
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,550
have been here for weeks, months, some
of you for years. How many times do you

1702
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
of you for years. How many times do you
 

1703
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,550
of you for years. How many times do you
hear me say I'm not interested in

1704
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,560
hear me say I'm not interested in
 

1705
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,390
hear me say I'm not interested in
trading inside range, but when we leave

1706
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,400
trading inside range, but when we leave
 

1707
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,630
trading inside range, but when we leave
range, that's when I'm interested in

1708
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:54,640
range, that's when I'm interested in
 

1709
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,910
range, that's when I'm interested in
trading. Right? So you would have seen

1710
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:55,920
trading. Right? So you would have seen
 

1711
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,670
trading. Right? So you would have seen
it all week just like can't be bothered.

1712
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680
it all week just like can't be bothered.
 

1713
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,950
it all week just like can't be bothered.
Can't be bothered. Can't be bothered.

1714
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:58,960
Can't be bothered. Can't be bothered.
 

1715
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,270
Can't be bothered. Can't be bothered.
We've got to leave leave range. I traded

1716
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,280
We've got to leave leave range. I traded
 

1717
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,630
We've got to leave leave range. I traded
long bias yesterday on FOMC because we

1718
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,640
long bias yesterday on FOMC because we
 

1719
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,470
long bias yesterday on FOMC because we
got above this range. So everyone who

1720
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
got above this range. So everyone who
 

1721
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,069
got above this range. So everyone who
was in Discord with me once there's a

1722
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
was in Discord with me once there's a
 

1723
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,349
was in Discord with me once there's a
range. Once we got above this, we were

1724
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:09,359
range. Once we got above this, we were
 

1725
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,109
range. Once we got above this, we were
long biased to previous week high up

1726
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
long biased to previous week high up
 

1727
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,030
long biased to previous week high up
here. We were probably short biased for

1728
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,040
here. We were probably short biased for
 

1729
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,870
here. We were probably short biased for
a pull back to here. But I did not want

1730
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:14,880
a pull back to here. But I did not want
 

1731
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,230
a pull back to here. But I did not want
to take that. Wanted to take a long from

1732
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,240
to take that. Wanted to take a long from
 

1733
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,670
to take that. Wanted to take a long from
here which never turned out because they

1734
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
here which never turned out because they
 

1735
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,710
here which never turned out because they
sold it. Right? So market's always

1736
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
sold it. Right? So market's always
 

1737
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,950
sold it. Right? So market's always

point. All right. So, if you break I

1796
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
point. All right. So, if you break I
 

1797
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,390
point. All right. So, if you break I
just call it 35. If you break 35, these

1798
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
just call it 35. If you break 35, these

00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:35,599
buys are going to be okay and you might
 

1801
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,950
buys are going to be okay and you might
get a drift. But all the time we're

1802
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:36,960
get a drift. But all the time we're
 

1803
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,510
get a drift. But all the time we're
under 34s, they are in big big trouble

1804
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:39,520
under 34s, they are in big big trouble
 

1805
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,390
under 34s, they are in big big trouble
because they came in with size.

1806
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400

Orange line is your target, right?

1820
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,240
Orange line is your target, right?
 

1821
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,910
Orange line is your target, right?
Orange line is your target. Let me just

1822
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
Orange line is your target. Let me just
 

1823
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,190
Orange line is your target. Let me just
check this uh blue box one and make sure

1824
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
check this uh blue box one and make sure
 

1825
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,670
check this uh blue box one and make sure
I've got it in the right spot.

1826
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680

 

1827
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,109

Okay, there's like a little

1828
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
Okay, there's like a little
 

1829
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,790
Okay, there's like a little
I'll do this so you can see how I do it.

1830
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
I'll do this so you can see how I do it.
 

1831
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,950
I'll do this so you can see how I do it.
I'm watching this here. There's this uh

1832
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
I'm watching this here. There's this uh
 

1833
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,430
I'm watching this here. There's this uh
node above value here. We're thin here

1834
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
node above value here. We're thin here
 

1835
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,349
node above value here. We're thin here
and then we repriced it and we broke out

1836
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:53,359
and then we repriced it and we broke out
 

1837
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,190
and then we repriced it and we broke out
from. So, I'm interested in that. But

1838
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,200
from. So, I'm interested in that. But
 

1839
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,829
from. So, I'm interested in that. But
once we get under that, right, except

1840
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:57,839
once we get under that, right, except
 

1841
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,390
once we get under that, right, except
the the bottom of this blue box will be

1842
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
the the bottom of this blue box will be
 

1843
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,309
the the bottom of this blue box will be
the old value area high. Once we lose

1844
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:02,319
the old value area high. Once we lose
 

1845
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,550
the old value area high. Once we lose
that, then what are we going to do? All

1846
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:04,560
that, then what are we going to do? All
 

1847
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,710
that, then what are we going to do? All
right. If we can't hold above value,

1848
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:06,720
right. If we can't hold above value,
 

1849
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,470
right. If we can't hold above value,
we're going to search for fair value.

1850
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
we're going to search for fair value.
 

1851
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,150
we're going to search for fair value.
Where's fair value? There it is. It's

1852
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,160
Where's fair value? There it is. It's
 

1853
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,589
Where's fair value? There it is. It's
standing out, right? So, if we lose

1854
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
standing out, right? So, if we lose
 

1855
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,510
standing out, right? So, if we lose
this, this is possible. It doesn't have

1856
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
this, this is possible. It doesn't have
 

1857
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,870
this, this is possible. It doesn't have
to do it today. I want to really make

1858
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:14,880
to do it today. I want to really make
 

1859
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,309
to do it today. I want to really make
that clear. This might take a few days

1860
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
that clear. This might take a few days
 

1861
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,470
that clear. This might take a few days
or weeks to happen. But this here is a

1862
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:20,480
or weeks to happen. But this here is a
 

1863
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,150
or weeks to happen. But this here is a
highly probable area for us to trade

1864
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
highly probable area for us to trade
 

1865
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,750
highly probable area for us to trade
into because we've never come back to

1866
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
into because we've never come back to
 

1867
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,470
into because we've never come back to
it. All right? So, that's previous or

1868
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,480
it. All right? So, that's previous or
 

1869
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,870
it. All right? So, that's previous or
many many weeks ago value area high

1870
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
many many weeks ago value area high
 

1871
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,710
many many weeks ago value area high
became a point of control. We've never

1872
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
became a point of control. We've never
 

1873
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,790
became a point of control. We've never
retested it. It's been one, two, three.

1874
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:34,800
retested it. It's been one, two, three.
 

1875
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,710
retested it. It's been one, two, three.
This would be the third week of not ret.

1876
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,720
This would be the third week of not ret.
 

1877
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,309
This would be the third week of not ret.
Well, actually, technically, it's two.

1878
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:38,319
Well, actually, technically, it's two.
 

1879
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,750
Well, actually, technically, it's two.
This would be the second week of not

1880
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:39,760
This would be the second week of not
 

1881
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,670
This would be the second week of not
retesting it. All right. So, I think

1882
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680
retesting it. All right. So, I think
 

1883
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,430
retesting it. All right. So, I think
there's a highly probable chance that we

1884
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:43,440
there's a highly probable chance that we
 

1885
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,950
there's a highly probable chance that we
come down to that. The only other thing

1886
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:44,960
come down to that. The only other thing
 

1887
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,349
come down to that. The only other thing
I want to be considerate of is these

1888
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,359
I want to be considerate of is these
 

1889
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,150
I want to be considerate of is these
daily levels that I keep talking about.

1890
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
daily levels that I keep talking about.
 

1891
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,750
daily levels that I keep talking about.
We do have a bit of a shelf developing

1892
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:51,760
We do have a bit of a shelf developing
 

1893
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,230
We do have a bit of a shelf developing
here. This works. This is the same area,

1894
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
here. This works. This is the same area,
 

1895
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,870
here. This works. This is the same area,
290s. This is your 50-day, 20-day. So,

1896
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:56,880
290s. This is your 50-day, 20-day. So,
 

1897
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,270
290s. This is your 50-day, 20-day. So,
in here, I think there will be a lot of

1898
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
in here, I think there will be a lot of
 

1899
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,670
in here, I think there will be a lot of
bulls waiting. All right. If they're

1900
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:01,680
bulls waiting. All right. If they're
 

1901
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,950
bulls waiting. All right. If they're
going to set a higher low, like I've

1902
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:02,960
going to set a higher low, like I've
 

1903
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,390
going to set a higher low, like I've
talked about for weeks and weeks and

1904
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,400
talked about for weeks and weeks and
 

1905
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,589
talked about for weeks and weeks and
weeks, this is where they need to do it

1906
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:05,599
weeks, this is where they need to do it
 

1907
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,550
weeks, this is where they need to do it
on a daily. If they fail to set a higher

1908
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
on a daily. If they fail to set a higher
 

1909
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,510
on a daily. If they fail to set a higher
low here on a daily, it is night night

1910
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
low here on a daily, it is night night
 

1911
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,109
low here on a daily, it is night night
time. All right? Because this is a

1912
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:13,119
time. All right? Because this is a
 

1913
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,790
time. All right? Because this is a
straight move up. They need to set the

1914
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:14,800
straight move up. They need to set the
 

1915
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,309
straight move up. They need to set the
higher low here on a daily to have a

1916
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:16,319
higher low here on a daily to have a
 

1917
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,230
higher low here on a daily to have a
chance to go back up, which will be

1918
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
chance to go back up, which will be
 

1919
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,510
chance to go back up, which will be
beautiful inverse head and shoulders.

1920
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:19,520
beautiful inverse head and shoulders.
 

1921
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,430
beautiful inverse head and shoulders.
Fail that. Okay. Good night. Good night

1922
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,440
Fail that. Okay. Good night. Good night
 

1923
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,990
Fail that. Okay. Good night. Good night
market. So, I'm willing to play both

1924
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,000
market. So, I'm willing to play both
 

1925
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,430
market. So, I'm willing to play both
ways when we get into that. But that's

1926
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,440
ways when we get into that. But that's
 

1927
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,190
ways when we get into that. But that's
what I'm watching for is what I've been

1928
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
what I'm watching for is what I've been
 

1929
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,069
what I'm watching for is what I've been
watching for for I don't know 2 3 weeks

1930
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:30,079
watching for for I don't know 2 3 weeks
 

1931
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:41,510
watching for for I don't know 2 3 weeks
now.

1932
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520

 

1933
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,190

Lots of buyers coming in down here by

1934
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
Lots of buyers coming in down here by
 

1935
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,950
Lots of buyers coming in down here by
the way folks. Lots and lots and lots of

1936
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:44,960
the way folks. Lots and lots and lots of
 

1937
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,190
the way folks. Lots and lots and lots of
buyers coming in here. They are trying

1938
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200
buyers coming in here. They are trying
 

1939
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,430
buyers coming in here. They are trying
over and over again. Hu like if you look

1940
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
over and over again. Hu like if you look
 

1941
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,750
over and over again. Hu like if you look
at bit maps huge buy. We're not really

1942
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:51,760
at bit maps huge buy. We're not really
 

1943
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,510
at bit maps huge buy. We're not really
moving higher. I would not be short down

1944
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,520
moving higher. I would not be short down
 

1945
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,230
moving higher. I would not be short down
here, right? I still short bias, but you

1946
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:56,240
here, right? I still short bias, but you
 

1947
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,670
here, right? I still short bias, but you
don't want to be a new money short down

1948
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,680
don't want to be a new money short down
 

1949
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,109
don't want to be a new money short down
here. The next new money short really

1950
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
here. The next new money short really
 

1951
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,510
here. The next new money short really
comes if we expand underneath Gloveex,

1952
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:01,520
comes if we expand underneath Gloveex,
 

1953
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,990
comes if we expand underneath Gloveex,
right? So, if we start coming underneath

1954
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
right? So, if we start coming underneath
 

1955
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,309
right? So, if we start coming underneath
here and if we build liquidity here and

1956
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:06,319
here and if we build liquidity here and
 

1957
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,990
here and if we build liquidity here and
we expand underneath and use that

1958
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
we expand underneath and use that
 

1959
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,829
we expand underneath and use that
liquidity to move lower, then you can

1960
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:09,839
liquidity to move lower, then you can
 

1961
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,190
liquidity to move lower, then you can
think about this move. But just think

1962
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
think about this move. But just think
 

1963
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,750
think about this move. But just think
about how violent this move's been down

1964
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:13,760
about how violent this move's been down
 

1965
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,390
about how violent this move's been down
without a repric. We can afford a repric

1966
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
without a repric. We can afford a repric
 

1967
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,069
without a repric. We can afford a repric
maybe into previous week value area low.

1968
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:18,079
maybe into previous week value area low.
 

1969
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,510
maybe into previous week value area low.
Maybe they come back. Are you sure we

1970
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:19,520
Maybe they come back. Are you sure we
 

1971
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,670
Maybe they come back. Are you sure we
don't want to move back into value? No,

1972
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:21,680
don't want to move back into value? No,
 

1973
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,190
don't want to move back into value? No,
we don't want to move back into value.

1974
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,200
we don't want to move back into value.
 

1975
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,790
we don't want to move back into value.
Right? That kind of move there can

1976
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
Right? That kind of move there can
 

1977
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,630
Right? That kind of move there can
easily happen if we get through previous

1978
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:26,640
easily happen if we get through previous
 

1979
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,710
easily happen if we get through previous
week value area low then you know if

1980
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:28,720
week value area low then you know if
 

1981
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,430
week value area low then you know if
they start lifting the offer right if

1982
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:31,440
they start lifting the offer right if
 

1983
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,950
they start lifting the offer right if
there's no sellers hanging out here we

1984
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
there's no sellers hanging out here we
 

1985
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,069
there's no sellers hanging out here we
know where was I waiting 26s

1986
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:36,079
know where was I waiting 26s
 

1987
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,950
know where was I waiting 26s
26s

1988
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:38,960
26s
 

1989
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,390
26s
it was 26s right double check this was

1990
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:42,400
it was 26s right double check this was
 

1991
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,430
it was 26s right double check this was
26s I'd say 26s where are those big

1992
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:45,440
26s I'd say 26s where are those big
 

1993
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,309
26s I'd say 26s where are those big
buyers 63 there's a massive lot got

1994
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:48,319
buyers 63 there's a massive lot got
 

1995
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,150
buyers 63 there's a massive lot got
stuck at 82 so delta big delta up to 82

1996
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,160
stuck at 82 so delta big delta up to 82
 

1997
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,150
stuck at 82 so delta big delta up to 82
so I'd be watching Yeah. Well, it's the

1998
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:54,160
so I'd be watching Yeah. Well, it's the
 

1999
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,870
so I'd be watching Yeah. Well, it's the
same kind of level in and around here.

2000
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
same kind of level in and around here.
 

2001
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,270
same kind of level in and around here.
Do sellers hold this market back down?

2002
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,280
Do sellers hold this market back down?
 

2003
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,990
Do sellers hold this market back down?
Is this a pump which gets resold into in

2004
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,000
Is this a pump which gets resold into in
 

2005
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,030
Is this a pump which gets resold into in
and around 82ish? If they start

2006
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
and around 82ish? If they start
 

2007
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,950
and around 82ish? If they start
reclaiming value, they can come all the

2008
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:06,960
reclaiming value, they can come all the
 

2009
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,550
reclaiming value, they can come all the
way back up to VWOP, can't they? They

2010
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:08,560
way back up to VWOP, can't they? They
 

2011
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,550
way back up to VWOP, can't they? They
failed to take out that. Just want to

2012
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:10,560
failed to take out that. Just want to
 

2013
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,230
failed to take out that. Just want to
make sure.

2014
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:12,240
make sure.
 

2015
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,750
make sure.
Did we take it on the ES? We didn't take

2016
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
Did we take it on the ES? We didn't take
 

2017
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,910
Did we take it on the ES? We didn't take
it on ES either. So, I'd be watching for

2018
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:15,920
it on ES either. So, I'd be watching for
 

2019
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,309
it on ES either. So, I'd be watching for
a reshort around here if you see

2020
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:18,319
a reshort around here if you see
 

2021
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,390
a reshort around here if you see
failure. All right. If they reclaim

2022
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
failure. All right. If they reclaim
 

2023
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,910
failure. All right. If they reclaim
this, you don't want to be short because

2024
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:21,920
this, you don't want to be short because
 

2025
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,349
this, you don't want to be short because
they're going to lift it then and they

2026
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:23,359
they're going to lift it then and they
 

2027
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,150
they're going to lift it then and they
can attack VWAP and previous day low and

2028
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,160
can attack VWAP and previous day low and
 

2029
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,829
can attack VWAP and previous day low and
even previous day value. But I'd be

2030
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:27,839
even previous day value. But I'd be
 

2031
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,230
even previous day value. But I'd be
thinking if we're going to sell, we

2032
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:30,240
thinking if we're going to sell, we
 

2033
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,109
thinking if we're going to sell, we
should sell around here. Big ifs, but if

2034
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:33,119
should sell around here. Big ifs, but if
 

2035
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,190
should sell around here. Big ifs, but if
we're going to sell, this is where we

2036
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,200
we're going to sell, this is where we
 

2037
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,870
we're going to sell, this is where we
should set sell around into sort of the

2038
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:36,880
should set sell around into sort of the
 

2039
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,230
should set sell around into sort of the
80s.

2040
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:42,240

 

2041
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,630

Am I ever looking into session high and

2042
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:44,640
Am I ever looking into session high and
 

2043
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,790
Am I ever looking into session high and
lows? Yes, what this orange line is.

2044
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:46,800
lows? Yes, what this orange line is.
 

2045
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,430
lows? Yes, what this orange line is.
That's your GlobeEx low.

2046
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
That's your GlobeEx low.
 

2047
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,990
That's your GlobeEx low.
Absolutely.

2048
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:52,000
Absolutely.
 

2049
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,349
Absolutely.
Okay. So, here we go. They're going to

2050
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:53,359
Okay. So, here we go. They're going to
 

2051
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,790
Okay. So, here we go. They're going to
lift this into these sort of sort of

2052
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
lift this into these sort of sort of
 

2053
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,710
lift this into these sort of sort of
80s, 70s and 80s, but I would say the

2054
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:56,720
80s, 70s and 80s, but I would say the
 

2055
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,710
80s, 70s and 80s, but I would say the
big delta is stuck at 82. If they get

2056
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,720
big delta is stuck at 82. If they get
 

2057
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,950
big delta is stuck at 82. If they get
above 82, the buyers start to feel

2058
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:00,960
above 82, the buyers start to feel
 

2059
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,270
above 82, the buyers start to feel
comfortable. That's where they're going

2060
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:03,280
comfortable. That's where they're going
 

2061
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,870
comfortable. That's where they're going
to try and lift it up to. Meta and

2062
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:04,880
to try and lift it up to. Meta and
 

2063
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,470
to try and lift it up to. Meta and
Microsoft both gone green. By the way,

2064
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
Microsoft both gone green. By the way,
 

2065
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,150
Microsoft both gone green. By the way,
I'm watching ES as well. It's not too

2066
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160
I'm watching ES as well. It's not too
 

2067
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,829
I'm watching ES as well. It's not too
far away from both of its V VW what? So,

2068
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
far away from both of its V VW what? So,
 

2069
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,750
far away from both of its V VW what? So,
it's almost there. You see the current

2070
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
it's almost there. You see the current
 

2071
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,990
it's almost there. You see the current
high on that push was 63s. I'll be

2072
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,000
high on that push was 63s. I'll be
 

2073
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,030
high on that push was 63s. I'll be
watching 82s. be watching around 82. So,

2074
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,040
watching 82s. be watching around 82. So,
 

2075
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,630
watching 82s. be watching around 82. So,
I'm not like I'm not going to slam this

2076
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:20,640
I'm not like I'm not going to slam this
 

2077
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,150
I'm not like I'm not going to slam this
short as we come into it. We don't know

2078
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,160
short as we come into it. We don't know
 

2079
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,470
short as we come into it. We don't know
if they just lift this whole thing, but

2080
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:24,480
if they just lift this whole thing, but
 

2081
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,549
if they just lift this whole thing, but
if we start to fail and we create a

2082
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:26,559
if we start to fail and we create a
 

2083
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,990
if we start to fail and we create a
lower high and we build out some

2084
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000
lower high and we build out some
 

2085
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,670
lower high and we build out some
liquidity, maybe I'll be interested in

2086
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:29,680
liquidity, maybe I'll be interested in
 

2087
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:37,589
liquidity, maybe I'll be interested in
another trade.

2088
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:37,599

 

2089
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,510

Yeah. Well, I can see that the delta's

2090
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
Yeah. Well, I can see that the delta's
 

2091
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,430
Yeah. Well, I can see that the delta's
gone positive on the last five, one,

2092
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:41,440
gone positive on the last five, one,
 

2093
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,349
gone positive on the last five, one,
two, three, five minute candles, but it

2094
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
two, three, five minute candles, but it
 

2095
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,950
two, three, five minute candles, but it
doesn't mean anything until we reclaim a

2096
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:44,960
doesn't mean anything until we reclaim a
 

2097
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,150
doesn't mean anything until we reclaim a
level. Of course, we're going to go

2098
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
level. Of course, we're going to go
 

2099
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,430
level. Of course, we're going to go
positive. There's lots of buying coming

2100
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:47,440
positive. There's lots of buying coming
 

2101
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,910
positive. There's lots of buying coming
in here, but what really matters is this

2102
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:49,920
in here, but what really matters is this
 

2103
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,030
in here, but what really matters is this
level here that I keep telling you

2104
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
level here that I keep telling you
 

2105
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,109
level here that I keep telling you
about. The delta is stuck 82. Let me

2106
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:55,119
about. The delta is stuck 82. Let me
 

2107
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,630
about. The delta is stuck 82. Let me
show you on bit map. See if you can see

2108
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
show you on bit map. See if you can see
 

2109
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,549
show you on bit map. See if you can see
this. It should stand out here. If I

2110
00:49:58,549 --> 00:49:58,559
this. It should stand out here. If I
 

2111
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,710
this. It should stand out here. If I
come up to 82, where are you

2112
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:02,720
come up to 82, where are you
 

2113
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:11,270
come up to 82, where are you
70?

2114
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:11,280

 

2115
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,710

It's moving so quick. It's going to keep

2116
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:12,720
It's moving so quick. It's going to keep
 

2117
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,309
It's moving so quick. It's going to keep
pulling it away. All right. You see this

2118
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
pulling it away. All right. You see this
 

2119
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,710
pulling it away. All right. You see this
here into

2120
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:16,720
here into
 

2121
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,230
here into
here. See 81, 127 lot, and a 50 lot.

2122
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,240
here. See 81, 127 lot, and a 50 lot.
 

2123
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,630
here. See 81, 127 lot, and a 50 lot.
These guys up here are offside. You're

2124
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
These guys up here are offside. You're
 

2125
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,309
These guys up here are offside. You're
looking at the level two on the right,

2126
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
looking at the level two on the right,
 

2127
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,630
looking at the level two on the right,
the tape. That would be what I'd be

2128
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:26,640
the tape. That would be what I'd be
 

2129
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,470
the tape. That would be what I'd be
watching into those 82s. Those are the

2130
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,480
watching into those 82s. Those are the
 

2131
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,829
watching into those 82s. Those are the
guys that are currently offside. If you

2132
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:29,839
guys that are currently offside. If you
 

2133
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,109
guys that are currently offside. If you
if they take that out, then we can

2134
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:31,119
if they take that out, then we can
 

2135
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,870
if they take that out, then we can
squeeze right back up. Like I said, I

2136
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:32,880
squeeze right back up. Like I said, I
 

2137
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,790
squeeze right back up. Like I said, I
wouldn't just be slamming short in this.

2138
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
wouldn't just be slamming short in this.
 

2139
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,150
wouldn't just be slamming short in this.
You want to wait to see if there's a

2140
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:36,160
You want to wait to see if there's a
 

2141
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,750
You want to wait to see if there's a
reaction because if there's no reaction

2142
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,760
reaction because if there's no reaction
 

2143
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,990
reaction because if there's no reaction
at 82s, right, then they're going to

2144
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:40,000
at 82s, right, then they're going to
 

2145
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,549
at 82s, right, then they're going to
come straight up into here and we're

2146
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:42,559
come straight up into here and we're
 

2147
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,390
come straight up into here and we're
leaving that alone, which is a bit

2148
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,400
leaving that alone, which is a bit
 

2149
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,230
leaving that alone, which is a bit
dirty. And you also watching ES into

2150
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:46,240
dirty. And you also watching ES into
 

2151
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,549
dirty. And you also watching ES into
this same level. ES is almost here. So

2152
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:48,559
this same level. ES is almost here. So
 

2153
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,390
this same level. ES is almost here. So
that's what I'd be watching personally.

2154
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:50,400
that's what I'd be watching personally.
 

2155
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,990
that's what I'd be watching personally.
That's what I'd be watching. I wouldn't

2156
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,000
That's what I'd be watching. I wouldn't
 

2157
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,109
That's what I'd be watching. I wouldn't
be bullish bias until we start taking

2158
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
be bullish bias until we start taking
 

2159
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,270
be bullish bias until we start taking
out levels and put like and putting in

2160
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:57,280
out levels and put like and putting in
 

2161
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,790
out levels and put like and putting in
higher lows. This is just a rebalance

2162
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:58,800
higher lows. This is just a rebalance
 

2163
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,950
higher lows. This is just a rebalance
and a reprice. And you can see we just

2164
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
and a reprice. And you can see we just
 

2165
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,309
and a reprice. And you can see we just
tapped into 82s and just got slammed.

2166
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:04,319
tapped into 82s and just got slammed.
 

2167
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,910
tapped into 82s and just got slammed.
Right? So that little first reaction

2168
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:05,920
Right? So that little first reaction
 

2169
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,990
Right? So that little first reaction
straight into just above 82s. Actually

2170
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:08,000
straight into just above 82s. Actually
 

2171
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,829
straight into just above 82s. Actually
went 84s. And you can see it's the first

2172
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
went 84s. And you can see it's the first
 

2173
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,829
went 84s. And you can see it's the first
sort of attempt from sellers and buyers

2174
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
sort of attempt from sellers and buyers
 

2175
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,390
sort of attempt from sellers and buyers
just got caught there again.

2176
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
just got caught there again.
 

2177
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,870
just got caught there again.
That is the level based on delta. That's

2178
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:16,880
That is the level based on delta. That's
 

2179
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,390
That is the level based on delta. That's
the level. That's the overunder right

2180
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:18,400
the level. That's the overunder right
 

2181
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,870
the level. That's the overunder right
now. And they're trying to now absorb

2182
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:20,880
now. And they're trying to now absorb
 

2183
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,470
now. And they're trying to now absorb
previous week value area low. So this

2184
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:22,480
previous week value area low. So this
 

2185
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,309
previous week value area low. So this
becomes the battle. Do they fade this

2186
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:24,319
becomes the battle. Do they fade this
 

2187
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,150
becomes the battle. Do they fade this
all the way back down or buyers get a

2188
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,160
all the way back down or buyers get a
 

2189
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,829
all the way back down or buyers get a
squeeze out into view up here? I don't

2190
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:27,839
squeeze out into view up here? I don't
 

2191
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,150
squeeze out into view up here? I don't
know. This is why we don't attack it. We

2192
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160
know. This is why we don't attack it. We
 

2193
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,630
know. This is why we don't attack it. We
let them do whatever it is they need to

2194
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:32,640
let them do whatever it is they need to
 

2195
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,309
let them do whatever it is they need to
do. And if they start to roll over, we

2196
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319
do. And if they start to roll over, we
 

2197
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,829
do. And if they start to roll over, we
play. And if they start to, you know,

2198
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:35,839
play. And if they start to, you know,
 

2199
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,829
play. And if they start to, you know,
put put higher lows and reclaim, we can

2200
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:37,839
put put higher lows and reclaim, we can
 

2201
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:45,190
put put higher lows and reclaim, we can
bid up.

2202
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200

 

2203
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,630

I'm not into um

2204
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640
I'm not into um
 

2205
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,230
I'm not into um
playing counter trend longs when we've

2206
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:50,240
playing counter trend longs when we've
 

2207
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,870
playing counter trend longs when we've
just left balance, but uh we do need to

2208
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:52,880
just left balance, but uh we do need to
 

2209
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,230
just left balance, but uh we do need to
be aware of that previous week value

2210
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
be aware of that previous week value
 

2211
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,910
be aware of that previous week value
error low. Absolutely need to be aware

2212
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:55,920
error low. Absolutely need to be aware
 

2213
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,870
error low. Absolutely need to be aware
of it. Okay, so drift into VWAP now

2214
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
of it. Okay, so drift into VWAP now
 

2215
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,349
of it. Okay, so drift into VWAP now
looks probable.

2216
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359

 

2217
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,069

ES is at VWOUP. Spy has got a tiny bit

2218
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:08,079
ES is at VWOUP. Spy has got a tiny bit
 

2219
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,710
ES is at VWOUP. Spy has got a tiny bit
left to go. Guess what the bottom was

2220
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:10,720
left to go. Guess what the bottom was
 

2221
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,109
left to go. Guess what the bottom was
today on Spy? 82s. All right, so all

2222
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:13,119
today on Spy? 82s. All right, so all
 

2223
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,630
today on Spy? 82s. All right, so all
those guys have been here the last few

2224
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
those guys have been here the last few
 

2225
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,349
those guys have been here the last few
days. Everyone in Discord, 85 to 82

2226
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
days. Everyone in Discord, 85 to 82
 

2227
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,670
days. Everyone in Discord, 85 to 82
rotation on Spy. All right, look at this

2228
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:19,680
rotation on Spy. All right, look at this
 

2229
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,390
rotation on Spy. All right, look at this
morning. Once we lost 85, we went

2230
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:22,400
morning. Once we lost 85, we went
 

2231
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,390
morning. Once we lost 85, we went
straight down to 82. Gamma exposure is

2232
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:24,400
straight down to 82. Gamma exposure is
 

2233
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,190
straight down to 82. Gamma exposure is
at 82. They bid back off at 82. I'm

2234
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,200
at 82. They bid back off at 82. I'm
 

2235
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,430
at 82. They bid back off at 82. I'm
telling you now, there is not much of a

2236
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:29,440
telling you now, there is not much of a
 

2237
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,910
telling you now, there is not much of a
put wall underneath. If they lose 82s on

2238
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:31,920
put wall underneath. If they lose 82s on
 

2239
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,670
put wall underneath. If they lose 82s on
spy, it is a little bit night night

2240
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:33,680
spy, it is a little bit night night
 

2241
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,270
spy, it is a little bit night night
because everything was heavy topside.

2242
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,280
because everything was heavy topside.
 

2243
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,589
because everything was heavy topside.
And again, I gave you that in Discord

2244
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
And again, I gave you that in Discord
 

2245
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:40,790
And again, I gave you that in Discord
last night. We talked about it. I'm

2246
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:40,800
last night. We talked about it. I'm
 

2247
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,549
last night. We talked about it. I'm
pretty sure

2248
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:42,559
pretty sure
 

2249
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,349
pretty sure
sure I mention it.

2250
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:47,359

 

2251
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,829

Did I not mention it? There we go. Spy

2252
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:49,839
Did I not mention it? There we go. Spy
 

2253
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,230
Did I not mention it? There we go. Spy
levels for tomorrow 69700. Not much

2254
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:52,240
levels for tomorrow 69700. Not much
 

2255
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,710
levels for tomorrow 69700. Not much
below most of call walls topside. So 85

2256
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:54,720
below most of call walls topside. So 85
 

2257
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,510
below most of call walls topside. So 85
and 82 still key lose that weakness

2258
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520
and 82 still key lose that weakness
 

2259
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,589
and 82 still key lose that weakness
possible. that was given at 625 last

2260
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
possible. that was given at 625 last
 

2261
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,430
possible. that was given at 625 last
night, right? Those are still the

2262
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
night, right? Those are still the
 

2263
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,870
night, right? Those are still the
levels. We're still just playing gamma

2264
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
levels. We're still just playing gamma
 

2265
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,309
levels. We're still just playing gamma
to gamma at the moment by the looks of

2266
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,319
to gamma at the moment by the looks of
 

2267
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,470
to gamma at the moment by the looks of
it. Options dealers still playing this

2268
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
it. Options dealers still playing this
 

2269
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,390
it. Options dealers still playing this
market.

2270
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,400

 

2271
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,349

So, straight squeeze up, repricing.

2272
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359

 

2273
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,270

How much more juice has got it got in it

2274
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,280
How much more juice has got it got in it
 

2275
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,750
How much more juice has got it got in it
is the question.

2276
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:19,760
is the question.
 

2277
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,190
is the question.
Bid bid bid bid bid

2278
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
Bid bid bid bid bid
 

2279
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,270
Bid bid bid bid bid
through to 82. So bulls now completely

2280
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:25,280
through to 82. So bulls now completely
 

2281
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,190
through to 82. So bulls now completely
comfortable because they've repriced and

2282
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
comfortable because they've repriced and
 

2283
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,790
comfortable because they've repriced and
they're holding and bears have a chance

2284
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:28,800
they're holding and bears have a chance
 

2285
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,950
they're holding and bears have a chance
to come in previous day value area low.

2286
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960
to come in previous day value area low.
 

2287
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,150
to come in previous day value area low.
But the fact that they didn't hold the

2288
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:32,160
But the fact that they didn't hold the
 

2289
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,150
But the fact that they didn't hold the
previous week is a bit dirty. I don't

2290
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
previous week is a bit dirty. I don't
 

2291
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,430
previous week is a bit dirty. I don't
like that they left that. That's a bit

2292
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:35,440
like that they left that. That's a bit
 

2293
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,549
like that they left that. That's a bit
naughty. But you know it's the ENQ. She

2294
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
naughty. But you know it's the ENQ. She
 

2295
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:46,390
naughty. But you know it's the ENQ. She
loves doing that especially this year.

2296
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,400

 

2297
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,470

And then we do have some imbalances here

2298
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
And then we do have some imbalances here
 

2299
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,430
And then we do have some imbalances here
43 to 54. And then there's some more all

2300
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:51,440
43 to 54. And then there's some more all
 

2301
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,589
43 to 54. And then there's some more all
the way up 70s. If we claim the opening

2302
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,599
the way up 70s. If we claim the opening
 

2303
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,670
the way up 70s. If we claim the opening
range though, that's going to be uh it's

2304
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:55,680
range though, that's going to be uh it's
 

2305
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,430
range though, that's going to be uh it's
going to be a bit like last night really

2306
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,440
going to be a bit like last night really
 

2307
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,670
going to be a bit like last night really
like one move down and then um all the

2308
00:53:59,670 --> 00:53:59,680
like one move down and then um all the
 

2309
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:05,430
like one move down and then um all the
way back up. It's not very nice.

2310
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440

 

2311
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,150

So Meta and Microsoft half% up. Rest

2312
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:08,160
So Meta and Microsoft half% up. Rest
 

2313
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,630
So Meta and Microsoft half% up. Rest
rest of the market still in a bleed.

2314
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:10,640
rest of the market still in a bleed.

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,870
rest of the market still in a bleed.
Rest of the market still in a bleed

2316
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:12,880
Rest of the market still in a bleed
 

2317
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,030
Rest of the market still in a bleed
here.

2318
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,040
here.
 

2319
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,470
here.
They're trying to get to VWAP by the

2320
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,480
They're trying to get to VWAP by the
 

2321
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:28,950
They're trying to get to VWAP by the
looks of it.

2322
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:28,960

 

2323
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,549

Does the spy 185 again back inside its

2324
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
Does the spy 185 again back inside its
 

2325
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,870
Does the spy 185 again back inside its
initial balance on the spy? This is

2326
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
initial balance on the spy? This is
 

2327
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,470
initial balance on the spy? This is
silly market at this point.

2328
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
silly market at this point.
 

2329
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,270
silly market at this point.
This is a silly market at this point,

2330
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,280

 

2331
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,430

right? There's no higher low yet. This

2332
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,440
right? There's no higher low yet. This
 

2333
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,230
right? There's no higher low yet. This
is just a straight squeeze.

2334
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,240
is just a straight squeeze.
 

2335
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,190
is just a straight squeeze.
So watching if there's acceptance, but

2336
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,200
So watching if there's acceptance, but
 

2337
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,270
So watching if there's acceptance, but
you'd imagine there'll be some rejection

2338
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,280
you'd imagine there'll be some rejection
 

2339
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:00,549
you'd imagine there'll be some rejection
at some point.

2340
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559

 

2341
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,870

There you go. It's the start of a

2342
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:02,880
There you go. It's the start of a
 

2343
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,030
There you go. It's the start of a
rejection there.

2344
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
rejection there.
 

2345
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,430
rejection there.
So probably going to come down fairly

2346
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
So probably going to come down fairly
 

2347
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,030
So probably going to come down fairly
decently here and then try and set a

2348
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:09,040
decently here and then try and set a
 

2349
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,390
decently here and then try and set a
higher low. So either VWAP or down into

2350
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:12,400
higher low. So either VWAP or down into
 

2351
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,270
higher low. So either VWAP or down into
here. So this is the battle now. Can

2352
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,280
here. So this is the battle now. Can
 

2353
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,109
here. So this is the battle now. Can
they get this move here? And they need

2354
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
they get this move here? And they need
 

2355
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,870
they get this move here? And they need
to use this cluster to go higher if they

2356
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:18,880
to use this cluster to go higher if they
 

2357
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,950
to use this cluster to go higher if they
are. Otherwise, bears will lean against

2358
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:20,960
are. Otherwise, bears will lean against
 

2359
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,069
are. Otherwise, bears will lean against
this and look for a rotation to here,

2360
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
this and look for a rotation to here,
 

2361
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,430
this and look for a rotation to here,
right? And this would be their cover

2362
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:25,440
right? And this would be their cover
 

2363
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,589
right? And this would be their cover
point. And if they got acceptance below,

2364
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:27,599
point. And if they got acceptance below,
 

2365
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,589
point. And if they got acceptance below,
great.

2366
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:29,599
great.
 

2367
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,349
great.
But I'm not going to trade this here

2368
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:31,359
But I'm not going to trade this here
 

2369
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,710
But I'm not going to trade this here
because they should have rejected here

2370
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
because they should have rejected here
 

2371
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,950
because they should have rejected here
versus 82. They didn't. I want to be

2372
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:34,960
versus 82. They didn't. I want to be
 

2373
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,870
versus 82. They didn't. I want to be
careful of a lift up into this.

2374
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
careful of a lift up into this.
 

2375
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,349
careful of a lift up into this.
Where's What was that high we just

2376
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:41,359
Where's What was that high we just
 

2377
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,829
Where's What was that high we just
traded? 8480s. So, it got very close to

2378
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:43,839
traded? 8480s. So, it got very close to
 

2379
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,390
traded? 8480s. So, it got very close to
85s. So, we know that's the rotation.

2380
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:46,400
85s. So, we know that's the rotation.
 

2381
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,030
85s. So, we know that's the rotation.
85s and 82s on the spy. I do I do

2382
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:49,040
85s and 82s on the spy. I do I do
 

2383
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,950
85s and 82s on the spy. I do I do
personally think that is controlling

2384
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:50,960
personally think that is controlling
 

2385
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,990
personally think that is controlling
most of the There you go. Here's a

2386
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,000
most of the There you go. Here's a
 

2387
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,630
most of the There you go. Here's a
flush. So, this is their chance to set a

2388
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
flush. So, this is their chance to set a
 

2389
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,109
flush. So, this is their chance to set a
higher low. Maybe wick to wick 500s. If

2390
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:57,119
higher low. Maybe wick to wick 500s. If
 

2391
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,789
higher low. Maybe wick to wick 500s. If
not,

2392
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
not,
 

2393
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,390
not,
might drift all the way down into here.

2394
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:00,400
might drift all the way down into here.
 

2395
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,630
might drift all the way down into here.
Spy will or ES and spy will look to hold

2396
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
Spy will or ES and spy will look to hold
 

2397
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,470
Spy will or ES and spy will look to hold
VW up here. If they can set a higher low

2398
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,480
VW up here. If they can set a higher low
 

2399
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,990
VW up here. If they can set a higher low
here, then they can have that move back

2400
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,000
here, then they can have that move back
 

2401
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:15,670
here, then they can have that move back
inside the range.

2402
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:15,680

 

2403
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,829

So, good higher low or good attempt at a

2404
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:17,839
So, good higher low or good attempt at a
 

2405
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,870
So, good higher low or good attempt at a
higher low here. I'm not convinced yet.

2406
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:20,880
higher low here. I'm not convinced yet.
 

2407
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,589
higher low here. I'm not convinced yet.
We did just repric a buy side imbalance

please. I'd said so many prayers for us
 

2437
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,950
please. I'd said so many prayers for us
to just get out this range. I've

2438
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
to just get out this range. I've
 

2439
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,470
to just get out this range. I've
constantly said, I don't care which side

2440
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:20,480
constantly said, I don't care which side
 

2441
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:26,069
constantly said, I don't care which side
we go. Just please.

2442
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079

 

2443
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,430

Yeah, totally. Well, the it makes sense.

2444
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:29,440
Yeah, totally. Well, the it makes sense.
 

2445
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,750
Yeah, totally. Well, the it makes sense.
Look, when you see stuff like this,

2446
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
Look, when you see stuff like this,
 

2447
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,470
Look, when you see stuff like this,
right, we're not balancing it out. The

2448
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:34,480
right, we're not balancing it out. The
 

2449
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,030
right, we're not balancing it out. The
thing is bears needed to defend this 82.

2450
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,040
thing is bears needed to defend this 82.
 

2451
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,270
thing is bears needed to defend this 82.
It's why I said there in here that in

2452
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:39,280
It's why I said there in here that in
 

2453
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,270
It's why I said there in here that in
this wick here, there was a lot of

2454
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:41,280
this wick here, there was a lot of
 

2455
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,670
this wick here, there was a lot of
buying. All right,

2456
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:43,680
buying. All right,
 

2457
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,990
buying. All right,
so bears really wanted to defend that.

2458
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,000
so bears really wanted to defend that.
 

2459
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,589
so bears really wanted to defend that.
If they could have defended that, they

2460
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
If they could have defended that, they
 

2461
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,030
If they could have defended that, they
could have caused this move down here.

2462
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:49,040
could have caused this move down here.
 

2463
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,309
could have caused this move down here.
This is why I was like, I'm not going to

2464
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
This is why I was like, I'm not going to
 

2465
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,309
This is why I was like, I'm not going to
just come in and hammer short. If you if

2466
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:52,319
just come in and hammer short. If you if
 

2467
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,829
just come in and hammer short. If you if
you just rewind the tape, you'll hear me

2468
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:53,839
you just rewind the tape, you'll hear me
 

2469
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:54,950
you just rewind the tape, you'll hear me
say, I'm not just going to come in and

2470
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
say, I'm not just going to come in and
 

2471
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,789
say, I'm not just going to come in and
hammer short because we don't know if it

2472
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:56,799
hammer short because we don't know if it
 

2473
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,870
hammer short because we don't know if it
wants to come up to here or here. And

2474
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:58,880
wants to come up to here or here. And
 

2475
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,390
wants to come up to here or here. And
right now, we're going right the way

2476
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:00,400
right now, we're going right the way
 

2477
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,309
right now, we're going right the way
back to value. All right, so bears, this

2478
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
back to value. All right, so bears, this
 

2479
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,670
back to value. All right, so bears, this
is last chance that they really have

2480
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:03,680
is last chance that they really have
 

2481
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,589
is last chance that they really have
here is to defend this. They've now

2482
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:05,599
here is to defend this. They've now
 

2483
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,390
here is to defend this. They've now
lost. All right, here are the VWAPs.

2484
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
lost. All right, here are the VWAPs.
 

2485
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,990
lost. All right, here are the VWAPs.
This is off the high pivot. This is off

2486
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,000
This is off the high pivot. This is off
 

2487
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,390
This is off the high pivot. This is off
the low pivot. They've now lost that. If

2488
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:12,400
the low pivot. They've now lost that. If
 

2489
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,309
the low pivot. They've now lost that. If
bears don't defend this, then guess

2490
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:14,319
bears don't defend this, then guess
 

2491
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,150
bears don't defend this, then guess
what? Well, that's going to be used to

2492
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
what? Well, that's going to be used to
 

2493
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,230
what? Well, that's going to be used to
go up here, right? That will become

2494
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
go up here, right? That will become
 

2495
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,789
go up here, right? That will become
liquidity to go up here. It's very ugly

2496
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:20,799
liquidity to go up here. It's very ugly
 

2497
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,950
liquidity to go up here. It's very ugly
now to play this bull side with this

2498
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
now to play this bull side with this
 

2499
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,710
now to play this bull side with this
micro pullback. It's like this bare

2500
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
micro pullback. It's like this bare
 

2501
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,230
micro pullback. It's like this bare
side. That was a micro pullback. It's

2502
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:26,240
side. That was a micro pullback. It's
 

2503
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,470
side. That was a micro pullback. It's
all you got. The better bullish move

2504
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
all you got. The better bullish move
 

2505
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,349
all you got. The better bullish move
would be like this. But I've got a

2506
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
would be like this. But I've got a
 

2507
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,789
would be like this. But I've got a
feeling it's not going to give that to

2508
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:32,799
feeling it's not going to give that to
 

2509
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:36,470
feeling it's not going to give that to
us. It just feels very this

2510
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
us. It just feels very this
 

2511
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,829
us. It just feels very this
82 spy. Okay.

2512
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:39,839
82 spy. Okay.
 

2513
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,430
82 spy. Okay.
This now here

2514
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:43,440
This now here
 

2515
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,950
This now here
85

2516
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960
85
 

2517
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,349
85
spy. All right.

2518
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:47,359
spy. All right.
 

2519
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,430
spy. All right.
I can show you.

2520
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,440
I can show you.
 

2521
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,950
I can show you.
This is how quickly it's happening. It's

2522
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:50,960
This is how quickly it's happening. It's
 

2523
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,150
This is how quickly it's happening. It's
literally just options dealers, guys.

2524
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,160
literally just options dealers, guys.
 

2525
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,430
literally just options dealers, guys.
Here you go. 82,

2526
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:57,440
Here you go. 82,
 

2527
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,309
Here you go. 82,
85 through 85. There's a little bit at

2528
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319
85 through 85. There's a little bit at
 

2529
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,109
85 through 85. There's a little bit at
88 and uh and then 90 and then 700.

2530
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
88 and uh and then 90 and then 700.
 

2531
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,510
88 and uh and then 90 and then 700.
Under 82, there was no put wall. So, if

2532
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:05,520
Under 82, there was no put wall. So, if
 

2533
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,270
Under 82, there was no put wall. So, if
they didn't save 82, this market was

2534
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
they didn't save 82, this market was
 

2535
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,750
they didn't save 82, this market was
gone. It was completely gone. That was

2536
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:09,760
gone. It was completely gone. That was
 

2537
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,910
gone. It was completely gone. That was
their only chance really.

2538
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:15,920

 

2539
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,510

Sorry. Do I need to catch up on some

2540
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:17,520
Sorry. Do I need to catch up on some
 

2541
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,030
Sorry. Do I need to catch up on some
stuff here? Sorry, folks. Uh, what are

Have I missed something? Someone pass

2546
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:25,040
Have I missed something? Someone pass
 

2547
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,670
Have I missed something? Someone pass
something? Thanks. That was a 70 point

2548
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:27,680
something? Thanks. That was a 70 point
 

2549
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,069
something? Thanks. That was a 70 point
reversal to almost V up. Re-entered

2550
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
reversal to almost V up. Re-entered
 

2551
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,069
reversal to almost V up. Re-entered
three times. Thanks, man. Oh, lovely.

Really nice. Good work. You just played

2554
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:34,880
Really nice. Good work. You just played
 

2555
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,430
Really nice. Good work. You just played
the delta flip

2556
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:37,440
the delta flip
 

2557
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,950
the delta flip
and there was never a reason to get out

2558
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:38,960
and there was never a reason to get out
 

2559
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,510
and there was never a reason to get out
if you played that. Yeah. Never give you

2560
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:41,520
if you played that. Yeah. Never give you
 

2561
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,190
if you played that. Yeah. Never give you
a reason to get out. Once it got above

2562
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,200
a reason to get out. Once it got above
 

2563
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,910
a reason to get out. Once it got above
82, that was it.

2564
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:45,920
82, that was it.
 

2565
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,630
82, that was it.
All right, let me have a look.

2566
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:48,640
All right, let me have a look.
 

2567
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,150
All right, let me have a look.
Well, I'm kind of put off doing much

2568
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:50,160
Well, I'm kind of put off doing much
 

2569
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,549
Well, I'm kind of put off doing much
now. I'm going to be honest.

2570
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:52,559
now. I'm going to be honest.
 

2571
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,309
now. I'm going to be honest.
Bears need to defend this and they've

2572
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
Bears need to defend this and they've
 

2573
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,589
Bears need to defend this and they've
done a terrible job as

2574
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:57,599
done a terrible job as
 

2575
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,069
done a terrible job as
they've done a terrible job since April.

2576
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:00,079
they've done a terrible job since April.
 

2577
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,230
they've done a terrible job since April.
Uh, so we want to be careful. We're back

2578
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:02,240
Uh, so we want to be careful. We're back
 

2579
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,109
Uh, so we want to be careful. We're back
inside previous days value.

2580
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:05,119
inside previous days value.
 

2581
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,109
inside previous days value.
Let's put some volume on here now as

2582
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:07,119
Let's put some volume on here now as
 

2583
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,390
Let's put some volume on here now as
well. Sorry, I forgot to do that because

2584
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
well. Sorry, I forgot to do that because
 

2585
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,670
well. Sorry, I forgot to do that because
it's on my other chart. You got to

2586
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:09,680
it's on my other chart. You got to
 

2587
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,190
it's on my other chart. You got to
remind me if I ever forget to do it.

2588
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,200
remind me if I ever forget to do it.
 

2589
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,150
remind me if I ever forget to do it.
Just uh shout at me.

2590
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,160
Just uh shout at me.
 

2591
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,589
Just uh shout at me.
Aren't you gone? Let's get rid of these

2592
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:15,599
Aren't you gone? Let's get rid of these
 

2593
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,950
Aren't you gone? Let's get rid of these
anchors because we've traded over it.

2594
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:18,960
anchors because we've traded over it.
 

2595
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,549
anchors because we've traded over it.
Let's put this guy back on.

2596
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:22,559
Let's put this guy back on.
 

2597
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,710
Let's put this guy back on.
Right, there we go.

2598
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:24,720
Right, there we go.
 

2599
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,109
Right, there we go.
So, high profile point control on the

2600
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:27,119
So, high profile point control on the
 

2601
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,190
So, high profile point control on the
day all up at this kind of level here.

2602
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
day all up at this kind of level here.
 

2603
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,910
day all up at this kind of level here.
This is your I would normally call this

2604
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:31,920
This is your I would normally call this
 

2605
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,829
This is your I would normally call this
an underover over. I'm reluctant to call

2606
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
an underover over. I'm reluctant to call
 

2607
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,069
an underover over. I'm reluctant to call
it today an under over, but I guess it

2608
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:36,079
it today an under over, but I guess it
 

2609
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,390
it today an under over, but I guess it
is where we built out this shelf. Uh

2610
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:38,400
is where we built out this shelf. Uh
 

2611
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,910
is where we built out this shelf. Uh
bears must defend this. Failing to

2612
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
bears must defend this. Failing to
 

2613
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,270
bears must defend this. Failing to
defend this will cause an inverse head

2614
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,280
defend this will cause an inverse head
 

2615
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,549
defend this will cause an inverse head
and shoulder, and we will go for a

2616
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:42,559
and shoulder, and we will go for a
 

2617
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:50,710
and shoulder, and we will go for a
resqueeze higher.

2618
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720

 

2619
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,910

So look at spy. It's just rejected 85.

2620
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
So look at spy. It's just rejected 85.
 

2621
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,990
So look at spy. It's just rejected 85.
It can't get a close over 85. It's

2622
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:56,000
It can't get a close over 85. It's
 

2623
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,230
It can't get a close over 85. It's
trying to get a close over 85. If it

2624
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:58,240
trying to get a close over 85. If it
 

2625
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,390
trying to get a close over 85. If it
does successfully get a close over 85, I

2626
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:00,400
does successfully get a close over 85, I
 

2627
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:09,589
does successfully get a close over 85, I
would expect it to attack 88.

2628
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:09,599

 

2629
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,829

Alex, what are the bands on your chart

2630
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:11,839
Alex, what are the bands on your chart
 

2631
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:15,589
Alex, what are the bands on your chart
that show the rotations?

2632
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599

 

2633
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,190

Um, I'm not sure what you mean. The

2634
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,200
Um, I'm not sure what you mean. The
 

2635
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,470
Um, I'm not sure what you mean. The
bands, do you mean these the clouds?

2636
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
bands, do you mean these the clouds?
 

2637
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,109
bands, do you mean these the clouds?
These are my flow zones. Yeah, these are

2638
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:23,119
These are my flow zones. Yeah, these are
 

2639
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,470
These are my flow zones. Yeah, these are
the flow zones. So, these are rolling

2640
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:24,480
the flow zones. So, these are rolling
 

2641
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,870
the flow zones. So, these are rolling
fibs.

2642
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:28,880

 

2643
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,750

See how wide this got here? All right.

2644
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:31,760
See how wide this got here? All right.
 

2645
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,670
See how wide this got here? All right.
Maybe we can see we're rejecting

2646
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:33,680
Maybe we can see we're rejecting
 

2647
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,150
Maybe we can see we're rejecting
previous days value.

2648
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,160

previous days value.
Where would bulls want to defend? I

2650
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
Where would bulls want to defend? I
 

2651
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,190
Where would bulls want to defend? I
would imagine they'll want to defend

2652
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:39,200
would imagine they'll want to defend
 

2653
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,030
would imagine they'll want to defend
this right here now. Right? If they're

2654
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,040
this right here now. Right? If they're
 

2655
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,630
this right here now. Right? If they're
going to set a higher low, I mean, if

2656
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:42,640
going to set a higher low, I mean, if
 

2657
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,910
going to set a higher low, I mean, if
they can't hold V up, if they're going

2658
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
they can't hold V up, if they're going
 

2659
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,670
they can't hold V up, if they're going
to set a higher low, bulls will want to

2660
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
to set a higher low, bulls will want to
 

2661
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,910
to set a higher low, bulls will want to
defend this. This can still be sold,

2662
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
defend this. This can still be sold,
 

2663
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,910
defend this. This can still be sold,
right? This is structure at the moment.

01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:49,920
right? This is structure at the moment.
 

2665
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,390

If bears sell this, they will attempt to
sell it down to here. Bulls will attempt

All right,
 

2701
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,470
All right,
let me clean this up and make this make

01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
let me clean this up and make this make
 

2703
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,510
let me clean this up and make this make
sense for you. Right.

2711
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,589

Where's previous week value very low?

2712
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:51,599
Where's previous week value very low?
 

2713
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,309
Where's previous week value very low?
Where is it? Where's it gone?

2714
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:54,319
Where is it? Where's it gone?
 

2715
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,910
Where is it? Where's it gone?
Is it just there and I can't see it?

2716
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:55,920
Is it just there and I can't see it?
 

2717
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:02,230

2720
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:05,040
on. Disappeared off my chart. Let me get
 

2721
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:13,589

this previous week.

2722
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:13,599

 

2723
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,750

Okay, so this is yesterday's rotation.

2724
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:17,760
Okay, so this is yesterday's rotation.
 

2725
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,470

01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,160
overnight.
 

2729
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,390
overnight.
If we think about what we did overnight,

2730
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
If we think about what we did overnight,
 

2731
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,630
If we think about what we did overnight,
we failed to get over previous week and

2732
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:28,640
we failed to get over previous week and
 

2733
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,029
we failed to get over previous week and
previous day and we came all the way

2734
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
previous day and we came all the way
 

2735
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,270
previous day and we came all the way
down underneath previous week and set a

2736
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:33,280
down underneath previous week and set a
 

2737
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,029
down underneath previous week and set a
low here.

2738
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:35,039
low here.
 

2739
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,950
low here.
So overnight and then we came back

2740
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
So overnight and then we came back
 

2741
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,549
So overnight and then we came back
inside. So we failed. So we failed

2742
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
inside. So we failed. So we failed
 

2743
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,029
inside. So we failed. So we failed

previous week possibly inside previous
 

2753
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,789
previous week possibly inside previous
days. So this really for me is the no

2754
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:52,799
days. So this really for me is the no
 

2755
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,230
days. So this really for me is the no
trade zone. Definitely this is a no no

2756
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:56,240
trade zone. Definitely this is a no no
 

2757
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,510
trade zone. Definitely this is a no no
trade zone. I don't want to play in

2758
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,520
trade zone. I don't want to play in
 

2759
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,630
trade zone. I don't want to play in
there. But if you get acceptance in here

2760
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:00,640
there. But if you get acceptance in here
 

2761
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,390
there. But if you get acceptance in here
and if you like playing rotation, there

2762
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:02,400
and if you like playing rotation, there
 

2763
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,829
and if you like playing rotation, there
is a difference. It's a no trade zone

2764
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:03,839
is a difference. It's a no trade zone
 

2765
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,109
is a difference. It's a no trade zone
for me. It doesn't mean it needs to be

2766
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
for me. It doesn't mean it needs to be
 

2767
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,029
for me. It doesn't mean it needs to be
for you. If we start finding acceptance

2768
01:04:07,029 --> 01:04:07,039
for you. If we start finding acceptance
 

2769
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,190
for you. If we start finding acceptance
inside here or inside here, if you're

2770
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:09,200
inside here or inside here, if you're
 

2771
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,390
inside here or inside here, if you're
playing the weekly level, you're playing

2772
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:10,400
playing the weekly level, you're playing
 

2773
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,829
playing the weekly level, you're playing
that. If you're playing the daily level,

2774
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:11,839
that. If you're playing the daily level,
 

2775
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,750
that. If you're playing the daily level,
you're playing that. And if we're not

2776
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:13,760
you're playing that. And if we're not
 

2777
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,589
you're playing that. And if we're not
getting acceptance underneath the weekly

2778
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:15,599
getting acceptance underneath the weekly
 

2779
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,109
getting acceptance underneath the weekly
level, we should come and test the other

2780
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:17,119
level, we should come and test the other
 

2781
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,270
level, we should come and test the other
weekly other side of the range. If we're

2782
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:19,280
weekly other side of the range. If we're
 

2783
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,870
weekly other side of the range. If we're
not getting acceptance underneath

2784
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
not getting acceptance underneath
 

2785
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,789
not getting acceptance underneath
previous daily value, then we should

2786
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:22,799
previous daily value, then we should
 

2787
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,950
previous daily value, then we should
come and test the other side of the

2788
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
come and test the other side of the
 

2789
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,430
come and test the other side of the
range. Technically speaking, but uh like

2790
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
range. Technically speaking, but uh like
 

2791
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,990
range. Technically speaking, but uh like
you will hear me to say all the time, I

2792
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
you will hear me to say all the time, I
 

2793
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,829
you will hear me to say all the time, I
flipping hate playing rotation, so I

2794
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
flipping hate playing rotation, so I
 

2795
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,069
flipping hate playing rotation, so I
will avoid it like the plague. I've just

2796
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:36,079
will avoid it like the plague. I've just
 

2797
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:49,270
will avoid it like the plague. I've just
lost that level again. You bugger.

2798
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:49,280

 

2799
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,710

Hopefully that makes sense. Different

2800
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
Hopefully that makes sense. Different
 

2801
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,630
Hopefully that makes sense. Different
between a rotating market and a trending

2802
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:52,640
between a rotating market and a trending
 

2803
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,950
between a rotating market and a trending
market. We've had the ability or we've

2804
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960

FOMC and this morning. We've had the

2808
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:00,880
FOMC and this morning. We've had the
 

2809
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,349
FOMC and this morning. We've had the
opportunity to trend twice uh but we're

2810
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:03,359
opportunity to trend twice uh but we're
 

2811
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:06,710
opportunity to trend twice uh but we're
not seeing the continuation yet yet.

2812
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:06,720
not seeing the continuation yet yet.

moment we've just seen back into range.

2814
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,200

 

2815
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,230

Oh, well, if you just think about

2816
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:14,240
Oh, well, if you just think about
 

2817
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:20,549
Oh, well, if you just think about
Fibonacci numbers, yeah, 13, 21, 45s.

2818
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:20,559
Fibonacci numbers, yeah, 13, 21, 45s.
 

2819
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:21,910
Fibonacci numbers, yeah, 13, 21, 45s.
There's a reason, like, if you didn't

2820
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:21,920
There's a reason, like, if you didn't
 

2821
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,510
There's a reason, like, if you didn't
know, there's a reason people use like a

2822
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,520
know, there's a reason people use like a
 

2823
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:33,349
know, there's a reason people use like a
21 EMA. Yeah, it it's a fib.

2824
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359

 

2825
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,990

Same with these. These are fibs fib

2826
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,000
Same with these. These are fibs fib
 

2827
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,870
Same with these. These are fibs fib
numbers. 788 82s.

2828
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
numbers. 788 82s.
 

2829
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,069
numbers. 788 82s.
All right.

2830
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:44,079

 

2831
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,029

Yes. About to take out higher day. Uh no

2832
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:47,039
Yes. About to take out higher day. Uh no
 

2833
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,029
Yes. About to take out higher day. Uh no
acceptance underneath back inside value.

2834
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039
acceptance underneath back inside value.
 

2835
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,630
acceptance underneath back inside value.
This is looking more and more like an

2836
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:50,640
This is looking more and more like an
 

2837
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,069
This is looking more and more like an
inverse head and shoulder. It's very

2838
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:52,079
inverse head and shoulder. It's very
 

2839
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,430
inverse head and shoulder. It's very
dangerous to play this because this

2840
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
dangerous to play this because this
 

2841
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,190
dangerous to play this because this
pullback is weak. But this is looking

2842
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200
pullback is weak. But this is looking
 

2843
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,470
pullback is weak. But this is looking
more and more probable right now.

2844
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:56,480
more and more probable right now.
 

2845
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,750
more and more probable right now.
There's your point of control on the

2846
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
There's your point of control on the
 

2847
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,990
There's your point of control on the
session. I would say uh bulls have the

2848
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
session. I would say uh bulls have the
 

2849
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,150
session. I would say uh bulls have the
ability to

2850
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
ability to
 

2851
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,670
ability to
really take over this market.

2852
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:05,680
really take over this market.
 

2853
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,589
really take over this market.
I can't see me doing much else with this

2854
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:07,599
I can't see me doing much else with this
 

2855
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,390
I can't see me doing much else with this
right now.

2856
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:12,400

 

2857
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,470

Yeah, I know, Peter. It's It's silly.

2858
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:16,480
Yeah, I know, Peter. It's It's silly.
 

2859
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,470
Yeah, I know, Peter. It's It's silly.
It's silly. But that's uh like we said,

2860
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
It's silly. But that's uh like we said,
 

2861
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,069
It's silly. But that's uh like we said,
that's been ENQ a lot recently, isn't

2862
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:20,079
that's been ENQ a lot recently, isn't
 

2863
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,470
that's been ENQ a lot recently, isn't
it? I mean, leaving this is gross. What

2864
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:22,480
it? I mean, leaving this is gross. What
 

2865
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,910
it? I mean, leaving this is gross. What
would have been better for the whole

2866
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:23,920
would have been better for the whole
 

2867
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,710
would have been better for the whole
trigger would have been this, this,

2868
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:26,720
trigger would have been this, this,
 

2869
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,190
trigger would have been this, this,
this, this, this, this. Okay, then we

2870
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:29,200
this, this, this, this. Okay, then we
 

2871
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,029
this, this, this, this. Okay, then we
have a base built out. We've taken the

2872
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:31,039
have a base built out. We've taken the
 

2873
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,789
have a base built out. We've taken the
liquidity. We've got a higher low. We've

2874
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:32,799
liquidity. We've got a higher low. We've
 

2875
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,630
liquidity. We've got a higher low. We've
got acceptance in range. That becomes an

2876
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:34,640
got acceptance in range. That becomes an
 

2877
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,549
got acceptance in range. That becomes an
easy long. This V-shaped recoveries are

2878
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:38,559
easy long. This V-shaped recoveries are
 

2879
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,670
easy long. This V-shaped recoveries are
are so gross.

2880
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:41,680
are so gross.
 

2881
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,829
are so gross.
But whatever. This is the market. So,

2882
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:43,839
But whatever. This is the market. So,
 

2883
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,270
But whatever. This is the market. So,
back into this anchor off the high. I'm

2884
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:45,280
back into this anchor off the high. I'm
 

2885
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,950
back into this anchor off the high. I'm
going to get rid of that now. I think

2886
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:46,960
going to get rid of that now. I think
 

2887
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,230
going to get rid of that now. I think
we're just going to scream upside.

2888
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,240
we're just going to scream upside.
 

2889
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,230
we're just going to scream upside.
Shorts are absolutely cooked because

2890
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:50,240
Shorts are absolutely cooked because
 

2891
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,549
Shorts are absolutely cooked because
we're back inside value. Shorts are

01:06:52,559 --> 01:07:01,829
we're back inside value. Shorts are
absolutely cooked now.

01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:01,839

 

2895
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,710

big seller at 582. Yeah, I'd say yeah, I

2896
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:04,720
big seller at 582. Yeah, I'd say yeah, I

2899
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:12,470
agree with you. 582 to 578.
That's where they tried to sell it.

2900
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:12,480

 

2901
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,950

So again, if we come here, we will see

2902
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:14,960
So again, if we come here, we will see
 

2903
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,349
So again, if we come here, we will see
them.

2904
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:17,359
them.
 

2905
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:22,789
them.
Let me come down.

2906
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:22,799

 

2907
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:25,750

Let's look at the VPD on the left. 582

2908
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:25,760
Let's look at the VPD on the left. 582
 

2909
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,589
Let's look at the VPD on the left. 582
to 5678. There's one here 589.

2910
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:29,599
to 5678. There's one here 589.
 

2911
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,910
to 5678. There's one here 589.
Here you go. So these guys here 583. You

2912
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920
Here you go. So these guys here 583. You
 

2913
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,430
Here you go. So these guys here 583. You
see all this sellside stacked and then

2914
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:33,440
see all this sellside stacked and then
 

2915
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,710
see all this sellside stacked and then
this guy here 580 187 lot offside. So

2916
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
this guy here 580 187 lot offside. So
 

2917
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,309
this guy here 580 187 lot offside. So
all the time we're over this guy here at

2918
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:38,319
all the time we're over this guy here at
 

2919
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,470
all the time we're over this guy here at
580. Bulls have the chance to stay in

2920
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:40,480
580. Bulls have the chance to stay in
 

2921
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:54,150
580. Bulls have the chance to stay in
control of this market.

2922
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:54,160

 

2923
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,349

Yeah. I guess one of the things when

2924
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:55,359
Yeah. I guess one of the things when
 

2925
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:56,870
Yeah. I guess one of the things when
you're waiting when you're one of the a

2926
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
you're waiting when you're one of the a
 

2927
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,230
you're waiting when you're one of the a
trader like me that waits for a

2928
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,240
trader like me that waits for a
 

2929
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,029
trader like me that waits for a
confirmation on a hold

2930
01:08:01,029 --> 01:08:01,039
confirmation on a hold
 

2931
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,109
confirmation on a hold
I mean this is

2932
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:03,119
I mean this is
 

2933
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,549
I mean this is
without taking liquidity

2934
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:06,559
without taking liquidity
 

2935
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,390
without taking liquidity
it doesn't even pull back to 30s all

2936
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
it doesn't even pull back to 30s all
 

2937
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,750
it doesn't even pull back to 30s all
about here this for me that's just a no

2938
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:11,760
about here this for me that's just a no
 

2939
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,390
about here this for me that's just a no
go it's a nogo I I can't shoot myself

2940
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,400
go it's a nogo I I can't shoot myself
 

2941
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,510
go it's a nogo I I can't shoot myself
for not taking longs here

2942
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:19,520

 

2943
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,030

but yeah we're going to get that

2944
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,040
but yeah we're going to get that
 

2945
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,510
but yeah we're going to get that
inverted head and shoulders look so back

2946
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:23,520
inverted head and shoulders look so back
 

2947
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,269
inverted head and shoulders look so back
inside previous week point control. Next

2948
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:25,279
inside previous week point control. Next
 

2949
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,829
inside previous week point control. Next
stop is 637.

2950
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:27,839
stop is 637.
 

2951
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,070
stop is 637.
Then you've got that New York open 644

2952
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:30,080
Then you've got that New York open 644
 

2953
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,910
Then you've got that New York open 644
and through that previous day value area

2954
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:31,920
and through that previous day value area
 

2955
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,349
and through that previous day value area
high because we're going to we've had no

2956
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
high because we're going to we've had no
 

2957
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,669
high because we're going to we've had no
acceptance under previous day value high

2958
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:35,679
acceptance under previous day value high
 

2959
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,590
acceptance under previous day value high
and under previous week high. So we

2960
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:37,600
and under previous week high. So we
 

2961
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,189
and under previous week high. So we
should come and test the top side of the

2962
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:39,199
should come and test the top side of the
 

2963
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,749
should come and test the top side of the
range. So if you are long in this, I

2964
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:41,759
range. So if you are long in this, I
 

2965
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,510
range. So if you are long in this, I
don't see a really a great entry model.

2966
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,520
don't see a really a great entry model.
 

2967
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,030
don't see a really a great entry model.
But if you are longing this, it's a

2968
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,040
But if you are longing this, it's a
 

2969
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,229
But if you are longing this, it's a
fantastic trade and these are your

2970
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:46,239
fantastic trade and these are your
 

2971
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:47,590
fantastic trade and these are your
targets. And once you get through that

2972
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:47,600
targets. And once you get through that
 

2973
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,309
targets. And once you get through that
gap fill to 800. And if you get through

2974
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:50,319
gap fill to 800. And if you get through
 

2975
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,269
gap fill to 800. And if you get through
800, you might as well go to 926,000

2976
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:53,279
800, you might as well go to 926,000
 

2977
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,149
800, you might as well go to 926,000
to be quite honest with you, which is

2978
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:56,159
to be quite honest with you, which is
 

2979
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:59,510
to be quite honest with you, which is
flipping insane when we just zoom out.

2980
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,520
flipping insane when we just zoom out.
 

2981
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,349
flipping insane when we just zoom out.
What the bloody hell is this? But there

2982
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:01,359
What the bloody hell is this? But there
 

2983
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,550
What the bloody hell is this? But there
we go. No. Sweet. Technically, higher

2984
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:04,560
we go. No. Sweet. Technically, higher
 

2985
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,749
we go. No. Sweet. Technically, higher
low. If we reclaim this, we're coming up

2986
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:07,759
low. If we reclaim this, we're coming up
 

2987
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,189
low. If we reclaim this, we're coming up
because we've got three lots of stops up

2988
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
because we've got three lots of stops up
 

2989
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,110
because we've got three lots of stops up
here now. We did take it yesterday, but

01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:11,120
here now. We did take it yesterday, but
 

2991
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,630

2999
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,669
screaming. You're screaming. That's
going to be the big short pain point is

3000
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:21,679
going to be the big short pain point is
 

3001
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:35,510

01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,349

Went for rotation in at previous day

3004

Went for rotation in at previous day
 

3005
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,910
Went for rotation in at previous day
value low got 617.

3006
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:39,920

Spy might go for gap. Yeah, spy is

3008
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:41,600
Spy might go for gap. Yeah, spy is
 

3009
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,870
Spy might go for gap. Yeah, spy is
definitely looks like it's going for

3010
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
definitely looks like it's going for
 

3011
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,669
definitely looks like it's going for
gapful at 8750. Just remember 88 is a

3012
01:09:45,669 --> 01:09:45,679
gapful at 8750. Just remember 88 is a
 

3013
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:55,350
gapful at 8750. Just remember 88 is a
quite a big level.

3014
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,360

 

3015
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,229

TP at the gap. Yeah, I mean

3016
01:09:58,229 --> 01:09:58,239
TP at the gap. Yeah, I mean
 

3017
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,709
TP at the gap. Yeah, I mean
all the way up here. It's possible. It's

3018
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:00,719
all the way up here. It's possible. It's
 

3019
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,630
all the way up here. It's possible. It's
possible.

3020
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:02,640
possible.
 

3021
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,189
possible.
This level is fair value currently from

3022
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
This level is fair value currently from
 

3023
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,550
This level is fair value currently from
previous day. So you need to find

3024
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:06,560
previous day. So you need to find
 

3025
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,390
previous day. So you need to find
acceptance over 637. my TP. If if I was

3026
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:10,400
acceptance over 637. my TP. If if I was
 

3027
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,310
acceptance over 637. my TP. If if I was
long, I'd be taking a partial here and

3028
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:12,320
long, I'd be taking a partial here and
 

3029
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,669
long, I'd be taking a partial here and
I'd be looking for this previous day

3030
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:13,679
I'd be looking for this previous day
 

3031
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,430
I'd be looking for this previous day
value area high. This level here would

3032
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:15,440
value area high. This level here would
 

3033
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,830
value area high. This level here would
be my TP, right? A little bit into here.

3034
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:17,840
be my TP, right? A little bit into here.
 

3035
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,030
be my TP, right? A little bit into here.
That's your New York open and your

3036
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:19,040
That's your New York open and your
 

3037
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,110
That's your New York open and your
previous day point of control and here.

3038
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,120
previous day point of control and here.
 

3039
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,030
previous day point of control and here.
And I'd want to this pullback would need

3040
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:23,040
And I'd want to this pullback would need
 

3041
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,669
And I'd want to this pullback would need
to hold value. They have to hold value

3042
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:25,679
to hold value. They have to hold value
 

3043
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,830
to hold value. They have to hold value
here if I'm bullish. Right? If they

3044
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:27,840
here if I'm bullish. Right? If they
 

3045
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,750
here if I'm bullish. Right? If they
don't hold value here, it can hold in

3046
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:29,760
don't hold value here, it can hold in
 

3047
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,350
don't hold value here, it can hold in
front of value, but it's definitely got

3048
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:31,360
front of value, but it's definitely got
 

3049
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,070
front of value, but it's definitely got
I do not want it back outside of this.

3050
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:34,080
I do not want it back outside of this.
 

3051
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,310
I do not want it back outside of this.
It's done all this work to get back

3052
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:36,320
It's done all this work to get back
 

3053
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,110
It's done all this work to get back
inside of value. if they lose value. No,

3054
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,120
inside of value. if they lose value. No,
 

3055
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,910
inside of value. if they lose value. No,
it's just it just means I don't know

3056
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:41,920
it's just it just means I don't know
 

3057
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,229
it's just it just means I don't know
what it means. It just means it's [\h__\h]

3058
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:44,239
what it means. It just means it's [\h__\h]
 

3059
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,830
what it means. It just means it's [\h__\h]
I I don't know how else to describe it.

01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,830
I I don't know how else to describe it.
They have to hold value. Yeah, they have

3062
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:47,840
They have to hold value. Yeah, they have
 

3063
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,910
They have to hold value. Yeah, they have
to hold value here on a pullback. If if

3064
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
to hold value here on a pullback. If if
 

3065
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,390
to hold value here on a pullback. If if
if I'm bullish all the way up to the top

if I'm bullish all the way up to the top
 

3067
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,070
if I'm bullish all the way up to the top
side of the range.

3069
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,149

Hopefully that makes sense.

01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,280
to midpoint of value, back down, loses
 

3083
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,790
to midpoint of value, back down, loses
it again. You can't, we don't want to

3084
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:16,800
it again. You can't, we don't want to
 

3085
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,669
it again. You can't, we don't want to
lose this box, right? If you think about

3086
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:19,679
lose this box, right? If you think about
 

3087
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,510
lose this box, right? If you think about
previous week, previous day value in

3088
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:21,520
previous week, previous day value in
 

3089
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,910
previous week, previous day value in
here, all right, we've had no acceptance

3090
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:23,920
here, all right, we've had no acceptance
 

3091
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,910
here, all right, we've had no acceptance
above, no acceptance below, right? But

3092
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:25,920
above, no acceptance below, right? But
 

3093
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,590
above, no acceptance below, right? But
we're moving from under and reclaiming.

3094
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:27,600
we're moving from under and reclaiming.
 

3095
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,910
we're moving from under and reclaiming.
Once we reclaim, we should go top side

3096
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:29,920
Once we reclaim, we should go top side
 

3097
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,669
Once we reclaim, we should go top side
of the box. If we lose bottom side of

3098
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:31,679
of the box. If we lose bottom side of
 

3099
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,510
of the box. If we lose bottom side of
the box, it's not a good look. Hopefully

3100
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:33,520
the box, it's not a good look. Hopefully
 

3101
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,510
the box, it's not a good look. Hopefully
that makes sense. So, basically just

3102
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
that makes sense. So, basically just
 

3103
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,750
that makes sense. So, basically just
this is your box

3104
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:37,760
this is your box
 

3105
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,030
this is your box
like we just talked about. Just we can

3106
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,040
like we just talked about. Just we can
 

3107
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,550
like we just talked about. Just we can
just do the whole thing. This is your

3108
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
just do the whole thing. This is your
 

3109
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,870
just do the whole thing. This is your
box. All right. This is your box and

3110
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:42,880
box. All right. This is your box and
 

3111
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,229
box. All right. This is your box and
this is your box, right? We've reclaimed

3112
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:46,239
this is your box, right? We've reclaimed
 

3113
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,709
this is your box, right? We've reclaimed
this. We don't really want to lose this.

3114
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:48,719
this. We don't really want to lose this.
 

3115
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,550
this. We don't really want to lose this.
All right. If you're bullish, you want

3116
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:50,560
All right. If you're bullish, you want
 

3117
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,470
All right. If you're bullish, you want
them to hold here. You do not want them

3118
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
them to hold here. You do not want them
 

3119
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,830
them to hold here. You do not want them
to lose that. And you want to complete

3120
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:53,840
to lose that. And you want to complete
 

3121
01:11:53,840 --> 01:12:01,830
to lose that. And you want to complete
the rotation up here.

3122
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,840

 

3123
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:10,709

Yeah, ADHD market. Yeah.

3124
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:10,719

 

3125
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,390

Vick's getting absolutely crushed at

3126
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
Vick's getting absolutely crushed at
 

3127
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,750
Vick's getting absolutely crushed at
that um just above 1650. So, was that

3128
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:15,760
that um just above 1650. So, was that
 

3129
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:22,149
that um just above 1650. So, was that
the level from last night? It was.

3130
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:22,159

 

3131
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,910

It's wild how quick these moves are

3132
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:23,920
It's wild how quick these moves are
 

3133
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,590
It's wild how quick these moves are
happening. But you know when we we've

3134
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:25,600
happening. But you know when we we've
 

3135
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,590
happening. But you know when we we've
had consolidation in tight ranges for

3136
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:27,600
had consolidation in tight ranges for
 

3137
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,510
had consolidation in tight ranges for
eight days and then we get an expansion

3138
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,520
eight days and then we get an expansion
 

3139
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,110
eight days and then we get an expansion
outside. What's this range been from

3140
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:33,120
outside. What's this range been from
 

3141
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,510
outside. What's this range been from
yesterday's high to the low and we've

3142
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,520
yesterday's high to the low and we've
 

3143
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:41,510
yesterday's high to the low and we've
done it multiple times now.

3144
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520

 

3145
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,070

And that's not a joke. Just shy of 500

3146
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:44,080
And that's not a joke. Just shy of 500
 

3147
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,669
And that's not a joke. Just shy of 500
points.

3148
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:45,679
points.
 

3149
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,430
points.
And even this morning from that New York

3150
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,440
And even this morning from that New York
 

3151
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,709
And even this morning from that New York
open

3152
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:52,719

 

3153
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,229

260 points down and then what almost all

3154
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
260 points down and then what almost all
 

3155
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,510
260 points down and then what almost all
of it back up. Crazy.

3156
01:12:59,510 --> 01:12:59,520
of it back up. Crazy.
 

3157
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,350
of it back up. Crazy.
Crazy.

3158
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,360
Crazy.
 

3159
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,790
Crazy.
Watch your ATR on your sizing.

3160
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:06,800

 

3161
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:16,950

Big old V shape.

3162
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:16,960

 

3163
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,590

Yeah, ES very strong. I agree. ES very

3164
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:19,600
Yeah, ES very strong. I agree. ES very
 

3165
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,189
Yeah, ES very strong. I agree. ES very
strong. But it's because you got spy

3166
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:21,199
strong. But it's because you got spy
 

3167
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,189
strong. But it's because you got spy
back over 85s.

3168
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:23,199
back over 85s.
 

3169
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,390
back over 85s.
So they're going for gap fill.

3170
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:26,400
So they're going for gap fill.
 

3171
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,189
So they're going for gap fill.
They are going for gap fill.

3172
01:13:29,189 --> 01:13:29,199
They are going for gap fill.
 

3173
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,510
They are going for gap fill.
So you're at globex high now really on

3174
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:31,520
So you're at globex high now really on
 

3175
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,669
So you're at globex high now really on
ES and spy.

3176
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
ES and spy.
 

3177
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,830
ES and spy.
It will want gap fill and it will want

3178
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
It will want gap fill and it will want
 

3179
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,390
It will want gap fill and it will want
to test 88. If we get through 88, next

3180
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
to test 88. If we get through 88, next
 

3181
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,390
to test 88. If we get through 88, next
level is 90. If we get through 90, next

3182
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,400
level is 90. If we get through 90, next
 

3183
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,709
level is 90. If we get through 90, next
level is 700. All right. 8. And I would

3184
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:44,719
level is 700. All right. 8. And I would
 

3185
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,110
level is 700. All right. 8. And I would
say the same thing. You do not want to

3186
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:47,120
say the same thing. You do not want to
 

3187
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,910
say the same thing. You do not want to
lose a pullback into 85s on the spy.

3188
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:49,920
lose a pullback into 85s on the spy.
 

3189
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,430
lose a pullback into 85s on the spy.
Right? It's done all the hard work to

3190
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,440
Right? It's done all the hard work to
 

3191
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,189
Right? It's done all the hard work to
get back above it. It held 82. It got

3192
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
get back above it. It held 82. It got
 

3193
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,590
get back above it. It held 82. It got
back above 85. You do not want to see it

3194
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600
back above 85. You do not want to see it
 

3195
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,110
back above 85. You do not want to see it
lose 85 on the spy.

3196
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,120
lose 85 on the spy.
 

3197
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,950
lose 85 on the spy.
We haven't had a good pullback on this

3198
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960
We haven't had a good pullback on this
 

3199
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,830
We haven't had a good pullback on this
market since I would I know these are

3200
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:03,840
market since I would I know these are
 

3201
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,270
market since I would I know these are
pullbacks, but I would say this is a

3202
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:05,280
pullbacks, but I would say this is a
 

3203
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,350
pullbacks, but I would say this is a
very very steep trend. Just be very very

3204
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
very very steep trend. Just be very very
 

3205
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,669
very very steep trend. Just be very very
aware. It would not surprise me to come

3206
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
aware. It would not surprise me to come
 

3207
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,350
aware. It would not surprise me to come
and see them retest this level down

3208
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:11,360
and see them retest this level down
 

3209
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,830
and see them retest this level down
here, right? And then they need to hold

3210
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:13,840
here, right? And then they need to hold
 

3211
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,750
here, right? And then they need to hold
this kind of level. This is what they

3212
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:15,760
this kind of level. This is what they
 

3213
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,750
this kind of level. This is what they
must hold to complete this rotation.

3214
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:17,760
must hold to complete this rotation.
 

3215
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,669
must hold to complete this rotation.
Failing to hold this, they're opening

3216
01:14:19,669 --> 01:14:19,679
Failing to hold this, they're opening
 

3217
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,430
Failing to hold this, they're opening
themselves up for this move back down.

3218
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
themselves up for this move back down.
 

3219
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,070
themselves up for this move back down.
It's flipping gross. You don't want to

3220
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
It's flipping gross. You don't want to
 

3221
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,310
It's flipping gross. You don't want to
lose this level. Really, I don't know

3222
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:26,320
lose this level. Really, I don't know
 

3223
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,950
lose this level. Really, I don't know
where you guys got uh your bids in from,

3224
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
where you guys got uh your bids in from,
 

3225
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,110
where you guys got uh your bids in from,
whether you took the weekly or daily

3226
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,120
whether you took the weekly or daily
 

3227
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,830
whether you took the weekly or daily
reclaims,

3228
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:33,840
reclaims,
 

3229
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,590
reclaims,
or maybe you took the 82s once we got

3230
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
or maybe you took the 82s once we got
 

3231
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,030
or maybe you took the 82s once we got
above the 82s.

3232
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040

 

3233
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,070

becomes a rotation.

3234
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:44,080
becomes a rotation.
 

3235
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,910
becomes a rotation.
Remember, you want to find a bid a

3236
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
Remember, you want to find a bid a
 

3237
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,149
Remember, you want to find a bid a
previous day value area low or above.

3238
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:48,159
previous day value area low or above.
 

3239

previous day value area low or above.
You do not want to lose that. That will

3240
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
You do not want to lose that. That will
 

3241
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,750
You do not want to lose that. That will
create the liquidity that you need to go

3242
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:51,760
create the liquidity that you need to go
 

3243
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,070
create the liquidity that you need to go
higher. All right? This will create the

3244
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:54,080
higher. All right? This will create the
 

3245
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,510
higher. All right? This will create the
liquidity you need to go high because

liquidity you need to go high because
 

3247
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,790
liquidity you need to go high because
then you'll have all the stops in and

3248
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:56,800
then you'll have all the stops in and
 

3249
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,870
then you'll have all the stops in and
then you should then use these stops for

3250
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:58,880
then you should then use these stops for
 

3251
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,470
then you should then use these stops for
a big drive. That's what you're looking

3252
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:00,480
a big drive. That's what you're looking
 

3253
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,110
a big drive. That's what you're looking
for if you're looking to either buy back

3254
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:03,120
for if you're looking to either buy back
 

3255
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,750
for if you're looking to either buy back
in or uh or hold your position that

3256
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:05,760
in or uh or hold your position that
 

3257
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,750
in or uh or hold your position that
you're already in. Um, initial balance

3258
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:07,760
you're already in. Um, initial balance
 

3259
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,590
you're already in. Um, initial balance
now set. So your IB highs is up here as

3260
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:09,600
now set. So your IB highs is up here as
 

3261
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,550
now set. So your IB highs is up here as
well. Technically speaking, we're in a

3262
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
well. Technically speaking, we're in a
 

3263
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,669
well. Technically speaking, we're in a
initial balance rotational day with 250

3264
01:15:15,669 --> 01:15:15,679
initial balance rotational day with 250
 

3265
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,510
initial balance rotational day with 250
odd points for the IB. Let me just check

3266
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
odd points for the IB. Let me just check
 

3267
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,229
odd points for the IB. Let me just check
that. I think that's about right. 250

3268
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
that. I think that's about right. 250
 

3269
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:23,030
that. I think that's about right. 250
260 points on the IB. Right. So here

3270
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,040
260 points on the IB. Right. So here
 

3271
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,270
260 points on the IB. Right. So here
comes the pullback. You will want them

3272
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,280
comes the pullback. You will want them
 

3273
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:36,310
comes the pullback. You will want them
to hold this value area.

3274
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:36,320

 

3275
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,669

I haven't had a good pullback on the

3276
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:37,679
I haven't had a good pullback on the
 

3277
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,830
I haven't had a good pullback on the
market since COVID. I mean, I think I

3278
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:39,840
market since COVID. I mean, I think I
 

3279
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,870
market since COVID. I mean, I think I
don't think that's fair. I think the

3280
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
don't think that's fair. I think the
 

3281
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,350
don't think that's fair. I think the
tariff pullback was pretty good. That

3282
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:43,360
tariff pullback was pretty good. That
 

3283
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:52,550
tariff pullback was pretty good. That
was a pretty good pullback. The tariff,

3284
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:52,560

They got caught offside there. If we
 

3495
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,270
They got caught offside there. If we
protect 70s, we're probably going to go

3496
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:53,280
protect 70s, we're probably going to go
 

3497
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,990
protect 70s, we're probably going to go
higher now.

3498
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:56,000
higher now.
 

3499
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,709

3505
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,590
It's got to be AI trader or whatever
it's called. Here's the test 70s. They

3506
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
it's called. Here's the test 70s. They
 

3507
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,350
it's called. Here's the test 70s. They
need to hold this. If they hold 70s, we

3508
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:07,360
need to hold this. If they hold 70s, we
 

3509
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,870
need to hold this. If they hold 70s, we
go higher. If they don't hold 70s, it's

3510
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
go higher. If they don't hold 70s, it's
 

3511
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,550
go higher. If they don't hold 70s, it's
a problem. We'll snap down to previous

3512
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,560
a problem. We'll snap down to previous
 

3513
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,990
a problem. We'll snap down to previous
day. Okay, not holding it.

3514
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,000
day. Okay, not holding it.
 

3515
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,070
day. Okay, not holding it.
Still not in this. I was trying to get a

3516
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
Still not in this. I was trying to get a
 

3517
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,750
Still not in this. I was trying to get a
limit out into it. I'm kind of glad I

3518
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
limit out into it. I'm kind of glad I
 

3519
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,030
limit out into it. I'm kind of glad I
didn't now. So, here's a retest of value

3520
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:21,040
didn't now. So, here's a retest of value
 

3521
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,070
didn't now. So, here's a retest of value
area low previous day. Now, if they lose

3522
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:24,080
area low previous day. Now, if they lose
 

3523
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,830
area low previous day. Now, if they lose
this, you're going to go either full

3524
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:25,840
this, you're going to go either full
 

3525
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,709
this, you're going to go either full
rotation or a trap underneath. Do we

3526
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:28,719
rotation or a trap underneath. Do we
 

3527
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,550
rotation or a trap underneath. Do we
have What do we have underneath? Is

3528
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:30,560
have What do we have underneath? Is
 

3529
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,870
have What do we have underneath? Is
there an imbalance? No. No. Big five

3530
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:32,880
there an imbalance? No. No. Big five
 

3531
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,310
there an imbalance? No. No. Big five
minute imbalance. One minute imbalance

3532
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:34,320
minute imbalance. One minute imbalance
 

3533
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:44,470
minute imbalance. One minute imbalance
down to 33s. That would be disgusting.

3534
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:44,480

 

3535
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,830

So, you can see this is the area I think

3536
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:45,840
So, you can see this is the area I think
 

3537
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,750
So, you can see this is the area I think
bulls need to hold, right? If they're

3538
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:47,760
bulls need to hold, right? If they're
 

3539
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,149
bulls need to hold, right? If they're
going to go for the rotation back up,

3540
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:50,159
going to go for the rotation back up,
 

3541
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,910
going to go for the rotation back up,
they need to hold this area. If they

3542
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:51,920
they need to hold this area. If they
 

3543
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,350
they need to hold this area. If they
lose this, there's either a trap play.

3544
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:55,360
lose this, there's either a trap play.
 

3545
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,030
lose this, there's either a trap play.
All right. What you need to be careful

3546
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,040
All right. What you need to be careful
 

3547
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,270
All right. What you need to be careful
of is this. There's either a trap play

3548
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
of is this. There's either a trap play
 

3549
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,830
of is this. There's either a trap play
here or they hold this or if they lose

3550
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:01,840
here or they hold this or if they lose
 

3551
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,669
here or they hold this or if they lose
it, we're coming right back down to this

3552
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
it, we're coming right back down to this
 

3553
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:06,870
it, we're coming right back down to this
because we're kind of thin in here.

3554
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:06,880
because we're kind of thin in here.
 

3555
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,990
because we're kind of thin in here.
And that would be my worry.

3556
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:10,000
And that would be my worry.
 

3557
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,229
And that would be my worry.
All right. So, they're losing value. So,

3558
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:12,239
All right. So, they're losing value. So,
 

3559
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,910
All right. So, they're losing value. So,
now it's either a trap play or they're

3560
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:13,920
now it's either a trap play or they're
 

3561
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,350
now it's either a trap play or they're
going to lose all the way down. It's

3562
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360
going to lose all the way down. It's
 

3563
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,629
going to lose all the way down. It's
going to go straight up, straight down.

3564
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:16,639
going to go straight up, straight down.
 

3565
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:17,830
going to go straight up, straight down.
If we're going to do that, we can think

3566
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:17,840
If we're going to do that, we can think
 

3567
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,430
If we're going to do that, we can think
about a fib. Remember, we didn't sweep

3568
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440
about a fib. Remember, we didn't sweep
 

3569
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,189
about a fib. Remember, we didn't sweep
the low. It's the one thing we have to

3570
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
the low. It's the one thing we have to
 

3571
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,950
the low. It's the one thing we have to
bear in mind. We didn't sweep the low.

3572
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:22,960
bear in mind. We didn't sweep the low.
 

3573
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,669
bear in mind. We didn't sweep the low.
Bull flag area is into this 30 50% back

3574
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:25,679
Bull flag area is into this 30 50% back
 

3575
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,510
Bull flag area is into this 30 50% back
pullback will be into that imbalance.

3576
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:27,520
pullback will be into that imbalance.
 

3577
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,030
pullback will be into that imbalance.
That imbalance is at 33s.

3578
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:31,040
That imbalance is at 33s.
 

3579
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,270
That imbalance is at 33s.
And balance is actually up here at 33s.

3580
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,280
And balance is actually up here at 33s.
 

3581
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,790
And balance is actually up here at 33s.
So

3582
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:34,800
So
 

3583
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,270
So
still viable for bulls.

3584
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:39,280

 

3585
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,910

Alex, stop moving that you wally. Stop

3586
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,920
Alex, stop moving that you wally. Stop
 

3587
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:53,750
Alex, stop moving that you wally. Stop
it.

3588
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:53,760

 

3589
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,669

Sellers do keep sending the lows, but

3590
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:55,679
Sellers do keep sending the lows, but
 

3591
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,830
Sellers do keep sending the lows, but
Delta's still heavy here. Not flipping

3592
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:57,840
Delta's still heavy here. Not flipping
 

3593
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,629
Delta's still heavy here. Not flipping
Delta. They're trying to absorb around

3594
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:00,639
Delta. They're trying to absorb around
 

3595
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,110
Delta. They're trying to absorb around
previous days value. Are we at 85s yet?

3596
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,120
previous days value. Are we at 85s yet?
 

3597
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,030
previous days value. Are we at 85s yet?
Not quite. They're trying to reclaim

3598
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:05,040
Not quite. They're trying to reclaim
 

3599
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:16,629
Not quite. They're trying to reclaim
initial balance though on the ES.

3600
01:23:16,629 --> 01:23:16,639

 

3601
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,110

Big battle here. They know it's a

3602
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,120
Big battle here. They know it's a
 

3603
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,470
Big battle here. They know it's a
sensitive level. Something's going to

3604
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:20,480
sensitive level. Something's going to
 

3605
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,990
sensitive level. Something's going to
happen here either way. We can't sit

3606
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:22,000
happen here either way. We can't sit
 

3607
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,270
happen here either way. We can't sit
here for too long. Someone's going to

3608
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:23,280
here for too long. Someone's going to
 

3609
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:33,590
here for too long. Someone's going to
get hurt.

3610
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600

 

3611
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,910

Nice reclaim. Where are those sellers?

3612
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:35,920
Nice reclaim. Where are those sellers?
 

3613
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,830
Nice reclaim. Where are those sellers?
70s.

3614
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:37,840
70s.
 

3615
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,229
70s.
Delta's at 80s. So, it's starting to

3616
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:40,239
Delta's at 80s. So, it's starting to
 

3617
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,669
Delta's at 80s. So, it's starting to
look a little bit better for the bulls

3618
01:23:41,669 --> 01:23:41,679
look a little bit better for the bulls
 

3619
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,270
look a little bit better for the bulls
here. They're holding that previous day

3620
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:43,280
here. They're holding that previous day
 

3621
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,910
here. They're holding that previous day
value area, but uh sellers came in at

3622
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:45,920
value area, but uh sellers came in at
 

3623
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,070
value area, but uh sellers came in at
80s. So, they came in at 70s and 80s.

3624
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:48,080
80s. So, they came in at 70s and 80s.
 

3625
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,830
80s. So, they came in at 70s and 80s.
So, if we get over 70s, we're going to

3626
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
So, if we get over 70s, we're going to
 

3627
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,669
So, if we get over 70s, we're going to
test 80. We get over 80 a squeeze as

3628
01:23:51,669 --> 01:23:51,679
test 80. We get over 80 a squeeze as
 

3629
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,590
test 80. We get over 80 a squeeze as
possible. Just be careful because buyers

3630
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
possible. Just be careful because buyers
 

3631
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,830
possible. Just be careful because buyers
got caught at 90 and above. That's your

3632
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:55,840
got caught at 90 and above. That's your
 

3633
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,149
got caught at 90 and above. That's your
rotation. You just want to see a bit of

3634
01:23:58,149 --> 01:23:58,159
rotation. You just want to see a bit of
 

3635
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,310
rotation. You just want to see a bit of
a delta flip here. Starting to see it

3636
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:00,320
a delta flip here. Starting to see it
 

3637
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:13,110
a delta flip here. Starting to see it
try and creep in.

3638
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120

 

3639
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,709

Yeah, there's definitely a little bit of

3640
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
Yeah, there's definitely a little bit of
 

3641
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,229
Yeah, there's definitely a little bit of
absorption here on the tape. Looking at

3642
01:24:16,229 --> 01:24:16,239
absorption here on the tape. Looking at
 

3643
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:19,030
absorption here on the tape. Looking at
the cumulative delta

3644
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:19,040
the cumulative delta
 

3645
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,870
the cumulative delta
price not dragging down, delta dragging

3646
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:20,880
price not dragging down, delta dragging
 

3647
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,390
price not dragging down, delta dragging
down. We've got an absorber on the tape

3648
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:22,400
down. We've got an absorber on the tape
 

3649
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,310
down. We've got an absorber on the tape
here, which is what we wanted to see.

3650
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:24,320
here, which is what we wanted to see.
 

3651
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,950
here, which is what we wanted to see.
So, can he just step up now and uh drive

3652
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960
So, can he just step up now and uh drive
 

3653
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,709
So, can he just step up now and uh drive
us straight back over the 80s because

3654
01:24:28,709 --> 01:24:28,719
us straight back over the 80s because
 

3655
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,709
us straight back over the 80s because
that's where the sellers came in. You

3656
01:24:30,709 --> 01:24:30,719
that's where the sellers came in. You
 

3657
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,550
that's where the sellers came in. You
got 189 sellside delta at 80. Can we get

3658
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:34,560
got 189 sellside delta at 80. Can we get
 

3659
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,550
got 189 sellside delta at 80. Can we get
over that for a squeeze? Point of

3660
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
over that for a squeeze? Point of
 

3661
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,149
over that for a squeeze? Point of
control just above that as well. So,

3662
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
control just above that as well. So,
 

3663
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,470
control just above that as well. So,
buyers having a good go here. Here we go

3664
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:40,480
buyers having a good go here. Here we go
 

3665
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,310
buyers having a good go here. Here we go
over him. We should be able to squeeze

3666
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,320
over him. We should be able to squeeze
 

3667
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,590
over him. We should be able to squeeze
out now. Should be the start of the

3668
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:43,600
out now. Should be the start of the
 

3669
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,510
out now. Should be the start of the
squeeze. Here's point of control on the

3670
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:45,520
squeeze. Here's point of control on the
 

3671
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,750
squeeze. Here's point of control on the
day. Don't want to lose these 80s. You

3672
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:47,760
day. Don't want to lose these 80s. You
 

3673
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,310
day. Don't want to lose these 80s. You
want to see a shove over 80s. Otherwise,

3674
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:50,320
want to see a shove over 80s. Otherwise,
 

3675
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,950
want to see a shove over 80s. Otherwise,
we're just going to go 70 80 70 80 60 70

3676
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:52,960
we're just going to go 70 80 70 80 60 70
 

3677
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,550
we're just going to go 70 80 70 80 60 70
60 70 and no good. Okay, no good. Then

3678
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:56,560
60 70 and no good. Okay, no good. Then
 

3679
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,110
60 70 and no good. Okay, no good. Then
failed. Failed to hold over 80. Fail

3680
01:24:59,110 --> 01:24:59,120
failed. Failed to hold over 80. Fail
 

3681
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,030
failed. Failed to hold over 80. Fail
point of control on the day. That's what

3682
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:01,040
point of control on the day. That's what
 

3683
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,110
point of control on the day. That's what
we just talked about. This area here

3684
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:03,120
we just talked about. This area here
 

3685
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,030
we just talked about. This area here
sensitive.

3686
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:05,040
sensitive.
 

3687
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,629
sensitive.
This is your fair value on the day. They

3688
01:25:06,629 --> 01:25:06,639
This is your fair value on the day. They
 

3689
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:07,990
This is your fair value on the day. They
had the opportunity to do that. They

3690
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:08,000
had the opportunity to do that. They
 

3691
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,510
had the opportunity to do that. They
just failed. I'd be very careful now

3692
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:09,520
just failed. I'd be very careful now
 

3693
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,070
just failed. I'd be very careful now
about well, one of these moves here.

3694
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,080
about well, one of these moves here.
 

3695
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,390
about well, one of these moves here.
This is the hard thing right now is

3696
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,400
This is the hard thing right now is
 

3697
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,430
This is the hard thing right now is
timing it when they've left such a big

3698
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:19,440
timing it when they've left such a big
 

3699
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,030
timing it when they've left such a big
move.

3700
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:21,040
move.
 

3701
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,470
move.
Do they want to come all the way back

3702
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
Do they want to come all the way back
 

3703
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:27,590
Do they want to come all the way back
down? Very hard timing this

3704
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:27,600
down? Very hard timing this
 

3705
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,350
down? Very hard timing this
seller stuck under 50 right now.

3706
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
seller stuck under 50 right now.
 

3707
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,270
seller stuck under 50 right now.
Retesting that seller at 50. If they let

3708
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,280
Retesting that seller at 50. If they let
 

3709
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,669
Retesting that seller at 50. If they let
him out, we snap. They're aggressively

3710
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:33,679
him out, we snap. They're aggressively
 

3711
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,189
him out, we snap. They're aggressively
selling this. Really aggressively

3712
01:25:35,189 --> 01:25:35,199
selling this. Really aggressively
 

3713
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:36,790
selling this. Really aggressively
selling this. They're flying into this

3714
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:36,800
selling this. They're flying into this
 

3715
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,390
selling this. They're flying into this
book. Here's the new low. So, they're

3716
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,400
book. Here's the new low. So, they're
 

3717
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,510
book. Here's the new low. So, they're
going to keep breaking down here.

3718
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:41,520
going to keep breaking down here.
 

3719
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,790
going to keep breaking down here.
Still no bulls here.

3720
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
Still no bulls here.
 

3721
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,870
Still no bulls here.
They had the opportunity to step up for

3722
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:46,880
They had the opportunity to step up for
 

3723
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,149
They had the opportunity to step up for
like about 30 seconds and failed

3724
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:50,159
like about 30 seconds and failed
 

3725

like about 30 seconds and failed
previous day low here into 28s. Uh got

01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:53,440
previous day low here into 28s. Uh got
 

3727
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,270
previous day low here into 28s. Uh got
an imbalance here at uh 33 to 31 by side

3728
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,280
an imbalance here at uh 33 to 31 by side

imbalance.

3730
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:02,880

 

3731
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,750

We're starting to see that pull back.

3732
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:05,760
We're starting to see that pull back.
 

3733
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,149
We're starting to see that pull back.
Did we ever take this high? No. I

3734
01:26:10,149 --> 01:26:10,159
Did we ever take this high? No. I
 

3735
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,390
Did we ever take this high? No. I
if we' taken this out, I'd feel so much

3736
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:12,400
if we' taken this out, I'd feel so much
 

3737
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,550
if we' taken this out, I'd feel so much
more bullish. If we' taken this out, it

3738
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:14,560
more bullish. If we' taken this out, it
 

3739
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,149
more bullish. If we' taken this out, it
would be much easier for me to really

3740
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:16,159
would be much easier for me to really
 

3741
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,310
would be much easier for me to really
think about trying to attack this high

3742
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
think about trying to attack this high
 

3743
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,669
think about trying to attack this high
side. The fact that we haven't taken

3744
01:26:19,669 --> 01:26:19,679
side. The fact that we haven't taken
 

3745
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,709
side. The fact that we haven't taken
this is a little bit concerning, but

3746
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:22,719
this is a little bit concerning, but
 

3747
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,030
this is a little bit concerning, but
there's your ledge.

3748
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:25,040
there's your ledge.
 

3749
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,310
there's your ledge.
If they lose it, they're going to come

3750
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,320
If they lose it, they're going to come
 

3751
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,790
If they lose it, they're going to come
back to here. Previous week's value and

3752
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:28,800
back to here. Previous week's value and
 

3753
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,550
back to here. Previous week's value and
a ledge. We're very, very thin in here.

3754
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:32,560
a ledge. We're very, very thin in here.
 

3755
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,189
a ledge. We're very, very thin in here.
I'm still bullish in it in based on what

3756
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
I'm still bullish in it in based on what
 

3757
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,950
I'm still bullish in it in based on what
I'm seeing because we've reclaimed but

3758
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960
I'm seeing because we've reclaimed but
 

3759
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,189
I'm seeing because we've reclaimed but
uh we've losing this. I still think

3760
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:39,199
uh we've losing this. I still think
 

3761
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:46,790
uh we've losing this. I still think
bulls are not done yet.

3762
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:46,800

 

3763
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,310

Go all the way to the bottom. I don't

3764
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:48,320
Go all the way to the bottom. I don't
 

3765
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,510
Go all the way to the bottom. I don't
think we're going to go all the way to

3766
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:49,520
think we're going to go all the way to
 

3767
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,830
think we're going to go all the way to
the bottom. Spy holding 85. I think it's

3768
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:51,840
the bottom. Spy holding 85. I think it's
 

3769
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,189
the bottom. Spy holding 85. I think it's
a pullback which is likely to be

3770
01:26:53,189 --> 01:26:53,199
a pullback which is likely to be
 

3771
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,430
a pullback which is likely to be
absorbed unless something changes. The

3772
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,440
absorbed unless something changes. The
 

3773
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,430
absorbed unless something changes. The
question the only question is when are

3774
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:57,440
question the only question is when are
 

3775
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,910
question the only question is when are
bulls willing to step in? If everyone's

3776
01:26:59,910 --> 01:26:59,920
bulls willing to step in? If everyone's
 

3777
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,629
bulls willing to step in? If everyone's
like me been not playing the V-shaped

3778
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:02,639
like me been not playing the V-shaped
 

3779
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,030
like me been not playing the V-shaped
recovery, you're waiting for a pullback.

3780
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,040
recovery, you're waiting for a pullback.
 

3781
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,070
recovery, you're waiting for a pullback.
You're waiting for an area to hold. They

3782
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,080
You're waiting for an area to hold. They
 

3783
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,550
You're waiting for an area to hold. They
had the opportunity.

3784
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
had the opportunity.
 

3785
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,550
had the opportunity.
This is the bull flag area. If this is a

3786
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:12,560
This is the bull flag area. If this is a
 

3787
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,149
This is the bull flag area. If this is a
two-leg, this is the bull flag area.

3788
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:14,159
two-leg, this is the bull flag area.
 

3789
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:17,590
two-leg, this is the bull flag area.
Otherwise, 61 fib. Think about 61 fib is

3790
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:17,600
Otherwise, 61 fib. Think about 61 fib is
 

3791
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,030
Otherwise, 61 fib. Think about 61 fib is
also lining up with the previous week

3792
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:19,040
also lining up with the previous week
 

3793
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,350
also lining up with the previous week
value area low and the current shelf.

3794
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:21,360
value area low and the current shelf.
 

3795
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,510
value area low and the current shelf.
All right. So, maybe they're going to

3796
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:23,520
All right. So, maybe they're going to
 

3797
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,830
All right. So, maybe they're going to
hang out here.

3798
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:25,840
hang out here.
 

3799
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,629
hang out here.
Maybe if they can't get involved in a

3800
01:27:28,629 --> 01:27:28,639
Maybe if they can't get involved in a
 

3801
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:36,470
Maybe if they can't get involved in a
bull flag higher.

3802
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:36,480

 

3803
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,390

But uh we're now developing potentially

3804
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:38,400
But uh we're now developing potentially
 

3805
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,870
But uh we're now developing potentially
a micro head and shoulder for that wash.

3806
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:40,880
a micro head and shoulder for that wash.
 

3807
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,709
a micro head and shoulder for that wash.
What will that measured move be? Will

3808
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:42,719
What will that measured move be? Will
 

3809
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,709
What will that measured move be? Will
that be if we call this the neckline?

3810
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719
that be if we call this the neckline?
 

3811
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,750
that be if we call this the neckline?
Where's the 100%.

3812
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:47,760
Where's the 100%.
 

3813
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,030
Where's the 100%.
Oh mate, there's so many factors here

3814
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,040
Oh mate, there's so many factors here
 

3815
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,189
Oh mate, there's so many factors here
going against each other. This is not a

3816
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
going against each other. This is not a
 

3817
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:57,750
going against each other. This is not a
high confluence setup.

3818
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:57,760

 

3819
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,070

Spy still above 85. Still in its initial

Spy still above 85. Still in its initial
 

3821
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,070
Spy still above 85. Still in its initial
balance. All right, let me use the

3822
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:02,080
balance. All right, let me use the
 

3823
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,669
balance. All right, let me use the
bathroom while this does whatever it's

3824
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:03,679
bathroom while this does whatever it's
 

3825
01:28:03,679 --> 01:29:20,229
bathroom while this does whatever it's
going to do and we'll come back.

3826
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:20,239

 

3827
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:22,550

still selling. They just aggressively

3828
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:22,560
still selling. They just aggressively
 

3829
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,510
still selling. They just aggressively
sold 27s there. Are there any bids

3830
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:25,520
sold 27s there. Are there any bids
 

3831
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,550
sold 27s there. Are there any bids
stacking up on the book?

3832
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:28,560
stacking up on the book?
 

3833
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,390
stacking up on the book?
It's the first time seen a little bit of

3834
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
It's the first time seen a little bit of
 

3835
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,990
It's the first time seen a little bit of
a reaction here, but there's still sell

3836
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:32,000
a reaction here, but there's still sell
 

3837
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,669
a reaction here, but there's still sell
sign and balance at 550. We've started

3838
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:33,679
sign and balance at 550. We've started
 

3839
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,430
sign and balance at 550. We've started
to lose previous days value area low.

3840
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:35,440
to lose previous days value area low.
 

3841
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,669
to lose previous days value area low.
This is

3842
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:37,679
This is
 

3843
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,149
This is
basically, how can I best say this?

3844
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
basically, how can I best say this?
 

3845
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,229
basically, how can I best say this?
Weekly and daily traders are trading uh

01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:52,950
Weekly and daily traders are trading uh
against each other right now.

3848
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960

 

3849
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,229

I don't think they really know what they

3850
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:54,239
I don't think they really know what they
 

3851
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,669
I don't think they really know what they
want to do with it. I just think it's

3852
01:29:55,669 --> 01:29:55,679
want to do with it. I just think it's
 

3853
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:59,030
want to do with it. I just think it's
gamma exposure. SPY still holding IB. ES

gamma exposure. SPY still holding IB. ES

weakness here. Unsurprising when we look

3860
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:04,880
weakness here. Unsurprising when we look
 

3861
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,229
weakness here. Unsurprising when we look
across the mag and we see what's

3862
01:30:06,229 --> 01:30:06,239
across the mag and we see what's
 

3863
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,390
across the mag and we see what's
happening. Look at Oracle. Look at

3864
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:08,400
happening. Look at Oracle. Look at
 

3865
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,590
happening. Look at Oracle. Look at
Tesla. Look at Nvidia all in big sales.

3866
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:11,600
Tesla. Look at Nvidia all in big sales.
 

3867
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,950
Tesla. Look at Nvidia all in big sales.
But here we go. Here's the attempt to

3868
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:12,960
But here we go. Here's the attempt to
 

3869
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,790
But here we go. Here's the attempt to
reclaim value. Okay, so those sellers

3870
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,800
reclaim value. Okay, so those sellers
 

3871
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,510
reclaim value. Okay, so those sellers
underneath 30 did get stuck. This is the

3872
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:17,520
underneath 30 did get stuck. This is the
 

3873
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,669
underneath 30 did get stuck. This is the
attempt to reclaim value. They must

3874
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
attempt to reclaim value. They must
 

3875
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,510
attempt to reclaim value. They must
reclaim these levels. And the problem

3876
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:21,520
reclaim these levels. And the problem
 

3877
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,149
reclaim these levels. And the problem
now is if you're going to be bullish,

3878
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:24,159
now is if you're going to be bullish,
 

3879
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,390
now is if you're going to be bullish,
okay? You have to respect this level up

3880
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
okay? You have to respect this level up
 

3881
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,910
okay? You have to respect this level up
here. You have to unfortunately. All

3882
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:29,920
here. You have to unfortunately. All
 

3883
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,030
here. You have to unfortunately. All
right? So, if they're going to be

3884
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:31,040
right? So, if they're going to be
 

3885
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,870
right? So, if they're going to be
bullish, you need this. And really, you

3886
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:32,880
bullish, you need this. And really, you
 

3887
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,110
bullish, you need this. And really, you
want a bid over this. You want to use

3888
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:35,120
want a bid over this. You want to use
 

3889
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,149
want a bid over this. You want to use
pain here to move higher. Like I said, I

3890
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:38,159
pain here to move higher. Like I said, I
 

3891
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,590
pain here to move higher. Like I said, I
think they have the ability to do it,

3892
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:39,600
think they have the ability to do it,
 

3893
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,189
think they have the ability to do it,
but timing it's going to be hard. This

3894
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
but timing it's going to be hard. This
 

3895
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:42,229
but timing it's going to be hard. This
is the first time we've seen some

3896
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:42,239
is the first time we've seen some
 

3897
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:45,270
is the first time we've seen some
sellers trapped. We can see it. Bring

3898
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:45,280
sellers trapped. We can see it. Bring
 

3899
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,629
sellers trapped. We can see it. Bring
this up. Hope you can see this right

3900
01:30:46,629 --> 01:30:46,639
this up. Hope you can see this right
 

3901
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:47,910
this up. Hope you can see this right
under here. You can see these sellers.

3902
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:47,920
under here. You can see these sellers.
 

3903
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,830
under here. You can see these sellers.
This is all sellside under sort of 40,

3904
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
This is all sellside under sort of 40,
 

3905
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:57,910
This is all sellside under sort of 40,
but definitely under 29s.

3906
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:57,920

 

3907
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,510

So, you wouldn't want this really to

3908
01:30:59,510 --> 01:30:59,520
So, you wouldn't want this really to
 

3909
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,390
So, you wouldn't want this really to
come under 40. Now, you want to reclaim

3910
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:02,400
come under 40. Now, you want to reclaim
 

3911
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,390
come under 40. Now, you want to reclaim
value. You really, really, really want

3912
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:04,400
value. You really, really, really want
 

3913
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,229
value. You really, really, really want
to reclaim value. If you've got a shot

3914
01:31:06,229 --> 01:31:06,239
to reclaim value. If you've got a shot
 

3915
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,629
to reclaim value. If you've got a shot
here of really driving back out, you

3916
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:08,639
here of really driving back out, you
 

3917
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:20,470
here of really driving back out, you
want to reclaim value.

3918
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:20,480

 

3919
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,510

Yeah, exactly. It it is it's the level

3920
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:23,520
Yeah, exactly. It it is it's the level
 

3921
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,310
Yeah, exactly. It it is it's the level
that we broke down from from 5:00 a.m.

3922
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:26,320
that we broke down from from 5:00 a.m.
 

3923
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,390
that we broke down from from 5:00 a.m.
this morning,

3924
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,400
this morning,
 

3925
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,870
this morning,
but there's

3926
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:30,880
but there's
 

3927
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,030
but there's
542 could potentially find a bid.

3928
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:35,040
542 could potentially find a bid.
 

3929
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,030
542 could potentially find a bid.
600 could potentially sell, but we poked

3930
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,040
600 could potentially sell, but we poked
 

3931
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,350
600 could potentially sell, but we poked
through it. So, it's like I just think

3932
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:39,360
through it. So, it's like I just think
 

3933
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,950
through it. So, it's like I just think
you've got a battle of time frames right

3934
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:40,960
you've got a battle of time frames right
 

3935
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,070
you've got a battle of time frames right
now.

3936
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:44,080

 

3937
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,390

You have a battle of time frames.

3938
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:46,400
You have a battle of time frames.
 

3939
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,070
You have a battle of time frames.
They're trying to sell this again. Heavy

3940
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:48,080
They're trying to sell this again. Heavy
 

3941
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,390
They're trying to sell this again. Heavy
delta coming in here again. Now, if they

3942
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:50,400
delta coming in here again. Now, if they
 

3943
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,830
delta coming in here again. Now, if they
don't get a breakdown, this will be a

3944
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:51,840
don't get a breakdown, this will be a
 

3945
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:59,430
don't get a breakdown, this will be a
clue.

3946
01:31:59,430 --> 01:31:59,440

 

3947
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,430

Is there a passive buyer here? We're not

3948
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
Is there a passive buyer here? We're not
 

3949
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,669
Is there a passive buyer here? We're not
breaking down now. We're starting to

3950
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679
breaking down now. We're starting to
 

3951
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,110
breaking down now. We're starting to
break down. Are they going to take out

3952
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,120
break down. Are they going to take out
 

3953
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,750
break down. Are they going to take out
this guy? Where did I say it was? 29s.

3954
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:07,760
this guy? Where did I say it was? 29s.
 

3955
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,510
this guy? Where did I say it was? 29s.
Aggressive selling into 29s. And they

3956
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:09,520
Aggressive selling into 29s. And they
 

3957
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,510
Aggressive selling into 29s. And they
haven't got their way yet. Doesn't mean

3958
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:11,520
haven't got their way yet. Doesn't mean
 

3959
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:19,270
haven't got their way yet. Doesn't mean
they don't.

3960
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:19,280

 

3961
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,790

There's the 29 test. Buyers need to come

3962
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:22,800
There's the 29 test. Buyers need to come
 

3963
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,950
There's the 29 test. Buyers need to come
get us back above 35 here to leave these

3964
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:24,960
get us back above 35 here to leave these
 

3965
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,390
get us back above 35 here to leave these
sellers stuck. Otherwise, we can still

3966
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:26,400
sellers stuck. Otherwise, we can still
 

3967
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,030
sellers stuck. Otherwise, we can still
wash. 29 test. So, still washing. Still

3968
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
wash. 29 test. So, still washing. Still
 

3969
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,189
wash. 29 test. So, still washing. Still
no alignment.

3970
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:33,199

 

3971
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,030

I just think SPY is going to come all

3972
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:35,040
I just think SPY is going to come all
 

3973
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,870
I just think SPY is going to come all
the way back down to 85 and then make a

3974
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:36,880
the way back down to 85 and then make a
 

3975
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,790
the way back down to 85 and then make a
decision. I just feel like that is all

3976
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:38,800
decision. I just feel like that is all
 

3977
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,669
decision. I just feel like that is all
we're going to do. I have maintained

3978
01:32:41,669 --> 01:32:41,679
we're going to do. I have maintained
 

3979
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,669
we're going to do. I have maintained
this uh thought process for a while now.

3980
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
this uh thought process for a while now.
 

3981
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,910
this uh thought process for a while now.
I think option dealers are in absolute

3982
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:45,920
I think option dealers are in absolute
 

3983
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,990
I think option dealers are in absolute
control of the market. probably because

3984
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:50,000
control of the market. probably because
 

3985
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,830
control of the market. probably because
they don't know how to hedge this right

3986
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:51,840
they don't know how to hedge this right
 

3987
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,030
they don't know how to hedge this right
now because they're not sure what we're

3988
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:53,040
now because they're not sure what we're
 

3989
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,830
now because they're not sure what we're
going to do. Definitely in stagflation.

3990
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:55,840
going to do. Definitely in stagflation.
 

3991
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,390
going to do. Definitely in stagflation.
So, they're like, "Well, let's let's

3992
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:58,400
So, they're like, "Well, let's let's
 

3993
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,830
So, they're like, "Well, let's let's
just pin this market." Okay, here's a

3994
01:32:59,830 --> 01:32:59,840
just pin this market." Okay, here's a
 

3995
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,110
just pin this market." Okay, here's a
move down to 85s, 8513s,

3996
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,120
move down to 85s, 8513s,
 

3997
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,910
move down to 85s, 8513s,
8514s, 8512s.

3998
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:05,920
8514s, 8512s.
 

3999
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,070
8514s, 8512s.
They're trying to pin this down to 85s,

4000
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,080
They're trying to pin this down to 85s,
 

4001
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,430
They're trying to pin this down to 85s,
and then they can make a decision maybe

4002
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:09,440
and then they can make a decision maybe
 

4003
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:26,629
and then they can make a decision maybe
once they get to 85s.

4004
01:33:26,629 --> 01:33:26,639

 

4005
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:28,470

notice my IPs are wrong. My other chart

4006
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:28,480
notice my IPs are wrong. My other chart
 

4007
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,590
notice my IPs are wrong. My other chart
there we go is better. Right. So 85 test

4008
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:31,600
there we go is better. Right. So 85 test
 

4009
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,750
there we go is better. Right. So 85 test
spy

4010
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:33,760
spy
 

4011
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,110
spy
and we might come all the way down to

4012
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:35,120
and we might come all the way down to
 

4013
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,669
and we might come all the way down to
this box that we talked about

4014
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
this box that we talked about
 

4015
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,149
this box that we talked about
and that would be the kind of 61 and

4016
01:33:40,149 --> 01:33:40,159
and that would be the kind of 61 and
 

4017
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:42,229
and that would be the kind of 61 and
previous week value and the edge this

4018
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,239
previous week value and the edge this
 

4019
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:46,149
previous week value and the edge this
current edge giving back this whole move

4020
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
current edge giving back this whole move
 

4021
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:49,189
current edge giving back this whole move
straight up straight down last night

4022
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:49,199
straight up straight down last night
 

4023
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,629
straight up straight down last night
straight up again this well straight

4024
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:50,639
straight up again this well straight
 

4025
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,390
straight up again this well straight
down this morning again then straight

4026
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:52,400
down this morning again then straight
 

4027
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,830
down this morning again then straight
back up and then straight back down.

4028
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:53,840
back up and then straight back down.
 

4029
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,870
back up and then straight back down.
We're just not finding uh or not

4030
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:56,880
We're just not finding uh or not
 

4031
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,110
We're just not finding uh or not
building anything out yet but it will

4032
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
building anything out yet but it will
 

4033
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,510
building anything out yet but it will
come. We're losing 85s now on the spy.

4034
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,520
come. We're losing 85s now on the spy.
 

4035
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,590
come. We're losing 85s now on the spy.
VWAP's the next spot. This is looking

4036
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:03,600
VWAP's the next spot. This is looking
 

4037
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,550
VWAP's the next spot. This is looking
very ugly for this market. How have we

4038
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:06,560
very ugly for this market. How have we
 

4039
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,709
very ugly for this market. How have we
gone back into range and lost range

4040
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:08,719
gone back into range and lost range
 

4041
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,070
gone back into range and lost range
again? Why not reject it this morning on

4042
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,080
again? Why not reject it this morning on
 

4043
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,750
again? Why not reject it this morning on
the retest? Why do these silly things at

4044
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:15,760
the retest? Why do these silly things at
 

4045
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,110
the retest? Why do these silly things at
the point of controls are the only thing

4046
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,120
the point of controls are the only thing
 

4047
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,990
the point of controls are the only thing
being traded at at the moment? So,

4048
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:20,000
being traded at at the moment? So,
 

4049
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,990
being traded at at the moment? So,
previous week value low, next stop

4050
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,000
previous week value low, next stop
 

4051
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,149
previous week value low, next stop
likely then I would assume and if we

4052
01:34:24,149 --> 01:34:24,159
likely then I would assume and if we
 

4053
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:25,830
likely then I would assume and if we
lose that then probably the Globeex low

4054
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:25,840
lose that then probably the Globeex low
 

4055
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:34,229
lose that then probably the Globeex low
because we didn't take it this morning.

4056
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:34,239

 

4057
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:35,669

I don't think it's choppiness. I think

4058
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:35,679
I don't think it's choppiness. I think
 

4059
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:38,629
I don't think it's choppiness. I think
it's actually the the opposite. It's

4060
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:38,639
it's actually the the opposite. It's
 

4061
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,870
it's actually the the opposite. It's
it's a lack of liquidity.

4062
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:42,880

 

4063
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,550

It's a lack of liquidity. So, bulls want

4064
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:44,560
It's a lack of liquidity. So, bulls want
 

4065
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,950
It's a lack of liquidity. So, bulls want
to defend this blue box. If they don't

4066
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:46,960
to defend this blue box. If they don't
 

4067
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,390
to defend this blue box. If they don't
defend the blue box, then we're going to

4068
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:48,400
defend the blue box, then we're going to
 

4069
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,669
defend the blue box, then we're going to
we're going to go all the way for the

4070
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:49,679
we're going to go all the way for the
 

4071
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,990
we're going to go all the way for the
globe slow. They can't defend this,

4072
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:52,000
globe slow. They can't defend this,
 

4073
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,750
globe slow. They can't defend this,
we're going for globeex low. Simple as

4074
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:53,760
we're going for globeex low. Simple as
 

4075
01:34:53,760 --> 01:35:00,070
we're going for globeex low. Simple as
that.

4076
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080

 

4077
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,229

I've watched this 85 test on spy. Going

4078
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,239
I've watched this 85 test on spy. Going
 

4079
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,709
I've watched this 85 test on spy. Going
to back test it now. If they lose that

4080
01:35:04,709 --> 01:35:04,719
to back test it now. If they lose that
 

4081
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:11,669
to back test it now. If they lose that
wash is available.

4082
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:11,679

 

4083
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:22,070

Failed the back test. So far

4084
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:22,080

 

4085
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,149

back to be what spy. If it loses if it

4086
01:35:24,149 --> 01:35:24,159
back to be what spy. If it loses if it
 

4087
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:26,149
back to be what spy. If it loses if it
loses that we're going back down and

4088
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:26,159
loses that we're going back down and
 

4089
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,790
loses that we're going back down and
it's starting to lose it. So previous

4090
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:28,800
it's starting to lose it. So previous
 

4091
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,390
it's starting to lose it. So previous
week value area low this level key now.

4092
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:30,400
week value area low this level key now.
 

4093
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,830
week value area low this level key now.
If they lose this we're going back to

4094
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:31,840
If they lose this we're going back to
 

4095
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,910
If they lose this we're going back to
the GlobeEx lows in my opinion. This is

4096
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:33,920
the GlobeEx lows in my opinion. This is
 

4097
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,750
the GlobeEx lows in my opinion. This is
the last chance to loom for for buyers.

4098
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:35,760
the last chance to loom for for buyers.
 

4099
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,110
the last chance to loom for for buyers.
They need to come in here and here now.

4100
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:37,120
They need to come in here and here now.
 

4101
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,629
They need to come in here and here now.
If they don't we're coming back down

4102
01:35:38,629 --> 01:35:38,639
If they don't we're coming back down
 

4103
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,550
If they don't we're coming back down
here. So they ended up doing a deep

4104
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,560
here. So they ended up doing a deep
 

4105
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,390
here. So they ended up doing a deep
pull. If they don't hold this then I

4106
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:42,400
pull. If they don't hold this then I
 

4107
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,830
pull. If they don't hold this then I
think there is a sell all the way back

4108
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
think there is a sell all the way back
 

4109
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,430
think there is a sell all the way back
down. Look at the lack of structure both

4110
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:45,440
down. Look at the lack of structure both
 

4111
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,830
down. Look at the lack of structure both
sides. It's ugly. So here's previous

4112
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:47,840
sides. It's ugly. So here's previous
 

4113
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,590
sides. It's ugly. So here's previous
week value area low. Are we going to

4114
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:49,600
week value area low. Are we going to
 

4115
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,189
week value area low. Are we going to
continue to sell through this now and go

4116
01:35:51,189 --> 01:35:51,199
continue to sell through this now and go
 

4117
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:54,070
continue to sell through this now and go
for low of day?

4118
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,080
for low of day?
 

4119
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,030
for low of day?
I'd say it feels like yes. It definitely

4120
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:57,040
I'd say it feels like yes. It definitely
 

4121
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:06,070
I'd say it feels like yes. It definitely
feels like yes at the moment.

4122
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:06,080

 

4123
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,110

ESF VWAP. See how Spy back tested that

4124
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:09,120
ESF VWAP. See how Spy back tested that
 

4125
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:12,950
ESF VWAP. See how Spy back tested that
85 once it came under it and lost it.

4126
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:12,960
85 once it came under it and lost it.
 

4127
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,550
85 once it came under it and lost it.
Very, very thin both sides here. You're

4128
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:14,560
Very, very thin both sides here. You're
 

4129
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,590
Very, very thin both sides here. You're
going to have to be careful if you're

4130
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:15,600
going to have to be careful if you're
 

4131
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,510
going to have to be careful if you're
going to play this. This is crazy thin.

4132
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
going to play this. This is crazy thin.
 

4133
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,030
going to play this. This is crazy thin.
I think we're going to come to Globeex

4134
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:19,040
I think we're going to come to Globeex
 

4135
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,669
I think we're going to come to Globeex
low at this point though. We've lost the

4136
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:21,679
low at this point though. We've lost the
 

4137
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,590
low at this point though. We've lost the
key levels.

4138
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:23,600
key levels.
 

4139
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,750
key levels.
Problem is we lack liquidity. It doesn't

4140
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:25,760
Problem is we lack liquidity. It doesn't
 

4141
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,709
Problem is we lack liquidity. It doesn't
need to drive up to 8530s

4142
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:28,719
need to drive up to 8530s
 

4143
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,870
need to drive up to 8530s
again.

4144
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:30,880
again.
 

4145
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,270
again.
Here we go. So 84 is now on SPY. So once

4146
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:33,280
Here we go. So 84 is now on SPY. So once
 

4147
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,950
Here we go. So 84 is now on SPY. So once
it lost at 85, that was very, very

4148
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:34,960
it lost at 85, that was very, very
 

4149
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:39,110
it lost at 85, that was very, very
quick.

4150
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:39,120

 

4151
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,270

Losing previous week area low here. I

4152
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,280
Losing previous week area low here. I
 

4153
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,229
Losing previous week area low here. I
think we're probably going to trade down

4154
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
think we're probably going to trade down
 

4155
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:43,510
think we're probably going to trade down
to the lows. It's just a question if

4156
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,520
to the lows. It's just a question if
 

4157
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,870
to the lows. It's just a question if
they pop it up first.

4158
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:46,880
they pop it up first.
 

4159
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,270
they pop it up first.
VIX finding a bid after filling its gap.

4160
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:51,280
VIX finding a bid after filling its gap.
 

4161
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,109
VIX finding a bid after filling its gap.
This is tricky here. Previous week value

4162
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
This is tricky here. Previous week value
 

4163
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,709
This is tricky here. Previous week value
area low. So bulls trying to defend

4164
01:36:54,709 --> 01:36:54,719
area low. So bulls trying to defend
 

4165
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,550
area low. So bulls trying to defend
this. I would say at this point bears

4166
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:56,560
this. I would say at this point bears
 

4167
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,830
this. I would say at this point bears
will want to sell this, sell this, sell

4168
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:57,840
will want to sell this, sell this, sell
 

4169
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,109
will want to sell this, sell this, sell
this. This is what they want to do to

4170
01:36:59,109 --> 01:36:59,119
this. This is what they want to do to
 

4171
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,950
this. This is what they want to do to
complete it. Bulls will want to do this,

4172
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:00,960
complete it. Bulls will want to do this,
 

4173
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,390
complete it. Bulls will want to do this,
this, this, this. I think bulls are on

4174
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:04,400
this, this, this. I think bulls are on
 

4175
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:13,430
this, this, this. I think bulls are on
in a bit of danger here.

4176
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:13,440

 

4177
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:23,510

Big level here for sure.

4178
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:23,520

 

4179
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,109

Asia logo looks good. Yeah, it does

4180
01:37:25,109 --> 01:37:25,119
Asia logo looks good. Yeah, it does
 

4181
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:26,550
Asia logo looks good. Yeah, it does
potentially look good. I'm not going to

4182
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:26,560
potentially look good. I'm not going to
 

4183
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,070
potentially look good. I'm not going to
deny that. I think potentially looks

4184
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:28,080
deny that. I think potentially looks
 

4185
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,910
deny that. I think potentially looks
good if you lose value.

4186
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:31,920
good if you lose value.
 

4187
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,270
good if you lose value.
But I think uh

4188
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:35,280
But I think uh
 

4189
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,550
But I think uh
bears need to defend 520s basically. I

4190
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:38,560
bears need to defend 520s basically. I
 

4191
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,189
bears need to defend 520s basically. I
think that's the level. 520s. 500 maybe.

4192
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:41,199
think that's the level. 520s. 500 maybe.
 

4193
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:42,550
think that's the level. 520s. 500 maybe.
There's some buy side delta there at

4194
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
There's some buy side delta there at
 

4195
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:48,950
There's some buy side delta there at
500, but 520 is somewhere up here. So,

4196
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
500, but 520 is somewhere up here. So,
 

4197
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,709
500, but 520 is somewhere up here. So,
there's the hold of this blue level. I

4198
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:50,719
there's the hold of this blue level. I
 

4199
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:51,910
there's the hold of this blue level. I
still think bears have got a chance

4200
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:51,920
still think bears have got a chance
 

4201
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,590
still think bears have got a chance
here, but you know, this market's done

4202
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:53,600
here, but you know, this market's done
 

4203
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,870
here, but you know, this market's done
weird things this morning. It's been

4204
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
weird things this morning. It's been
 

4205
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,669
weird things this morning. It's been
V-shaped recovery and then uh V-shaped

4206
01:37:57,669 --> 01:37:57,679
V-shaped recovery and then uh V-shaped
 

4207
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:59,030
V-shaped recovery and then uh V-shaped
recovery and I don't know what you call

4208
01:37:59,030 --> 01:37:59,040
recovery and I don't know what you call
 

4209
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,350
recovery and I don't know what you call
this. What's that move? Reverse V-shaped

4210
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:01,360
this. What's that move? Reverse V-shaped
 

4211
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,669
this. What's that move? Reverse V-shaped
down. Maybe we go V-shaped recovery back

4212
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:03,679
down. Maybe we go V-shaped recovery back
 

4213
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:09,109
down. Maybe we go V-shaped recovery back
to the 20s and 30s. Now,

4214
01:38:09,109 --> 01:38:09,119

 

4215
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,910

we lack liquidity or or we lack

4216
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:11,920
we lack liquidity or or we lack
 

4217
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,030
we lack liquidity or or we lack
structure is probably a better way of

4218
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:13,040
structure is probably a better way of
 

4219
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,790
structure is probably a better way of
putting it. So, the moves happen sharp

4220
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:14,800
putting it. So, the moves happen sharp
 

4221
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,229
putting it. So, the moves happen sharp
and fast.

4222
01:38:16,229 --> 01:38:16,239
and fast.
 

4223
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:22,629
and fast.
just up my phone.

4224
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:22,639

 

4225
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:26,149

It's my wife. Probably shouldn't

4226
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:26,159
It's my wife. Probably shouldn't
 

4227
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:29,030
It's my wife. Probably shouldn't
get a slap.

4228
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:29,040
get a slap.
 

4229
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,590
get a slap.
Okay, 500 test 520s above that. That's

4230
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:31,600
Okay, 500 test 520s above that. That's
 

4231
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,510
Okay, 500 test 520s above that. That's
the level. Bears need to defend. Uh they

4232
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:33,520
the level. Bears need to defend. Uh they
 

4233
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,990
the level. Bears need to defend. Uh they
need a breakdown underneath value.

4234
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:38,000

 

4235
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,750

So 500 or I'd say 98. There's some delta

4236
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
So 500 or I'd say 98. There's some delta
 

4237
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,629
So 500 or I'd say 98. There's some delta
there at 98. Buyers do look a little bit

4238
01:38:44,629 --> 01:38:44,639
there at 98. Buyers do look a little bit
 

4239
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,310
there at 98. Buyers do look a little bit
trapped right now in and around there,

4240
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
trapped right now in and around there,
 

4241
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,310
trapped right now in and around there,
but uh last time we said that we just

4242
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:48,320
but uh last time we said that we just
 

4243
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:54,629
but uh last time we said that we just
went straight upside. So,

4244
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:54,639

 

4245
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,870

previous week value still holding this

4246
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:56,880
previous week value still holding this
 

4247
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,950
previous week value still holding this
blue box. We had the chance to sort of

4248
01:38:58,950 --> 01:38:58,960
blue box. We had the chance to sort of
 

4249
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,310
blue box. We had the chance to sort of
break and use it as resistance. We're

4250
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:00,320
break and use it as resistance. We're
 

4251
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,830
break and use it as resistance. We're
not. We're going to bid back up towards

4252
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:01,840
not. We're going to bid back up towards
 

4253
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,910
not. We're going to bid back up towards
here now by the looks of it. Anywhere

4254
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:03,920
here now by the looks of it. Anywhere
 

4255
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,750
here now by the looks of it. Anywhere
from here, bears will need to defend and

4256
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:05,760
from here, bears will need to defend and
 

4257
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,390
from here, bears will need to defend and
look for that. If we get this move here,

4258
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:08,400
look for that. If we get this move here,
 

4259
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,470
look for that. If we get this move here,
I'm interested. Uh, I want to be very

4260
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:10,480
I'm interested. Uh, I want to be very
 

4261
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,910
I'm interested. Uh, I want to be very
careful because if we don't and we get

4262
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:11,920
careful because if we don't and we get
 

4263
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,109
careful because if we don't and we get
this move, we can go straight back

4264
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:13,119
this move, we can go straight back
 

4265
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:14,790
this move, we can go straight back
upside. Why am I going like, "Oh, it can

4266
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:14,800
upside. Why am I going like, "Oh, it can
 

4267
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,390
upside. Why am I going like, "Oh, it can
do this or it can do this." Well,

4268
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:16,400
do this or it can do this." Well,
 

4269
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,910
do this or it can do this." Well,
there's your weekly level. There's your

4270
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:17,920
there's your weekly level. There's your
 

4271
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,910
there's your weekly level. There's your
daily level. Failed. Daily level holding

4272
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:19,920
daily level. Failed. Daily level holding
 

4273
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,990
daily level. Failed. Daily level holding
weekly level. This is the problem. We're

4274
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:22,000
weekly level. This is the problem. We're
 

4275
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,350
weekly level. This is the problem. We're
not in alignment right now. Once we find

4276
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:25,360
not in alignment right now. Once we find
 

4277
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,870
not in alignment right now. Once we find
alignment like we had this morning was

4278
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:28,880
alignment like we had this morning was
 

4279
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,270
alignment like we had this morning was
really nice smooth trend, but we've lost

4280
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:31,280
really nice smooth trend, but we've lost
 

4281
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,790
really nice smooth trend, but we've lost
alignment. We've gone back into

4282
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:32,800
alignment. We've gone back into
 

4283
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,390
alignment. We've gone back into
rotational markets.

4284
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:36,400
rotational markets.
 

4285
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,189
rotational markets.

85 retest on the spy. Does it reclaim it
 

4287
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:43,590
85 retest on the spy. Does it reclaim it
now? Jesus Christ. Can we stop trading

4299
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,590
really don't care which way you want to
go with this, but it would be lovely if

4300
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:57,600
go with this, but it would be lovely if
 

4301
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,109
go with this, but it would be lovely if
we could leave this range.

4302
01:40:01,109 --> 01:40:01,119
we could leave this range.
 

4303
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:09,990
we could leave this range.
Be really lovely.

4304
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,000

 

4305
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,149

4462
01:44:56,070 --> 01:44:56,080

4465
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,669
man. SPY wants to go. This thing's going
to squeeze again. So weekly players

4466
01:44:59,669 --> 01:44:59,679
to squeeze again. So weekly players
 

4467
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:01,430
to squeeze again. So weekly players
trying to take control. Can they get

4468
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:01,440
trying to take control. Can they get
 

4469
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,830
trying to take control. Can they get
back inside previous days range? Um

4470
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:03,840
back inside previous days range? Um
 

4471
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:06,790
back inside previous days range? Um
probably at this point. And this is the

4472
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:06,800
probably at this point. And this is the
 

4473
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,030
probably at this point. And this is the
level right here. This guy right here.

4474
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:09,040
level right here. This guy right here.
 

4475
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,510
level right here. This guy right here.
That's your rotation here to here. Here

4476
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:11,520
That's your rotation here to here. Here
 

4477
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,510
That's your rotation here to here. Here
to here. I don't know what happens until

we get outside of this box right now.

4480
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:15,280
we get outside of this box right now.
 

4481
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,350
we get outside of this box right now.
This is your box.

4482
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:17,360
This is your box.
 

4483
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,790
This is your box.
Right. They've confirmed that as the

Right. They've confirmed that as the
 

4485
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:25,750
Right. They've confirmed that as the
box. That's where we're pinned.

4486
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:25,760

 

4487
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,270

That is where we're pinned. No doubt

4488
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:27,280
That is where we're pinned. No doubt
 

4489
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,270
That is where we're pinned. No doubt
about it.

4490
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:29,280
about it.
 

4491
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,109
about it.
There you go. Rejection insider value.

4492
01:45:31,109 --> 01:45:31,119

What a [\h__\h] market. Every time I think
 

4497
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,910
What a [\h__\h] market. Every time I think
we might get a really good market.

4498
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:39,920
we might get a really good market.
 

4499
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:48,629
we might get a really good market.
We get back into this.

4500
01:45:48,629 --> 01:45:48,639

 

4501
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:55,910

Look at that last candle.

4502
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:55,920

 

4503
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,550

It's like a 50 point I don't know what

4504
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,560
It's like a 50 point I don't know what
 

4505
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,350
It's like a 50 point I don't know what
to do candle. Look at that.

4506
01:46:01,350 --> 01:46:01,360
to do candle. Look at that.
 

4507
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:07,990
to do candle. Look at that.
505 to 555s and no edge in it.

4508
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:08,000

4516
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:15,280
day. I'm not complaining, but it's just
 

4517
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,310
day. I'm not complaining, but it's just
like,

4518
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:18,320

something. You've had FOMC.

4522
01:46:24,709 --> 01:46:24,719
something. You've had FOMC.
 

4523
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,629
something. You've had FOMC.
You've had your ability to go upside.

Every idiot under the sun wants to talk

4528
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:31,840
Every idiot under the sun wants to talk
 

4529
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,830
Every idiot under the sun wants to talk
about quantitive easing. Stick it up

4530
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:33,840
about quantitive easing. Stick it up
 

4531
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,229
about quantitive easing. Stick it up
your ass. The market's [\h__\h] No one's

4535
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,510
working. You've got a liquidity crisis.
I guess we're just waiting for Japan to

4536
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:41,520
I guess we're just waiting for Japan to
 

4537
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,189
I guess we're just waiting for Japan to
absolutely tank this market next week.

4538
01:46:43,189 --> 01:46:43,199
absolutely tank this market next week.
 

4539
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:45,030
absolutely tank this market next week.
And then my question is, everyone knows

4540
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:45,040
And then my question is, everyone knows
 

4541
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,870
And then my question is, everyone knows
that's coming. Is it already sort of

4542
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:46,880
that's coming. Is it already sort of
 

4543
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,790
that's coming. Is it already sort of
priced in? But maybe that's what we've

4544
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:48,800
priced in? But maybe that's what we've
 

4545
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,229
priced in? But maybe that's what we've
got to wait for. We've just probably got

4546
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:50,239
got to wait for. We've just probably got
 

4547
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:51,830
got to wait for. We've just probably got
to wait for this carry trade to see if

4548
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:51,840
to wait for this carry trade to see if
 

4549
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,229
to wait for this carry trade to see if
it actually does anything. I would like

4550
01:46:54,229 --> 01:46:54,239
it actually does anything. I would like
 

4551
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:55,669
it actually does anything. I would like
it to do something, but the more I think

4552
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:55,679
it to do something, but the more I think
 

4553
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:57,189
it to do something, but the more I think
about it, the more I think if everyone's

4554
01:46:57,189 --> 01:46:57,199
about it, the more I think if everyone's
 

4555
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:58,709
about it, the more I think if everyone's
looking for the same thing, it will not

4556
01:46:58,709 --> 01:46:58,719
looking for the same thing, it will not
 

4557
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,229
looking for the same thing, it will not
happen. But I'll talk about it in the in

4558
01:47:00,229 --> 01:47:00,239
happen. But I'll talk about it in the in
 

4559
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:02,629
happen. But I'll talk about it in the in
the newsletter on Saturday.

4560
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:02,639
the newsletter on Saturday.
 

4561
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:04,950
the newsletter on Saturday.
It feels like a small cap market. I

4562
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:04,960
It feels like a small cap market. I
 

4563
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,510
It feels like a small cap market. I
can't like I cannot say it enough. NQ

4564
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:07,520
can't like I cannot say it enough. NQ
 

4565
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,270
can't like I cannot say it enough. NQ
literally feels like a small cap market

4566
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:09,280
literally feels like a small cap market
 

4567
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,430
literally feels like a small cap market
now.

4568
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:11,440
now.
 

4569
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,149
now.
And if everyone's waiting for the trade

4570
01:47:14,149 --> 01:47:14,159
And if everyone's waiting for the trade
 

4571
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:18,229
And if everyone's waiting for the trade
or the carry trade,

4572
01:47:18,229 --> 01:47:18,239
or the carry trade,
 

4573
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,149
or the carry trade,
it just makes me feel like a small cap.

4574
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:20,159
it just makes me feel like a small cap.
 

4575
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:22,629
it just makes me feel like a small cap.
If everyone's waiting for a fade and

4576
01:47:22,629 --> 01:47:22,639
If everyone's waiting for a fade and
 

4577
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:24,709
If everyone's waiting for a fade and
everyone's stacked shorts side in it,

4578
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:24,719
everyone's stacked shorts side in it,
 

4579
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:26,870
everyone's stacked shorts side in it,
then the chances of it happening are not

4580
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:26,880
then the chances of it happening are not
 

4581
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,470
then the chances of it happening are not
very high and it's probably going to go

4582
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:28,480
very high and it's probably going to go
 

4583
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,629
very high and it's probably going to go
the other way and catch everyone. So

4584
01:47:30,629 --> 01:47:30,639
the other way and catch everyone. So
 

4585
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:33,270
the other way and catch everyone. So
that's where my head's at

4586
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:33,280
that's where my head's at
 

4587
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,189
that's where my head's at
and it's probably where dealers heads at

4588
01:47:35,189 --> 01:47:35,199
and it's probably where dealers heads at
 

4589
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:41,109
and it's probably where dealers heads at
as well.

4590
01:47:41,109 --> 01:47:41,119

 

4591
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,030

this one thing. If they come out and say
 

4625
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,590
this one thing. If they come out and say
it's illegal, he can't do it. What are

4626
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:53,600
it's illegal, he can't do it. What are
 

4627
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,109

01:48:57,109 --> 01:48:57,119
already been gained? What hap? How do
 

4631
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:59,270
already been gained? What hap? How do
you give that money back? Who's tracking

4632
01:48:59,270 --> 01:48:59,280
you give that money back? Who's tracking
 

4633
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:02,390
you give that money back? Who's tracking
that? If they can't even track the jobs

4634
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:02,400
that? If they can't even track the jobs
 

4635
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,870
that? If they can't even track the jobs
numbers, how they tracking the uh

4636
01:49:04,870 --> 01:49:04,880
numbers, how they tracking the uh
 

4637
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,629
numbers, how they tracking the uh
billions or trillions, if you listen to

4638
01:49:06,629 --> 01:49:06,639
billions or trillions, if you listen to
 

4639
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:08,070
billions or trillions, if you listen to

And we're trading against each of them

4656
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:26,320
And we're trading against each of them
 

4657
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:35,350
And we're trading against each of them
right now.

4658
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,360

 

4659
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:39,350

Market down 1% and VIX even. Um, it just

4660
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:39,360
Market down 1% and VIX even. Um, it just
 

4661
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,350
Market down 1% and VIX even. Um, it just
I would say the VIX is actually up

4662
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:41,360
I would say the VIX is actually up
 

4663
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,270
I would say the VIX is actually up
0.44%.

4664
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:43,280
0.44%.
 

4665
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,669
0.44%.
And the ES is down 0.25%. So,

4666
01:49:45,669 --> 01:49:45,679
And the ES is down 0.25%. So,
 

4667
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:52,950
And the ES is down 0.25%. So,
correlation still there.

4668
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:52,960

 

4669
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:57,669

Correlation's still there.

4670
01:49:57,669 --> 01:49:57,679

You got long on the level down here, was

4674
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:02,639
You got long on the level down here, was
 

4675
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:06,709
You got long on the level down here, was
it? Nice. It's good. It's a good long.

4676
01:50:06,709 --> 01:50:06,719
it? Nice. It's good. It's a good long.

Just make sure you're paying yourself

4678
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:07,840
Just make sure you're paying yourself
 

4679
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,669
Just make sure you're paying yourself
some here because you don't this might

4680
01:50:09,669 --> 01:50:09,679
some here because you don't this might
 

4681
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:10,870
some here because you don't this might
come right back down. This is your

4682
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:10,880
come right back down. This is your
 

4683
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,229
come right back down. This is your
rotation like we talked about. This is

4684
01:50:12,229 --> 01:50:12,239
rotation like we talked about. This is
 

4685
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:14,149
rotation like we talked about. This is
your box. This is why I've come

4686
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:14,159
your box. This is why I've come
 

4687
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:15,669
your box. This is why I've come
uninterested.

4688
01:50:15,669 --> 01:50:15,679
uninterested.
 

4689
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:17,510
uninterested.
We did talk about potentially getting

4690
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:17,520
We did talk about potentially getting
 

4691
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,550
We did talk about potentially getting
long here, but uh I didn't like that we

4692
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,560
long here, but uh I didn't like that we
 

4693
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,070
long here, but uh I didn't like that we
lost that level really. That would have

4694
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,080
lost that level really. That would have
 

4695
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,750
lost that level really. That would have
been much easier play. I just don't want

4696
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:23,760
been much easier play. I just don't want
 

4697
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,270
been much easier play. I just don't want
to play a rotation now where we're

4698
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:25,280
to play a rotation now where we're
 

4699
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,910
to play a rotation now where we're
fighting. Um because this can be a lower

4700
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:27,920
fighting. Um because this can be a lower
 

4701
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,830
fighting. Um because this can be a lower
high, this can be a higher low. This can

4702
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:29,840
high, this can be a higher low. This can
 

4703
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,590
high, this can be a higher low. This can
be the rotation. They will build out

4704
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:31,600
be the rotation. They will build out
 

4705
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:33,030
be the rotation. They will build out
here until they're ready to make a

4706
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:33,040
here until they're ready to make a
 

4707
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,750
here until they're ready to make a
decision.

4708
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:35,760
decision.
 

4709
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,830
decision.
You can see that blue line and this blue

4710
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:37,840
You can see that blue line and this blue
 

4711
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,669
You can see that blue line and this blue
line. That's where we're in stuck in

4712
01:50:39,669 --> 01:50:39,679
line. That's where we're in stuck in
 

4713
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:51,830
line. That's where we're in stuck in
between right now.

4714
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:51,840

 

4715
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:55,189

Uh, I don't think so. Dim.

4716
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199
Uh, I don't think so. Dim.
 

4717
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:57,109
Uh, I don't think so. Dim.
I think that just I think it will always

4718
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:57,119
I think that just I think it will always
 

4719
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:59,030
I think that just I think it will always
say reset account if you want to do it.

4720
01:50:59,030 --> 01:50:59,040
say reset account if you want to do it.
 

4721
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,270
say reset account if you want to do it.
I don't think so. But you won't know

4722
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:01,280
I don't think so. But you won't know
 

4723
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:03,590
I don't think so. But you won't know
until you get to end of day. Unless

4724
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:03,600
until you get to end of day. Unless
 

4725
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,709
until you get to end of day. Unless
you're looking at your screen and you

4726
01:51:04,709 --> 01:51:04,719
you're looking at your screen and you
 

4727
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:06,149
you're looking at your screen and you
can you I mean you know if you've blown

4728
01:51:06,149 --> 01:51:06,159
can you I mean you know if you've blown
 

4729
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:35,990
can you I mean you know if you've blown
it. It will tell you in front of you.

4730
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,000

 

4731
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,629

Um,

4732
01:51:38,629 --> 01:51:38,639
Um,
 

4733
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:41,669
Um,
I think both sides are though, uh,

4734
01:51:41,669 --> 01:51:41,679
I think both sides are though, uh,
 

4735
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:43,430
I think both sides are though, uh,
Sigma. I think you'll find you've got

4736
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:43,440
Sigma. I think you'll find you've got
 

4737
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,669
Sigma. I think you'll find you've got
both sides.

4738
01:51:45,669 --> 01:51:45,679
both sides.
 

4739
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:47,990
both sides.
So, if you look up here, if we just get

4740
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,000
So, if you look up here, if we just get
 

4741
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,950
So, if you look up here, if we just get
you on map, this is why I don't trust it

4742
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:50,960
you on map, this is why I don't trust it
 

4743
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,550
you on map, this is why I don't trust it
right now. All right. If we just look at

4744
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:52,560
right now. All right. If we just look at
 

4745
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,709
right now. All right. If we just look at
this.

4746
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719

 

4747
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:07,830

Yeah, buyers came in here.

4748
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:07,840

 

4749
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,350

These guys down here are still caught.

4750
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:11,360
These guys down here are still caught.
 

4751
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:14,229
These guys down here are still caught.
So

4752
01:52:14,229 --> 01:52:14,239
So
 

4753
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:16,070
So
yeah, I don't know, man. I just think

4754
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:16,080
yeah, I don't know, man. I just think
 

4755
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:21,270
yeah, I don't know, man. I just think
it's a rotation now.

4756
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:21,280

 

4757
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,629

Made my money anyway. And how long we

4758
01:52:22,629 --> 01:52:22,639
Made my money anyway. And how long we
 

4759
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:24,470
Made my money anyway. And how long we
got left? A [\h__\h] hour left. God, this

4760
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:24,480
got left? A [\h__\h] hour left. God, this
 

4761
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:31,270
got left? A [\h__\h] hour left. God, this
is going slow.

4762
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:31,280

 

4763
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:34,070

Yeah, I don't have a bias right now.

4764
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:34,080
Yeah, I don't have a bias right now.
 

4765
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:46,629
Yeah, I don't have a bias right now.
I don't have a bias.

4766
01:52:46,629 --> 01:52:46,639

 

4767
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:53,109

If we go to 5 minute,

4768
01:52:53,109 --> 01:52:53,119

 

4769
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:55,990

you can see we're holding

4770
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:56,000
you can see we're holding
 

4771
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,589
you can see we're holding
here.

4772
01:52:57,589 --> 01:52:57,599
here.
 

4773

4783
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,270

01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:11,280
like the market doesn't know what it's

01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:38,470
And that's just your rotation. Now
until we get confirmation and one side

really comes in more aggressive and
 

4807
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:47,430
really comes in more aggressive and
starts to win

reasons to come down here, but uh all
 

4831
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,750
reasons to come down here, but uh all
depends. Are we going to reject this

4832
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:19,760
depends. Are we going to reject this
 

4833
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:21,830
depends. Are we going to reject this
range?

4834
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:21,840
range?
 

4835
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:25,910

I guess this here is key. 650s, 630s.

4836
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:25,920
I guess this here is key. 650s, 630s.

rejecting 630s and 650s,

4841
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:31,990
rejecting 630s and 650s,
there's potential, right? There's

4842
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:32,000
there's potential, right? There's

there's potential, right? There's
potential to move lower. I think you're

4847
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:37,350
actually right. All the time we're
rejecting up there, there's potential to

4848
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:37,360
rejecting up there, there's potential to
 

4849
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:39,830

02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:04,790
just scary. And are you are you playing
zero DTE in those or are you going

5088
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:04,800
zero DTE in those or are you going
 

5089
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:32,870
zero DTE in those or are you going
further out?

5090
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:32,880

 

5091
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,550

still stuck at value area low for the

5092
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,560
still stuck at value area low for the
 

5093
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:40,229
still stuck at value area low for the
session.

5094
02:01:40,229 --> 02:01:40,239

 

5095
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:43,189

In the last one, two, three, four, five,

5096
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
In the last one, two, three, four, five,
 

5097
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,750
In the last one, two, three, four, five,
six candles, buyers are stuck over 20s

5098
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:45,760
six candles, buyers are stuck over 20s
 

5099
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,629
six candles, buyers are stuck over 20s
and uh over 20s, over 02s and sellers

5100
02:01:48,629 --> 02:01:48,639
and uh over 20s, over 02s and sellers
 

5101
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:52,229
and uh over 20s, over 02s and sellers
are stuck under 96. That's how tight

5102
02:01:52,229 --> 02:01:52,239
are stuck under 96. That's how tight
 

5103
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:54,950
are stuck under 96. That's how tight
it's gone. Feels like flush is coming,

5104
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:54,960
it's gone. Feels like flush is coming,
 

5105
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,310
it's gone. Feels like flush is coming,
but I wouldn't guarantee it if we're

5106
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:56,320
but I wouldn't guarantee it if we're
 

5107
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:58,310
but I wouldn't guarantee it if we're
holding 85s. If we lose 85 and it's

5108
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:58,320
holding 85s. If we lose 85 and it's
 

5109
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:01,510
holding 85s. If we lose 85 and it's
probably a bigger move.

5110
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:01,520
probably a bigger move.
 

5111
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,669
probably a bigger move.
I want to wait to see if we get outside

5112
02:02:03,669 --> 02:02:03,679
I want to wait to see if we get outside
 

5113
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:07,350
I want to wait to see if we get outside
value. Can we get outside value? Are we

5114
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:07,360
value. Can we get outside value? Are we
 

5115
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:16,149
value. Can we get outside value? Are we
going to start washing

5116
02:02:16,149 --> 02:02:16,159

 

5117
02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:25,510

spy 85 again?

5118
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:25,520

 

5119
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:49,189

Um what is coming up rest of the day

5120
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:49,199

 

5121
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:52,149

starting to lose 85s potentially here.

5122
02:02:52,149 --> 02:02:52,159
starting to lose 85s potentially here.
 

5123
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:53,750
starting to lose 85s potentially here.
Do they rebid it though? We're

5124
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:53,760
Do they rebid it though? We're
 

5125
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:55,669
Do they rebid it though? We're
underneath current value. Do we trade to

5126
02:02:55,669 --> 02:02:55,679
underneath current value. Do we trade to
 

5127
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:58,550
underneath current value. Do we trade to
value area low? Feels like it wants to

5128
02:02:58,550 --> 02:02:58,560
value area low? Feels like it wants to
 

5129
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,070
value area low? Feels like it wants to
wash, but what it feels like and what it

5130
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:00,080
wash, but what it feels like and what it
 

5131
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:01,589
wash, but what it feels like and what it
does have been two different things

5132
02:03:01,589 --> 02:03:01,599
does have been two different things
 

5133
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:07,830
does have been two different things
recently. There's the retest of value

5134
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:07,840

 

5135
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,709

reclaim of 85 holding VWAP. Yeah, buyers

5136
02:03:10,709 --> 02:03:10,719
reclaim of 85 holding VWAP. Yeah, buyers
 

5137
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:13,830
reclaim of 85 holding VWAP. Yeah, buyers
did just get caught on this candle here.

5138
02:03:13,830 --> 02:03:13,840
did just get caught on this candle here.
 

5139
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:17,270
did just get caught on this candle here.
So all the time we protect 500 I think

5140
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,280
So all the time we protect 500 I think
 

5141
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:24,470
So all the time we protect 500 I think
maybe maybe a move back down to 470s

5142
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:24,480

 

5143
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,990

but SPY is going to make it very hard

5144
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:26,000
but SPY is going to make it very hard
 

5145
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,669
but SPY is going to make it very hard
for you I would say if you're adamant on

5146
02:03:27,669 --> 02:03:27,679
for you I would say if you're adamant on
 

5147
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:30,390
for you I would say if you're adamant on
trying to get this rotation once that

5148
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:30,400
trying to get this rotation once that
 

5149
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:31,830
trying to get this rotation once that
thing loses it you can just set a price

5150
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:31,840
thing loses it you can just set a price
 

5151
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,510
thing loses it you can just set a price
alert I set it underneath as well

5152
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:33,520
alert I set it underneath as well
 

5153
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,430
alert I set it underneath as well
because it keeps ducking underneath and

5154
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:35,440
because it keeps ducking underneath and
 

5155
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,270
because it keeps ducking underneath and
finding a bid on VWAP. 85 is basically

5156
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:37,280
finding a bid on VWAP. 85 is basically
 

5157
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:39,510
finding a bid on VWAP. 85 is basically
VWOP right now on the spiders and that's

5158
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:39,520
VWOP right now on the spiders and that's
 

5159
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:41,750
VWOP right now on the spiders and that's
that is the soak level. If they lose

5160
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:41,760
that is the soak level. If they lose
 

5161
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:44,070
that is the soak level. If they lose
that, 82 is the level I would say. Well,

5162
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:44,080
that, 82 is the level I would say. Well,
 

5163
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,990
that, 82 is the level I would say. Well,
what was that pin? 84 we traded at

5164
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,000
what was that pin? 84 we traded at
 

5165
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,669
what was that pin? 84 we traded at
earlier. Don't remember seeing anything

5166
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
earlier. Don't remember seeing anything
 

5167
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,350
earlier. Don't remember seeing anything
there. Maybe Julian can tell me

5168
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,360
there. Maybe Julian can tell me
 

5169
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,870
there. Maybe Julian can tell me
otherwise, but 82 was the level

5170
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:50,880
otherwise, but 82 was the level
 

5171
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:55,430
otherwise, but 82 was the level
downside.

5172
02:03:55,430 --> 02:03:55,440

 

5173
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:58,149

Yeah, totally.

5174
02:03:58,149 --> 02:03:58,159
Yeah, totally.
 

5175
02:03:58,159 --> 02:04:00,070
Yeah, totally.
So, how much like if you're trading off

5176
02:04:00,070 --> 02:04:00,080
So, how much like if you're trading off
 

5177
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:02,470
So, how much like if you're trading off
it, how much room do you give it? Like

5178
02:04:02,470 --> 02:04:02,480
it, how much room do you give it? Like
 

5179
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:06,390
it, how much room do you give it? Like
for example, today

5180
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:06,400

 

5181
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,229

we

5182
02:04:08,229 --> 02:04:08,239
we
 

5183
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:09,990
we
trade if you were bidding 85 on that

5184
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:10,000
trade if you were bidding 85 on that
 

5185
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,470
trade if you were bidding 85 on that
pullback, we traded right down to 84.

5186
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:14,480

 

5187
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:15,990

How much room do you give it? Do you

5188
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:16,000
How much room do you give it? Do you
 

5189
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,270
How much room do you give it? Do you
give it level to level and you're

5190
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:17,280
give it level to level and you're
 

5191
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,030
give it level to level and you're
trading like small size or are you going

5192
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:19,040
trading like small size or are you going
 

5193
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:20,390
trading like small size or are you going
far enough out that you don't really

5194
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:20,400
far enough out that you don't really
 

5195
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:28,550
far enough out that you don't really
care?

5196
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:28,560

 

5197
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,070

Still, these buyers keep getting stuck.

5198
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:30,080
Still, these buyers keep getting stuck.
 

5199
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,270
Still, these buyers keep getting stuck.
If they're trying to trade through 500

5200
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:31,280
If they're trying to trade through 500
 

5201
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,350
If they're trying to trade through 500
and they're not getting their way,

5202
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,360
and they're not getting their way,
 

5203
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,830
and they're not getting their way,
that's the one, two, three attempts now

5204
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:35,840
that's the one, two, three attempts now
 

5205
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,589
that's the one, two, three attempts now
to get through 500, not getting their

5206
02:04:37,589 --> 02:04:37,599
to get through 500, not getting their
 

5207
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:51,910
to get through 500, not getting their
way, which is value on the day.

5208
02:04:51,910 --> 02:04:51,920

 

5209
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:54,390

Delta's trying to move higher, price is

5210
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:54,400
Delta's trying to move higher, price is
 

5211
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,310
Delta's trying to move higher, price is
moving lower. There's a seller on the

5212
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:56,320
moving lower. There's a seller on the
 

5213
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:57,830
moving lower. There's a seller on the
tape.

5214
02:04:57,830 --> 02:04:57,840
tape.
 

5215
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:59,350
tape.
[\h__\h] delta is trying to move higher.

5216
02:04:59,350 --> 02:04:59,360
[\h__\h] delta is trying to move higher.
 

5217
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:00,390
[\h__\h] delta is trying to move higher.
Price is moving lower. There's

5218
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:00,400
Price is moving lower. There's
 

5219
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,950
Price is moving lower. There's
definitely a seller on the tape

5220
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:02,960
definitely a seller on the tape
 

5221
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,950
definitely a seller on the tape
versus 500, I'd say, at the moment. So,

5222
02:05:04,950 --> 02:05:04,960
versus 500, I'd say, at the moment. So,
 

5223
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:07,750
versus 500, I'd say, at the moment. So,
we might get a snap here. Here's your

5224
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:07,760
we might get a snap here. Here's your
 

5225
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,510
we might get a snap here. Here's your
previous week open. I think there's a

5226
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:09,520
previous week open. I think there's a
 

5227
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,589
previous week open. I think there's a
snap potentially coming here just based

5228
02:05:11,589 --> 02:05:11,599
snap potentially coming here just based
 

5229
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:13,910
snap potentially coming here just based
on what I've seen on the delta there.

5230
02:05:13,910 --> 02:05:13,920
on what I've seen on the delta there.
 

5231
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:16,310
on what I've seen on the delta there.
And your cover level will be 470. If we

5232
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:16,320
And your cover level will be 470. If we
 

5233
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,589
And your cover level will be 470. If we
let go of that, it would be lower of

5234
02:05:17,589 --> 02:05:17,599
let go of that, it would be lower of
 

5235
02:05:17,599 --> 02:05:19,350
let go of that, it would be lower of
day. Remember, we didn't take out

5236
02:05:19,350 --> 02:05:19,360
day. Remember, we didn't take out
 

5237
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:23,430
day. Remember, we didn't take out
Gloveex. 500 is key. Uh 5685

02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:55,360
like you'd be fans of the Italian guys
 

5401

Los Angeles. Man, this market doesn't

5410

5411
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:33,430

know what to do.

5412
02:10:33,430 --> 02:10:33,440

5413
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:39,350
know what to do.
Back to 85 on the spy we go.

5414
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:39,360

 

5415
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:43,030

Big kill candle there.

5416
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:43,040
Big kill candle there.
 

5417
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:49,510
Big kill candle there.
My stomach's rumbling. I need to eat.

5418
02:10:49,510 --> 02:10:49,520

 

5419
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,629

5420
02:10:52,629 --> 02:10:52,639
back down to previous weekly open.
 

5421
02:10:52,639 --> 02:10:54,149
back down to previous weekly open.

5422
02:10:54,149 --> 02:10:54,159
Are they going to just pop this straight
 

5423
02:10:54,159 --> 02:10:56,629
Are they going to just pop this straight
back up to 500?

5424
02:10:56,629 --> 02:10:56,639
back up to 500?

5427
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:03,030

They just soaked 85 again. I think

5428
02:11:03,030 --> 02:11:03,040
They just soaked 85 again. I think
 

5429
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,470
They just soaked 85 again. I think
there's a snap coming soon. They can't

5430
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:04,480
there's a snap coming soon. They can't
 

5431
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:06,149
there's a snap coming soon. They can't
keep soaking and soaking and soaking and

5432
02:11:06,149 --> 02:11:06,159
keep soaking and soaking and soaking and
 

5433
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:08,629
keep soaking and soaking and soaking and
soaking without a break. One way or

5434
02:11:08,629 --> 02:11:08,639
soaking without a break. One way or
 

5435
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:10,550
soaking without a break. One way or
another,

5436
02:11:10,550 --> 02:11:10,560
another,
 

5437
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:12,709
another,
I'd be watching these 500s here. There's

5438
02:11:12,709 --> 02:11:12,719
I'd be watching these 500s here. There's
 

5439
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:15,189
I'd be watching these 500s here. There's
a sellside imbalance to 506. But again,

5440
02:11:15,189 --> 02:11:15,199
a sellside imbalance to 506. But again,
 

5441
02:11:15,199 --> 02:11:17,030
a sellside imbalance to 506. But again,

02:14:03,189 --> 02:14:03,199
The moment I look away, we start doing
 

5523
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:05,270
The moment I look away, we start doing
it. All right. So, ES starting to let go

5524
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:05,280

02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:07,440
of those 85s.
 

5527
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:08,870
of those 85s.
If we start rejecting previous week

5528
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:08,880
If we start rejecting previous week
 

5529
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,310
If we start rejecting previous week
value and current week value. So, if we

5530
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:10,320
value and current week value. So, if we
 

5531
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:12,229
value and current week value. So, if we

5558
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:52,960
I'd rather watch this guy 82 and 90. So
 

5559
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,470
I'd rather watch this guy 82 and 90. So
let's see how we act up here. Do they

5560
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:54,480
let's see how we act up here. Do they
 

5561
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,629
let's see how we act up here. Do they
resell this on this push? Or is that yet

5562
02:14:56,629 --> 02:14:56,639
resell this on this push? Or is that yet
 

5563
02:14:56,639 --> 02:14:58,550
resell this on this push? Or is that yet
another fail breakdown under me previous

5564
02:14:58,550 --> 02:14:58,560
another fail breakdown under me previous
 

5565
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:01,350
another fail breakdown under me previous
week? I'm watching SPY back into 85,

5566
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:01,360
week? I'm watching SPY back into 85,
 

5567
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,270
week? I'm watching SPY back into 85,
which is retesting now. So do they

5568
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:03,280
which is retesting now. So do they
 

5569
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,109
which is retesting now. So do they
resell this for the move to 82 or do

5570
02:15:05,109 --> 02:15:05,119
resell this for the move to 82 or do
 

5571
02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:10,069
resell this for the move to 82 or do
they reclaim it for move to 88?

5572
02:15:10,069 --> 02:15:10,079

 

5573
02:15:10,079 --> 02:15:11,589

And that's on spy that I'm talking about

5574
02:15:11,589 --> 02:15:11,599
And that's on spy that I'm talking about
 

5575
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:21,589
And that's on spy that I'm talking about
when I say 82 and 88.

5576
02:15:21,589 --> 02:15:21,599

 

5577
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:25,270

Very very thin on that kill candle above

5578
02:15:25,270 --> 02:15:25,280
Very very thin on that kill candle above
 

5579
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:27,910
Very very thin on that kill candle above
500 to 506.

5580
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:27,920
500 to 506.
 

5581
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:29,350
500 to 506.
I'd say sellers are in control here

5582
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:29,360
I'd say sellers are in control here
 

5583
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:31,830
I'd say sellers are in control here
versus sort of 506. 500 506 sellers are

5584
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:31,840
versus sort of 506. 500 506 sellers are
 

5585
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:38,950
versus sort of 506. 500 506 sellers are
in control for a potential leg down.

5586
02:15:38,950 --> 02:15:38,960

 

5587
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:39,990

This depends if they're going to give

5588
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:40,000
This depends if they're going to give
 

5589
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:46,950
This depends if they're going to give
any follow through today.

5590
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:46,960

 

5591
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:53,030

OTM puts were 24x.

5592
02:15:53,030 --> 02:15:53,040

 

5593
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:55,270

That's awesome. You're doing on props

5594
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:55,280
That's awesome. You're doing on props
 

5595
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,189
That's awesome. You're doing on props
right now. What as in uh there's

5596
02:15:57,189 --> 02:15:57,199
right now. What as in uh there's
 

5597
02:15:57,199 --> 02:15:59,589
right now. What as in uh there's
options? There's Sorry, how do I say

5598
02:15:59,589 --> 02:15:59,599
options? There's Sorry, how do I say
 

5599
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:02,390
options? There's Sorry, how do I say
that? There's props for options.

5600
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
that? There's props for options.
 

5601
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:06,229
that? There's props for options.
I didn't know that.

5602
02:16:06,229 --> 02:16:06,239

 

5603
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:08,950

Okay, here's the ledge into this area.

5604
02:16:08,950 --> 02:16:08,960
Okay, here's the ledge into this area.
 

5605
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,550
Okay, here's the ledge into this area.
If they reclaim this, we go straight up.

5606
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:10,560
If they reclaim this, we go straight up.
 

5607
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:11,669
If they reclaim this, we go straight up.
If they reject this, they're going to

5608
02:16:11,669 --> 02:16:11,679
If they reject this, they're going to
 

5609
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:13,030
If they reject this, they're going to
retest this low and they're going to try

5610
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:13,040
retest this low and they're going to try
 

5611
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,030
retest this low and they're going to try
and get acceptance under value. So, this

5612
02:16:15,030 --> 02:16:15,040
and get acceptance under value. So, this
 

5613
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:18,149
and get acceptance under value. So, this
is the area here. Bears must defend this

5614
02:16:18,149 --> 02:16:18,159
is the area here. Bears must defend this
 

5615
02:16:18,159 --> 02:16:19,750
is the area here. Bears must defend this
if they really, really want to get that

5616
02:16:19,750 --> 02:16:19,760
if they really, really want to get that
 

5617
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:21,589
if they really, really want to get that
GlobeEx. If they don't, then this just

5618
02:16:21,589 --> 02:16:21,599
GlobeEx. If they don't, then this just
 

5619
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:22,870
GlobeEx. If they don't, then this just
comes straight back up to here. Again,

5620
02:16:22,870 --> 02:16:22,880
comes straight back up to here. Again,
 

5621
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,149
comes straight back up to here. Again,
you can see we're very, very thin in

5622
02:16:24,149 --> 02:16:24,159
you can see we're very, very thin in
 

5623
02:16:24,159 --> 02:16:25,350
you can see we're very, very thin in
here like I just talked about. So,

5624
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:25,360
here like I just talked about. So,
 

5625
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:30,870
here like I just talked about. So,
here's the attempt to defend it.

5626
02:16:30,870 --> 02:16:30,880

 

5627
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:32,389

They just trapped a ton of buyers in

5628
02:16:32,389 --> 02:16:32,399
They just trapped a ton of buyers in
 

5629
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:34,709
They just trapped a ton of buyers in
that last move up there.

5630
02:16:34,709 --> 02:16:34,719
that last move up there.
 

5631
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:36,549
that last move up there.
This buy still holding 85. It's still

5632
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:36,559
This buy still holding 85. It's still
 

5633
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:38,150
This buy still holding 85. It's still
not getting a confirmation of a big kill

5634
02:16:38,150 --> 02:16:38,160
not getting a confirmation of a big kill
 

5635
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:39,509
not getting a confirmation of a big kill
candle yet. It feels like it's coming,

5636
02:16:39,509 --> 02:16:39,519
candle yet. It feels like it's coming,
 

5637
02:16:39,519 --> 02:16:44,629
candle yet. It feels like it's coming,
but we're not getting confirmation yet.

5638
02:16:44,629 --> 02:16:44,639

 

5639
02:16:44,639 --> 02:16:46,230

It's a good rejection of that ledge,

5640
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:46,240
It's a good rejection of that ledge,
 

5641
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,469
It's a good rejection of that ledge,
though. They need to close outside of

5642
02:16:48,469 --> 02:16:48,479
though. They need to close outside of
 

5643
02:16:48,479 --> 02:16:49,830
though. They need to close outside of
previous week value here. And then we

5644
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:49,840
previous week value here. And then we
 

5645
02:16:49,840 --> 02:17:01,270
previous week value here. And then we
can go pukey puke

5646
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,280

 

5647
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,349

main flush in the afternoon. You might

5648
02:17:03,349 --> 02:17:03,359
main flush in the afternoon. You might
 

5649
02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:05,030
main flush in the afternoon. You might
well be right, Peter. Uh, I won't be

5650
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:05,040
well be right, Peter. Uh, I won't be
 

5651
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:07,349
well be right, Peter. Uh, I won't be
here for it today, unfortunately.

5652
02:17:07,349 --> 02:17:07,359
here for it today, unfortunately.
 

5653
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:09,990
here for it today, unfortunately.
Just like last night when I was so

5654
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,000
Just like last night when I was so
 

5655
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,429
Just like last night when I was so
pissed off last night,

5656
02:17:13,429 --> 02:17:13,439
pissed off last night,
 

5657
02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:16,070
pissed off last night,
I went out for food. I was watching a

5658
02:17:16,070 --> 02:17:16,080
I went out for food. I was watching a
 

5659
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:18,230
I went out for food. I was watching a
film. I thought, oh, just quickly check

5660
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:18,240
film. I thought, oh, just quickly check
 

5661
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:19,910
film. I thought, oh, just quickly check
the charts. And I saw where we were and

5662
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:19,920
the charts. And I saw where we were and
 

5663
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:22,870
the charts. And I saw where we were and
I was like, you have got to be [\h__\h]

5664
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:22,880
I was like, you have got to be [\h__\h]
 

5665
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:30,309
I was like, you have got to be [\h__\h]
me.

5666
02:17:30,309 --> 02:17:30,319

 

5667
02:17:30,319 --> 02:17:33,110

Yeah. Nvidia 3.65%. 65% down. It's just

5668
02:17:33,110 --> 02:17:33,120
Yeah. Nvidia 3.65%. 65% down. It's just
 

5669
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:35,030
Yeah. Nvidia 3.65%. 65% down. It's just
Oracle, mate. Anything anything chip

5670
02:17:35,030 --> 02:17:35,040
Oracle, mate. Anything anything chip
 

5671
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:40,709
Oracle, mate. Anything anything chip
related is going to get dragged.

5672
02:17:40,709 --> 02:17:40,719

 

5673
02:17:40,719 --> 02:17:43,349

Yeah, I know a few of you would have

5674
02:17:43,349 --> 02:17:43,359
Yeah, I know a few of you would have
 

5675
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:44,950
Yeah, I know a few of you would have
been insane. What was tough is I was

5676
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:44,960
been insane. What was tough is I was
 

5677
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:47,589
been insane. What was tough is I was
waiting for two moves last night,

5678
02:17:47,589 --> 02:17:47,599
waiting for two moves last night,
 

5679
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:48,950
waiting for two moves last night,
yesterday. I was looking for Here they

5680
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:48,960
yesterday. I was looking for Here they
 

5681
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:52,070
yesterday. I was looking for Here they
are. All right, so this was posted uh

5682
02:17:52,070 --> 02:17:52,080
are. All right, so this was posted uh
 

5683
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:54,629
are. All right, so this was posted uh
3:22 in the afternoon. Right. So, this

5684
02:17:54,629 --> 02:17:54,639
3:22 in the afternoon. Right. So, this
 

5685
02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:56,629
3:22 in the afternoon. Right. So, this
is what I was looking for. either a

5686
02:17:56,629 --> 02:17:56,639
is what I was looking for. either a
 

5687
02:17:56,639 --> 02:17:58,790
is what I was looking for. either a
retest after taking out the high and a

5688
02:17:58,790 --> 02:17:58,800
retest after taking out the high and a
 

5689
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:00,790
retest after taking out the high and a
squeeze back higher or a break under and

5690
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:00,800
squeeze back higher or a break under and
 

5691
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:02,469
squeeze back higher or a break under and
stay heavy for the rotation. If we look

5692
02:18:02,469 --> 02:18:02,479
stay heavy for the rotation. If we look
 

5693
02:18:02,479 --> 02:18:05,030
stay heavy for the rotation. If we look
at what we actually got, it was even if

5694
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:05,040
at what we actually got, it was even if
 

5695
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:06,309
at what we actually got, it was even if
we look at that level that I'm talking

5696
02:18:06,309 --> 02:18:06,319
we look at that level that I'm talking
 

5697
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:10,629
we look at that level that I'm talking
about rejection into sort of 230 240s.

5698
02:18:10,629 --> 02:18:10,639
about rejection into sort of 230 240s.
 

5699
02:18:10,639 --> 02:18:15,429
about rejection into sort of 230 240s.
We look at what actually happened.

5700
02:18:15,429 --> 02:18:15,439

 

5701
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:18,629

230s was it 730s? I think it was I just

5702
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:18,639
230s was it 730s? I think it was I just
 

5703
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:20,389
230s was it 730s? I think it was I just
said 230s.

5704
02:18:20,389 --> 02:18:20,399
said 230s.
 

5705
02:18:20,399 --> 02:18:23,910
said 230s.
7:30s or is it 6

5706
02:18:23,910 --> 02:18:23,920
7:30s or is it 6
 

5707
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:27,589
7:30s or is it 6

5708
02:18:27,589 --> 02:18:27,599

5709
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:30,629
uh yesterday?
Yeah.

5710
02:18:30,629 --> 02:18:30,639

 

5711
02:18:30,639 --> 02:18:33,110

Right. Right here.

5712
02:18:33,110 --> 02:18:33,120

5789
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,150
to get caught. All right, because they
cannot sell under here. They've had

5790
02:20:08,150 --> 02:20:08,160
cannot sell under here. They've had
 

5791
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:09,590
cannot sell under here. They've had
numerous attempts. If they don't get it

numerous attempts. If they don't get it
 

5793
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,429
numerous attempts. If they don't get it

need this. And if they don't get it,
 

5799
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,710
need this. And if they don't get it,
they are going to get this slammed.

5800
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:18,720
they are going to get this slammed.
 

5801
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,150

Wouldn't be slammed pumped in their

Wouldn't be slammed pumped in their
 

5803
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:23,349
Wouldn't be slammed pumped in their
face. So they running out of time here

5804
02:20:23,349 --> 02:20:23,359
face. So they running out of time here
 

5805
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:24,870
face. So they running out of time here
versus this ledge here. They must

5806
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:24,880
versus this ledge here. They must
 

5807
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,309
versus this ledge here. They must
protect this ledge. Failure to protect

5808
02:20:26,309 --> 02:20:26,319
protect this ledge. Failure to protect
 

5809
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:28,230
protect this ledge. Failure to protect
this ledge.

5810
02:20:28,230 --> 02:20:28,240
this ledge.
 

5811
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:30,630
this ledge.
There's lots of room upside for them to

5812
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:30,640
There's lots of room upside for them to
 

5813
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:33,190
There's lots of room upside for them to
come and squeeze. Because at the moment,

5814
02:20:33,190 --> 02:20:33,200
come and squeeze. Because at the moment,
 

5815
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,590
come and squeeze. Because at the moment,
if we think about this,

5816
02:20:35,590 --> 02:20:35,600
if we think about this,
 

5817
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:38,150
if we think about this,
there's the pullback for bulls to buy,

5818
02:20:38,150 --> 02:20:38,160
there's the pullback for bulls to buy,
 

5819
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:40,309
there's the pullback for bulls to buy,
right? There's the push. Here's the

5820
02:20:40,309 --> 02:20:40,319
right? There's the push. Here's the
 

5821
02:20:40,319 --> 02:20:42,550
right? There's the push. Here's the
attempt from shorts to fail. they

5822
02:20:42,550 --> 02:20:42,560
attempt from shorts to fail. they
 

5823
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:45,349
attempt from shorts to fail. they
haven't completed it. This here is a

5824
02:20:45,349 --> 02:20:45,359
haven't completed it. This here is a
 

5825
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:47,670
haven't completed it. This here is a
failed break. All right? So, if they

5826
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:47,680
failed break. All right? So, if they
 

5827
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:50,389
failed break. All right? So, if they
cannot get under this level here, this

5828
02:20:50,389 --> 02:20:50,399
cannot get under this level here, this
 

5829
02:20:50,399 --> 02:20:51,830
cannot get under this level here, this
is where shorts will get caught and they

5830
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:51,840
is where shorts will get caught and they
 

5831
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:53,830
is where shorts will get caught and they
will allow a squeeze back up to here,

5832
02:20:53,830 --> 02:20:53,840
will allow a squeeze back up to here,
 

5833
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:56,150
will allow a squeeze back up to here,
here, here, and who knows what happens

5834
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:56,160
here, here, and who knows what happens
 

5835
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:58,630
here, here, and who knows what happens
once we start running. Okay, so shorts

5836
02:20:58,630 --> 02:20:58,640
once we start running. Okay, so shorts
 

5837
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:00,389
once we start running. Okay, so shorts
right now are definitely caught versus

5838
02:21:00,389 --> 02:21:00,399
right now are definitely caught versus
 

5839
02:21:00,399 --> 02:21:02,230
right now are definitely caught versus
this level. They've had numerous

down under this low?
That's my question right now. We should

5908
02:22:55,670 --> 02:22:55,680
That's my question right now. We should
 

5909
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:57,110
That's my question right now. We should
we should be breaking down under that

5910
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:57,120
we should be breaking down under that
 

5911
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:58,710
we should be breaking down under that
low based on what they've done here.

5912
02:22:58,710 --> 02:22:58,720
low based on what they've done here.

need to take control of this market and
break down. The one thing I'd say is

break down. The one thing I'd say is
 

5927
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:15,510

5932
02:23:19,510 --> 02:23:19,520
their job. But if they get the breakdown
 

5933
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:22,790
their job. But if they get the breakdown
here, then this level here can be traded

5934
02:23:22,790 --> 02:23:22,800
here, then this level here can be traded
 

5935
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:25,670
here, then this level here can be traded
into. And this level here for me, this

is your magnet. All right, this right

5938
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:27,680
is your magnet. All right, this right

what's happening in the market macro
wise. I would say

5956
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:54,720

available. If they chop it, then they
 

6081
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:06,950
available. If they chop it, then they
just chop it back down and that becomes

6082
02:27:06,950 --> 02:27:06,960
just chop it back down and that becomes
 

6083
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:08,309
just chop it back down and that becomes
your range. Look at the range on the

02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:25,270
of it. We can This is why I have
conflicting ideas right now. We see

6180
02:29:25,270 --> 02:29:25,280
conflicting ideas right now. We see
 

6181
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:27,429
conflicting ideas right now. We see
this. This is developing profile for the

6182
02:29:27,429 --> 02:29:27,439
this. This is developing profile for the
 

6183
02:29:27,439 --> 02:29:30,070
this. This is developing profile for the
week, right? This is current week. We've

week, right? This is current week. We've
 

6185
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:32,469
week, right? This is current week. We've
traded outside of it. We traded inside,

6186
02:29:32,469 --> 02:29:32,479
traded outside of it. We traded inside,
 

6187
02:29:32,479 --> 02:29:34,150
traded outside of it. We traded inside,
rejected. We're coming back to hit

6188
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:34,160
rejected. We're coming back to hit
 

6189
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:37,270
rejected. We're coming back to hit
question mark. Do we reject

6190
02:29:37,270 --> 02:29:37,280
question mark. Do we reject
 

6191
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,110
question mark. Do we reject
for this roll down? Why haven't we taken

6192
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:39,120
for this roll down? Why haven't we taken
 

6193
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:41,750
for this roll down? Why haven't we taken
it? Why haven't we taken the lows? If we

6194
02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:41,760
it? Why haven't we taken the lows? If we
 

6195
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,990
it? Why haven't we taken the lows? If we
get back inside, yeah, maybe more

6196
02:29:43,990 --> 02:29:44,000
get back inside, yeah, maybe more
 

6197
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,790
get back inside, yeah, maybe more
upside, but it's ugly, man. You just got

6198
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:46,800
upside, but it's ugly, man. You just got
 

6199
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:49,750
upside, but it's ugly, man. You just got
so much conflicting

6200
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:49,760
so much conflicting
 

6201
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:52,309
so much conflicting
things here. If we done this,

6202
02:29:52,309 --> 02:29:52,319
things here. If we done this,
 

6203
02:29:52,319 --> 02:29:54,870
things here. If we done this,
I'd be way more bullish.

6204
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:54,880
I'd be way more bullish.
 

6205
02:29:54,880 --> 02:30:00,469
I'd be way more bullish.
But we didn't do that.

6206
02:30:00,469 --> 02:30:00,479

 

6207
02:30:00,479 --> 02:30:02,550

And the squeezes happen so quick.

6208
02:30:02,550 --> 02:30:02,560
And the squeezes happen so quick.
 

6209
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,630
And the squeezes happen so quick.
They're just like, "Okay, we're going

6210
02:30:04,630 --> 02:30:04,640
They're just like, "Okay, we're going
 

6211
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:06,150
They're just like, "Okay, we're going
right once we trap down here. Okay,

6212
02:30:06,150 --> 02:30:06,160
right once we trap down here. Okay,
 

6213
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:12,870
right once we trap down here. Okay,
we're going. 100 points."

6214
02:30:12,870 --> 02:30:12,880

 

6215
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:14,710

It's still inside initial balance as

6216
02:30:14,710 --> 02:30:14,720
It's still inside initial balance as
 

6217
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:20,150
It's still inside initial balance as
well.

6218
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:20,160

 

6219
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:23,190

What trading interview? Uh platform just

sort you out.
Point of control here. All right. So, if

6248
02:31:10,710 --> 02:31:10,720
Point of control here. All right. So, if
 

6249
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:12,070
Point of control here. All right. So, if
they squeeze through this, you got

6250
02:31:12,070 --> 02:31:12,080
they squeeze through this, you got
 

6251
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:13,590
they squeeze through this, you got
previous week point of control, current

6252
02:31:13,590 --> 02:31:13,600
previous week point of control, current
 

6253
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:16,150
previous week point of control, current
value area high 604.

6254
02:31:16,150 --> 02:31:16,160
value area high 604.
 

6255
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:17,429
value area high 604.
That's kind of the level that it can

6256
02:31:17,429 --> 02:31:17,439
That's kind of the level that it can
 

6257
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:18,710
That's kind of the level that it can
trade up to. And if they're going to

6258
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:18,720
trade up to. And if they're going to
 

6259
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:20,230
trade up to. And if they're going to
start really turning this on, they're

6260
02:31:20,230 --> 02:31:20,240
start really turning this on, they're
 

6261
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:22,469
start really turning this on, they're
going to have to start setting a big old

6262
02:31:22,469 --> 02:31:22,479
going to have to start setting a big old
 

6263
02:31:22,479 --> 02:31:27,750
going to have to start setting a big old
squeeze out. Uh ES starting to go,

6264
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:27,760

 

6265
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:29,830

spy starting to go. Previous uh day

6266
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:29,840
spy starting to go. Previous uh day
 

6267
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,429
spy starting to go. Previous uh day
close possible on the spy here. It's

6268
02:31:31,429 --> 02:31:31,439
close possible on the spy here. It's
 

6269
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:33,830
close possible on the spy here. It's
really not very far away. Same with ES

6270
02:31:33,830 --> 02:31:33,840
really not very far away. Same with ES
 

6271
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,750
really not very far away. Same with ES
should go and fill that gap now on those

6272
02:31:35,750 --> 02:31:35,760
should go and fill that gap now on those
 

6273
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:38,230
should go and fill that gap now on those
markets. I would say big old squeeze out

6274
02:31:38,230 --> 02:31:38,240
markets. I would say big old squeeze out
 

6275
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:41,270
markets. I would say big old squeeze out
here is possible on those markets. 600 a

6276
02:31:41,270 --> 02:31:41,280
here is possible on those markets. 600 a
 

6277
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:52,309
here is possible on those markets. 600 a
big level.

6278
02:31:52,309 --> 02:31:52,319

 

6279
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:54,710

So ES is getting very close to this

6280
02:31:54,710 --> 02:31:54,720
So ES is getting very close to this
 

6281
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:56,950
So ES is getting very close to this
level up here. It's very close to this

6282
02:31:56,950 --> 02:31:56,960
level up here. It's very close to this
 

6283
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:59,510
level up here. It's very close to this
close up here. So relative strength in

6284
02:31:59,510 --> 02:31:59,520
close up here. So relative strength in
 

6285
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,670
close up here. So relative strength in
those markets. So possible squeeze up

6286
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:01,680
those markets. So possible squeeze up
 

6287
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:04,710
those markets. So possible squeeze up
here. I'd say we're now above value um

6288
02:32:04,710 --> 02:32:04,720
here. I'd say we're now above value um
 

6289
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:07,030
here. I'd say we're now above value um
point control on the day. Lots of buying

6290
02:32:07,030 --> 02:32:07,040
point control on the day. Lots of buying
 

6291
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:08,389
point control on the day. Lots of buying
coming in here. It's just whether they

6292
02:32:08,389 --> 02:32:08,399
coming in here. It's just whether they
 

6293
02:32:08,399 --> 02:32:09,750
coming in here. It's just whether they
can continue a squeeze. You've been

6294
02:32:09,750 --> 02:32:09,760
can continue a squeeze. You've been
 

6295
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:11,270
can continue a squeeze. You've been
straight up. This is just a huge squeeze

6296
02:32:11,270 --> 02:32:11,280
straight up. This is just a huge squeeze
 

6297
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:14,389
straight up. This is just a huge squeeze
out. It's nothing else.

6298
02:32:14,389 --> 02:32:14,399
out. It's nothing else.
 

6299
02:32:14,399 --> 02:32:17,190
out. It's nothing else.
So reflipped value, so held value. So

6300
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:17,200
So reflipped value, so held value. So
 

6301
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:18,469
So reflipped value, so held value. So
now you're starting to see alignment

6302
02:32:18,469 --> 02:32:18,479
now you're starting to see alignment
 

6303
02:32:18,479 --> 02:32:20,630
now you're starting to see alignment
where weekly players want it up, daily

6304
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:20,640
where weekly players want it up, daily
 

6305
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:23,750
where weekly players want it up, daily
players want it up, and where they're

6306
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:23,760
players want it up, and where they're
 

6307
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:27,190
players want it up, and where they're
trying to go. Weekly, weekly, daily, and

6308
02:32:27,190 --> 02:32:27,200
trying to go. Weekly, weekly, daily, and
 

6309
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:28,870
trying to go. Weekly, weekly, daily, and
then these levels up here. Completion of

6310
02:32:28,870 --> 02:32:28,880
then these levels up here. Completion of
 

6311
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:30,309
then these levels up here. Completion of
rotation will be all the way up here. So

6312
02:32:30,309 --> 02:32:30,319
rotation will be all the way up here. So
 

6313
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:33,270
rotation will be all the way up here. So
if we're not going to auction under

6314
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:33,280
if we're not going to auction under
 

6315
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,510
if we're not going to auction under
these then we should auction back to

6316
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:35,520
these then we should auction back to
 

6317
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:37,030
these then we should auction back to
this

6318
02:32:37,030 --> 02:32:37,040
this
 

6319
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:38,790
this
should

6320
02:32:38,790 --> 02:32:38,800
should
 

6321
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:41,190
should
didn't do it earlier has failed numerous

6322
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:41,200
didn't do it earlier has failed numerous
 

6323
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:52,550
didn't do it earlier has failed numerous
times and this is your key level.

6324
02:32:52,550 --> 02:32:52,560

 

6325
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:55,510

So, here's a retest of previous day

6326
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:55,520
So, here's a retest of previous day
 

6327
02:32:55,520 --> 02:33:05,670
So, here's a retest of previous day
again.

6328
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:05,680

 

6329
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:07,349

Are they just really going to leave this

6330
02:33:07,349 --> 02:33:07,359
Are they just really going to leave this
 

6331
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:14,790
Are they just really going to leave this
pinned in between the two?

6332
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:14,800

 

6333
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:16,870

VIX finding a bit of previous day low. I

6334
02:33:16,870 --> 02:33:16,880
VIX finding a bit of previous day low. I
 

6335
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:18,710
VIX finding a bit of previous day low. I
can't imagine this auctions finished

6336
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:18,720
can't imagine this auctions finished
 

6337
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:20,710
can't imagine this auctions finished
higher after just work. They've just

6338
02:33:20,710 --> 02:33:20,720
higher after just work. They've just
 

6339
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:24,070
higher after just work. They've just
worked so hard to do this move. Are they

6340
02:33:24,070 --> 02:33:24,080
worked so hard to do this move. Are they
 

6341
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:25,270
worked so hard to do this move. Are they
literally going to give this right back

6342
02:33:25,270 --> 02:33:25,280
literally going to give this right back
 

6343
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:27,270
literally going to give this right back
to 24s? I cannot imagine them doing

6344
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:27,280
to 24s? I cannot imagine them doing
 

6345
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:29,429
to 24s? I cannot imagine them doing
that. But they've done some weird things

6346
02:33:29,429 --> 02:33:29,439
that. But they've done some weird things
 

6347
02:33:29,439 --> 02:33:31,910
that. But they've done some weird things
today in leaving liquidity.

6348
02:33:31,910 --> 02:33:31,920
today in leaving liquidity.
 

6349
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:33,750
today in leaving liquidity.
So ES just poked through initial balance

6350
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:33,760
So ES just poked through initial balance
 

6351
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:36,790
So ES just poked through initial balance
high. Look above IB high and fail. It

6352
02:33:36,790 --> 02:33:36,800
high. Look above IB high and fail. It
 

6353
02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:39,510
high. Look above IB high and fail. It
had a gap filled to 91. We got up to 86.

6354
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:39,520
had a gap filled to 91. We got up to 86.
 

6355
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:41,670
had a gap filled to 91. We got up to 86.
It's now rotating back inside. It might

6356
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:41,680
It's now rotating back inside. It might
 

6357
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:48,150
It's now rotating back inside. It might
try and test 78 to 75 on ES. Uh spy just

6358
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:48,160
try and test 78 to 75 on ES. Uh spy just
 

6359
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:50,790
try and test 78 to 75 on ES. Uh spy just
ripped up to 87. might well come back

6360
02:33:50,790 --> 02:33:50,800
ripped up to 87. might well come back
 

6361
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:53,910
ripped up to 87. might well come back
here to what's this 86es. You wouldn't

6362
02:33:53,910 --> 02:33:53,920
here to what's this 86es. You wouldn't
 

6363
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:55,429
here to what's this 86es. You wouldn't
want to see it back at 85. If it comes

6364
02:33:55,429 --> 02:33:55,439
want to see it back at 85. If it comes
 

6365
02:33:55,439 --> 02:33:57,590
want to see it back at 85. If it comes
all the way back at 85, it's major

6366
02:33:57,590 --> 02:33:57,600
all the way back at 85, it's major
 

6367
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:04,070
all the way back at 85, it's major
problem again.

6368
02:34:04,070 --> 02:34:04,080

 

6369
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:19,349

Gold alltime high. Is it really? O

6370
02:34:19,349 --> 02:34:19,359

 

6371
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:22,150

node here. They need to hold this. So,

6372
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:22,160
node here. They need to hold this. So,
 

6373
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:23,750
node here. They need to hold this. So,
they just got stuck at point control

6374
02:34:23,750 --> 02:34:23,760
they just got stuck at point control
 

6375
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:26,150
they just got stuck at point control
again. So, current and previous week

6376
02:34:26,150 --> 02:34:26,160
again. So, current and previous week
 

6377
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:28,630
again. So, current and previous week
point control hit all here and current

6378
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:28,640
point control hit all here and current
 

6379
02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:30,630
point control hit all here and current
value area high, value area low for the

6380
02:34:30,630 --> 02:34:30,640
value area high, value area low for the
 

6381
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:32,389
value area high, value area low for the
week. So, there's your resistance point

6382
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:32,399
week. So, there's your resistance point
 

6383
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:34,389
week. So, there's your resistance point
and this might be the new rotation. Oh

6384
02:34:34,389 --> 02:34:34,399
and this might be the new rotation. Oh
 

6385
02:34:34,399 --> 02:34:36,230
and this might be the new rotation. Oh
my god. So, all they had to do is get

6386
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,240
my god. So, all they had to do is get
 

6387
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:37,750
my god. So, all they had to do is get
over that for the squeeze. They failed.

6388
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:37,760
over that for the squeeze. They failed.
 

6389
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:39,349
over that for the squeeze. They failed.
So, this might be the new rotation, you

6390
02:34:39,349 --> 02:34:39,359
So, this might be the new rotation, you
 

6391
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:44,389
So, this might be the new rotation, you
know.

6392
02:34:44,389 --> 02:34:44,399

 

6393
02:34:44,399 --> 02:34:47,510

Pathetic. They're pathetic. Both sides

6394
02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:47,520
Pathetic. They're pathetic. Both sides
 

6395
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:50,550
Pathetic. They're pathetic. Both sides
pathetic.

6396
02:34:50,550 --> 02:34:50,560

 

6397
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:56,790

No Santa rally for NASDAQ. Um

6398
02:34:56,790 --> 02:34:56,800

 

6399
02:34:56,800 --> 02:34:59,990

probably not. But uh I mean things can

6400
02:34:59,990 --> 02:35:00,000
probably not. But uh I mean things can
 

6401
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,870
probably not. But uh I mean things can
change very quickly like we know.

6402
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:02,880
change very quickly like we know.
 

6403
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:05,030
change very quickly like we know.
This got news hitting the tape bit. What

6404
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:05,040
This got news hitting the tape bit. What
 

6405
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:31,429
This got news hitting the tape bit. What
is going on here?

6406
02:35:31,429 --> 02:35:31,439

 

6407
02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:33,110

So, back down into the shelf and view

6408
02:35:33,110 --> 02:35:33,120
So, back down into the shelf and view
 

6409
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:53,990
So, back down into the shelf and view
up.

6410
02:35:53,990 --> 02:35:54,000

 

6411
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,510

So, straight squeeze up. We uh lacked a

6412
02:35:57,510 --> 02:35:57,520
So, straight squeeze up. We uh lacked a
 

6413
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:59,190
So, straight squeeze up. We uh lacked a
pullback. Here comes the pullback. Do

6414
02:35:59,190 --> 02:35:59,200
pullback. Here comes the pullback. Do
 

6415
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:01,349
pullback. Here comes the pullback. Do
they find a bid here now? Or are they

6416
02:36:01,349 --> 02:36:01,359
they find a bid here now? Or are they
 

6417
02:36:01,359 --> 02:36:02,710
they find a bid here now? Or are they
just going to collapse this whole thing

6418
02:36:02,710 --> 02:36:02,720
just going to collapse this whole thing
 

6419
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:11,590
just going to collapse this whole thing
from one side to the other?

6420
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:11,600

 

6421
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:21,830

Dogs just w. All right, Luna.

6422
02:36:21,830 --> 02:36:21,840

 

6423
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:23,190

So, if we lose this shelf, we're going

6424
02:36:23,190 --> 02:36:23,200
So, if we lose this shelf, we're going
 

6425
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:24,630
So, if we lose this shelf, we're going
to go into that low volume node and

6426
02:36:24,630 --> 02:36:24,640
to go into that low volume node and
 

6427
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:26,070
to go into that low volume node and
trade right the way back down to the

6428
02:36:26,070 --> 02:36:26,080
trade right the way back down to the
 

6429
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:29,190
trade right the way back down to the
500s.

6430
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:29,200

 

6431
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:30,790

I expect they would try and hold this

6432
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:30,800
I expect they would try and hold this
 

6433
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:39,750
I expect they would try and hold this
shelf here,

6434
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:39,760

this market is terrible. It's just
 

6461
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:07,110
this market is terrible. It's just

uh we lack we lack any structure here.
 

6467

uh we lack we lack any structure here.
We lack any confirmation. They they had

6468
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:15,120
We lack any confirmation. They they had
 

6469
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:17,349
We lack any confirmation. They they had
the ability here to try and confirm

6470
02:37:17,349 --> 02:37:17,359
the ability here to try and confirm
 

6471

the ability here to try and confirm
weekly and daily buys tried to confirm

6472

weekly and daily buys tried to confirm
 

6473
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:20,950
weekly and daily buys tried to confirm
to go higher. They failed. They're going

6474
02:37:20,950 --> 02:37:20,960
to go higher. They failed. They're going
 

6475
02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:22,309
to go higher. They failed. They're going
to come straight back down. Here's your

6476
02:37:22,309 --> 02:37:22,319
to come straight back down. Here's your
 

6477
02:37:22,319 --> 02:37:24,389
to come straight back down. Here's your
node. They can look for that rotation.

6478
02:37:24,389 --> 02:37:24,399
node. They can look for that rotation.
 

6479
02:37:24,399 --> 02:37:25,670
node. They can look for that rotation.
If they fail that, they look for this

6480
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:25,680
If they fail that, they look for this
 

6481
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:27,910
If they fail that, they look for this
rotation. This just becomes a no trade

6482
02:37:27,910 --> 02:37:27,920
rotation. This just becomes a no trade
 

6483
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:30,389
rotation. This just becomes a no trade
zone for me. I've maintained that

6484
02:37:30,389 --> 02:37:30,399
zone for me. I've maintained that
 

6485
02:37:30,399 --> 02:37:32,230
zone for me. I've maintained that
numerous times. If we can get outside of

6486
02:37:32,230 --> 02:37:32,240
numerous times. If we can get outside of
 

6487
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:34,309
numerous times. If we can get outside of
value, I'm interested in trading. Once

6488
02:37:34,309 --> 02:37:34,319
value, I'm interested in trading. Once
 

6489
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:37,030
value, I'm interested in trading. Once
we're inside of value, when it's, you

6490
02:37:37,030 --> 02:37:37,040
we're inside of value, when it's, you
 

6491
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:39,510
we're inside of value, when it's, you
know, unwilling to move properly, I'm

6492
02:37:39,510 --> 02:37:39,520
know, unwilling to move properly, I'm

dealers, just pull it. Pull your 85. Let
 

6683
02:42:29,359 --> 02:42:31,750
dealers, just pull it. Pull your 85. Let
it go 82. It would be so much fun if you

6684
02:42:31,750 --> 02:42:31,760
it go 82. It would be so much fun if you
 

6685
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:34,389
it go 82. It would be so much fun if you
actually do that. Finally, we've got

6686
02:42:34,389 --> 02:42:34,399
actually do that. Finally, we've got
 

6687
02:42:34,399 --> 02:42:35,910
actually do that. Finally, we've got
GlobeEx to go for. There's a low hanging

6688
02:42:35,910 --> 02:42:35,920
GlobeEx to go for. There's a low hanging
 

6689
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:37,990
GlobeEx to go for. There's a low hanging
fruit down there we can go for. Come on,

6690
02:42:37,990 --> 02:42:38,000
fruit down there we can go for. Come on,
 

6691
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,150
fruit down there we can go for. Come on,
market. You've got to get under these

6692
02:42:40,150 --> 02:42:40,160
market. You've got to get under these
 

6693
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:42,230
market. You've got to get under these
70s.

6694
02:42:42,230 --> 02:42:42,240
70s.
 

6695
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:43,830
70s.
I tell you what, there was last time we

6696
02:42:43,830 --> 02:42:43,840
I tell you what, there was last time we
 

6697
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:45,349
I tell you what, there was last time we
down here, there was a seller stuck at

6698
02:42:45,349 --> 02:42:45,359
down here, there was a seller stuck at
 

6699
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:47,910
down here, there was a seller stuck at
58. So, just be aware of that from when

6700
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:47,920
58. So, just be aware of that from when
 

6701
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:53,349
58. So, just be aware of that from when
we were down here at 11:30.

6702
02:42:53,349 --> 02:42:53,359

 

6703
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:55,590

There's a chance to I I do think there's

6704
02:42:55,590 --> 02:42:55,600
There's a chance to I I do think there's
 

6705
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:57,030
There's a chance to I I do think there's
a chance to snap this. It's just whether

6706
02:42:57,030 --> 02:42:57,040
a chance to snap this. It's just whether
 

6707
02:42:57,040 --> 02:43:00,469
a chance to snap this. It's just whether
they need to pop it up first

6708
02:43:00,469 --> 02:43:00,479
they need to pop it up first
 

6709
02:43:00,479 --> 02:43:03,990
they need to pop it up first
because it's a third visit. Now,

6710
02:43:03,990 --> 02:43:04,000
because it's a third visit. Now,
 

6711
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,870
because it's a third visit. Now,
once this goes, we've got a low hanging

6712
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:06,880
once this goes, we've got a low hanging
 

6713
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:09,270
once this goes, we've got a low hanging
fruit down here. This is just rotation,

6714
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:09,280
fruit down here. This is just rotation,
 

6715
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:10,630
fruit down here. This is just rotation,
rotation, rotation. I want to play

6716
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:10,640
rotation, rotation. I want to play
 

6717
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:12,230
rotation, rotation. I want to play
outside of rotation. I don't want to

6718
02:43:12,230 --> 02:43:12,240
outside of rotation. I don't want to
 

6719
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:14,790
outside of rotation. I don't want to
play in here. I want to see this if

6720
02:43:14,790 --> 02:43:14,800
play in here. I want to see this if
 

6721
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:16,150
play in here. I want to see this if
we're going to play that or I want to

6722
02:43:16,150 --> 02:43:16,160
we're going to play that or I want to
 

6723
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:17,750
we're going to play that or I want to
see this if we're going to play that. I

6724
02:43:17,750 --> 02:43:17,760
see this if we're going to play that. I
 

6725
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:19,670
see this if we're going to play that. I
don't want to play in that. It's just

6726
02:43:19,670 --> 02:43:19,680
don't want to play in that. It's just
 

6727
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:22,710
don't want to play in that. It's just
garbage.

6728
02:43:22,710 --> 02:43:22,720

 

6729
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:25,750

Okay, here comes Mr. Bid bid.

6730
02:43:25,750 --> 02:43:25,760
Okay, here comes Mr. Bid bid.
 

6731
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:31,670
Okay, here comes Mr. Bid bid.
Mr. 85 absorbing again.

6732
02:43:31,670 --> 02:43:31,680

 

6733
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:37,030

Bid bid bid bid bid bid bid. Come on.

6734
02:43:37,030 --> 02:43:37,040
Bid bid bid bid bid bid bid. Come on.
 

6735
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:41,270
Bid bid bid bid bid bid bid. Come on.
Seller stepping down into 512s here.

6736
02:43:41,270 --> 02:43:41,280
Seller stepping down into 512s here.
 

6737
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:42,630
Seller stepping down into 512s here.
So, they're trying to get filled into

6738
02:43:42,630 --> 02:43:42,640
So, they're trying to get filled into
 

6739
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:44,710
So, they're trying to get filled into
twelves here. Oh, he's just pulled it up

6740
02:43:44,710 --> 02:43:44,720
twelves here. Oh, he's just pulled it up
 

6741
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,550
twelves here. Oh, he's just pulled it up
higher.

6742
02:43:46,550 --> 02:43:46,560
higher.
 

6743
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:49,269
higher.
He's moved up to 37s here now. Let's see

6744
02:43:49,269 --> 02:43:49,279
He's moved up to 37s here now. Let's see
 

6745
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:53,510
He's moved up to 37s here now. Let's see
if they pop this up and then smack it.

6746
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:53,520
if they pop this up and then smack it.
 

6747
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:56,150
if they pop this up and then smack it.
Answer is so far, yes. Okay, this is

6748
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,160
Answer is so far, yes. Okay, this is
 

6749
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:58,389
Answer is so far, yes. Okay, this is
good. They need follow through now. Now

6750
02:43:58,389 --> 02:43:58,399
good. They need follow through now. Now
 

6751
02:43:58,399 --> 02:44:00,150
good. They need follow through now. Now
or never for these spares. They need

6752
02:44:00,150 --> 02:44:00,160
or never for these spares. They need
 

6753
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:01,349
or never for these spares. They need
follow through now. Now or never because

6754
02:44:01,349 --> 02:44:01,359
follow through now. Now or never because
 

6755
02:44:01,359 --> 02:44:03,910
follow through now. Now or never because
they just came flying in. Doesn't look

6756
02:44:03,910 --> 02:44:03,920
they just came flying in. Doesn't look
 

6757
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:06,389
they just came flying in. Doesn't look
good for them.

6758
02:44:06,389 --> 02:44:06,399
good for them.
 

6759
02:44:06,399 --> 02:44:07,910
good for them.
And you got a spoofer on the tape who

6760
02:44:07,910 --> 02:44:07,920
And you got a spoofer on the tape who
 

6761
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:09,429
And you got a spoofer on the tape who
keeps lifting his offer. That's not

6762
02:44:09,429 --> 02:44:09,439
keeps lifting his offer. That's not
 

6763
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:10,790
keeps lifting his offer. That's not
good. Look. And he's just lifted again.

6764
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:10,800
good. Look. And he's just lifted again.
 

6765
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:13,590
good. Look. And he's just lifted again.
That's not a look a good look at all for

6766
02:44:13,590 --> 02:44:13,600
That's not a look a good look at all for
 

6767
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:15,190
That's not a look a good look at all for
these bears. If you've got a spoofer

6768
02:44:15,190 --> 02:44:15,200
these bears. If you've got a spoofer
 

6769
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:17,830
these bears. If you've got a spoofer
lifting his offer, probably means he's a

6770
02:44:17,830 --> 02:44:17,840
lifting his offer, probably means he's a
 

6771
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:19,349
lifting his offer, probably means he's a
buyer and he's not actually interested

6772
02:44:19,349 --> 02:44:19,359
buyer and he's not actually interested
 

6773
02:44:19,359 --> 02:44:20,550
buyer and he's not actually interested
in getting filled to the sell. So,

6774
02:44:20,550 --> 02:44:20,560
in getting filled to the sell. So,
 

6775
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:21,349
in getting filled to the sell. So,
you're going to have to wait for a

6776
02:44:21,349 --> 02:44:21,359
you're going to have to wait for a
 

6777
02:44:21,359 --> 02:44:22,790
you're going to have to wait for a
momentum shift here to come. And it's

6778
02:44:22,790 --> 02:44:22,800
momentum shift here to come. And it's
 

6779
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:24,309
momentum shift here to come. And it's
gone buy side delta and they're starting

6780
02:44:24,309 --> 02:44:24,319
gone buy side delta and they're starting
 

6781
02:44:24,319 --> 02:44:26,230
gone buy side delta and they're starting
to try and squeeze this all the way back

6782
02:44:26,230 --> 02:44:26,240
to try and squeeze this all the way back
 

6783
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:28,070
to try and squeeze this all the way back
out. I'd say 500 is going to be the key

6784
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:28,080
out. I'd say 500 is going to be the key
 

6785
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:30,550
out. I'd say 500 is going to be the key
level over 500 low volume node straight

6786
02:44:30,550 --> 02:44:30,560
level over 500 low volume node straight
 

6787
02:44:30,560 --> 02:44:32,710
level over 500 low volume node straight
up to 520. So, if they get over 500,

6788
02:44:32,710 --> 02:44:32,720
up to 520. So, if they get over 500,
 

6789
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:35,110
up to 520. So, if they get over 500,
they're going 520 and you're right back

6790
02:44:35,110 --> 02:44:35,120
they're going 520 and you're right back
 

6791
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:38,150
they're going 520 and you're right back
into this low volume node here. So bears

6792
02:44:38,150 --> 02:44:38,160
into this low volume node here. So bears
 

6793
02:44:38,160 --> 02:44:40,710
into this low volume node here. So bears
failing miserably to get this breakdown.

6794
02:44:40,710 --> 02:44:40,720
failing miserably to get this breakdown.
 

6795
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:42,230
failing miserably to get this breakdown.
This is their level to defend. If they

6796

this becomes yet again a no trade zone
 

6801
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:47,990
this becomes yet again a no trade zone
because we never broke underneath value

6802
02:44:47,990 --> 02:44:48,000
because we never broke underneath value

control and they are not. That's all I

Is it lunch now? Oh, yes. Okay. So,
 

6847
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:49,990

small day. I mean, relatively speaking,

6848
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,000
small day. I mean, relatively speaking,
 

6849
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,230
small day. I mean, relatively speaking,
considering what was in front of me, I

6850
02:45:52,230 --> 02:45:52,240
considering what was in front of me, I
 

6851
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:55,190
considering what was in front of me, I
don't think that was really the best ex

6852
02:45:55,190 --> 02:45:55,200
don't think that was really the best ex
 

6853

6854
02:45:56,870 --> 02:45:56,880
execution
 

6855
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:59,429
execution
today. Where did we trade? We traded the

6856
02:45:59,429 --> 02:45:59,439
today. Where did we trade? We traded the
 

6857
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:01,349
today. Where did we trade? We traded the
breakdown under underneath previous

6858
02:46:01,349 --> 02:46:01,359
breakdown under underneath previous
 

6859
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:03,510
breakdown under underneath previous
week, right? We caught that there. That

6860
02:46:03,510 --> 02:46:03,520
week, right? We caught that there. That
 

6861
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:05,510
week, right? We caught that there. That
was it. That's all we caught. It's the

6862
02:46:05,510 --> 02:46:05,520
was it. That's all we caught. It's the
 

6863
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:09,510
was it. That's all we caught. It's the
only time all day that we've left value

6864
02:46:09,510 --> 02:46:09,520
only time all day that we've left value
 

6865
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:11,269
only time all day that we've left value
once we reclaimed it. There was probably

6866
02:46:11,269 --> 02:46:11,279
once we reclaimed it. There was probably
 

6867
02:46:11,279 --> 02:46:13,110
once we reclaimed it. There was probably
a trade upside, but like we say, Alex

6868
02:46:13,110 --> 02:46:13,120
a trade upside, but like we say, Alex
 

6869
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:15,590
a trade upside, but like we say, Alex
doesn't like trading inside value. So,

6870
02:46:15,590 --> 02:46:15,600
doesn't like trading inside value. So,
 

6871
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:18,710
doesn't like trading inside value. So,
ever since 10:05, there's basically not

6872
02:46:18,710 --> 02:46:18,720
ever since 10:05, there's basically not
 

6873
02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:21,349
ever since 10:05, there's basically not
been a trade opportunity.

6874
02:46:21,349 --> 02:46:21,359
been a trade opportunity.
 

6875
02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:24,469
been a trade opportunity.

6924
02:47:58,469 --> 02:47:58,479
going to have to hold it for one to five
 

6925
02:47:58,479 --> 02:48:00,630

Because they've done a split now. So,

6930
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:04,640
Because they've done a split now. So,
 

6931
02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:06,630
Because they've done a split now. So,
lots more liquidity injected in here

6932

lots more liquidity injected in here
 

6933
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:07,990
lots more liquidity injected in here
now. So, it's going to take a longer

6934
02:48:07,990 --> 02:48:08,000
now. So, it's going to take a longer
 

6935
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:11,750
now. So, it's going to take a longer
time.

Which one is best?
 

7057
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:51,670
Which one is best?
It really depends what size you like

7058
02:52:51,670 --> 02:52:51,680
It really depends what size you like
 

7059
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:55,110
It really depends what size you like
trading, what your ambitions are. Um 25k

7060
02:52:55,110 --> 02:52:55,120
trading, what your ambitions are. Um 25k
 

7061
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:58,070
trading, what your ambitions are. Um 25k
50k are in terms of RR are the best. All

7062
02:52:58,070 --> 02:52:58,080
50k are in terms of RR are the best. All
 

7063
02:52:58,080 --> 02:53:01,190
50k are in terms of RR are the best. All
right, they're the easiest to pass. Um

7064
02:53:01,190 --> 02:53:01,200
right, they're the easiest to pass. Um
 

7065
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:02,870
right, they're the easiest to pass. Um
but they obviously give you less draw

7066
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:02,880
but they obviously give you less draw
 

7067
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:05,830
but they obviously give you less draw
down. The bigger the accounts, uh the

7068
02:53:05,830 --> 02:53:05,840
down. The bigger the accounts, uh the
 

7069
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:07,429
down. The bigger the accounts, uh the
more draw down you get, but the less

7070
02:53:07,429 --> 02:53:07,439
more draw down you get, but the less
 

7071
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:08,790
more draw down you get, but the less
efficient they are because you're going

7072
02:53:08,790 --> 02:53:08,800
efficient they are because you're going
 

7073
02:53:08,800 --> 02:53:11,030
efficient they are because you're going
to need to make three, four, five R in

7074
02:53:11,030 --> 02:53:11,040
to need to make three, four, five R in
 

7075
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:14,630
to need to make three, four, five R in
terms of your uh trading draw down. So

7076
02:53:14,630 --> 02:53:14,640
terms of your uh trading draw down. So
 

7077
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:18,150
terms of your uh trading draw down. So
my advice is always 50ks.

7078
02:53:18,150 --> 02:53:18,160
my advice is always 50ks.
 

7079
02:53:18,160 --> 02:53:20,710
my advice is always 50ks.
50ks nice and small. Let them build.

7080
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:20,720
50ks nice and small. Let them build.
 

7081
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:22,870
50ks nice and small. Let them build.
That's the way to do it in my opinion.

7082
02:53:22,870 --> 02:53:22,880
That's the way to do it in my opinion.
 

7083
02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:24,870
That's the way to do it in my opinion.
I've got plenty of videos on that. But

7084
02:53:24,870 --> 02:53:24,880
I've got plenty of videos on that. But
 

7085
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:26,950
I've got plenty of videos on that. But
again, look, if you don't like trading

7086
02:53:26,950 --> 02:53:26,960
again, look, if you don't like trading
 

7087
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:28,630

That would be the big mover, especially

surprised to see this market yank a

little bit um like it did previously.
 

7129
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:43,830
little bit um like it did previously.
But who knows? I would love it if we

7130
02:54:43,830 --> 02:54:43,840
But who knows? I would love it if we
 

7131
02:54:43,840 --> 02:54:45,910
But who knows? I would love it if we
leave this range. It would be really

7132
02:54:45,910 --> 02:54:45,920
leave this range. It would be really
 

7133
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:48,630
leave this range. It would be really
nice. The best the best move that we

7134
02:54:48,630 --> 02:54:48,640
nice. The best the best move that we
 

7135
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:49,910
nice. The best the best move that we
could get in this market, the best thing

could get in this market, the best thing
that we could ask for in this market,

7138
02:54:51,269 --> 02:54:51,279
that we could ask for in this market,
 

7139
02:54:51,279 --> 02:54:53,030
that we could ask for in this market,
whether it's today or next week, right?

7140
02:54:53,030 --> 02:54:53,040
whether it's today or next week, right?
 

7141
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:55,429

It's really simple. Best move that we

02:54:55,429 --> 02:54:55,439
It's really simple. Best move that we
 

7143
02:54:55,439 --> 02:54:57,670
It's really simple. Best move that we
could ask for is to leave this range

7144
02:54:57,670 --> 02:54:57,680
could ask for is to leave this range
 

7145
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:00,790
could ask for is to leave this range
with a gap. All right? If we had woken

7146
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:00,800
with a gap. All right? If we had woken
 

7147
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:03,030
with a gap. All right? If we had woken
up

7148
02:55:03,030 --> 02:55:03,040
up
 

7149
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:04,550

02:55:04,550 --> 02:55:04,560
this morning and we were trading down
 

7151
02:55:04,560 --> 02:55:06,150
this morning and we were trading down
here. It would have been really obvious,

7152
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:06,160
here. It would have been really obvious,
 

7153
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:09,510
here. It would have been really obvious,
wouldn't it? Back test, failure. Really

7154
02:55:09,510 --> 02:55:09,520
wouldn't it? Back test, failure. Really
 

7155
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:13,030
wouldn't it? Back test, failure. Really
simple. Leave buyers trapped, fail. I

02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:13,040
simple. Leave buyers trapped, fail. I
 

7157
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:15,670
simple. Leave buyers trapped, fail. I
don't want us trading back inside here.

02:55:15,670 --> 02:55:15,680
don't want us trading back inside here.
 

7159
02:55:15,680 --> 02:55:16,870
don't want us trading back inside here.
All right? Because then we're not

7160
02:55:16,870 --> 02:55:16,880
All right? Because then we're not
 

7161
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:18,950
All right? Because then we're not
leaving the buyers trapped. Remember

7162
02:55:18,950 --> 02:55:18,960
leaving the buyers trapped. Remember
 

7163
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:20,950

here,
really simple. Back test, fail, trade

7166
02:55:24,389 --> 02:55:24,399
really simple. Back test, fail, trade
 

7167
02:55:24,399 --> 02:55:27,830
really simple. Back test, fail, trade
away. That's what we want. Or it's if

7168
02:55:27,830 --> 02:55:27,840
away. That's what we want. Or it's if
 

7169
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:29,910
away. That's what we want. Or it's if
AVGO has blowout earnings and we open up

7170
02:55:29,910 --> 02:55:29,920

upside. That's going to be the easiest

02:55:34,389 --> 02:55:34,399
upside. That's going to be the easiest
 

7175
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:35,830
upside. That's going to be the easiest
thing. If we're going to continue to

02:55:35,830 --> 02:55:35,840
thing. If we're going to continue to
 

7177

thing. If we're going to continue to
trade in here, I'm going to continue to
