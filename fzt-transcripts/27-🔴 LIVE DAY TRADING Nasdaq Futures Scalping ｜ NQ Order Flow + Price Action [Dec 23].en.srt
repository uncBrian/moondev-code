31
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,550

bunged up, so if I sound funny, that'll

be why. All right. You can see we're
 

35
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,629
be why. All right. You can see we're
trading this low volume node. All right.

36
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
trading this low volume node. All right.
 

37
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,710
trading this low volume node. All right.
Right here. If you're wondering what

38
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
Right here. If you're wondering what
 

39
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,990
Right here. If you're wondering what
this profile is on the side of the

40
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
this profile is on the side of the
 

41
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,230
this profile is on the side of the
chart, this is the 2025 profile. All

42
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
chart, this is the 2025 profile. All
 

43
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,550
chart, this is the 2025 profile. All
right. This is all the volume we've had

44
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
right. This is all the volume we've had
 

45
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,909
right. This is all the volume we've had
for the whole of the year. And we are

46
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
for the whole of the year. And we are
 

47
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,510
for the whole of the year. And we are
trading right in a little node at the

48
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
trading right in a little node at the
 

49
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,309
trading right in a little node at the
moment where we might potentially catch

50
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
moment where we might potentially catch
 

51
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,870
moment where we might potentially catch
a bid. All right, if they use it as

52
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
a bid. All right, if they use it as
 

53
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,390
a bid. All right, if they use it as
support, if we get under it, we will

54
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
support, if we get under it, we will
 

55
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,390
support, if we get under it, we will
probably use it as resistance. All

56
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
probably use it as resistance. All
 

57
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,590
probably use it as resistance. All
right, what are we doing? We're trying

58
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
right, what are we doing? We're trying
 

59
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,350
right, what are we doing? We're trying
to close the gap right now. So, we can

60
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
to close the gap right now. So, we can
 

61
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,550
to close the gap right now. So, we can
see this Friday to Monday gap is right

62
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
see this Friday to Monday gap is right
 

63
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,469
see this Friday to Monday gap is right
here. We're trading inside of it for the

64
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
here. We're trading inside of it for the
 

65
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,909
here. We're trading inside of it for the
second time. Yesterday, we tapped into

66
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
second time. Yesterday, we tapped into
 

67
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,790
second time. Yesterday, we tapped into
it, found a bid. Today, we are trying to

68
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
it, found a bid. Today, we are trying to
 

69
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,710
it, found a bid. Today, we are trying to
uh close it by the looks of it. At the

70
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
uh close it by the looks of it. At the
 

71
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,150
uh close it by the looks of it. At the
moment, probably right into the middle

72
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
moment, probably right into the middle
 

73
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,870
moment, probably right into the middle
point of that gap. We have lost the

74
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
point of that gap. We have lost the
 

75
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,950
point of that gap. We have lost the
20-day, not by much. It's just above us,

76
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
20-day, not by much. It's just above us,
 

77
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,189
20-day, not by much. It's just above us,
maybe 10, 20 points above us. We've got

78
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
maybe 10, 20 points above us. We've got
 

79
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,110
maybe 10, 20 points above us. We've got
the 50-day below and the 5day way, way

80
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
the 50-day below and the 5day way, way
 

81
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,790
the 50-day below and the 5day way, way
down here. All right, so the

82
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
down here. All right, so the
 

83
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,629
down here. All right, so the
opportunities are still here, both sides

84
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
opportunities are still here, both sides
 

85
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,309
opportunities are still here, both sides
of the market. If we think about what we

86
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
of the market. If we think about what we
 

87
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,589
of the market. If we think about what we
did, we talked about this from the low

88
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
did, we talked about this from the low
 

89
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,189
did, we talked about this from the low
to here.

90
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199

 

91
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,070

Alex's brain not in gear from the high

92
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
Alex's brain not in gear from the high
 

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,550
Alex's brain not in gear from the high
to here. All right, we drove up into the

94
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
to here. All right, we drove up into the
 

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,550
to here. All right, we drove up into the
golden zone. Can't get a close above the

96
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
golden zone. Can't get a close above the
 

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,589
golden zone. Can't get a close above the
786 right now. I'll keep rejecting into

98
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
786 right now. I'll keep rejecting into
 

99
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,350
786 right now. I'll keep rejecting into
this rebalance. Question is, do we find

100
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
this rebalance. Question is, do we find
 

101
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,670
this rebalance. Question is, do we find
a bid here, right, for the remainder of

102
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
a bid here, right, for the remainder of
 

103
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,670
a bid here, right, for the remainder of
the year? Is a bid found somewhere in

104
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
the year? Is a bid found somewhere in
 

105
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,909
the year? Is a bid found somewhere in
here to go and attack the highs or is

106
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
here to go and attack the highs or is
 

107
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,430
here to go and attack the highs or is
this just a little bull trap and we

108
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
this just a little bull trap and we
 

109
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,909
this just a little bull trap and we
collapse back down and we do something

110
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
collapse back down and we do something
 

111
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,589
collapse back down and we do something
like this? Time will tell. We don't know

112
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
like this? Time will tell. We don't know
 

113
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,189
like this? Time will tell. We don't know
right now. I'm definitely on low volume.

114
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
right now. I'm definitely on low volume.
 

115
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,430
right now. I'm definitely on low volume.
I'm not placing that bet. I'm not

116
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm not placing that bet. I'm not
 

117
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm not placing that bet. I'm not
looking for a big move out of this in

118
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
looking for a big move out of this in
 

119
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,790
looking for a big move out of this in
low volume. Okay, let's have a look into

120
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
low volume. Okay, let's have a look into
 

121
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,270
low volume. Okay, let's have a look into
the hourlys.

122
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280

 

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,469

Make sure you guys can see this. All

124
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
Make sure you guys can see this. All
 

125
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,070
Make sure you guys can see this. All
right, this is where it gets a little

126
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
right, this is where it gets a little
 

127
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,749
right, this is where it gets a little
tricky right now. All right, because

128
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
tricky right now. All right, because
 

129
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,510
tricky right now. All right, because
we're leaving

130
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
we're leaving
 

131
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,350
we're leaving
or we're trading between two volume

132
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
or we're trading between two volume
 

133
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,950
or we're trading between two volume
areas.

134
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
areas.
 

135
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,430
areas.
So, yesterday

136
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
So, yesterday
 

137
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,350
So, yesterday
we had a big D-shaped profile right

138
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
we had a big D-shaped profile right
 

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,430
we had a big D-shaped profile right
here. You can see this is tight, right?

140
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
here. You can see this is tight, right?
 

141
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,029
here. You can see this is tight, right?
717s

142
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
717s
 

143
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,790
717s
to 75s. There's not a lot in that. 40

144
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
to 75s. There's not a lot in that. 40
 

145
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,350
to 75s. There's not a lot in that. 40
odd points. Okay, there's not a lot to

146
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
odd points. Okay, there's not a lot to
 

147
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,869
odd points. Okay, there's not a lot to
play with there. But this is where we

148
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
play with there. But this is where we
 

149
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,230
play with there. But this is where we
couldn't find acceptance above. We

150
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
couldn't find acceptance above. We
 

151
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,909
couldn't find acceptance above. We
didn't find acceptance below. We traded

152
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
didn't find acceptance below. We traded
 

153
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,830
didn't find acceptance below. We traded
sideways all day like we predicted but

154
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
sideways all day like we predicted but
 

155
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,070
sideways all day like we predicted but
we have now broken down away from it on

156
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
we have now broken down away from it on
 

157
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,029
we have now broken down away from it on
that news trading into the gap. So the

158
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
that news trading into the gap. So the
 

159
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,790
that news trading into the gap. So the
question is very simple. Are we going to

160
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
question is very simple. Are we going to
 

161
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,430
question is very simple. Are we going to
reject volume or value from yesterday?

162
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
reject volume or value from yesterday?
 

163
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,589
reject volume or value from yesterday?
Are we going to migrate value lower? Are

164
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
Are we going to migrate value lower? Are
 

165
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,670
Are we going to migrate value lower? Are
we going to come into here reject value

166
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
we going to come into here reject value
 

167
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,589
we going to come into here reject value
area lower in front of value area low

168
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
area lower in front of value area low
 

169
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,350
area lower in front of value area low
and close this gap if there's going to

170
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
and close this gap if there's going to
 

171
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,190
and close this gap if there's going to
be follow through? Are we going to get

172
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
be follow through? Are we going to get
 

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,589
be follow through? Are we going to get
down to previous day value area high?

174
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
down to previous day value area high?
 

175
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,509
down to previous day value area high?
All right with there is a node here

176
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
All right with there is a node here
 

177
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,829
All right with there is a node here
which is why I've marked it out. So, I'm

178
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
which is why I've marked it out. So, I'm
 

179
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,750
which is why I've marked it out. So, I'm
watching this to see, do we find a bid

180
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
watching this to see, do we find a bid
 

181
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,990
watching this to see, do we find a bid
in and around, let's just call it 580

182
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
in and around, let's just call it 580
 

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,430
in and around, let's just call it 580
down to 520. All right. So, if we're

184
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
down to 520. All right. So, if we're
 

185
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,350
down to 520. All right. So, if we're
going to have one more little drive

186
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
going to have one more little drive
 

187
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,110
going to have one more little drive
lower to fill the gap and maybe do some

188
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
lower to fill the gap and maybe do some
 

189
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,030
lower to fill the gap and maybe do some
more damage, then I'd be looking for

190
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
more damage, then I'd be looking for
 

191
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,030
more damage, then I'd be looking for
this move here. Some kind of bull trap

192
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
this move here. Some kind of bull trap
 

193
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,350
this move here. Some kind of bull trap
here and cover points would be here.

194
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
here and cover points would be here.
 

195
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,030
here and cover points would be here.
Three point three points really close

196
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
Three point three points really close
 

197
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,829
Three point three points really close
the gap little node previous week value

198
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
the gap little node previous week value
 

199
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,750
the gap little node previous week value
area high.

200
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
area high.
 

201
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,829
area high.
If we come down here on a morning flush,

202
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
If we come down here on a morning flush,
 

203
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,750
If we come down here on a morning flush,
all right, without giving the good sell

204
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
all right, without giving the good sell
 

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,910
all right, without giving the good sell
signal, I'll be ignoring the shorts and

206
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
signal, I'll be ignoring the shorts and
 

207
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,110
signal, I'll be ignoring the shorts and
I'll wait and see. Are we going to find

208
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
I'll wait and see. Are we going to find
 

209
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,150
I'll wait and see. Are we going to find
a bid here, here, or here to come back

210
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
a bid here, here, or here to come back
 

211
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,310
a bid here, here, or here to come back
up, right? So, I'm willing to play both

212
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
up, right? So, I'm willing to play both
 

213
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,389
up, right? So, I'm willing to play both
sides of this tape as long as we go to

214
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
sides of this tape as long as we go to
 

215
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,910
sides of this tape as long as we go to
an extreme. If we go up into previous

216
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
an extreme. If we go up into previous
 

217
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,630
an extreme. If we go up into previous
days value and there is no reaction,

218
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
days value and there is no reaction,
 

219
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,829
days value and there is no reaction,
right, and we do something like this,

220
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
right, and we do something like this,
 

221
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,509
right, and we do something like this,
then we're going to expect this, right?

222
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
then we're going to expect this, right?
 

223
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,110
then we're going to expect this, right?
We're going to expect move from lower

224
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
We're going to expect move from lower
 

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,710
We're going to expect move from lower
value to higher value. It's not a lot to

226
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
value to higher value. It's not a lot to
 

227
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,509
value to higher value. It's not a lot to
move from. So if you wanted to play that

228
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
move from. So if you wanted to play that
 

229
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,269
move from. So if you wanted to play that
and we reclaim it, you could look for

230
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
and we reclaim it, you could look for
 

231
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,190
and we reclaim it, you could look for
this move back to the top side of value

232
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
this move back to the top side of value
 

233
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,710
this move back to the top side of value
if you wanted to play inside of

234
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
if you wanted to play inside of
 

235
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,269
if you wanted to play inside of
yesterday's value.

236
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
yesterday's value.
 

237
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,509
yesterday's value.
If big big [clears throat] if here, but

238
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
If big big [clears throat] if here, but
 

239
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,590
If big big [clears throat] if here, but
if we lose previous week's value area

240
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
if we lose previous week's value area
 

241
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,110
if we lose previous week's value area
high,

242
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
high,
 

243
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,870
high,
the natural progression, if suddenly the

244
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
the natural progression, if suddenly the
 

245
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,710
the natural progression, if suddenly the
market got very very heavy, I'd find it

246
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
market got very very heavy, I'd find it
 

247
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,870
market got very very heavy, I'd find it
somewhat surprising on what I'm going to

248
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
somewhat surprising on what I'm going to
 

249
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,389
somewhat surprising on what I'm going to
consider a holiday session. Then you'd

250
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
consider a holiday session. Then you'd
 

251
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,870
consider a holiday session. Then you'd
be looking for a move down here, 400s,

252
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
be looking for a move down here, 400s,
 

253
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,110
be looking for a move down here, 400s,
440s, right into point of control. if it

254
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
440s, right into point of control. if it
 

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,150
440s, right into point of control. if it
really got a weak week all the way down

256
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
really got a weak week all the way down
 

257
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,150
really got a weak week all the way down
here. I find that move there

258
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
here. I find that move there
 

259
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,829
here. I find that move there
kind of hard to think about happening

260
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
kind of hard to think about happening
 

261
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,790
kind of hard to think about happening
today given the probability that not

262
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
today given the probability that not
 

263
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,269
today given the probability that not
many people are playing the market. But

264
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
many people are playing the market. But
 

265
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,670
many people are playing the market. But
you never know. You just never know. So,

266
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
you never know. You just never know. So,
 

267
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,110
you never know. You just never know. So,
I've got to prepare you for it. All

268
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
I've got to prepare you for it. All
 

269
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,509
I've got to prepare you for it. All
right. That's the we'll deal with that

270
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
right. That's the we'll deal with that
 

271
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,910
right. That's the we'll deal with that
as and when and if we get there. So, the

272
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
as and when and if we get there. So, the
 

273
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,949
as and when and if we get there. So, the
first moves we're looking for are a push

274
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
first moves we're looking for are a push
 

275
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,829
first moves we're looking for are a push
that fails, TP1, TP2, TP3, or a flush

276
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
that fails, TP1, TP2, TP3, or a flush
 

277
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,710
that fails, TP1, TP2, TP3, or a flush
that bids up.

278
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
that bids up.
 

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,230
that bids up.
Right? Those are your first

280
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
Right? Those are your first
 

281
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,069
Right? Those are your first
opportunities in the market. Your second

282
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
opportunities in the market. Your second
 

283
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,590
opportunities in the market. Your second
opportunity in the market will be if you

284
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
opportunity in the market will be if you
 

285
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,509
opportunity in the market will be if you
reclaim this to go from one side of

286
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
reclaim this to go from one side of
 

287
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,350
reclaim this to go from one side of
value to the other. And kind of the same

288
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
value to the other. And kind of the same
 

289
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,550
value to the other. And kind of the same
but on a weekly if you lose this

290
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560

 

291
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,230

you lose this and stay heavy here will

292
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
you lose this and stay heavy here will
 

293
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,190
you lose this and stay heavy here will
be this move right

294
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
be this move right
 

295
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,670
be this move right
one of these options right so that's

296
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
one of these options right so that's
 

297
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,350
one of these options right so that's
that's to have you prepared for what

298
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
that's to have you prepared for what
 

299
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,750
that's to have you prepared for what
we're looking for if we move up here you

300
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
we're looking for if we move up here you
 

301
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,949
we're looking for if we move up here you
can just see we're trading right in the

302
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
can just see we're trading right in the
 

303
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,389
can just see we're trading right in the
middle of the gap it's the last place I

304
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
middle of the gap it's the last place I
 

305
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,269
middle of the gap it's the last place I
want to trade right now all right so um

306
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
want to trade right now all right so um
 

307
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,030
want to trade right now all right so um
we we don't want to trade right in the

308
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
we we don't want to trade right in the
 

309
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,829
we we don't want to trade right in the
middle we want to see this come back

310
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
middle we want to see this come back
 

311
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,389
middle we want to see this come back
here test some key level and fail if

312
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
here test some key level and fail if
 

313
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,750
here test some key level and fail if
we're going to go for downside. All

314
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
we're going to go for downside. All
 

315
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,430
we're going to go for downside. All
right, that's what we're going to look

316
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
right, that's what we're going to look
 

317
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,509
right, that's what we're going to look
for. Okay,

318
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519

 

319
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,269

let's cycle through some of these names

320
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
let's cycle through some of these names
 

321
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,509
let's cycle through some of these names
quickly. A few to get through. ES over

322
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
quickly. A few to get through. ES over
 

323
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,230
quickly. A few to get through. ES over
the 900s, which is that key level I

324
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
the 900s, which is that key level I
 

325
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,990
the 900s, which is that key level I
probably say over under. Let's have a

326
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
probably say over under. Let's have a
 

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,710
probably say over under. Let's have a
little look. Yeah,

328
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
little look. Yeah,
 

329
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,829
little look. Yeah,
so relative strength here. Can ES find a

330
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
so relative strength here. Can ES find a
 

331
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,310
so relative strength here. Can ES find a
bid at 900 and continue that move up?

332
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
bid at 900 and continue that move up?
 

333
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,790
bid at 900 and continue that move up?
Otherwise, you're looking at 880s.

334
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
Otherwise, you're looking at 880s.
 

335
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,389
Otherwise, you're looking at 880s.
All right. So, I'd be looking to see can

336
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
All right. So, I'd be looking to see can
 

337
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,710
All right. So, I'd be looking to see can
it hold 900

338
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
it hold 900
 

339
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,430
it hold 900
whole number or 880s for that bid back

340
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
whole number or 880s for that bid back
 

341
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,269
whole number or 880s for that bid back
up to take out some of this liquidity.

342
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
up to take out some of this liquidity.
 

343
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,670
up to take out some of this liquidity.
That's the big question. It has relative

344
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
That's the big question. It has relative
 

345
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,389
That's the big question. It has relative
strength. It's possible. Um, if we look

346
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
strength. It's possible. Um, if we look
 

347
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,550
strength. It's possible. Um, if we look
at RTY, that was on a screamer

348
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
at RTY, that was on a screamer
 

349
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,230
at RTY, that was on a screamer
Sunday, come back down, big push

350
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
Sunday, come back down, big push
 

351
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,829
Sunday, come back down, big push
yesterday. Same kind of thing. Does it

352
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
yesterday. Same kind of thing. Does it
 

353
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,190
yesterday. Same kind of thing. Does it
find a bid here or do we see that

354
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
find a bid here or do we see that
 

355
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,949
find a bid here or do we see that
rotation in small caps at end of the

356
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
rotation in small caps at end of the
 

357
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,629
rotation in small caps at end of the
year start to come back into the bigger

358
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639

359
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,509
year start to come back into the bigger
names? Time will tell. tell. All right,

360
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
names? Time will tell. tell. All right,
 

361
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,670
names? Time will tell. tell. All right,

85 upside and then there's not really

364
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
85 upside and then there's not really
 

365
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,870
85 upside and then there's not really
much until 700. The the big gamma I had

366
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
much until 700. The the big gamma I had
 

367
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,910
much until 700. The the big gamma I had
a look last night is still up here. Um I

368
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
a look last night is still up here. Um I
 

369
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,509
a look last night is still up here. Um I
can't imagine we get there this side of

370
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
can't imagine we get there this side of
 

371
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,350
can't imagine we get there this side of
the year, but you just never know. All

372
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
the year, but you just never know. All
 

373
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,350
the year, but you just never know. All
right, so I'd be watching 85. That's

374
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
right, so I'd be watching 85. That's
 

375
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,509
right, so I'd be watching 85. That's
been a level for a few weeks as has 82

376
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
been a level for a few weeks as has 82
 

377
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,389
been a level for a few weeks as has 82
and 80s. All right, so 80s pull back

378
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
and 80s. All right, so 80s pull back
 

379
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,629
and 80s. All right, so 80s pull back
into 80s. If they hold a pull back into

380
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
into 80s. If they hold a pull back into
 

381
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,350
into 80s. If they hold a pull back into
80s, we can be bullish. 82s as well.

382
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
80s, we can be bullish. 82s as well.
 

383
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,870
80s, we can be bullish. 82s as well.
There was some exposure there, but not

384
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
There was some exposure there, but not
 

385
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,949
There was some exposure there, but not
very much. 85s is your top level. So

386
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
very much. 85s is your top level. So
 

387
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,110
very much. 85s is your top level. So
that's kind of potential rotation here

388
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
that's kind of potential rotation here
 

389
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,590
that's kind of potential rotation here
on an hourly while they build it out.

390
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
on an hourly while they build it out.
 

391
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,509
on an hourly while they build it out.
Cues, same kind of thing. This needs to

392
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
Cues, same kind of thing. This needs to
 

393
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,910
Cues, same kind of thing. This needs to
be blue.

394
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
be blue.
 

395
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,470
be blue.
And we can move this pivot up into

396
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
And we can move this pivot up into
 

397
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,790
And we can move this pivot up into
around here. All right. Watching 615s on

398
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
around here. All right. Watching 615s on
 

399
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,670
around here. All right. Watching 615s on
Q's if they flush down there and hold.

400
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
Q's if they flush down there and hold.
 

401
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,389
Q's if they flush down there and hold.
Um, same as like that uh move we were

402
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
Um, same as like that uh move we were
 

403
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,629
Um, same as like that uh move we were
looking for on NQ. And if they lose

404
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
looking for on NQ. And if they lose
 

405
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,990
looking for on NQ. And if they lose
that, then you can see it's back into

406
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
that, then you can see it's back into
 

407
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,590
that, then you can see it's back into
range. Some liquidity here we can aim

408
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
range. Some liquidity here we can aim
 

409
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,269
range. Some liquidity here we can aim
for. It all depends. Remember we got a

410
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
for. It all depends. Remember we got a
 

411
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,230
for. It all depends. Remember we got a
balance two weeks. This is two weeks

412
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
balance two weeks. This is two weeks
 

413
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,949
balance two weeks. This is two weeks
balance range ahead. Going to be tough

414
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
balance range ahead. Going to be tough
 

415
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,629
balance range ahead. Going to be tough
to get acceptance back into there, but

416
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
to get acceptance back into there, but
 

417
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,430
to get acceptance back into there, but
we will see. VIX continues or had

418
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
we will see. VIX continues or had
 

419
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,550
we will see. VIX continues or had
continued to drift lower.

420
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
continued to drift lower.
 

421
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,150
continued to drift lower.
Right, low 14s.

422
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
Right, low 14s.
 

423
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,829
Right, low 14s.
This starts to get into the area where

424
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
This starts to get into the area where
 

425
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,069
This starts to get into the area where
market just barely moves when we're down

426
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
market just barely moves when we're down
 

427
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,069
market just barely moves when we're down
here. You know, no volatility. This is

428
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
here. You know, no volatility. This is
 

429
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,990
here. You know, no volatility. This is
fear, greed, and volatility. This is how

430
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
fear, greed, and volatility. This is how
 

431
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,629
fear, greed, and volatility. This is how
I think about the VIX. So, uh, yeah, all

432
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
I think about the VIX. So, uh, yeah, all
 

433
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,350
I think about the VIX. So, uh, yeah, all
the time we're down into here, we're not

434
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
the time we're down into here, we're not
 

435
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,629
the time we're down into here, we're not
going to move too aggressively, but you

436
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
going to move too aggressively, but you
 

437
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,470
going to move too aggressively, but you
can see it's caught little bit of a bid

438
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
can see it's caught little bit of a bid
 

439
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,710
can see it's caught little bit of a bid
at 14. Um, we're going to have to watch

440
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
at 14. Um, we're going to have to watch
 

441
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,269
at 14. Um, we're going to have to watch
how it acts at 1490s, 15s. Does it

442
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
how it acts at 1490s, 15s. Does it
 

443
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,870
how it acts at 1490s, 15s. Does it
reclaim? If it reclaims, maybe we get a

444
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
reclaim? If it reclaims, maybe we get a
 

445
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,470
reclaim? If it reclaims, maybe we get a
bit of weakness in the market this

446
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
bit of weakness in the market this
 

447
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,350
bit of weakness in the market this
morning. Bitcoin, all right, reflushed a

448
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
morning. Bitcoin, all right, reflushed a
 

449
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,949
morning. Bitcoin, all right, reflushed a
little bit last night or the last few

450
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
little bit last night or the last few
 

451
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,030
little bit last night or the last few
sessions. You can see from Monday, bit

452
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
sessions. You can see from Monday, bit
 

453
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,949
sessions. You can see from Monday, bit
more of a selloff back into this range.

454
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
more of a selloff back into this range.
 

455
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,470
more of a selloff back into this range.
Those trading Bitcoin, there's your

range. Look below. Look above. It needs
 

459
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,750

to hold this and it's still got to

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
to hold this and it's still got to
 

461
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,590
to hold this and it's still got to
reclaim this area up here otherwise it's

557
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,069
checks or at least 50% or 61% to look
right. So look above here couldn't

558
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
right. So look above here couldn't
 

559
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,069
right. So look above here couldn't
regain it. Tried a few times yesterday

560
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
regain it. Tried a few times yesterday
 

561
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,030
regain it. Tried a few times yesterday
starting to lose the bid. So we could

562
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
starting to lose the bid. So we could
 

563
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,069
starting to lose the bid. So we could
think about this

564
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
think about this
 

565
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,269
think about this

if it doesn't catch a bid there,

if it doesn't catch a bid there,
 

569
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,949

583
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,829
that 500. It's such a magnet. You'd
expect it to get there, but uh we will

904
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
how we act here. If they find a bid
 

905
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,830
how we act here. If they find a bid
around here, it might be that we uh can

906
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
around here, it might be that we uh can
 

907
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,909
around here, it might be that we uh can
drive back up and take out some of those

908
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
drive back up and take out some of those

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,310
[clears throat]
Let's see.

938
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320

 

939
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,149

Yeah, this is probably like the worst

940
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,159
Yeah, this is probably like the worst
 

941
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,630
Yeah, this is probably like the worst
setup we could have um asked for if I'm

942
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
setup we could have um asked for if I'm
 

943
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,789
setup we could have um asked for if I'm
if I'm perfectly honest with you. The

944
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
if I'm perfectly honest with you. The
 

945
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,350
if I'm perfectly honest with you. The
last thing we wanted to do was drive

946
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,360
last thing we wanted to do was drive
 

947
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,110
last thing we wanted to do was drive
through all the levels in the opening

948
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
through all the levels in the opening
 

949
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,350
through all the levels in the opening
one minute and then in minute 3, four,

950
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
one minute and then in minute 3, four,
 

951
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,149
one minute and then in minute 3, four,
five, and six be right back stuck where

952
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
five, and six be right back stuck where
 

953
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,230
five, and six be right back stuck where
we were yesterday. That's that's not

954
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
we were yesterday. That's that's not
 

955
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,350
we were yesterday. That's that's not
that was not my uh if you ask me what my

956
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
that was not my uh if you ask me what my
 

957
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,830
that was not my uh if you ask me what my
A+ move was today, this was not would

958
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
A+ move was today, this was not would
 

959
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,070
A+ move was today, this was not would
not have been it. All right, but let's

960
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
not have been it. All right, but let's
 

961
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,510
not have been it. All right, but let's
see. It looks pretty bullish now. We're

962
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
see. It looks pretty bullish now. We're
 

963
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,870
see. It looks pretty bullish now. We're
starting to grab bids here. So, let's

964
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
starting to grab bids here. So, let's
 

965
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,710
starting to grab bids here. So, let's
see if they can bid above value and

966
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
see if they can bid above value and
 

967
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,310
see if they can bid above value and
start expanding maybe up to previous

968
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
start expanding maybe up to previous
 

969
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,630
start expanding maybe up to previous
days high if we got very lucky. That's

970
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
days high if we got very lucky. That's
 

971
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,070
days high if we got very lucky. That's
what they're attempting to do at the

972
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
what they're attempting to do at the
 

973
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,269
what they're attempting to do at the
moment.

974
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279

 

975
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,710

Oh god. If it's going to be like

976
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
Oh god. If it's going to be like
 

977
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,149
Oh god. If it's going to be like
yesterday up here, there's not going to

978
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
yesterday up here, there's not going to
 

979
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,909
yesterday up here, there's not going to
be a lot we can do with it.

980
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919

 

981
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,390

What's VWAP? Um, I think you might need

982
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
What's VWAP? Um, I think you might need
 

983
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,470
What's VWAP? Um, I think you might need
to uh do a little bit of research before

984
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
to uh do a little bit of research before
 

985
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,310
to uh do a little bit of research before
you trade if you don't know what VWAP

986
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
you trade if you don't know what VWAP
 

987
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,750
you trade if you don't know what VWAP
is. It's volume weighted average price.

988
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
is. It's volume weighted average price.
 

989
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,630
is. It's volume weighted average price.
Be slightly concerned.

990
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
Be slightly concerned.
 

991
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,990
Be slightly concerned.
You don't know what that is if I'm

992
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
You don't know what that is if I'm
 

993
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,390
You don't know what that is if I'm
honest.

994
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
honest.
 

995
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,230
honest.
Okay.

996
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240

 

997
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,510

ES did tag previous day high

998
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
ES did tag previous day high
 

999
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,029
ES did tag previous day high
and GloEx already twice.

1000
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:17,039
and GloEx already twice.
 

1001

1007
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,430

Current value area high is right here.

1008
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
Current value area high is right here.
 

1009
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,029
Current value area high is right here.
Don't want to give this much room, but I

1010
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
Don't want to give this much room, but I
 

1011
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,269
Don't want to give this much room, but I
am looking for a continuation squeeze.

1017
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,510
very very light size. Here we go.
Through value. Let's see if we can get

1018
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
Through value. Let's see if we can get
 

1019
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,510
Through value. Let's see if we can get
through to the 7 740s and above.

1020
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
through to the 7 740s and above.
 

1021
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,390
through to the 7 740s and above.
We get above here. If we c if we can get

1022
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,400
We get above here. If we c if we can get
 

1023
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,230
We get above here. If we c if we can get
above here, I'm going to peel some out

1024
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
above here, I'm going to peel some out
 

1025
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,590
above here, I'm going to peel some out
straight away. as soon as we get into

1026
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
straight away. as soon as we get into
 

1027
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,390
straight away. as soon as we get into
here. I want to see us hold these levels

1028
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
here. I want to see us hold these levels
 

1029
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,070
here. I want to see us hold these levels
and get into here. What I don't want is

1030
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
and get into here. What I don't want is
 

1031
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,029
and get into here. What I don't want is
us to get stuck. If we keep failing

1032
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039
us to get stuck. If we keep failing
 

1033
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,029
us to get stuck. If we keep failing
above this, the danger is this rotation.

1034
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:01,039
above this, the danger is this rotation.
 

1035
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,950
above this, the danger is this rotation.
I do not want to play that rotation. I'm

1036
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
I do not want to play that rotation. I'm
 

1037
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,269
I do not want to play that rotation. I'm
trying to play for this at the moment.

1038
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
trying to play for this at the moment.
 

1039
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,710
trying to play for this at the moment.
Trying to position for that. I will cut

1040
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
Trying to position for that. I will cut
 

1041
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,950
Trying to position for that. I will cut
a VWAP if we can't

1042
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960

 

1043
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,789

just get caught again above current

1044
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
just get caught again above current
 

1045
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,430
just get caught again above current
day's value, which is currently 26.

1046
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,440
day's value, which is currently 26.
 

1047
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,510
day's value, which is currently 26.
Let's get some volume on for you guys.

1048
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,520

 

1049
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,230

No, that's not what I want.

1050
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,240
No, that's not what I want.
 

1051
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,110
No, that's not what I want.
No, no, no. Come here.

1052
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
No, no, no. Come here.
 

1053
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,630
No, no, no. Come here.
There we go.

1054
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640

 

1055
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,029

Okay,

1056
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
Okay,
 

1057
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,190
Okay,
they're trying to bid 10. It looks

1058
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,200
they're trying to bid 10. It looks
 

1059
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,470
they're trying to bid 10. It looks
sloppy and messy right now.

1060
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480

 

1061
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,549

Yeah, 740 is GloEx highs. We haven't

1062
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
Yeah, 740 is GloEx highs. We haven't
 

1063
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,310
Yeah, 740 is GloEx highs. We haven't
taken it yet. That's what I was trying

1064
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
taken it yet. That's what I was trying
 

1065
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,630
taken it yet. That's what I was trying
to play up into.

1066
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
to play up into.
 

1067
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,750
to play up into.
If we get through that,

1068
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
If we get through that,
 

1069
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,510
If we get through that,
I don't want this to come back under VPO

1070
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
I don't want this to come back under VPO
 

1071
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,510
I don't want this to come back under VPO
here at 705s.

1072
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
here at 705s.
 

1073
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,110
here at 705s.
So, we've got some buyers trapped under

1074
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
So, we've got some buyers trapped under
 

1075
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,950
So, we've got some buyers trapped under
705. We need to use their pain to move

1076
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960
705. We need to use their pain to move
 

1077
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,789
705. We need to use their pain to move
higher. So, I'm playing their pain point

1078
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
higher. So, I'm playing their pain point
 

1079
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,470
higher. So, I'm playing their pain point
at the moment. If we lose that pain

1080
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
at the moment. If we lose that pain
 

1081
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:08,310
at the moment. If we lose that pain
point, then I'll be flat

1082
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320

 

1083
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,310

because if we lose 705s right here, all

1084
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
because if we lose 705s right here, all
 

1085
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,149
because if we lose 705s right here, all
right, there are sellers underneath who

1086
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
right, there are sellers underneath who
 

1087
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,630
right, there are sellers underneath who
are stuck. I will cut out because I do

1088
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
are stuck. I will cut out because I do
 

1089
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,549
are stuck. I will cut out because I do
not want to come back into this. I'll

1090
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
not want to come back into this. I'll
 

1091
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,230
not want to come back into this. I'll
just cut break even if we get back into

1092
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
just cut break even if we get back into
 

1093
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,510
just cut break even if we get back into
this, which I'm getting very close to

1094
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,520
this, which I'm getting very close to
 

1095
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,990
this, which I'm getting very close to
doing right now. It's be we're looking

1096
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,000
doing right now. It's be we're looking
 

1097
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,830
doing right now. It's be we're looking
for this. If they collapse this, then

1098
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:25,840
for this. If they collapse this, then
 

1099
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,070
for this. If they collapse this, then
this is possible. I don't want to trade

1100
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
this is possible. I don't want to trade
 

1101
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,750
this is possible. I don't want to trade
this part. I'll just leave it alone and

1102
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
this part. I'll just leave it alone and
 

1103
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,669
this part. I'll just leave it alone and
see if we find a bid here again or if we

1104
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679
see if we find a bid here again or if we
 

1105
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,190
see if we find a bid here again or if we
collapse the whole thing.

1106
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
collapse the whole thing.
 

1107

Okay, stopped out. So, a whole 17 bucks

Going to leave this alone now because I

1124
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,480
Going to leave this alone now because I
 

1125
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,789
Going to leave this alone now because I
don't want to trade really inside of

don't want to trade really inside of
 

1127
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,789
don't want to trade really inside of
what we created yesterday. This is my no

1128
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
what we created yesterday. This is my no
 

1129
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,470
what we created yesterday. This is my no
trade zone at the moment. I want to see

1130
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
trade zone at the moment. I want to see
 

1131
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,710
trade zone at the moment. I want to see
if we can do this or if we're going to

1132
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
if we can do this or if we're going to
 

1133
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,590
if we can do this or if we're going to
collapse this. Even that's going to be

1134
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
collapse this. Even that's going to be
 

1135
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,710
collapse this. Even that's going to be
ugly if we're going to do that. Unless

1136
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
ugly if we're going to do that. Unless
 

1137
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,310
ugly if we're going to do that. Unless
we trap a lot of volume up here.

1138
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
we trap a lot of volume up here.
 

1139

What do I think about the opening range

What do I think about the opening range
 

1143
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,149
What do I think about the opening range
breakout strategy? I think it's a

1144
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,159
breakout strategy? I think it's a
 

1145
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,630
breakout strategy? I think it's a
legitimate strategy. It's about all I

1146
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:28,640
legitimate strategy. It's about all I
 

1147
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,470
legitimate strategy. It's about all I
can say on it.

1148
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
can say on it.
 

1149
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,149
can say on it.
Sometimes it will work, sometimes it

Sometimes it will work, sometimes it
won't work like most strategies.

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,149
so through back down into previous day

point of control. Now we might rotate
 

1211
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,510

they're going to try and get back up to

1248
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
they're going to try and get back up to
 

1249
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,950
they're going to try and get back up to
24s will be their job. Here's previous

1250
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
24s will be their job. Here's previous
 

1251
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,950
24s will be their job. Here's previous
day value high. I'm still willing to

1252
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:06,960
day value high. I'm still willing to
 

1253
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,710
day value high. I'm still willing to
play upside if we can find acceptance

1254
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
play upside if we can find acceptance
 

1255
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,750
play upside if we can find acceptance
above a key level. I don't want to play

1256
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
above a key level. I don't want to play
 

1257
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,509
above a key level. I don't want to play
inside of yesterday's value. Can we get

1258
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
inside of yesterday's value. Can we get
 

1259
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,190
inside of yesterday's value. Can we get
above previous day's value area high and

1260
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
above previous day's value area high and
 

1261
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,870
above previous day's value area high and
start squeezing? Come on, catch up,

1262
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
start squeezing? Come on, catch up,
 

1263
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,430
start squeezing? Come on, catch up,
please. So, here's the test of those

1264
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:19,440
please. So, here's the test of those
 

1265
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,310
please. So, here's the test of those
20s. 24s I think I said was the level.

1266
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
20s. 24s I think I said was the level.
 

1267
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,909
20s. 24s I think I said was the level.
There we go. Can we start squeezing now?

1268
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:23,919
There we go. Can we start squeezing now?
 

1269
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,509
There we go. Can we start squeezing now?
ES looking good.

1270
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:29,519

 

1271
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,029

Can't get through value high on the

1272
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:31,039
Can't get through value high on the
 

1273
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,549
Can't get through value high on the
current session. Want to see expansion

1274
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559
current session. Want to see expansion
 

1275
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,630
current session. Want to see expansion
there for me to get in. Looking for us

1276
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
there for me to get in. Looking for us
 

1277
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,590
there for me to get in. Looking for us
to base above here for that move. Here

1278
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:37,600
to base above here for that move. Here
 

1279
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,630
to base above here for that move. Here
we go. So, here's 24's coming up. We

1280
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
we go. So, here's 24's coming up. We
 

1281
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,029
we go. So, here's 24's coming up. We
need to get through

1282
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
need to get through
 

1283
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,750
need to get through
20 in that candle that there 37. All

1284
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
20 in that candle that there 37. All
 

1285
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,350
20 in that candle that there 37. All
right. All the buyers got caught from

1286
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
right. All the buyers got caught from
 

1287
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,909
right. All the buyers got caught from
24s to 34s and the same from the candle

1288
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:49,919
24s to 34s and the same from the candle
 

1289
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,870
24s to 34s and the same from the candle
at 932. So, I'm watching those levels.

1290
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:52,880
at 932. So, I'm watching those levels.
 

1291
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,070
at 932. So, I'm watching those levels.
That's why I'm waiting to see if we can

1292
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
That's why I'm waiting to see if we can
 

1293
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,909
That's why I'm waiting to see if we can
find acceptance above there. We're

1294
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
find acceptance above there. We're
 

1295
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,509
find acceptance above there. We're
rotating into it. I need to see if we

1296
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:57,519
rotating into it. I need to see if we
 

1297
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,230
rotating into it. I need to see if we
can find acceptance above it.

1298
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,240

 

1299
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,310

Uh, very possible, Jour. Yeah, I mean,

Uh, very possible, Jour. Yeah, I mean,
 

1301
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,909
Uh, very possible, Jour. Yeah, I mean,
we we do expect sideways no volume

1302
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
we we do expect sideways no volume
 

1303
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,909
we we do expect sideways no volume
today.

1304
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:09,919
today.
 

1305
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,070
today.
That that is our expectation is for

1306
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
That that is our expectation is for
 

1307
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,990
That that is our expectation is for
that.

1308
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
that.
 

1309
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:30,230
that.
They're

1310
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240

I don't know, Carla. Couldn't tell you
 

1319
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,389
I don't know, Carla. Couldn't tell you
why. Maybe you're measuring it

1320
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:42,399
why. Maybe you're measuring it
 

1321
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,070
why. Maybe you're measuring it
differently. Good morning, Bella. How's

definitely right. We're just stuck. We
 

1335
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:07,909
definitely right. We're just stuck. We
are stuck.

1336
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919

 

1337
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,750

It's trying. It keeps trying up here and

1338
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:09,760
It's trying. It keeps trying up here and
 

1339
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,270
It's trying. It keeps trying up here and
failing.

1340
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:11,280
failing.
 

1341
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,030
failing.
Every time buyers step in here, they're

1342
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
Every time buyers step in here, they're
 

1343
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,829
Every time buyers step in here, they're
getting hit with a passive seller, but

1344
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:15,839
getting hit with a passive seller, but
 

1345
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,990
getting hit with a passive seller, but
it it's trying. It is definitely trying

1346
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
it it's trying. It is definitely trying
 

1347
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,510
it it's trying. It is definitely trying
to get going here. It wants to get

1348
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
to get going here. It wants to get
 

1349
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,950
to get going here. It wants to get
through these value area highs from

1350
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:20,960
through these value area highs from
 

1351
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,389
through these value area highs from
previous day and current day. It's just

1352
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:22,399
previous day and current day. It's just
 

1353
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,349
previous day and current day. It's just
struggling a bit.

1354
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:25,359
struggling a bit.
 

1355
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,589
struggling a bit.
720 is the level. You can see every time

1356
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:27,599
720 is the level. You can see every time
 

1357
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,750
720 is the level. You can see every time
it's up there, there's uh some buyers

1358
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
it's up there, there's uh some buyers
 

1359
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,030
it's up there, there's uh some buyers
keep getting offside. If they get

1360
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
keep getting offside. If they get
 

1361
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,950
keep getting offside. If they get
comfortably through that, we'll squeeze.

1362
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:32,960
comfortably through that, we'll squeeze.
 

1363
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,470
comfortably through that, we'll squeeze.
Here we go. Can it get through it?

1364
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:36,480
Here we go. Can it get through it?
 

1365
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,230
Here we go. Can it get through it?
Just added more offside delta there.

1366
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:38,240
Just added more offside delta there.
 

1367
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,109
Just added more offside delta there.
There's sellers at 25s and 30s. We have

1368
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:41,119
There's sellers at 25s and 30s. We have
 

1369
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,869
There's sellers at 25s and 30s. We have
the chance to go here. I really think we

1370
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879
the chance to go here. I really think we
 

1371
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,470
the chance to go here. I really think we
have the chance to go here on a squeeze.

1372
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
have the chance to go here on a squeeze.
 

1373
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,389
have the chance to go here on a squeeze.
So, can we find acceptance to squeeze

1374
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:46,399
So, can we find acceptance to squeeze
 

1375
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,389
So, can we find acceptance to squeeze
now?

1376
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
now?
 

1377
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,909
now?
Upside to 40s possible. Come on, market.

1378
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
Upside to 40s possible. Come on, market.
 

1379
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,349
Upside to 40s possible. Come on, market.
Someone just put their foot down on the

1380
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
Someone just put their foot down on the
 

1381
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,909
Someone just put their foot down on the
gas. There you go. All right. Here we

1382
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
gas. There you go. All right. Here we
 

1383

1385
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,430
go, folks. Here we go. So, we're looking
for that upside target. ES starting to

1386
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
for that upside target. ES starting to
 

1387
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,349
for that upside target. ES starting to
go now as well. Can we get acceptance?

1388
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
go now as well. Can we get acceptance?
 

1389
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,750
go now as well. Can we get acceptance?
Here we go, folks. Here we go. Looking

1390

Here we go, folks. Here we go. Looking
 

1391
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,670
Here we go, folks. Here we go. Looking
for that move into 40s. take some

1392
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:05,680
for that move into 40s. take some
 

1393
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,670
for that move into 40s. take some
partials on the way because we're not uh

1394
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:07,680
partials on the way because we're not uh
 

1395
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,510
partials on the way because we're not uh
a big volume day. But once we get to 40s

1396
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
a big volume day. But once we get to 40s
 

1397
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,109
a big volume day. But once we get to 40s
and above, we might start squeezing.

1398
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
and above, we might start squeezing.
 

1399
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,790
and above, we might start squeezing.
Here we go. We've got some sellside

1400
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800

previous day value area high once we
held previous day point of control and

1576
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:55,520
held previous day point of control and
 

1577

this level. If we lose this level, I'm
uninterested in this market, but we're

uninterested in this market, but we're

upside next year. So 50% upside so back
into that same level. I think they'll

1706
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:47,920
into that same level. I think they'll
 

1707
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,230
into that same level. I think they'll
way exceed that. But uh I'll be taking

1708
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
way exceed that. But uh I'll be taking
 

1709
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,910
way exceed that. But uh I'll be taking
partials off into that gap fill and then

1710
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:51,920
partials off into that gap fill and then
 

1711
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,430
partials off into that gap fill and then
just holding. And if we bid for the rest

1712
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
just holding. And if we bid for the rest
 

1713
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,790
just holding. And if we bid for the rest
of the year then it would be fantastic.

1714
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:54,800
of the year then it would be fantastic.
 

1715
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,870
of the year then it would be fantastic.
And if we lose it I'll cut it and I'd

1716
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880
And if we lose it I'll cut it and I'd
 

1717
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,030
And if we lose it I'll cut it and I'd
reattack it down here. Yeah. So nice

1718
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,040
reattack it down here. Yeah. So nice
 

1719
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,109
reattack it down here. Yeah. So nice

Is what it is. All right, I'm out of

this uh edge of this gray box. They're
 

1739
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,150
this uh edge of this gray box. They're
still holding though,

1740
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
still holding though,
 

1741
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,470
still holding though,
but now flat. So, we're locked in 490

1742
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:24,480
but now flat. So, we're locked in 490
 

1743
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:49,829
but now flat. So, we're locked in 490
bucks. That is it for today so far.

1744
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:49,839

open retra test. What you want a 50%

1748
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,160

1749

pullback off your open candle or I mean

1750
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
pullback off your open candle or I mean
 

1751
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,109
pullback off your open candle or I mean
I think it's probably given that that's

1752
00:42:59,109 --> 00:42:59,119
I think it's probably given that that's
 

1753
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,190
I think it's probably given that that's
probably what that dip is. There's your

1754
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
probably what that dip is. There's your
 

1755
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,190
probably what that dip is. There's your
open.

1756
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
open.
 

1757
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,150
open.
That's that opening candle that.

1758
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,160
That's that opening candle that.
 

1759
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,390
That's that opening candle that.
So this was the 50% retrace into that

1760
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,400
So this was the 50% retrace into that
 

1761
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,870
So this was the 50% retrace into that
open candle.

1762
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:10,880

If you're going for a whole session,

1764
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:12,560
If you're going for a whole session,
 

1765
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,309
If you're going for a whole session,
you're into these same lows. You're

1766
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:14,319
you're into these same lows. You're
 

1767
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,750
you're into these same lows. You're
basically into previous day point of

1768
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
basically into previous day point of
 

1769
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,670
basically into previous day point of
control current value area low. The only

1770
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:17,680
control current value area low. The only
 

1771
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,309
control current value area low. The only
thing I'd say, Peter, is if you come

1772
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:20,319
thing I'd say, Peter, is if you come
 

1773
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,870
thing I'd say, Peter, is if you come
down, if we build lots of liquidity here

1774
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:22,880
down, if we build lots of liquidity here
 

1775
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,270
down, if we build lots of liquidity here
and we come down into this level and we

1776
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
and we come down into this level and we
 

1777
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,790
and we come down into this level and we
don't reclaim, right, and they don't

1778
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:26,800
don't reclaim, right, and they don't
 

1779
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,790
don't reclaim, right, and they don't
bid, then we're going to use that and we

1780
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
bid, then we're going to use that and we
 

1781
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,230
bid, then we're going to use that and we
come right back down into here. This

1782
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
come right back down into here. This
 

1783
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,150
come right back down into here. This
this is where it gets a bit tricky.

1784
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
this is where it gets a bit tricky.
 

1785
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,950
this is where it gets a bit tricky.
Especially

1786
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:34,960
Especially
 

1787
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,630
Especially
on low volume. Remember, it wouldn't

1788
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:36,640
on low volume. Remember, it wouldn't
 

1789
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,309
on low volume. Remember, it wouldn't
take a lot for one player to just be

1790
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
take a lot for one player to just be
 

1791
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,150
take a lot for one player to just be
like, I'm done with this market for this

1792
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
like, I'm done with this market for this
 

1793
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,670
like, I'm done with this market for this
year and we we can close very quickly.

1794
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
year and we we can close very quickly.
 

1795
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,349
year and we we can close very quickly.
Right into point control for the current

00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:45,359
Right into point control for the current
 

1797
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,309
Right into point control for the current
session and VWAP range is very small

1798
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:48,319
session and VWAP range is very small
 

1799
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,270
session and VWAP range is very small
today, folks. All right. Might look big.

1800
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:51,280
today, folks. All right. Might look big.
 

1801
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,109
today, folks. All right. Might look big.
You might be like, we've got 113 point

1802
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:53,119
You might be like, we've got 113 point
 

1803
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,390
You might be like, we've got 113 point
range. We have, but uh most the range is

1804
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
range. We have, but uh most the range is
 

1805
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,710
range. We have, but uh most the range is
actually just in here. Uh you're playing

1806
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
actually just in here. Uh you're playing
 

1807
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,109
actually just in here. Uh you're playing
with 40 points, right? because looks

1808
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
with 40 points, right? because looks
 

1809
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,030
with 40 points, right? because looks
above have failed. Look below this has

1810
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
above have failed. Look below this has
 

1811
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,550
above have failed. Look below this has
failed and we started the day down here

1812
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:04,560
failed and we started the day down here
 

1813
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,150
failed and we started the day down here
and we've shown no signs of going back

1814
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,160
and we've shown no signs of going back
 

1815
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,069
and we've shown no signs of going back
there. So, we haven't got much to play

1816
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
there. So, we haven't got much to play
 

1817
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,805
there. So, we haven't got much to play
with.

1818
00:44:10,805 --> 00:44:10,815
with.
 

1819
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:21,589
with.
[cough]

1820
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599

 

1821
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,430

I say buyers are still in control of

1822
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
I say buyers are still in control of
 

1823
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,270
I say buyers are still in control of
this session right now, but we're just

1824
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
this session right now, but we're just
 

1825
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,109
this session right now, but we're just
testing previous days value high. So if

1826
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:27,119
testing previous days value high. So if
 

1827
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,470
testing previous days value high. So if
they don't find a bid here, we will

1828
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,480
they don't find a bid here, we will
 

1829
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,069
they don't find a bid here, we will
rotate to previous day point of control

1830
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:30,079
rotate to previous day point of control
 

1831
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,710
rotate to previous day point of control
previous day value very low. So don't

1832
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,720
previous day value very low. So don't
 

1833
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,990
previous day value very low. So don't
really want to play in this, right? So

1834
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
really want to play in this, right? So
 

1835
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,990
really want to play in this, right? So
if they don't find a bid here, they will

1836
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,000
if they don't find a bid here, they will
 

1837
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,670
if they don't find a bid here, they will
rotate to this. And if they lose this,

1838
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
rotate to this. And if they lose this,
 

1839
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,710
rotate to this. And if they lose this,
this if they lose this, this is

1840
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
this if they lose this, this is
 

1841
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,069
this if they lose this, this is
possible. Definitely this is possible,

1842
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:44,079
possible. Definitely this is possible,
 

1843
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,589
possible. Definitely this is possible,
but they might well just bid. This would

1844
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,599
but they might well just bid. This would
 

1845
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,109
but they might well just bid. This would
be like yesterday, right? Yesterday we

1846
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:47,119
be like yesterday, right? Yesterday we
 

1847
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,430
be like yesterday, right? Yesterday we
did this in here. Today we might well do

1848
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:49,440
did this in here. Today we might well do
 

1849
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,510
did this in here. Today we might well do
this in here again. Very, very possible,

1850
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,520
this in here again. Very, very possible,
 

1851
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,230
this in here again. Very, very possible,
folks. Right. They've lost value area

1852
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,240
folks. Right. They've lost value area
 

1853
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,910
folks. Right. They've lost value area
high

1854
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:55,920
high
 

1855
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,750
high
back into here. Now, if they lose this

1856
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,760
back into here. Now, if they lose this
 

1857
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,270
back into here. Now, if they lose this
back into here, then you have to ask, do

1858
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
back into here, then you have to ask, do
 

1859
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,270
back into here, then you have to ask, do
they bid off previous day value or was

1860
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
they bid off previous day value or was
 

1861
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,870
they bid off previous day value or was
this just a test of value and we're

1862
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:02,880
this just a test of value and we're
 

1863
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,790
this just a test of value and we're
going to lose it all? Come back down to

1864
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
going to lose it all? Come back down to
 

1865
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,670
going to lose it all? Come back down to
New York open gap fill. I don't know. I

00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,200
they want to do with it, they can. We'll
 

1871
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:24,390
they want to do with it, they can. We'll
just try and follow as they go.

Hold of the market's attempting to go

1887
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,870
level here, and previous day point
control and the gap fill. Right. So, gap

1888
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:42,880
control and the gap fill. Right. So, gap
 

1889
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,710

fill.

If they can hold it, if they lose it,

If they can hold it, if they lose it,
 

1899
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,190
If they can hold it, if they lose it,
then we're going to look for deeper

1900
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
then we're going to look for deeper
 

1901
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,870
then we're going to look for deeper

Balls definitely came in this morning,

1910
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,680
Balls definitely came in this morning,
 

1911
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:10,710
Balls definitely came in this morning,
but I don't have too much bias.

1912
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:10,720

 

1913
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,630

Thoughts on Nvidia? Um, have a look. You

1914
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
Thoughts on Nvidia? Um, have a look. You
 

1915
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,630
Thoughts on Nvidia? Um, have a look. You
swing? You mean you bought the dip as in

1916
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
swing? You mean you bought the dip as in
 

1917
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,829
swing? You mean you bought the dip as in
you bought a swing dip?

1918
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:21,839

 

1919
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,190

I mean, you can see the levels I'm

1920
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:23,200
I mean, you can see the levels I'm
 

1921
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,270
I mean, you can see the levels I'm
looking at. You're just in a range on

1922
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
looking at. You're just in a range on
 

1923
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,790
looking at. You're just in a range on
Nvidia. I don't think anything more than

1924
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:26,800
Nvidia. I don't think anything more than
 

1925
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,390
Nvidia. I don't think anything more than
that, right? Bit of a blowoff up here.

1926
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:30,400
that, right? Bit of a blowoff up here.
 

1927
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,150
that, right? Bit of a blowoff up here.
Never able to reclaim. Right. So, you

1928
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
Never able to reclaim. Right. So, you
 

1929
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,150
Never able to reclaim. Right. So, you
got buyers trapped up there. If you

1930
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
got buyers trapped up there. If you
 

1931
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,230
got buyers trapped up there. If you
break down under this level, it's night

1932
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,240
break down under this level, it's night
 

1933
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,589
break down under this level, it's night
night. All right. So, I wouldn't be

1934
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:37,599
night. All right. So, I wouldn't be
 

1935
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,030
night. All right. So, I wouldn't be
holding on under here. You've had two

1936
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
holding on under here. You've had two
 

1937
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,790
holding on under here. You've had two
undercuts, two look belows which have

1938
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
undercuts, two look belows which have
 

1939
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,190
undercuts, two look belows which have
reclaimed. I just be very careful if you

1940
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
reclaimed. I just be very careful if you
 

1941
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,550
reclaimed. I just be very careful if you
lose 170 basically. But otherwise,

1942
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
lose 170 basically. But otherwise,
 

1943
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,390
lose 170 basically. But otherwise,
you're just going to trade between 85

1944
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,400
you're just going to trade between 85
 

1945
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,030
you're just going to trade between 85
and 70. If it gets through 85, squeeze

1946
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,040
and 70. If it gets through 85, squeeze
 

1947
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,550
and 70. If it gets through 85, squeeze
potential to 90. If it gets through

1948
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:52,560
potential to 90. If it gets through
 

1949
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,470
potential to 90. If it gets through
that, it's got bigger potential. That

1950
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
that, it's got bigger potential. That
 

1951
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,309
that, it's got bigger potential. That
That's my thoughts.

1952
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:58,319

 

1953
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,150

All right. So, back down to previous day

1954
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:00,160
All right. So, back down to previous day
 

1955
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,150
All right. So, back down to previous day
value area low. So, they lost value high

1956
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,160
value area low. So, they lost value high
 

1957
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,270
value area low. So, they lost value high
like we talked about. They're losing

1958
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,280
like we talked about. They're losing
 

1959
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,470
like we talked about. They're losing
previous day point of control. They're

1960
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:04,480
previous day point of control. They're
 

1961
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,990
previous day point of control. They're
coming back down into previous day value

1962
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:06,000
coming back down into previous day value
 

1963
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,349
coming back down into previous day value
low. Do they find a bid here? If they

1964
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
low. Do they find a bid here? If they
 

1965
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,710
low. Do they find a bid here? If they
can't find a bid here, they come right

1966
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:08,720
can't find a bid here, they come right
 

1967
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,550
can't find a bid here, they come right
back down to the New York open and the

1968
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:10,560
back down to the New York open and the
 

1969
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,069
back down to the New York open and the
old gap fill.

1970
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:16,079

 

1971
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,710

It is uh

1972
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
It is uh
 

1973
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,990
It is uh
not very fun out here.

1974
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000

 

1975
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,430

Classic pump and dump. I wouldn't call

1976
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,440
Classic pump and dump. I wouldn't call
 

1977
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,510
Classic pump and dump. I wouldn't call
this a dump yet. It might look like a

1978
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,520
this a dump yet. It might look like a
 

1979
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,910
this a dump yet. It might look like a
dump, but uh I wouldn't actually call

1980
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:29,920
dump, but uh I wouldn't actually call
 

1981
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,230
dump, but uh I wouldn't actually call
this a dump yet. Right. It's a push,

1982
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240

 

1983
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,230

a look above and fail. And we're just in

1984
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,240
a look above and fail. And we're just in
 

1985
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,150
a look above and fail. And we're just in
yesterday's range. There's no dump here,

1986
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
yesterday's range. There's no dump here,
 

1987
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,670
yesterday's range. There's no dump here,
guys. All right. Just be aware this is

1988
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:41,680
guys. All right. Just be aware this is
 

1989
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,430
guys. All right. Just be aware this is
tiny. This might look big because we're

1990
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
tiny. This might look big because we're
 

1991
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,829
tiny. This might look big because we're
in tiny range. This is [\h__\h] all.

1992
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
in tiny range. This is [\h__\h] all.
 

1993
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,349
in tiny range. This is [\h__\h] all.
Nothing's really happening here. All

1994
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
Nothing's really happening here. All
 

1995
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,430
Nothing's really happening here. All
right, fellas and ladies and gents,

1996
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:49,440
right, fellas and ladies and gents,
 

1997
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,270
right, fellas and ladies and gents,
let's say. All right, you're looking at

1998
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,280
let's say. All right, you're looking at
 

1999
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,390
let's say. All right, you're looking at
like 30 40 points in rotation. It's not

2000
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:54,400
like 30 40 points in rotation. It's not
 

2001
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,950
like 30 40 points in rotation. It's not
a dump, right? The dump will come if we

2002
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
a dump, right? The dump will come if we
 

2003
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,270
a dump, right? The dump will come if we
start losing, you know, some of these.

2004
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,280
start losing, you know, some of these.
 

2005
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,589
start losing, you know, some of these.
This is uh definitely not not a pump and

2006
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
This is uh definitely not not a pump and
 

2007
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,150
This is uh definitely not not a pump and
dump. Not right now. It's a push and a

2008
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
dump. Not right now. It's a push and a
 

2009
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,589
dump. Not right now. It's a push and a
look above and fail. I'll give you that

2010
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:05,599
look above and fail. I'll give you that
 

2011
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,589
look above and fail. I'll give you that
low hanging fruit. Push.

2012

2075
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,230

That's nice. Once we left this gray box,

That's nice. Once we left this gray box,

That's nice. Once we left this gray box,
that's nice. Right. Look above. Left the

00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
partiallying into these. Right. Respect
 

2083

open and close this gap. But expect this

2090
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,520
open and close this gap. But expect this
 

2091
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,670
open and close this gap. But expect this
to rotate. Yesterday we did this. It's

2092
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:05,680
to rotate. Yesterday we did this. It's
 

2093
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,349
to rotate. Yesterday we did this. It's
very possible they do this again. My

2094
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:07,359
very possible they do this again. My
 

2095
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,950
very possible they do this again. My
expectation

2096
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:08,960
expectation
 

2097
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,190
expectation
like defensively I'm thinking, okay,

2098
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
like defensively I'm thinking, okay,
 

2099
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,190
like defensively I'm thinking, okay,
we're likely to rotate there. And if we

2100
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:13,200
we're likely to rotate there. And if we
 

2101
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,190
we're likely to rotate there. And if we
don't and you get further move downside

2102
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,200
don't and you get further move downside
 

2103
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,870
don't and you get further move downside
for you, great. But make sure you're

2104
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:16,880
for you, great. But make sure you're
 

2105
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,790
for you, great. But make sure you're
paying yourself along the way. Looks

2106
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:18,800
paying yourself along the way. Looks
 

2107
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:45,109
paying yourself along the way. Looks
very very thin here.

2108
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:45,119

 

2109
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,349

00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:49,359
came in at 89.1 versus 88.7 previously
 

2111
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,349
came in at 89.1 versus 88.7 previously
and estimated at 91. So it came in

2112
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:51,359
and estimated at 91. So it came in
 

2113
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,870

It's a bit like the CPI print.

So just probably a rotation. We can have

2204
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,040
So just probably a rotation. We can have
 

2205
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,630
So just probably a rotation. We can have
a look at the breadth of the market.

2206
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:00,640
a look at the breadth of the market.
 

2207
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:07,190
a look at the breadth of the market.
Let's have a quick look.

2209
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,069

Where are you?

00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:12,079

 

2211
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,589

I mean, it doesn't look too bad out

2212
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:13,599
I mean, it doesn't look too bad out
 

2213
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,349
I mean, it doesn't look too bad out
there still. This overview. Go away.

There we go. Doesn't look too bad. So

2216
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,280
There we go. Doesn't look too bad. So
 

2217
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,270
There we go. Doesn't look too bad. So
you can see the names getting hit. your

Are we going to see follow through? I'm

2236
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
Are we going to see follow through? I'm
 

2237
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,630
Are we going to see follow through? I'm
just trying to look to see if we see a

2238
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:50,640
just trying to look to see if we see a
 

2239
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,990
just trying to look to see if we see a
rotation. And tests are starting to

2240
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
rotation. And tests are starting to
 

2241
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:07,510
rotation. And tests are starting to
really sell now.

2242
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520

 

2243
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,990

Still weak on the spiders.

2244
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000

 

2245
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,910

Watching this New York open. If they

2246
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
Watching this New York open. If they
 

2247
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,990
Watching this New York open. If they
reclaim this and revisit value area low,

2248
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,000
reclaim this and revisit value area low,
 

2249
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,910
reclaim this and revisit value area low,
I'll consider a reshort up here. I just

2250
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:19,920
I'll consider a reshort up here. I just
 

2251
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,950
I'll consider a reshort up here. I just
want to be careful because we're in

2252
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
want to be careful because we're in
 

2253
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,710
want to be careful because we're in
rotation. This is new week opening gap.

2254
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:22,720
rotation. This is new week opening gap.
 

2255
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,950
rotation. This is new week opening gap.
If they come back up back up here

2256
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:24,960
If they come back up back up here
 

2257
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,790
If they come back up back up here
ideally here, I'll consider that move

2258
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:26,800
ideally here, I'll consider that move
 

2259
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,829
ideally here, I'll consider that move
down.

2260
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839

 

2261
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,829

Just don't if we do this, I don't want

2262
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
Just don't if we do this, I don't want
 

2263
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,710
Just don't if we do this, I don't want
to play it. They've had enough FAFS up

2264
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:34,720
to play it. They've had enough FAFS up
 

2265
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,710
to play it. They've had enough FAFS up
here for two days now. We're going to

2266
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
here for two days now. We're going to
 

2267
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,030
here for two days now. We're going to
continue. I need to see that or in front

2268
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,040
continue. I need to see that or in front
 

2269
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,630
continue. I need to see that or in front
of that also is okay.

2270
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:42,640
of that also is okay.
 

2271
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,390
of that also is okay.
And I'll tell you the big sellers came

2272
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
And I'll tell you the big sellers came
 

2273
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,870
And I'll tell you the big sellers came
in one block came in at 62 and the other

2274
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:46,880
in one block came in at 62 and the other
 

2275
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,670
in one block came in at 62 and the other
guys came in at 77.

2276
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:49,680
guys came in at 77.
 

2277
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,670
guys came in at 77.
One block came in at 62. The other guys

2278
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:51,680
One block came in at 62. The other guys
 

2279
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:58,870
One block came in at 62. The other guys
came in at 77.

2280
00:54:58,870 --> 00:54:58,880

 

2281
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,430

So currently we tapped previous day low.

2282
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,440
So currently we tapped previous day low.
 

2283
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,270
So currently we tapped previous day low.
See if we can close below it. If they

2284
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
See if we can close below it. If they
 

2285
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,589
See if we can close below it. If they
can get aggressive

2286
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:09,599

 

2287
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,109

at New York, let's get rid of these on

2288
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:11,119
at New York, let's get rid of these on
 

2289
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,109
at New York, let's get rid of these on
the screen. New York open acting as

2290
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,119
the screen. New York open acting as
 

2291
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,549
the screen. New York open acting as
resistance right now. Let's see if we

2292
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:14,559
resistance right now. Let's see if we
 

2293
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,390
resistance right now. Let's see if we
can get and close this gap or not. Do

2294
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,400
can get and close this gap or not. Do
 

2295
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,829
can get and close this gap or not. Do
they get acceptance underneath previous

2296
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:17,839
they get acceptance underneath previous
 

2297
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,390
they get acceptance underneath previous
day low? So far, the low of the auction

2298
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
day low? So far, the low of the auction
 

2299
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,270
day low? So far, the low of the auction
is all selling. All right. So, it's all

2300
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:23,280
is all selling. All right. So, it's all
 

2301
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,030
is all selling. All right. So, it's all
sell side at 30. So, there's still some

2302
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,040
sell side at 30. So, there's still some
 

2303
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,470
sell side at 30. So, there's still some
bids down there. I want to see this pop

2304
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:26,480
bids down there. I want to see this pop
 

2305
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,069
bids down there. I want to see this pop
up first before I think about anything

2306
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
up first before I think about anything
 

2307
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,549
up first before I think about anything
else.

2308
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:30,559
else.
 

2309
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,470
else.
Yeah, gap feels possible. That would be

2310
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
Yeah, gap feels possible. That would be
 

2311
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,150
Yeah, gap feels possible. That would be
the edge of the gray box, right? The gap

2312
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,160
the edge of the gray box, right? The gap
 

2313
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,150
the edge of the gray box, right? The gap
fill. That's the edge of the gray box.

2314
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
fill. That's the edge of the gray box.
 

2315
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,430
fill. That's the edge of the gray box.
That's what we were looking at early

2316
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
That's what we were looking at early
 

2317
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,270
That's what we were looking at early
morning. Didn't expect them to do that

2318
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,280
morning. Didn't expect them to do that
 

2319
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,349
morning. Didn't expect them to do that
push quite so aggressively early

2320
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:41,359
push quite so aggressively early
 

2321
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,230
push quite so aggressively early
morning. I will be honest with you. I'm

2322
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
morning. I will be honest with you. I'm
 

2323
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,670
morning. I will be honest with you. I'm
looking to see if they drift this up and

2324
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:45,680
looking to see if they drift this up and
 

2325
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,270
looking to see if they drift this up and
resell it. We're a bit extended right

2326
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,280
resell it. We're a bit extended right
 

2327
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,270
resell it. We're a bit extended right
now. I got a nasty feeling that they're

2328
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
now. I got a nasty feeling that they're
 

2329
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,710
now. I got a nasty feeling that they're
just going to do it in one move like

2330
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:50,720
just going to do it in one move like
 

2331
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,109
just going to do it in one move like
they did earlier.

2332
00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:55,119

 

2333
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,230

Lots of bids down here. 30s, 32s, 25s,

2334
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
Lots of bids down here. 30s, 32s, 25s,
 

2335
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,109
Lots of bids down here. 30s, 32s, 25s,
20s, 15s, 05s. Look at all this

2336
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:01,119
20s, 15s, 05s. Look at all this
 

2337
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,430
20s, 15s, 05s. Look at all this
liquidity below. So, ideally, they pop

2338
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:03,440
liquidity below. So, ideally, they pop
 

2339
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,309
liquidity below. So, ideally, they pop
this up for a resell and they don't

2340
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:06,319
this up for a resell and they don't
 

2341
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,990
this up for a resell and they don't
reclaim value. We do not want to. If

2342
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
reclaim value. We do not want to. If
 

2343
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,829
reclaim value. We do not want to. If
they reclaim value, I'm [\h__\h] not

2344
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839
they reclaim value, I'm [\h__\h] not
 

2345
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,829
they reclaim value, I'm [\h__\h] not
touching it. If they're going to be

2346
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:11,839
touching it. If they're going to be
 

2347
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,670
touching it. If they're going to be
dirty dogs today, I'm not interested.

2348
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:13,680
dirty dogs today, I'm not interested.
 

2349
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,589
dirty dogs today, I'm not interested.
But if they pop up and sell like that,

2350
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:15,599
But if they pop up and sell like that,
 

2351
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,829
But if they pop up and sell like that,
even that last move wasn't too bad, then

2352
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:17,839
even that last move wasn't too bad, then
 

2353
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,390
even that last move wasn't too bad, then
we're interested, right? I am interested

2354
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,400
we're interested, right? I am interested
 

2355
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,230
we're interested, right? I am interested
in these pushes that start to fail,

2356
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
in these pushes that start to fail,
 

2357
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,910
in these pushes that start to fail,
especially if they start closing below

2358
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
especially if they start closing below
 

2359
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:31,349
especially if they start closing below
30s. If they start closing below 30s,

2360
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:31,359

 

2361
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:37,109

some buyers got caught there at 45s.

2362
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:37,119

 

2363
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,430

Bids here at 30s. Think we're going to

2364
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
Bids here at 30s. Think we're going to
 

2365
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,470
Bids here at 30s. Think we're going to
go now lower. Here's the 30s. They keep

2366
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:42,480
go now lower. Here's the 30s. They keep
 

2367
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,069
go now lower. Here's the 30s. They keep
bidding. I think we probably swipe all

2368
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
bidding. I think we probably swipe all
 

2369
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,750
bidding. I think we probably swipe all
these guys out for downside pressure.

2370
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
these guys out for downside pressure.
 

2371
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,150
these guys out for downside pressure.
Now here come 30s. Come and put that

2372
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,160
Now here come 30s. Come and put that
 

2373
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,270
Now here come 30s. Come and put that
catch up so I can see.

2374
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
catch up so I can see.
 

2375
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,349
catch up so I can see.
So they're bidding 30s, 25s, 20s. Ideal

2376
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
So they're bidding 30s, 25s, 20s. Ideal
 

2377
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:00,470
So they're bidding 30s, 25s, 20s. Ideal
scenario for me will be something

2378
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,480

 

2379
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,390

maybe to get over New York open a little

2380
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,400
maybe to get over New York open a little
 

2381
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,870
maybe to get over New York open a little
pop somewhere into this node or here

2382
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:04,880
pop somewhere into this node or here
 

2383
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,030
pop somewhere into this node or here
which is resold. Otherwise, they're

2384
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,040
which is resold. Otherwise, they're
 

2385
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,470
which is resold. Otherwise, they're
going to force me to play low of day

2386
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
going to force me to play low of day
 

2387
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,870
going to force me to play low of day
which is not ideal. Don't really want to

2388
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:10,880
which is not ideal. Don't really want to
 

2389
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,630
which is not ideal. Don't really want to
do that. But watching this here and this

2390
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
do that. But watching this here and this
 

2391
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,670
do that. But watching this here and this
here, right? So, do we reject this? Like

2392
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:17,680
here, right? So, do we reject this? Like
 

2393
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,670
here, right? So, do we reject this? Like
a look above here or do we come all the

2394
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
a look above here or do we come all the
 

2395
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,109
a look above here or do we come all the
way up here and reject this? Which will

2396
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:21,119
way up here and reject this? Which will
 

2397
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,829
way up here and reject this? Which will
be actually be better price-wise. Uh I

2398
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:23,839
be actually be better price-wise. Uh I
 

2399
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,109
be actually be better price-wise. Uh I
will not play if we get back inside

2400
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:25,119
will not play if we get back inside
 

2401
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,510
will not play if we get back inside
that. I'm not interested.

2402
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520
that. I'm not interested.
 

2403
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,270
that. I'm not interested.
Not interested. Remember, we're

2404
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:29,280
Not interested. Remember, we're
 

2405
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,390
Not interested. Remember, we're
protecting the gap at the moment.

2406
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
protecting the gap at the moment.
 

2407
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,549
protecting the gap at the moment.
So, here over this little node. So

2408
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
So, here over this little node. So
 

2409
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,309
So, here over this little node. So
either they look above this and fail now

2410
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:36,319
either they look above this and fail now
 

2411
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,589
either they look above this and fail now
or they're going to squeeze all the way

2412
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
or they're going to squeeze all the way
 

2413
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,750
or they're going to squeeze all the way
back up to previous day value and

2414
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:39,760
back up to previous day value and
 

2415
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,030
back up to previous day value and
current day value area low.

2416
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:45,040

 

2417
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,789

This is where buying keeps coming in at

2418
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:46,799
This is where buying keeps coming in at
 

2419
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,910
This is where buying keeps coming in at
56s. They keep getting stuck here again.

2420
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:49,920
56s. They keep getting stuck here again.
 

2421
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,710
56s. They keep getting stuck here again.
They got stuck there at 56s. So this is

2422
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
They got stuck there at 56s. So this is
 

2423
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,349
They got stuck there at 56s. So this is
that like look above that node and fail

2424
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359
that like look above that node and fail
 

2425
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:00,470
that like look above that node and fail
kind of move has potential here.

2426
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:00,480
kind of move has potential here.
 

2427
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,230
kind of move has potential here.
Lots of buyers got stuck in that last

2428
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:02,240
Lots of buyers got stuck in that last
 

2429
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,309
Lots of buyers got stuck in that last
wick. I'll tell you that now.

2430
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:04,319
wick. I'll tell you that now.
 

2431
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,630
wick. I'll tell you that now.
So, can we close back downside the

2432
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:06,640
So, can we close back downside the
 

2433
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,069
So, can we close back downside the
bottom side of this node and start

2434
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:08,079
bottom side of this node and start
 

2435
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,990
bottom side of this node and start
losing 33s? Now, if they rebid over 56s,

2436
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,000
losing 33s? Now, if they rebid over 56s,
 

2437
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,470
losing 33s? Now, if they rebid over 56s,
we probably go value area low. If they

2438
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,480
we probably go value area low. If they
 

2439
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,349
we probably go value area low. If they
stay heavy around 56s, we should be able

2440
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:17,359
stay heavy around 56s, we should be able
 

2441
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,349
stay heavy around 56s, we should be able
to look for a wash into new low of day.

2442
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
to look for a wash into new low of day.
 

2443
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,109
to look for a wash into new low of day.
Here we go. So, they're protecting it so

2444
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
Here we go. So, they're protecting it so
 

2445
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,950
Here we go. So, they're protecting it so
far.

2446
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
far.
 

2447
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,190
far.
They need to see follow through though.

2448
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
They need to see follow through though.
 

2449
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,030
They need to see follow through though.
Yeah, not much follow through here.

2450
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,040
Yeah, not much follow through here.
 

2451
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,030
Yeah, not much follow through here.
Hello, wakey wakey sellers. Come back in

00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:51,680

 

2467
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,190

There's a seller under New York Open.

2468
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:53,200
There's a seller under New York Open.
 

2469
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,150
There's a seller under New York Open.
Keeps getting stuck. Right at 43s. So,

Christ. Figure out what that was. Okay,
so still watching 56 is where the buyers

2504
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:41,200
so still watching 56 is where the buyers
 

2505
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,990
so still watching 56 is where the buyers
are stuck.

2506
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,000

 

2507
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,990

Still no position for me. Cleaning out
 

2509
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,309
Still no position for me. Cleaning out
56s now. So either they retract buyers

2510
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:50,319
56s now. So either they retract buyers
 

2511
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:51,910
56s now. So either they retract buyers
now or we come right the way up to value

2512
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:51,920
now or we come right the way up to value
 

2513
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,950
now or we come right the way up to value
area low again. Still no position.

2514
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
area low again. Still no position.

Waiting to see there if they were going

2516
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:56,480
Waiting to see there if they were going
 

2517
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:06,470
Waiting to see there if they were going
to trap with follow through.

2518
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:06,480

 

2519
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,230

And if we reclaim value, I will not

2520
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:08,240
And if we reclaim value, I will not
 

2521
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,829
And if we reclaim value, I will not
short this. All right. We reclaim

2522
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
short this. All right. We reclaim
 

2523
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,390
short this. All right. We reclaim
previous day value low. I'm not going to

2524
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
previous day value low. I'm not going to
 

2525
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,470
previous day value low. I'm not going to
play short because they're protecting

2526
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:14,480
play short because they're protecting
 

2527
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,150
play short because they're protecting
that gap. Yeah, I don't mind the long.

2528
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,160
that gap. Yeah, I don't mind the long.
 

2529
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,069
that gap. Yeah, I don't mind the long.
The long back up to here makes sense.

2530
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:18,079
The long back up to here makes sense.
 

2531
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,710
The long back up to here makes sense.
And then trim some. Right. If you're

2532
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
And then trim some. Right. If you're
 

2533
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,589
And then trim some. Right. If you're
playing this reclaim, I'd trim some

2534
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
playing this reclaim, I'd trim some
 

2535
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,430
playing this reclaim, I'd trim some
here. And if you get this, you get you

2536
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
here. And if you get this, you get you
 

2537
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,870
here. And if you get this, you get you
might come all the way back upside. It's

2538
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880
might come all the way back upside. It's
 

2539
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,710
might come all the way back upside. It's
very possible because we've just

2540
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:28,720
very possible because we've just
 

2541
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,309
very possible because we've just
repriced this candle, right? We're

2542
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:30,319
repriced this candle, right? We're
 

2543
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,549
repriced this candle, right? We're
filling this imbalance. So if you got

2544
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:32,559
filling this imbalance. So if you got
 

2545
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,309
filling this imbalance. So if you got
long here, trim this. I'm waiting to see

2546
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
long here, trim this. I'm waiting to see
 

2547
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,150
long here, trim this. I'm waiting to see
if they want to reshort this back down.

2548
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:36,160
if they want to reshort this back down.
 

2549
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,309
if they want to reshort this back down.
If they don't, then your long is

2550
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:38,319
If they don't, then your long is
 

2551
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,309
If they don't, then your long is
possible to value area high and I will

2552
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:40,319
possible to value area high and I will
 

2553
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,910
possible to value area high and I will
just be no position at all. Okay, stop

2554
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:43,920
just be no position at all. Okay, stop
 

2555
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:50,309
just be no position at all. Okay, stop
talking. Start focusing, Alex.

01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:53,520
here and not getting their way. You can
 

2629
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,430
here and not getting their way. You can
see the book they're not very big. If

2630
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:55,440
see the book they're not very big. If
 

2631
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,950
see the book they're not very big. If
you look at bookmap these buyers are not

2632
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
you look at bookmap these buyers are not
 

2633
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,870
you look at bookmap these buyers are not
that big. 30 25 20s and then down to 10.

2634
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:00,880
that big. 30 25 20s and then down to 10.
 

2635
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,510
that big. 30 25 20s and then down to 10.
But they are absorbing down here. So far

2636
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:03,520
But they are absorbing down here. So far
 

2637
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,030
But they are absorbing down here. So far
I think they will get filled at some

2638
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:05,040
I think they will get filled at some
 

2639
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,750
I think they will get filled at some
point. I'm watching this New York open.

2640
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:07,760
point. I'm watching this New York open.
 

2641
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,270
point. I'm watching this New York open.
I really want to see if we can come up

2642
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:09,280
I really want to see if we can come up
 

2643
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,750
I really want to see if we can come up
to 50s and then reject 50s. Then I'll be

2644
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:11,760
to 50s and then reject 50s. Then I'll be
 

2645
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:31,270
to 50s and then reject 50s. Then I'll be
really interested in the cell.

2646
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280

 

2647
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,109

Lots of selling down here without moving

2648
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:33,119
Lots of selling down here without moving
 

2649
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,789
Lots of selling down here without moving
lower.

2650
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
lower.
 

2651
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,430
lower.
I'd say everything is sellside 37 and

2652
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
I'd say everything is sellside 37 and
 

2653
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,589
I'd say everything is sellside 37 and
under without moving lower right now. So

2654
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:39,599
under without moving lower right now. So
 

2655
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,950
under without moving lower right now. So
any seller under 37's currently stuck. I

2656
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:42,960
any seller under 37's currently stuck. I
 

2657
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,109
any seller under 37's currently stuck. I
want to see this hit 50s. All right,

2658
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
want to see this hit 50s. All right,
 

2659
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,470
want to see this hit 50s. All right,
because I know that's where buyers came

2660
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,480
because I know that's where buyers came
 

2661
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,150
because I know that's where buyers came
in. I want to see if they stay stuck.

2662
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:48,160
in. I want to see if they stay stuck.
 

2663
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,670
in. I want to see if they stay stuck.
And we just trap more buyers in this

2664
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:49,680
And we just trap more buyers in this
 

2665
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,309
And we just trap more buyers in this
candle. This is such tiny range. It's

2666
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
candle. This is such tiny range. It's
 

2667
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,109
candle. This is such tiny range. It's
hard for me to uh get involved in at the

2668
01:03:55,109 --> 01:03:55,119
hard for me to uh get involved in at the
 

2669
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,430
hard for me to uh get involved in at the
moment. Maybe if we get up to 50s.

2670
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:57,440
moment. Maybe if we get up to 50s.
 

2671
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,309
moment. Maybe if we get up to 50s.
Where's that imbalance? Imbalance 52s to

2672
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:00,319
Where's that imbalance? Imbalance 52s to
 

2673
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,349
Where's that imbalance? Imbalance 52s to
54s. Maybe I'll think about it. Maybe if

2674
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:03,359
54s. Maybe I'll think about it. Maybe if
 

2675
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,349
54s. Maybe I'll think about it. Maybe if
we do this,

2676
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:05,359
we do this,
 

2677
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:06,870
we do this,
I'll be interested now because I've

2678
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:06,880
I'll be interested now because I've
 

2679
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,230
I'll be interested now because I've
missed this. We were talking about this

2680
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,240
missed this. We were talking about this
 

2681
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,069
missed this. We were talking about this
move up into here to protect it. I've

2682
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079
move up into here to protect it. I've
 

2683
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,670
move up into here to protect it. I've
missed it. Got caught teaching. This is

2684
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:11,680
missed it. Got caught teaching. This is
 

2685
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,430
missed it. Got caught teaching. This is
the one problem I have sometimes trying

2686
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:13,440
the one problem I have sometimes trying
 

2687
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,190
the one problem I have sometimes trying
to show you guys. I missed the actual

2688
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,200
to show you guys. I missed the actual
 

2689
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,750
to show you guys. I missed the actual
moves I want. [sighs]

2690
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760
moves I want. [sighs]
 

2691
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,109
moves I want. [sighs]
Let's see. All right, here we go. Let's

2692
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:21,119
Let's see. All right, here we go. Let's
 

2693
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,630
Let's see. All right, here we go. Let's
see if we can fill this in just above

2694
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:22,640
see if we can fill this in just above
 

2695
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:32,069
see if we can fill this in just above
50s. That keeps breathing there.

2696
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:32,079

 

2697
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,670

Yeah, exactly. Both sides possible. I'm

2698
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:33,680
Yeah, exactly. Both sides possible. I'm
 

2699
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,589
Yeah, exactly. Both sides possible. I'm
trying to be flexible today. All right.

2700
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:35,599
trying to be flexible today. All right.
 

2701
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,589
trying to be flexible today. All right.
So I can show you my my my leaderboard,

2702
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:37,599
So I can show you my my my leaderboard,
 

2703
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:38,950
So I can show you my my my leaderboard,
let's call it. It's all I'm just trading

2704
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
let's call it. It's all I'm just trading
 

2705
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,910
let's call it. It's all I'm just trading
one account today. Up 710 on it. So we

2706
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:41,920
one account today. Up 710 on it. So we
 

2707
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,789
one account today. Up 710 on it. So we
will just see what we get.

2708
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:44,799
will just see what we get.
 

2709
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,150
will just see what we get.
Okay, here we go. Are we going to fill

2710
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160
Okay, here we go. Are we going to fill
 

2711
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,470
Okay, here we go. Are we going to fill
this imbalance in into this little

2712
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
this imbalance in into this little
 

2713
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,910
this imbalance in into this little
level? That's all buyers getting trapped

2714
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:49,920
level? That's all buyers getting trapped
 

2715
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,510
level? That's all buyers getting trapped
there again. They were trapped at 51s

2716
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,520
there again. They were trapped at 51s
 

2717
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,950
there again. They were trapped at 51s
before. There's a little imbalance into

2718
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
before. There's a little imbalance into
 

2719
01:04:52,960 --> 01:05:05,510
before. There's a little imbalance into
54 I'm looking at.

2720
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,520

 

2721
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,990

No one on the book above until 70s. It's

2722
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,000
No one on the book above until 70s. It's
 

2723
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,630
No one on the book above until 70s. It's
very thin book.

2724
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:10,640
very thin book.
 

2725
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,910
very thin book.
Here's that imbalance field.

2726
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:13,920
Here's that imbalance field.
 

2727
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,829
Here's that imbalance field.
They're supporting a bid now. Buyers are

2728
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
They're supporting a bid now. Buyers are
 

2729
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,829

coming in.
 

2731
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,069
coming in.
Well, it's now or never sellers. I would

2732
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:20,079
Well, it's now or never sellers. I would
 

2733
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,390
Well, it's now or never sellers. I would
say you have the chance now or never.

2734
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
say you have the chance now or never.
 

2735
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,829
say you have the chance now or never.
There's some bid support coming in.

2736
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:25,839
There's some bid support coming in.
 

2737
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,109
There's some bid support coming in.
They're interested in bidding this at

2738
01:05:27,109 --> 01:05:27,119
They're interested in bidding this at
 

2739
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:33,310
They're interested in bidding this at
the moment.

2740
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:33,320

 

2741
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,789

[snorts]

2742
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:34,799
[snorts]
 

2743
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,895
[snorts]
Yes, back to its gap. Uh PDC

2744
01:05:37,895 --> 01:05:37,905
Yes, back to its gap. Uh PDC
 

2745
01:05:37,905 --> 01:05:40,230
Yes, back to its gap. Uh PDC
[clears throat] looks messy down here.

2746
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,240
[clears throat] looks messy down here.
 

2747
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,589
[clears throat] looks messy down here.
All I'd say right now is definitely

2748
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:41,599
All I'd say right now is definitely
 

2749
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,829
All I'd say right now is definitely
sellers are caught under 37s and we

2750
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839
sellers are caught under 37s and we
 

2751
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,589
sellers are caught under 37s and we
might well test this val area low up

2752
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
might well test this val area low up
 

2753
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,309
might well test this val area low up
here. Now

2754
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
here. Now
 

2755
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,150
here. Now
we are seeing some bids come back in to

2756
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,160
we are seeing some bids come back in to
 

2757
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:57,829
we are seeing some bids come back in to
this market.

2758
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839

 

2759
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,990

650 now being bid. He's walking up. He's

2760
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
650 now being bid. He's walking up. He's
 

2761
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,390
650 now being bid. He's walking up. He's
trying to push this market up right now.

2762
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400

 

2763
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,870

He's rebid again. He's walking up and

2764
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
He's rebid again. He's walking up and
 

2765
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:20,950
He's rebid again. He's walking up and
again he's walked up into 55s now.

2766
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:20,960

 

2767
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,430

See if he's legit. And again, they're

2768
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:23,440
See if he's legit. And again, they're
 

2769
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,430
See if he's legit. And again, they're
getting aggressive there. Not touching

2770
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:25,440
getting aggressive there. Not touching
 

2771
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,150
getting aggressive there. Not touching
this. Too many games here. Way too many

2772
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,160
this. Too many games here. Way too many
 

2773
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:33,029
this. Too many games here. Way too many
games here for me.

2774
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:33,039

 

2775
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,950

Back to the 70s. If they go back inside

2776
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:34,960
Back to the 70s. If they go back inside
 

2777
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,150
Back to the 70s. If they go back inside
the range, there's nothing I'm going to

2778
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,160
the range, there's nothing I'm going to
 

2779
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,470
the range, there's nothing I'm going to
do. I'm not touching it up here. No way.

2780
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:38,480

This is my no trade zone.

2782
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:41,440
This is my no trade zone.
 

2783
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,589
This is my no trade zone.
No way. We're going to have no

2784
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:43,599
No way. We're going to have no
 

2785

I'm not trading in 30 points, so I'm

2788
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:46,880
I'm not trading in 30 points, so I'm
 

2789

I'm not trading in 30 points, so I'm
good. Thanks. I'm absolutely good.

2790
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:52,240

 

2791
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,750

But yeah, you can see a buyer on the

2792
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:53,760
But yeah, you can see a buyer on the
 

2793
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,069
But yeah, you can see a buyer on the
tape. He started getting aggressive from

2794
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:56,079
tape. He started getting aggressive from
 

2795
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,750
tape. He started getting aggressive from
those 30s. He walked up to 40, 42, 45,

2796
01:06:59,750 --> 01:06:59,760
those 30s. He walked up to 40, 42, 45,
 

2797
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,349
those 30s. He walked up to 40, 42, 45,
50, 52, 55. He's now pushing this market

2798
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:03,359
50, 52, 55. He's now pushing this market
 

2799
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,190
50, 52, 55. He's now pushing this market
up. He's literally [clears throat]

2800
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,200
up. He's literally [clears throat]
 

2801
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,349
up. He's literally [clears throat]
stairstepped up underneath. First time

2802
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:07,359
stairstepped up underneath. First time
 

2803
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,829
stairstepped up underneath. First time
we've seen it. Yeah. into this low

2804
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
we've seen it. Yeah. into this low
 

2805
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,510
we've seen it. Yeah. into this low
volume node yet, but we're into previous

2806
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
volume node yet, but we're into previous
 

2807
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,430
volume node yet, but we're into previous
day value low. We reclaim current value

2808
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:13,440
day value low. We reclaim current value
 

2809
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,789
day value low. We reclaim current value
on the day. If they don't reject here,

2810
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:14,799
on the day. If they don't reject here,
 

2811
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,309
on the day. If they don't reject here,
then we're going to go back inside value

2812
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:16,319
then we're going to go back inside value
 

2813
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:17,430
then we're going to go back inside value
and we're going to come up to previous

2814
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,440
and we're going to come up to previous
 

2815
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,789
and we're going to come up to previous
day point control and then up to

2816
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:18,799
day point control and then up to
 

2817
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,789
day point control and then up to
previous day value high. And it's it's

2818
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:20,799
previous day value high. And it's it's
 

2819
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,470
previous day value high. And it's it's
just going to be a no trade day for me

2820
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:22,480
just going to be a no trade day for me
 

2821
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:36,549
just going to be a no trade day for me
in that in that market in that area.

2822
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:36,559

 

2823
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:55,349

Yes, back to New York View.

2824
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:55,359

 

2825
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:59,029

Some those names are still rotating.

2826
01:07:59,029 --> 01:07:59,039
Some those names are still rotating.
 

2827
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,870
Some those names are still rotating.
It's not the mag, guys. All right. It's

2828
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:00,880
It's not the mag, guys. All right. It's
 

2829
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,029
It's not the mag, guys. All right. It's
not the mag rotating. It's the sort of B

2830
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039
not the mag rotating. It's the sort of B
 

2831
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,349
not the mag rotating. It's the sort of B
and C list names, let's call it. That's

2832
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:05,359
and C list names, let's call it. That's
 

2833
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:06,950
and C list names, let's call it. That's
what you're seeing. rotation in right

2834
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:06,960
what you're seeing. rotation in right
 

2835
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,430
what you're seeing. rotation in right
now the B and C list names I would call

2836
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:09,440
now the B and C list names I would call
 

2837
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,270
now the B and C list names I would call
it

2838
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:13,280

 

2839
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,630

RTI and NQ MBTS remember today's the

2840
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
RTI and NQ MBTS remember today's the
 

2841
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,390
RTI and NQ MBTS remember today's the
last balance day as well we rebalance

2842
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:18,400
last balance day as well we rebalance
 

2843
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,030
last balance day as well we rebalance
after today right on the on the ETFs I'm

2844
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,040
after today right on the on the ETFs I'm
 

2845
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,149
after today right on the on the ETFs I'm
pretty sure so AVGO goes uh into the

2846
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:24,159
pretty sure so AVGO goes uh into the
 

2847
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:26,550
pretty sure so AVGO goes uh into the
cues after today the rebalance day it's

2848
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,560
cues after today the rebalance day it's
 

2849
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,070
cues after today the rebalance day it's
their last it's their last chance to

2850
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,080
their last it's their last chance to
 

2851
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,229
their last it's their last chance to
position so that's probably what you've

2852
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:30,239
position so that's probably what you've
 

2853
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,990
position so that's probably what you've
got going on with the rotation in those

2854
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,000
got going on with the rotation in those
 

2855
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,309
got going on with the rotation in those
B and C list names it's their last

2856
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:34,319
B and C list names it's their last
 

2857
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,550
B and C list names it's their last
chance to reposition for the rebalance

2858
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:36,560
chance to reposition for the rebalance
 

2859
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,110
chance to reposition for the rebalance
on SPY and QQQ.

2860
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:41,120

 

2861
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,910

What was a rebalance day today? By the

2862
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:43,920
What was a rebalance day today? By the
 

2863
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,390
What was a rebalance day today? By the
end of day today, we kick a load of

2864
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:46,400
end of day today, we kick a load of
 

2865
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,070
end of day today, we kick a load of
names out of the cues and we bring a

2866
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:48,080
names out of the cues and we bring a
 

2867
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,070
names out of the cues and we bring a
load of names in. All right, so the

2868
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:50,080
load of names in. All right, so the
 

2869
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,390
load of names in. All right, so the
weakest names get pushed out and um

2870
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:52,400
weakest names get pushed out and um
 

2871
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,470
weakest names get pushed out and um
strong names that they want in go in.

2872
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,480
strong names that they want in go in.
 

2873
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,990
strong names that they want in go in.
That's why overall you want to be long,

2874
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
That's why overall you want to be long,
 

2875
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,030
That's why overall you want to be long,
right? And over why the market will

2876
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,040
right? And over why the market will
 

2877
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,269
right? And over why the market will
always go up long term. It is built to

2878
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:03,279
always go up long term. It is built to
 

2879
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,870
always go up long term. It is built to
go up. All right. So, it's like it's a

2880
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:04,880
go up. All right. So, it's like it's a
 

2881
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,390
go up. All right. So, it's like it's a
bit like a relegation. I don't know if

2882
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:06,400
bit like a relegation. I don't know if
 

2883
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,550
bit like a relegation. I don't know if
you have that in America, but for those

2884
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,560
you have that in America, but for those
 

2885
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,030
you have that in America, but for those
to give you Premier League t terms. All

2886
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040
to give you Premier League t terms. All
 

2887
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,749
to give you Premier League t terms. All
right. The bottom three of the table,

2888
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:13,759
right. The bottom three of the table,
 

2889
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,990
right. The bottom three of the table,
they get relegated. They go into a lower

2890
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,000
they get relegated. They go into a lower
 

2891
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,910
they get relegated. They go into a lower
a lower division. That's actually what

2892
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:17,920
a lower division. That's actually what
 

2893
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,870
a lower division. That's actually what
you get in SPY and QQQ. So, we boot

2894
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:20,880
you get in SPY and QQQ. So, we boot
 

2895
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,390
you get in SPY and QQQ. So, we boot
names out which aren't performing well,

2896
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
names out which aren't performing well,
 

2897
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,510
names out which aren't performing well,
and we replace them with names which are

2898
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:25,520
and we replace them with names which are
 

2899
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,349
and we replace them with names which are
performing well. Every quarter they

2900
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:27,359
performing well. Every quarter they
 

2901
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,910
performing well. Every quarter they
rebalance.

2902
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
rebalance.
 

2903
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,669
rebalance.
So, that makes sure that the market

2904
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
So, that makes sure that the market
 

2905
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,189
So, that makes sure that the market
stays strong. So if you imagine you got

2906
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:33,199
stays strong. So if you imagine you got
 

2907
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:35,269
stays strong. So if you imagine you got
a stock which is doing [\h__\h] and is down

2908
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:35,279
a stock which is doing [\h__\h] and is down
 

2909
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,870
a stock which is doing [\h__\h] and is down
on the year and no one wants it anymore

2910
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:36,880
on the year and no one wants it anymore
 

2911
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,309
on the year and no one wants it anymore
and it's underperforming and they

2912
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
and it's underperforming and they
 

2913
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,390
and it's underperforming and they
replace it with a stock which is up 100%

2914
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:40,400
replace it with a stock which is up 100%
 

2915
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,229
replace it with a stock which is up 100%
of the year. Well, guess what? Brings

2916
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
of the year. Well, guess what? Brings
 

2917
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:43,829
of the year. Well, guess what? Brings
strength into the market. All right, so

2918
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
strength into the market. All right, so
 

2919
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,910
strength into the market. All right, so
that's what today's the last day to do

2920
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
that's what today's the last day to do
 

2921
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,309
that's what today's the last day to do
it this quarter. So that's probably why

2922
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:48,319
it this quarter. So that's probably why
 

2923
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,870
it this quarter. So that's probably why
you've got a lot of names,

2924
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
you've got a lot of names,
 

2925
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,789
you've got a lot of names,
you know, those big option names, those

2926
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:52,799
you know, those big option names, those
 

2927
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,750
you know, those big option names, those
big uh

2928
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:55,760
big uh
 

2929
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,430
big uh
uh quantum names. You're seeing some

2930
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
uh quantum names. You're seeing some
 

2931
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,950
uh quantum names. You're seeing some
weakness in some of them or they're

2932
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
weakness in some of them or they're
 

2933
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,430
weakness in some of them or they're
actually quite whippy like I I am very

2934
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:01,440
actually quite whippy like I I am very
 

2935
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,270
actually quite whippy like I I am very
whippy today. You're probably seeing

2936
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,280
whippy today. You're probably seeing
 

2937
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,030
whippy today. You're probably seeing
people reposition themselves for the

2938
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,040
people reposition themselves for the
 

2939
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:12,630
people reposition themselves for the
next quarter.

2940
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:12,640

 

2941
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,550

Just stuck here at previous day values.

2942
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:14,560
Just stuck here at previous day values.
 

2943
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:21,590
Just stuck here at previous day values.
Can't really do much at the moment.

2944
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600

 

2945
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,270

Do I have a certain entry like a break

2946
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,280
Do I have a certain entry like a break
 

2947
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,030
Do I have a certain entry like a break
of a previous candle? Sometimes it can

2948
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,040
of a previous candle? Sometimes it can
 

2949
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,149
of a previous candle? Sometimes it can
be a previous candle. Uh normally it's a

2950
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
be a previous candle. Uh normally it's a
 

2951
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,990
be a previous candle. Uh normally it's a
break of an area where I think

2952
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
break of an area where I think
 

2953
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,310
break of an area where I think
participants are really really caught.

2954
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:32,320
participants are really really caught.
 

2955
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,310
participants are really really caught.
So I'll have an area I want to buy or

2956
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
So I'll have an area I want to buy or
 

2957
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,709
So I'll have an area I want to buy or
sell in and then I'll look for an entry

2958
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:36,719
sell in and then I'll look for an entry
 

2959
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,390
sell in and then I'll look for an entry
within that area based on what I'm

2960
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:38,400
within that area based on what I'm
 

2961
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,910
within that area based on what I'm
seeing on the tape more than anything.

2962
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:39,920
seeing on the tape more than anything.
 

2963
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,830
seeing on the tape more than anything.
Or or maybe it's even a reclaim of an

2964
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:41,840
Or or maybe it's even a reclaim of an
 

2965
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,990
Or or maybe it's even a reclaim of an
EMA. Like right now there's nothing for

2966
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,000
EMA. Like right now there's nothing for
 

2967
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,270
EMA. Like right now there's nothing for
me to do. We're going to go back into

2968
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,280
me to do. We're going to go back into
 

2969
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,990
me to do. We're going to go back into
range rotation. I'm [\h__\h] no way am I

2970
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:48,000
range rotation. I'm [\h__\h] no way am I
 

2971
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,750
range rotation. I'm [\h__\h] no way am I
playing range rotation today. No thank

2972
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:49,760
playing range rotation today. No thank
 

2973
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,550
playing range rotation today. No thank
you very much. I don't want to play in

2974
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
you very much. I don't want to play in
 

2975
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,550
you very much. I don't want to play in
the area we've been at all morning and

2976
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,560
the area we've been at all morning and
 

2977
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,390
the area we've been at all morning and
all of yesterday. I do not want to play

2978
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:56,400
all of yesterday. I do not want to play
 

2979
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,790
all of yesterday. I do not want to play
in here. It is a choice. All right.

2980
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:58,800
in here. It is a choice. All right.
 

2981
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,790
in here. It is a choice. All right.
Doesn't mean you guys can't play in

2982
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:00,800
Doesn't mean you guys can't play in
 

2983
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,270
Doesn't mean you guys can't play in
there, but I'm making the choice. I do

2984
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
there, but I'm making the choice. I do
 

2985
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,750
there, but I'm making the choice. I do
not want to play long in this. All

2986
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:05,760
not want to play long in this. All
 

2987
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,070
not want to play long in this. All
right. I don't want to play in this. We

2988
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:08,080
right. I don't want to play in this. We
 

2989
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,630
right. I don't want to play in this. We
either need strength or weakness or

2990
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:10,640
either need strength or weakness or
 

2991
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,550
either need strength or weakness or
nothing. That's how I'm treating this

2992
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:12,560
nothing. That's how I'm treating this
 

2993
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,189
nothing. That's how I'm treating this
market right now. I don't want to get

2994
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:15,199
market right now. I don't want to get
 

2995
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,950
market right now. I don't want to get
chopped up is the best way of putting

2996
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:16,960
chopped up is the best way of putting
 

2997
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:25,669
chopped up is the best way of putting
it.

2998
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679

 

2999
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,910

Okay. So 85 86 is a big level. 86 has

3000
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:29,920
Okay. So 85 86 is a big level. 86 has
 

3001
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,950
Okay. So 85 86 is a big level. 86 has
positive delta c. 85 has negative delta.

3002
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:32,960
positive delta c. 85 has negative delta.
 

3003
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,750
positive delta c. 85 has negative delta.
So 85 sellers are still in control. 86

3004
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
So 85 sellers are still in control. 86
 

3005
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,590
So 85 sellers are still in control. 86
is still stuck. We get above that then

3006
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
is still stuck. We get above that then
 

3007
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,669
is still stuck. We get above that then
uh more squeeze potential possible based

3008
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:39,679
uh more squeeze potential possible based
 

3009
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:47,189
uh more squeeze potential possible based
on what I've seen on the book.

3010
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199

 

3011
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,870

Do we need MBO to get the DOM? Um,

3012
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
Do we need MBO to get the DOM? Um,
 

3013
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,870
Do we need MBO to get the DOM? Um,
this is just uh I just pay for CME data

3014
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:52,880
this is just uh I just pay for CME data
 

3015
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,870
this is just uh I just pay for CME data
on here.

3016
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:54,880
on here.
 

3017
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,470
on here.
But you don't have to use this DOM. This

3018
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
But you don't have to use this DOM. This
 

3019
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,550
But you don't have to use this DOM. This
is just bookmap. This is Bootmaps DOM.

3020
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
is just bookmap. This is Bootmaps DOM.
 

3021
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,110
is just bookmap. This is Bootmaps DOM.
But you can use whatever you like.

3022
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,120

 

3023
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,669

You just want uh data beyond. I mean, I

3024
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:05,679
You just want uh data beyond. I mean, I
 

3025
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,830
You just want uh data beyond. I mean, I
never get people that look at they say,

3026
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
never get people that look at they say,
 

3027
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,189
never get people that look at they say,
"Oh, yeah, I trade the ladder." And then

3028
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:09,199
"Oh, yeah, I trade the ladder." And then
 

3029
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,950
"Oh, yeah, I trade the ladder." And then
they have no prices on the ladder other

3030
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:10,960
they have no prices on the ladder other
 

3031
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,709
they have no prices on the ladder other
than, you know, a ticky the side. You're

3032
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:12,719
than, you know, a ticky the side. You're
 

3033
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,870
than, you know, a ticky the side. You're
not trading a ladder.

3034
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
not trading a ladder.
 

3035
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,470
not trading a ladder.
You can't You're not trading a ladder if

3036
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:16,480
You can't You're not trading a ladder if
 

3037
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,750
You can't You're not trading a ladder if
you're seeing a tick either side of you

3038
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:17,760
you're seeing a tick either side of you
 

3039
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,669
you're seeing a tick either side of you
like what you would get for free from

3040
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
like what you would get for free from
 

3041
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,229
like what you would get for free from
Topep for example. You if you're

3042
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
Topep for example. You if you're
 

3043
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,550
Topep for example. You if you're
actually going to look at this data, you

3044
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:24,560
actually going to look at this data, you
 

3045
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,990
actually going to look at this data, you
need to pay for the data to see it all.

3046
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:28,000
need to pay for the data to see it all.
 

3047
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,390
need to pay for the data to see it all.
Okay. So, previous day point of control

3048
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:30,400
Okay. So, previous day point of control
 

3049
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,430
Okay. So, previous day point of control
now at 94s, you got both VWOPS 24hour

3050
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:33,440
now at 94s, you got both VWOPS 24hour
 

3051
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,750
now at 94s, you got both VWOPS 24hour
and cash VWOP up here. We're getting

3052
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:35,760
and cash VWOP up here. We're getting
 

3053
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,430
and cash VWOP up here. We're getting
stuck right now at previous day value

3054
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:37,440
stuck right now at previous day value
 

3055
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,110
stuck right now at previous day value
area low. So, maybe they drift in and

3056
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
area low. So, maybe they drift in and
 

3057
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,430
area low. So, maybe they drift in and
lose it. I don't know, folks. But it

3058
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,440
lose it. I don't know, folks. But it
 

3059
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,270
lose it. I don't know, folks. But it
doesn't look very pretty right now. It's

3060
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
doesn't look very pretty right now. It's
 

3061
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,110
doesn't look very pretty right now. It's
one thing. The one thing I do know is it

3062
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
one thing. The one thing I do know is it
 

3063
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:55,189
one thing. The one thing I do know is it
doesn't look very pretty.

3064
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:55,199

 

3065
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,430

So losing previous day value low. Value

3066
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,440
So losing previous day value low. Value
 

3067
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,189
So losing previous day value low. Value
area low on this current session is 66.

3068
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
area low on this current session is 66.
 

3069
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,870
area low on this current session is 66.
Don't want to say that out loud. It's

3070
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
Don't want to say that out loud. It's
 

3071
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,709
Don't want to say that out loud. It's
the sixes. All right. It's the sixes.

3072
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
the sixes. All right. It's the sixes.
 

3073
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,270
the sixes. All right. It's the sixes.
Not going to say that out loud. And we

3074
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,280
Not going to say that out loud. And we
 

3075
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,750
Not going to say that out loud. And we
have a shelf up here into 700. Okay. So,

3076
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:11,760
have a shelf up here into 700. Okay. So,
 

3077
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,430
have a shelf up here into 700. Okay. So,
this was the this was the level that

3078
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
this was the this was the level that
 

3079
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,950
this was the this was the level that
they broke down from.

3080
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:16,960
they broke down from.
 

3081
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,229
they broke down from.

I think stuff like this is I'm going to

3158
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:07,920
I think stuff like this is I'm going to
 

3159

I think stuff like this is I'm going to
I'm going to be honest with you. I think

3160
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:09,360
I'm going to be honest with you. I think
 

3161
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,229
I'm going to be honest with you. I think
this sums up the dirtiness of a

3162
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
this sums up the dirtiness of a
 

3163
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,910
this sums up the dirtiness of a
government. You're going to put initial

3164
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:13,920
government. You're going to put initial
 

3165
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,110
government. You're going to put initial
jobless claims out on Christmas Eve and

3166
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:17,120
jobless claims out on Christmas Eve and
 

3167
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,709
jobless claims out on Christmas Eve and
then you're going to put more jobless

3168
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
then you're going to put more jobless
 

3169
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:25,510
then you're going to put more jobless
claims out on New Year's Eve

3170
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:25,520

 

3171
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,470

when no when no one's here. You're just

3172
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:28,480
when no when no one's here. You're just
 

3173
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,310
when no when no one's here. You're just
going to hide it when no one's here. I

3174
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
going to hide it when no one's here. I
 

3175
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,750
going to hide it when no one's here. I
mean, it's

3176
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:33,760

 

3177
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,990

I just think that's that sums up the

3178
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,000
I just think that's that sums up the
 

3179
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,189
I just think that's that sums up the
government for me.

3180
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:39,199
government for me.
 

3181
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:42,310
government for me.

months and months. And some of the
biggest data you're going to put out

3186
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:44,960
biggest data you're going to put out
 

3187
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,870
biggest data you're going to put out
when no one's there.

3188
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:48,880

 

3189
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,830

Good one.

3190
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
Good one.
 

3191
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,510
Good one.
You normally not trade previous day

3192
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
You normally not trade previous day
 

3193
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,229
You normally not trade previous day
value area. Uh because if if we've it

3194
01:15:56,229 --> 01:15:56,239
value area. Uh because if if we've it
 

3195
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,070
value area. Uh because if if we've it
depends on what that value if this value

3196
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:58,080
depends on what that value if this value
 

3197
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,870
depends on what that value if this value
area was nice and big, I'd consider it.

3198
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:00,880
area was nice and big, I'd consider it.
 

3199
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,630
area was nice and big, I'd consider it.
But look how small this is. And look how

3200
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
But look how small this is. And look how
 

3201
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,149
But look how small this is. And look how
we've chopped this morning and chopped

3202
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:04,159
we've chopped this morning and chopped
 

3203
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,830
we've chopped this morning and chopped
here and chopped yesterday. I don't want

3204
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:05,840
here and chopped yesterday. I don't want
 

3205
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,750
here and chopped yesterday. I don't want
to chop in here. I don't want to play in

01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
to chop in here. I don't want to play in
 

3207
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,870
to chop in here. I don't want to play in
here. Right. This is bollocks in there.

3208
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:10,880
here. Right. This is bollocks in there.
 

3209
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,790
here. Right. This is bollocks in there.
I'm not interested in playing in there.

3210
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:12,800
I'm not interested in playing in there.
 

3211
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,070
I'm not interested in playing in there.
Think about you just bought the previous

3212
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:14,080
Think about you just bought the previous
 

3213
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,750
Think about you just bought the previous
day value long and you just got stopped

3214
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:15,760
day value long and you just got stopped
 

3215
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,950
day value long and you just got stopped
out. You going to have another go and

3216
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
out. You going to have another go and
 

3217
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,229
out. You going to have another go and
get stopped out again or you going to

3218
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:18,239
get stopped out again or you going to
 

3219
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:19,750
get stopped out again or you going to
fade this and maybe you come down to

3220
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:19,760
fade this and maybe you come down to
 

3221
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,229
fade this and maybe you come down to
here like

3222
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:24,239

 

3223
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,070

I don't think there's edge is the best

3224
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:26,080
I don't think there's edge is the best
 

3225
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,590
I don't think there's edge is the best
way of putting it. There's not edge in

3226
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:27,600
way of putting it. There's not edge in
 

3227
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,430
way of putting it. There's not edge in
that. When there's edge in previous

3228
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
that. When there's edge in previous
 

3229
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,110
that. When there's edge in previous
value areas is when there's something

3230
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,120
value areas is when there's something
 

3231
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:37,669
value areas is when there's something
like this, right? Nice big area.

3232
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679

 

3233
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,790

All right. lose this. Yeah, I have room.

3234

All right. lose this. Yeah, I have room.
 

3235
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,669
All right. lose this. Yeah, I have room.

3236
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:43,679

3237
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,990
I have room. What the hell am I going to
do in previous days value right now? I

3238
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:46,000

3239
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,750
do in previous days value right now? I

liking other people's posts. But, you
 

3319
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,430
liking other people's posts. But, you
know, crime is at incredibly high

3320
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:43,440
know, crime is at incredibly high
 

3321
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,030
know, crime is at incredibly high
levels. And when they say, "Oh, crime

3322
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:45,040
levels. And when they say, "Oh, crime

just suddenly not included knife crime
 

3327
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,390
just suddenly not included knife crime
in that data? This is the thing people

3328
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
in that data? This is the thing people
 

3329
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,229
in that data? This is the thing people
don't understand. Um, not you guys,

3330
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
don't understand. Um, not you guys,
 

3331
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:53,510
don't understand. Um, not you guys,
because if you're trading, you're

3332
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
because if you're trading, you're
 

3333
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,189
because if you're trading, you're
probably smart, but I'll make you aware

3334
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
probably smart, but I'll make you aware
 

3335
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,910
probably smart, but I'll make you aware
of this. things like that CPI report

3336
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:57,920
of this. things like that CPI report
 

3337
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,669
of this. things like that CPI report
that came out which came in better than

that came out which came in better than
 

3339
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,910
that came out which came in better than
expected didn't include like 80% of the

expected didn't include like 80% of the
 

3341
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,750
expected didn't include like 80% of the
goods we'd normally include. Right? This

3342
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,760
goods we'd normally include. Right? This
 

3343
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,510
goods we'd normally include. Right? This
is what they do when they say, "Oh,

3344
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:05,520
is what they do when they say, "Oh,
 

3345
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,709
is what they do when they say, "Oh,
unemployment's uh better than expected."

01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
unemployment's uh better than expected."
 

3347
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,709
unemployment's uh better than expected."
They won't include some data. When they

3348
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:10,719
They won't include some data. When they
 

3349
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,790
They won't include some data. When they
say crimes down or violent crimes down,

3350
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:12,800
say crimes down or violent crimes down,
 

3351
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,790
say crimes down or violent crimes down,
they suddenly don't include like GBH and

3352
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
they suddenly don't include like GBH and
 

3353
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,669
they suddenly don't include like GBH and
ABH. You have to like really look at the

3354
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:17,679
ABH. You have to like really look at the
 

3355
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,350
ABH. You have to like really look at the
sort of asterisks at the bottom to see

3356
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,360
sort of asterisks at the bottom to see
 

3357
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,669
sort of asterisks at the bottom to see
what they've included. Okay. So,

3358
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:21,679
what they've included. Okay. So,
 

3359
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:23,430
what they've included. Okay. So,
couldn't get back in above this low

3360
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
couldn't get back in above this low
 

3361
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,110
couldn't get back in above this low
volume volume node. They're doing the

3362
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,120
volume volume node. They're doing the
 

3363
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,310
volume volume node. They're doing the
same here. And you can see the

3364
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:26,320
same here. And you can see the
 

3365
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,470
same here. And you can see the
rotational part is sort of here right

3366
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:28,480
rotational part is sort of here right
 

3367
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,950
rotational part is sort of here right
now. Right. No acceptance above, no

3368
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:30,960
now. Right. No acceptance above, no
 

3369

01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,910
Yeah, it's uh it's in dire straits over
there right now, unfortunately. It's not

3396
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:03,920
there right now, unfortunately. It's not
 

3397
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,830
there right now, unfortunately. It's not
not somewhere I'm in a hurry to move

3398
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:05,840
not somewhere I'm in a hurry to move
 

3399
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,189
not somewhere I'm in a hurry to move
back to. Let's just put it that way.

3400
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:07,199
back to. Let's just put it that way.
 

3401
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,750
back to. Let's just put it that way.
It's the fall of a country. Can it be

3402
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:09,760
It's the fall of a country. Can it be
 

3403
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,510
It's the fall of a country. Can it be
fixed? Absolutely. But not with the

3404
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:11,520
fixed? Absolutely. But not with the
 

3405
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,149
fixed? Absolutely. But not with the
current leadership, I would say. Not

3406
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
current leadership, I would say. Not
 

3407
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:15,430
current leadership, I would say. Not
with any of the leaders who are trying

3408
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:15,440
with any of the leaders who are trying
 

3409
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,110
with any of the leaders who are trying
to get in at the moment either, I don't

3410
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,120
to get in at the moment either, I don't
 

3411
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,750
to get in at the moment either, I don't
think. So, you know,

3412
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
think. So, you know,
 

3413
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,310
think. So, you know,
I do worry about this isn't about the UK

3414
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:22,320
I do worry about this isn't about the UK
 

3415
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,430
I do worry about this isn't about the UK
or America. It's global thing. Where are

3416
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
or America. It's global thing. Where are
 

3417
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,310
or America. It's global thing. Where are
the young leaders, you know, who are

3418
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:28,320
the young leaders, you know, who are
 

3419
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,189
the young leaders, you know, who are
center, not far left, not far right,

3420
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:31,199
center, not far left, not far right,
 

3421
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,590
center, not far left, not far right,
bang in the middle, center, who can

3422
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
bang in the middle, center, who can
 

3423
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,910
bang in the middle, center, who can
drive a good economy and a good social

3424
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
drive a good economy and a good social
 

3425
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,990
drive a good economy and a good social
environment. Where are they? I'll tell

3426
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
environment. Where are they? I'll tell
 

3427
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,669
environment. Where are they? I'll tell
you where they are. Nowhere to be seen

3428
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:39,679
you where they are. Nowhere to be seen
 

3429
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,510
you where they are. Nowhere to be seen
because anyone with anyone at sense

3430
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,520
because anyone with anyone at sense
 

3431
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,950
because anyone with anyone at sense
doesn't want to be involved in politics

3432
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:42,960
doesn't want to be involved in politics
 

3433
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,390
doesn't want to be involved in politics
at all. And that's the problem we have

3434
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,400
at all. And that's the problem we have
 

3435
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,070
at all. And that's the problem we have
right now. It's why all the leaders,

3436
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
right now. It's why all the leaders,
 

3437
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:52,470
right now. It's why all the leaders,
they're either crooked or old.

3438
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480

 

3439
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,830

Same stuff in Germany. Is that right,

3440
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:53,840
Same stuff in Germany. Is that right,
 

3441
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,229
Same stuff in Germany. Is that right,
Roman? That's a it's a shame. Where am I

3442
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:56,239
Roman? That's a it's a shame. Where am I
 

3443
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:57,910
Roman? That's a it's a shame. Where am I
from? I'm I'm originally from London,

3445
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,790
from? I'm I'm originally from London,
but I live in in Los Angeles. Okay, so

3446
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:00,800
but I live in in Los Angeles. Okay, so
 

3447
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,550
but I live in in Los Angeles. Okay, so
they caught underneath this gray box.

3448
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:02,560
they caught underneath this gray box.
 

3449
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,229
they caught underneath this gray box.
You see this? No acceptance below. Low

3450
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:04,239
You see this? No acceptance below. Low
 

3451
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,590
You see this? No acceptance below. Low
volume node. Caught them. Come back to

3452
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
volume node. Caught them. Come back to
 

3453
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,189
volume node. Caught them. Come back to
the top side. If they hold the bid now,

3454
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:07,199
the top side. If they hold the bid now,
 

3455
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,870
the top side. If they hold the bid now,
they will try and drive higher through

3456
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
they will try and drive higher through
 

3457
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,030
they will try and drive higher through
this low volume node uh to the upside.

3458
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
this low volume node uh to the upside.
 

3459
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,350
this low volume node uh to the upside.
Now, if they can hold the bid, it's a

3460
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
Now, if they can hold the bid, it's a
 

3461
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,189
Now, if they can hold the bid, it's a
big if, but that's what they were trying

3462
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
big if, but that's what they were trying
 

3463
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,030
big if, but that's what they were trying
to do. Can they hold this now into sort

3464
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
to do. Can they hold this now into sort
 

3465
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,270
to do. Can they hold this now into sort
of 83s after doing the damage? So, they

3466
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
of 83s after doing the damage? So, they
 

3467
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,350
of 83s after doing the damage? So, they
caught shorts here. Can they hold this?

3468
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,360
caught shorts here. Can they hold this?
 

3469
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,189
caught shorts here. Can they hold this?
Can they find acceptance above and go

3470
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:23,199
Can they find acceptance above and go
 

3471
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:25,350
Can they find acceptance above and go
back into here? Now, that is the

3472
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:25,360
back into here? Now, that is the
 

3473
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,189
back into here? Now, that is the
question they're currently posing in the

3474
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:27,199
question they're currently posing in the
 

3475
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,669
question they're currently posing in the
market. I will not be trading this, but

3476
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:29,679
market. I will not be trading this, but
 

3477
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,270

you guys are welcome to trade it.
Showing you what what they're trying to

3480
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:32,800
Showing you what what they're trying to
 

3481
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,030
Showing you what what they're trying to
set up to happen. Volume point of

3483
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,189
set up to happen. Volume point of
control now is down here. So, I know on

3484
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
control now is down here. So, I know on
 

3485
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,030
control now is down here. So, I know on
this chart is showing up here, but on my

3486
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,040
this chart is showing up here, but on my
 

3487
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,189
this chart is showing up here, but on my
chart, it's down here now. So, they're

3488
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:41,199
chart, it's down here now. So, they're
 

3489
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:44,229
chart, it's down here now. So, they're
trying to see if they can bid back above

3490
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:44,239
trying to see if they can bid back above
 

3491
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:47,830
trying to see if they can bid back above
VPO on the day and get back above PDC,

3492
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:47,840
VPO on the day and get back above PDC,
 

3493
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,830
VPO on the day and get back above PDC,
which is where they keep failing. 92s.

3494
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:49,840
which is where they keep failing. 92s.
 

3495

which is where they keep failing. 92s.
All the big selling came in into the

3496
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,000
All the big selling came in into the
 

3497
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,629
All the big selling came in into the
700s this morning.

3498
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639

 

3499
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,189

It's just it is messy. You see this gray

3500
01:21:59,189 --> 01:21:59,199
It's just it is messy. You see this gray
 

3501
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,030
It's just it is messy. You see this gray
box for the rotation for me. I would say

3502
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,040
box for the rotation for me. I would say
 

3503
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:16,390
box for the rotation for me. I would say
this is very very messy right now

3504
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,400

 

3505
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,990

moving towards anarchy. Yeah,

3506
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:18,000
moving towards anarchy. Yeah,
 

3507
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,510
moving towards anarchy. Yeah,
unfortunately I think you you could

3508
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:19,520
unfortunately I think you you could
 

3509
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,830
unfortunately I think you you could
potentially be right and it's going to

3510
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
potentially be right and it's going to
 

3511
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,510
potentially be right and it's going to
take something too uh drastic to change

3512
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:25,520
take something too uh drastic to change
 

3513
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,229
take something too uh drastic to change
the sort of trajectory mankind's on

3514
01:22:28,229 --> 01:22:28,239
the sort of trajectory mankind's on
 

3515
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:31,510
the sort of trajectory mankind's on
right now. I'd say

3516
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:31,520
right now. I'd say
 

3517
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,629
right now. I'd say
anyway, I'll leave too much of my uh tin

3518
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639
anyway, I'll leave too much of my uh tin
 

3519
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,390
anyway, I'll leave too much of my uh tin
hat thoughts to myself because you guys

3520
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:36,400
hat thoughts to myself because you guys
 

3521
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:42,149
hat thoughts to myself because you guys
will think I'm absolutely insane.

3522
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:42,159

 

3523
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:44,070

I'm trying to avoid consolidation, but

3524
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,080
I'm trying to avoid consolidation, but
 

3525
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,070
I'm trying to avoid consolidation, but
above and below consolidation, you've

3526
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,080
above and below consolidation, you've
 

3527
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,510
above and below consolidation, you've
got a big space Also, you didn't trade

3528
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:49,520
got a big space Also, you didn't trade
 

3529
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,709
got a big space Also, you didn't trade
here. I guess only on points with big

3530
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:52,719
here. I guess only on points with big
 

3531
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,950
here. I guess only on points with big
price movement, right? Yeah. I I just

3532
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960
price movement, right? Yeah. I I just
 

3533
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,870
price movement, right? Yeah. I I just
the way I see it, um I need to see I

3534
01:22:58,870 --> 01:22:58,880
the way I see it, um I need to see I
 

3535
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,110
the way I see it, um I need to see I
need to know that I've got room, right?

3536
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,120
need to know that I've got room, right?
 

3537
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,350
need to know that I've got room, right?
So, if I'm going to hit a I'm not

3538
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
So, if I'm going to hit a I'm not
 

3539
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,110
So, if I'm going to hit a I'm not
interested in five or 10 points, right?

3540
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,120
interested in five or 10 points, right?
 

3541
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,870
interested in five or 10 points, right?
So, I need to see that I've got room to

3542
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:06,880
So, I need to see that I've got room to
 

3543
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,709
So, I need to see that I've got room to
get to my target. And then I've got to

3544
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:08,719
get to my target. And then I've got to
 

3545
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,629
get to my target. And then I've got to
see that the risk profile makes sense to

3546
01:23:10,629 --> 01:23:10,639
see that the risk profile makes sense to
 

3547
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,430
see that the risk profile makes sense to
get there. Um that's kind of how I see

3548
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:13,440
get there. Um that's kind of how I see
 

3549
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,110
get there. Um that's kind of how I see
trading. And if we don't have room and

3550
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:15,120
trading. And if we don't have room and
 

3551
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,510
trading. And if we don't have room and
if we're just light volume chopping

3552
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
if we're just light volume chopping
 

3553
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,790
if we're just light volume chopping
backwards and forwards, I have to ask

3554
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:18,800
backwards and forwards, I have to ask
 

3555
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:34,709
backwards and forwards, I have to ask
myself, is it worth my energy?

3556
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:34,719

 

3557
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,310

They've all been terrible for ages, ages

3630

There was no way I could vote for them

3640
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,000
There was no way I could vote for them
 

3641
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,149
There was no way I could vote for them
anymore. So, what I did was not vote at

anymore. So, what I did was not vote at
all. Just like, [\h__\h] this. I can't vote

Conservatives either because they're all

01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:19,679
Conservatives either because they're all
 

3649
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,750
Conservatives either because they're all
they're all scumbags. And that's the

3650
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:21,760
they're all scumbags. And that's the
 

3651
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,270
they're all scumbags. And that's the
same any country. Here's the squeeze

3652
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:23,280
same any country. Here's the squeeze
 

3653
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,110
same any country. Here's the squeeze
back higher now, folks. That's the same

3654
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,120
back higher now, folks. That's the same
 

3655
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,750
back higher now, folks. That's the same
for any country. You got to remember how

3656
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
for any country. You got to remember how
 

3657
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,629
for any country. You got to remember how
many uh how many governments actually um

3658
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:32,639
many uh how many governments actually um
 

3659
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:37,430
many uh how many governments actually um
actually deliver on their mandate?

3660
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:37,440
actually deliver on their mandate?
 

3661
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,550
actually deliver on their mandate?
Zero, right? Zero. Zero ever deliver on

3662
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
Zero, right? Zero. Zero ever deliver on
 

3663
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,149
Zero, right? Zero. Zero ever deliver on
their mandate. That's the that's the big

3664
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:42,159
their mandate. That's the that's the big
 

3665
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:45,189
their mandate. That's the that's the big
problem.

3666
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:45,199

 

3667
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,510

I wouldn't vote reform.

3668
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:47,520
I wouldn't vote reform.
 

3669
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,350
I wouldn't vote reform.
Not for me.

3670
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360

 

3671
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,070

Fiscally, I'm conservative. socially I'm

3672
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,080
Fiscally, I'm conservative. socially I'm
 

3673
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,149
Fiscally, I'm conservative. socially I'm
uh

3674
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:56,159
uh
 

3675
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,229
uh
I'm more left of center. Not not left

3676
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:58,239
I'm more left of center. Not not left
 

3677
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,550
I'm more left of center. Not not left
but left to center. So I mean that's

3678
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:00,560
but left to center. So I mean that's
 

3679
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,350
but left to center. So I mean that's
kind of where I stand. I believe that

3680
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,360
kind of where I stand. I believe that
 

3681
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,189
kind of where I stand. I believe that
you know don't think you should punish

3682
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:05,199
you know don't think you should punish
 

3683
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:07,189
you know don't think you should punish
people for working hard. I think you

3684
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
people for working hard. I think you
 

3685
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,590
people for working hard. I think you
should incentivize people to work hard.

3686
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
should incentivize people to work hard.
 

3687
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,990
should incentivize people to work hard.
I think over the taxation that you're

3688
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000
I think over the taxation that you're
 

3689
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,270
I think over the taxation that you're
seeing in the UK is absolutely savage.

3690
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,280
seeing in the UK is absolutely savage.
 

3691
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,350
seeing in the UK is absolutely savage.
Right? The I'll talk about me

3692
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:17,360
Right? The I'll talk about me

3696
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:21,760
companies in the UK. I pay myself out of
 

3697
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,790
companies in the UK. I pay myself out of
the UK and I'm a landlord in the UK. I'm

3698
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:24,800
the UK and I'm a landlord in the UK. I'm
 

3699
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,189
the UK and I'm a landlord in the UK. I'm
getting [\h__\h] on every single way

3700
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:27,199
getting [\h__\h] on every single way
 

3701
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,350
getting [\h__\h] on every single way
going. I might as well just stop stop

3702
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:29,360
going. I might as well just stop stop
 

3703
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,510
going. I might as well just stop stop
all work. So what's going to happen?

3704
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,520
all work. So what's going to happen?
 

3705
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,870
all work. So what's going to happen?
Giving you me as an example. I'm going

3706
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:32,880
Giving you me as an example. I'm going
 

3707
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,590
Giving you me as an example. I'm going
to sell up and move everything I have to

3708
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:35,600
to sell up and move everything I have to
 

3709
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,430
to sell up and move everything I have to
a more taxefficient country. So let's

3710
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,440
a more taxefficient country. So let's
 

3711
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,229
a more taxefficient country. So let's
say I move to Texas next year. Well, UK

3712
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:40,239
say I move to Texas next year. Well, UK
 

3713
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,830
say I move to Texas next year. Well, UK
loses everything that I've just done.

3714
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:41,840
loses everything that I've just done.
 

3715
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,590
loses everything that I've just done.
Now multiply that by the millions of

3716
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:43,600
Now multiply that by the millions of
 

3717
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,070
Now multiply that by the millions of
people who will be use leaving the UK

3718
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:46,080
people who will be use leaving the UK
 

3719
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,070
people who will be use leaving the UK
for similar reasons. going to Dubai,

3720
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:48,080
for similar reasons. going to Dubai,
 

3721
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,830
for similar reasons. going to Dubai,
going to Portugal, going to more tax

3722
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:49,840
going to Portugal, going to more tax
 

3723
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,510
going to Portugal, going to more tax
efficient places. What do you then get

3724
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:51,520
efficient places. What do you then get
 

3725
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,510
efficient places. What do you then get
in the UK? Less job creation. People

3726
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:53,520
in the UK? Less job creation. People
 

3727
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,110
in the UK? Less job creation. People
like me employ people, whether that's

3728
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:55,120
like me employ people, whether that's
 

3729
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,189
like me employ people, whether that's
full-time or it's on contract work or

3730
01:26:57,189 --> 01:26:57,199
full-time or it's on contract work or
 

3731
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:00,229
full-time or it's on contract work or
whatever, right? So, less job creation

3732
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:00,239
whatever, right? So, less job creation
 

3733
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,590
whatever, right? So, less job creation
equals what? More people with their

01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,470
you will know, I lost uh two friends to
suicide this year. Um so maybe we do

3850
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:18,480
suicide this year. Um so maybe we do
 

3851
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,390
suicide this year. Um so maybe we do
some Movember stuff. I'd like to do some

3852
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:20,400
some Movember stuff. I'd like to do some
 

3853
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,950
some Movember stuff. I'd like to do some
homeless stuff next year. We figure it

3854
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:22,960
homeless stuff next year. We figure it
 

3855
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,790
homeless stuff next year. We figure it
all out.

3856
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
all out.
 

3857
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,229
all out.
Okay, so reclaiming. So you can see

3858
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:26,239
Okay, so reclaiming. So you can see
 

3859
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:27,990
Okay, so reclaiming. So you can see
we're leaving the gray box. So they trap

3860
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:28,000
we're leaving the gray box. So they trap
 

3861
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,350
we're leaving the gray box. So they trap
shorts. We'll get back to talking about

3862
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:29,360
shorts. We'll get back to talking about
 

3863
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,830
shorts. We'll get back to talking about
the markets. Sorry folks. So we trap

3864
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:31,840
the markets. Sorry folks. So we trap
 

3865
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,550
the markets. Sorry folks. So we trap
shorts. They bid back up value, right?

3866
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
shorts. They bid back up value, right?
 

3867
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,830
shorts. They bid back up value, right?
Trapped shorts under here. They went

3868
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:35,840
Trapped shorts under here. They went
 

3869
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,990
Trapped shorts under here. They went
back into gray box. They did this move

3870
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:38,000
back into gray box. They did this move
 

3871
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,390
back into gray box. They did this move
here I talked about and their target now

3872
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:40,400
here I talked about and their target now
 

3873
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,470
here I talked about and their target now
is previous day value and current day

3874
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
is previous day value and current day
 

3875
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,950
is previous day value and current day
value. So if you're long, these are your

3876
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:44,960
value. So if you're long, these are your
 

3877
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,910
value. So if you're long, these are your
targets. Um just be careful because it's

3878
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:47,920
targets. Um just be careful because it's
 

3879
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,990
targets. Um just be careful because it's
so slow moving. Like this will feel big

3880
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:50,000
so slow moving. Like this will feel big
 

3881
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,910
so slow moving. Like this will feel big
but it's tiny, right? This will feel

3882
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:51,920
but it's tiny, right? This will feel
 

3883
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,709
but it's tiny, right? This will feel
big, but it's like 10 20 points, but

3884
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:54,719
big, but it's like 10 20 points, but
 

3885
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,629
big, but it's like 10 20 points, but
that's it's a very slow day, so this is

3886
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
that's it's a very slow day, so this is
 

3887
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,550
that's it's a very slow day, so this is
what we expect. Here we go. So, you

3888
01:29:58,550 --> 01:29:58,560
what we expect. Here we go. So, you
 

3889
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:12,550
what we expect. Here we go. So, you
might get it now. Really nice.

3890
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:12,560

 

3891
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,149

There you go. So, almost there. Really

3892
01:30:14,149 --> 01:30:14,159
There you go. So, almost there. Really
 

3893
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,750
There you go. So, almost there. Really
good. If any of you took it, congrats.

3894
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:15,760
good. If any of you took it, congrats.
 

3895
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,470
good. If any of you took it, congrats.
We talked about this uh when we were

3896
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
We talked about this uh when we were
 

3897
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,590
We talked about this uh when we were
here. There's the dip. So here's your 30

3898
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:21,600
here. There's the dip. So here's your 30
 

3899
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,470
here. There's the dip. So here's your 30
pointer and I'd be holding runners now.

3900
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:24,480
pointer and I'd be holding runners now.
 

3901
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,750
pointer and I'd be holding runners now.
If you can get through, you need to get

3902
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:25,760
If you can get through, you need to get
 

3903
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,149
If you can get through, you need to get
through this little level here and you'd

3904
01:30:28,149 --> 01:30:28,159
through this little level here and you'd
 

3905
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,709
through this little level here and you'd
be looking at 37s and then highs and if

3906
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
be looking at 37s and then highs and if
 

3907
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,229
be looking at 37s and then highs and if
you get really lucky all the way back up

3908
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:32,239
you get really lucky all the way back up
 

3909
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:35,110
you get really lucky all the way back up
here again. There you go, folks. Off it

3910
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:35,120
here again. There you go, folks. Off it
 

3911
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,830
here again. There you go, folks. Off it
goes. Rotation, rebalance rotation. So

3912
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,840
goes. Rotation, rebalance rotation. So
 

3913
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,910
goes. Rotation, rebalance rotation. So
into value area high from yesterday.

3914
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:39,920
into value area high from yesterday.
 

3915
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,510
into value area high from yesterday.
That's why I said I try and avoid this

3916
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:41,520
That's why I said I try and avoid this
 

3917
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,310
That's why I said I try and avoid this
but called it for you.

3918
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,320
but called it for you.
 

3919
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:48,070
but called it for you.
Nice, nice work. Nice work there, buddy.

3923
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,030
Nice work, Tyson. Yeah. So, just hold
now. See if you can get back through

3924
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:51,040
now. See if you can get back through
 

3925
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,790
now. See if you can get back through
this gray box. If you get acceptance

3926
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
this gray box. If you get acceptance
 

3927
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,669
this gray box. If you get acceptance
over 36s, I'd be looking for all the way

3928
01:30:55,669 --> 01:30:55,679
over 36s, I'd be looking for all the way
 

3929
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,470
over 36s, I'd be looking for all the way
up here. If you can find acceptance over

3930
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:58,480
up here. If you can find acceptance over
 

3931
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,790
up here. If you can find acceptance over
36s, but as long as you protected those

3932
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:00,800
36s, but as long as you protected those
 

3933
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,709
36s, but as long as you protected those
profits,

3934
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:04,719

 

3935
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:06,470

really nice ES about to break out as

3936
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:06,480
really nice ES about to break out as
 

3937
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,070
really nice ES about to break out as
well. You look good. You look really

3938
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,080

3940
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,400
good.
 

3941
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,950
good.
And you'd want them to hold sort of 704

3942
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
And you'd want them to hold sort of 704
 

3943
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,590
And you'd want them to hold sort of 704
705s. really

3944
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:17,600

 

3945
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,910

really nice

3946
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,920
really nice
 

3947
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,510
really nice
really really nice guys. So let's just

3948
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:21,520
really really nice guys. So let's just
 

3949
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,350
really really nice guys. So let's just
see if they can hold 704s 705s. You've

3950
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:25,360
see if they can hold 704s 705s. You've
 

3951
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,629
see if they can hold 704s 705s. You've
just completed the rotation of

3952
01:31:26,629 --> 01:31:26,639
just completed the rotation of
 

3953
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,030
just completed the rotation of
yesterday. Um I still think you've got a

3954
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:29,040
yesterday. Um I still think you've got a
 

3955
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,750
yesterday. Um I still think you've got a
chance to move higher. I'll be honest.

3956
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:31,760
chance to move higher. I'll be honest.
 

3957
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,910
chance to move higher. I'll be honest.
I'd be watching into 30s and then

3958
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:33,920
I'd be watching into 30s and then
 

3959
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,390
I'd be watching into 30s and then
through 30s obviously 50s and through

3960
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:36,400
through 30s obviously 50s and through
 

3961
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,950
through 30s obviously 50s and through
that. Uh maybe if you get lucky up

3962
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:38,960
that. Uh maybe if you get lucky up
 

3963
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,310
that. Uh maybe if you get lucky up
towards the high 700s.

3964
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:42,320
towards the high 700s.
 

3965
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:46,950
towards the high 700s.
As long as you protected in here.

3966
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:46,960

 

3967
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,590

Yeah, this one's very slow to move. Uh

3968
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:49,600
Yeah, this one's very slow to move. Uh
 

3969
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,229
Yeah, this one's very slow to move. Uh
on here I have volume point of control

3970
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:52,239
on here I have volume point of control
 

3971
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:56,709
on here I have volume point of control
down at 682 right now, mate. Down here,

3972
01:31:56,709 --> 01:31:56,719
down at 682 right now, mate. Down here,
 

3973
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,950
down at 682 right now, mate. Down here,
right on Ninja Trader. It's just slower

3974
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:58,960
right on Ninja Trader. It's just slower
 

3975
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,950
right on Ninja Trader. It's just slower
on here to move, but my PC is down here

3976
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:00,960
on here to move, but my PC is down here
 

3977
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,350
on here to move, but my PC is down here
right now.

3978
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:03,360
right now.
 

3979
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,030
right now.
Right. So that was the hold of it and

3980
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:05,040
Right. So that was the hold of it and
 

3981
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,550
Right. So that was the hold of it and
then the rips while the gray box is

3982
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:06,560
then the rips while the gray box is
 

3983
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,070
then the rips while the gray box is
here.

3984
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:08,080
here.
 

3985
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,430
here.
So I'd say you'd want to protect this

3986
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:11,440
So I'd say you'd want to protect this
 

3987
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,110
So I'd say you'd want to protect this
for this move. If they lose this, you

3988
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:13,120
for this move. If they lose this, you
 

3989
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,350
for this move. If they lose this, you
come straight back down in and we're

3990
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:15,360
come straight back down in and we're
 

3991
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,870
come straight back down in and we're
just going to do this rotation here. If

3992
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:16,880
just going to do this rotation here. If
 

3993
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,229
just going to do this rotation here. If
they lose this, you want them to hold a

3994
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:18,239
they lose this, you want them to hold a
 

3995
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:19,910
they lose this, you want them to hold a
bid and do this right now. If you're if

3996
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:19,920
bid and do this right now. If you're if
 

3997
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,110
bid and do this right now. If you're if
you're already long, right? If you're

3998
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:21,120
you're already long, right? If you're
 

3999
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,950
you're already long, right? If you're

4030
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:08,480
of volume. All right. So, all point of
 

4031
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,110

4035
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,030
is traded. Not most buyers, not most
sellers, most volume. Most buyers and

4036
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:15,040
sellers, most volume. Most buyers and
 

4037
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,950
sellers, most volume. Most buyers and
sellers. So, if we when we pause in

01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:18,960
sellers. So, if we when we pause in
 

4039
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,709
sellers. So, if we when we pause in
areas like think about how much time we

4154
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:05,760
compound Apex. If you want to go for the
 

4155
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,990
compound Apex. If you want to go for the
big wins, the big days and sit in a

4156
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:08,000
big wins, the big days and sit in a
 

4157
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,550
big wins, the big days and sit in a
trade set and forget TPT out of those

4158
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:10,560
trade set and forget TPT out of those
 

4159
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,310
trade set and forget TPT out of those
two. Yeah, those two. If you're a newer

4160
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,320
two. Yeah, those two. If you're a newer
 

4161
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,310
two. Yeah, those two. If you're a newer
trader, I would look at Lucid or Funded

4162
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,320
trader, I would look at Lucid or Funded
 

4163
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,110
trader, I would look at Lucid or Funded
Next. I think they're probably the

4164
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:19,120
Next. I think they're probably the
 

4165
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,110
Next. I think they're probably the
easiest to pass and easiest to get paid

4166
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:21,120
easiest to pass and easiest to get paid
 

4167
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,189
easiest to pass and easiest to get paid
from,

4168
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:23,199
from,
 

4169
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:27,189
from,
but maybe not quite as good for scaling.

4170
01:36:27,189 --> 01:36:27,199
but maybe not quite as good for scaling.
 

4171
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,950
but maybe not quite as good for scaling.
No, no, it doesn't, which I didn't

4172
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:28,960
No, no, it doesn't, which I didn't
 

4173
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,430
No, no, it doesn't, which I didn't
realize. Uh, Lucid does not have a

4174
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
realize. Uh, Lucid does not have a
 

4175
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,709
realize. Uh, Lucid does not have a
monthly subscription charge. It's

4176
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:32,719
monthly subscription charge. It's
 

4177
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,950
monthly subscription charge. It's
onetime fee, I believe, on the on the

4178
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:34,960
onetime fee, I believe, on the on the
 

4179
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,629
onetime fee, I believe, on the on the
Flex accounts at least. Is that what

4180
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:36,639
Flex accounts at least. Is that what
 

4181
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:39,030
Flex accounts at least. Is that what
they're called?

4182
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:39,040
they're called?
 

4183
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,910
they're called?
Lucid Flex. That sounds right. On the

4184
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:41,920
Lucid Flex. That sounds right. On the
 

4185
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,350
Lucid Flex. That sounds right. On the
new whatever new accounts they launch,

4186
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:43,360
new whatever new accounts they launch,
 

4187
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:47,990
new whatever new accounts they launch,
there's no monthly charge.

4188
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,000

 

4189
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,149

Okay. So, for me, VPO just moved up here

4190
01:36:50,149 --> 01:36:50,159
Okay. So, for me, VPO just moved up here
 

4191
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:51,669
Okay. So, for me, VPO just moved up here
now.

4192
01:36:51,669 --> 01:36:51,679
now.
 

4193
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:53,750
now.
So, uh we're in control now around these

4194
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:53,760
So, uh we're in control now around these
 

4195
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,149
So, uh we're in control now around these
713s. So, for you buyers, you want price

4196
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:56,159
713s. So, for you buyers, you want price
 

4197
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,790
713s. So, for you buyers, you want price
to get back above 713s, back above 715s

4198
01:36:58,790 --> 01:36:58,800
to get back above 713s, back above 715s
 

4199
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,229
to get back above 713s, back above 715s
and start squeezing for you guys. And

4200
01:37:00,229 --> 01:37:00,239
and start squeezing for you guys. And
 

4201
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:01,510
and start squeezing for you guys. And
then you're going to be good. If you can

4202
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:01,520
then you're going to be good. If you can
 

4203
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,510
then you're going to be good. If you can
get back above here and squeeze up, it

4204
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:03,520
get back above here and squeeze up, it
 

4205
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,870
get back above here and squeeze up, it
would be ideal for you guys.

4206
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:06,880
would be ideal for you guys.
 

4207
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,629
would be ideal for you guys.
You don't want to keep losing. If you

4208
01:37:08,629 --> 01:37:08,639
You don't want to keep losing. If you
 

4209
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,070
You don't want to keep losing. If you
build a shelf here and lose it, it's

4210
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,080
build a shelf here and lose it, it's
 

4211
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:14,149
build a shelf here and lose it, it's
going to get dangerous.

4212
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:14,159

 

4213
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:15,990

We're in rotation. You will watch ES.

4214
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:16,000
We're in rotation. You will watch ES.
 

4215
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:16,870
We're in rotation. You will watch ES.
See if you can get through initial

4216
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:16,880
See if you can get through initial
 

4217
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,390
See if you can get through initial
balance. Here's the squeeze. Really

4218
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:18,400
balance. Here's the squeeze. Really
 

4219
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,990
balance. Here's the squeeze. Really
nice. So, Tyson, hopefully you're still

4220
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:20,000
nice. So, Tyson, hopefully you're still
 

4221
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,590
nice. So, Tyson, hopefully you're still
in this. I think that might have got

4222
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
in this. I think that might have got
 

4223
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,229
in this. I think that might have got
close to your stop. But if we can

4224
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
close to your stop. But if we can
 

4225
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,830
close to your stop. But if we can
squeeze now, you've got these targets

4226
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:25,840
squeeze now, you've got these targets
 

4227
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,390
squeeze now, you've got these targets
above. So, oh, right. I'll be watching

4228
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:28,400
above. So, oh, right. I'll be watching
 

4229
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:32,070
above. So, oh, right. I'll be watching
this, this, and this.

4230
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
this, this, and this.
 

4231
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,790
this, this, and this.
Big ifs may, but you might have been

4232
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800
Big ifs may, but you might have been
 

4233
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,830
Big ifs may, but you might have been
knocked out. I'm not sure.

4234
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:37,840
knocked out. I'm not sure.
 

4235
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,950
knocked out. I'm not sure.
Max payout on Lucid. Uh, oh, before they

4236
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:40,960
Max payout on Lucid. Uh, oh, before they
 

4237
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,390
Max payout on Lucid. Uh, oh, before they
move you live, you mean? I'd have to

4238
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
move you live, you mean? I'd have to
 

4239
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:51,750
move you live, you mean? I'd have to
check. Let me have a look.

4240
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:51,760

 

4241
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,310

Yeah, one time fee on lucid.

4242
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:54,320
Yeah, one time fee on lucid.
 

4243
01:37:54,320 --> 01:38:00,870
Yeah, one time fee on lucid.
I will check.

4244
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:00,880

 

4245
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:15,830

It's trying to do it for you, Tyson.

4246
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:15,840

 

4247
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,189

Don't if their sight's down at the

4248
01:38:17,189 --> 01:38:17,199
Don't if their sight's down at the
 

4249
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:20,229
Don't if their sight's down at the
moment. I can't get it open.

4250
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
moment. I can't get it open.
 

4251
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:23,350
moment. I can't get it open.
Anyone else having that issue?

4252
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:23,360
Anyone else having that issue?
 

4253
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,109
Anyone else having that issue?
There we go. It's open now. Uh let's

4254
01:38:25,109 --> 01:38:25,119
There we go. It's open now. Uh let's
 

4255
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:33,350
There we go. It's open now. Uh let's
have a look.

4256
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:33,360

 

4257
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,830

Isn't ES absorbing above the wick? E ES

4258
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:35,840
Isn't ES absorbing above the wick? E ES
 

4259
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:36,950
Isn't ES absorbing above the wick? E ES
is doing pretty good, but it's got to

4260
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:36,960
is doing pretty good, but it's got to
 

4261
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,870
is doing pretty good, but it's got to
get back above its initial balance high.

4262
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
get back above its initial balance high.
 

4263
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,870
get back above its initial balance high.
So that high that it put in earlier at

4264
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
So that high that it put in earlier at
 

4265
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,870
So that high that it put in earlier at
948 is trying to get back above that.

4266
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:42,880
948 is trying to get back above that.
 

4267
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,709
948 is trying to get back above that.
Right. So at the moment we're still in a

4268
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:44,719
Right. So at the moment we're still in a
 

4269
01:38:44,719 --> 01:39:09,270
Right. So at the moment we're still in a
rotational market.

4270
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280

 

4271
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,149

So payout caps, profit splits after the

4272
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:12,159
So payout caps, profit splits after the
 

4273
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:16,149
So payout caps, profit splits after the
first 10,000. So for a 50k account, it's

4274
01:39:16,149 --> 01:39:16,159
first 10,000. So for a 50k account, it's
 

4275
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,109
first 10,000. So for a 50k account, it's
1 and a half thousand first payouts, I

4276
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:19,119
1 and a half thousand first payouts, I
 

4277
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,870
1 and a half thousand first payouts, I
think. And then 2,000 pay out three and

4278
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:20,880
think. And then 2,000 pay out three and
 

4279
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,189
think. And then 2,000 pay out three and
four and then two and a half, five, and

4280
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:23,199
four and then two and a half, five, and
 

4281
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:25,189
four and then two and a half, five, and
six.

4282
01:39:25,189 --> 01:39:25,199
six.
 

4283
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,950
six.
That's on a Lucid Pro. Let me check the

4284
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:26,960
That's on a Lucid Pro. Let me check the
 

4285
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:32,629
That's on a Lucid Pro. Let me check the
flex.

4286
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:32,639

 

4287
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,350

2,000 on the flex I think on a 50k until

4288
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
2,000 on the flex I think on a 50k until
 

4289
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,310
2,000 on the flex I think on a 50k until
you get to number six and then scale or

4290
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:40,320
you get to number six and then scale or
 

4291
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:44,149
you get to number six and then scale or
live. So kind of like Apex

4292
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:44,159
live. So kind of like Apex
 

4293
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:47,030
live. So kind of like Apex
in terms of like the money,

4294
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,040
in terms of like the money,
 

4295
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,550
in terms of like the money,
but you don't have the consistency

4296
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:48,560
but you don't have the consistency
 

4297
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,550
but you don't have the consistency
rules, right?

4298
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:50,560
rules, right?
 

4299
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:53,510
rules, right?
Yeah. I love TPT, man. I love TPT. I can

4300
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:53,520
Yeah. I love TPT, man. I love TPT. I can
 

4301
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,390
Yeah. I love TPT, man. I love TPT. I can
tell you this this month it's been my uh

4302
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:56,400
tell you this this month it's been my uh
 

4303
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,149
tell you this this month it's been my uh
and I've slowed right down now, but this

4304
01:39:58,149 --> 01:39:58,159
and I've slowed right down now, but this
 

4305
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,550
and I've slowed right down now, but this
month's

4306
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:00,560

4559
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,030
being a trend trader, mate. That's my
favorite trade. Um, it's just that we're

4560
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:37,040
favorite trade. Um, it's just that we're
 

4561
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,470
favorite trade. Um, it's just that we're
not in a trending market right now. Um,

4562
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:40,480
not in a trending market right now. Um,

but that's my favorite trade is a pro,
 

4565
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:44,629
but that's my favorite trade is a pro,
what I call a protrend. So, if the daily

4566
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:44,639
what I call a protrend. So, if the daily
 

4567
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,310
what I call a protrend. So, if the daily
wants to move higher, the hourly wants

4568
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:46,320
wants to move higher, the hourly wants
 

4569
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,629
wants to move higher, the hourly wants
to move higher, for example, I'm looking

4570
01:45:48,629 --> 01:45:48,639
to move higher, for example, I'm looking
 

4571
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:50,709
to move higher, for example, I'm looking
for a pullback on a lower time frame

4572
01:45:50,709 --> 01:45:50,719
for a pullback on a lower time frame
 

4573
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,470
for a pullback on a lower time frame
into a key level to trap lower time

4574
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:52,480
into a key level to trap lower time
 

4575
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:53,910
into a key level to trap lower time
frame traders to then move higher.

4576
01:45:53,910 --> 01:45:53,920
frame traders to then move higher.
 

4577
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:59,830
frame traders to then move higher.
That's my favorite. That's my A+ trade.

4583
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,030
bought 50K trade of eight Apex and I'm
kind of nervous about that. I made 9K on

4584
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:07,040
kind of nervous about that. I made 9K on
 

4585
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,870
kind of nervous about that. I made 9K on
demo yesterday and now it feels so

01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:08,880
demo yesterday and now it feels so
 

4587
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,709

01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:10,719
different. Yeah. Well, that's why you
 

4589
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,270

4591
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,109
need to that's why prop firms are great,

4593
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,590
right? Because demo you've got no
exposure to it at all, but on prop firm

4594
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:17,600
exposure to it at all, but on prop firm
 

4595
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,030
exposure to it at all, but on prop firm
you've got some exposure, but remember

4599
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,830
your exposure is probably between 20 and
50 bucks. It's not a huge amount of

4600
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:23,840
50 bucks. It's not a huge amount of
 

4601
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:27,030
50 bucks. It's not a huge amount of
money. So, just trade it normally,

4602
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:27,040
money. So, just trade it normally,
 

4603
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,550

looks fantastic holding above this new
little level. Okay, watch to see if we

4610
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,000
little level. Okay, watch to see if we

01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:37,440
can find acceptance through this. I
 

4613
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,870
can find acceptance through this. I
think there's a chance to really start

4614
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:38,880
think there's a chance to really start
 

4615
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,550
think there's a chance to really start
getting up into here. Let me just do a

4616
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:40,560
getting up into here. Let me just do a
 

4617
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,790
getting up into here. Let me just do a
projection and see if that times out

4618
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:42,800
projection and see if that times out
 

4619
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,790
projection and see if that times out
with previous day high.

4620
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:46,800

 

4621
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,470

getting into 792s.

4626
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:52,000

Buyers are in control. They came back in

4704
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:38,320
Buyers are in control. They came back in
 

4705
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,910
Buyers are in control. They came back in
control once we reclaimed previous day

4706
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:39,920
control once we reclaimed previous day
 

4707
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,750
control once we reclaimed previous day
value. All right, so they held this dip.

4708
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:41,760
value. All right, so they held this dip.
 

4709

Thing about down here, sellers had the
 

4711
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:45,669
Thing about down here, sellers had the
opportunity is why I was annoyed. I got

4712
01:48:45,669 --> 01:48:45,679
opportunity is why I was annoyed. I got
 

4713
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:47,270
opportunity is why I was annoyed. I got
caught monologuing here because the sell

4714
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:47,280
caught monologuing here because the sell
 

4715
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,669
caught monologuing here because the sell
opportunity was here. Couldn't break the

4716
01:48:49,669 --> 01:48:49,679
opportunity was here. Couldn't break the
 

4717
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:51,109
opportunity was here. Couldn't break the
low. That's where they get stuck. All

4718
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:51,119
low. That's where they get stuck. All
 

4719
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,270
low. That's where they get stuck. All
right, that's the pivot. They held this

4720
01:48:53,270 --> 01:48:53,280
right, that's the pivot. They held this
 

4721
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,189
right, that's the pivot. They held this
and the next chance is here and now

4722
01:48:55,189 --> 01:48:55,199
and the next chance is here and now
 

4723
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:56,709
and the next chance is here and now
you're away. So now it's just holding

4724
01:48:56,709 --> 01:48:56,719
you're away. So now it's just holding
 

4725
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,149
you're away. So now it's just holding
runners looking for the expansion up

4726
01:48:58,149 --> 01:48:58,159
runners looking for the expansion up
 

4727
01:48:58,159 --> 01:49:01,350

We're going to need that. All right. So
 

4733
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,109
We're going to need that. All right. So
here's current value high. I want to see

4734
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:07,119
here's current value high. I want to see
 

4735
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,030
here's current value high. I want to see
you expand Valeria high. Come and rip

4736
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:09,040
you expand Valeria high. Come and rip
 

4737
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,270
you expand Valeria high. Come and rip
these faces through 50s. We should run

4738
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,280
these faces through 50s. We should run
 

4739
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:14,229
these faces through 50s. We should run
the stops. So stops will be at 50s and

4740
01:49:14,229 --> 01:49:14,239
the stops. So stops will be at 50s and
 

4741
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:16,149
the stops. So stops will be at 50s and
the top of this box 60s. All right. So

4742
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:16,159
the top of this box 60s. All right. So
 

4743
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:18,950
the top of this box 60s. All right. So
50s and 60s. And if we run all of those,

4744
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:18,960
50s and 60s. And if we run all of those,
 

4745
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,550
50s and 60s. And if we run all of those,
you I'd be moving my stop up and then

4746
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:20,560
you I'd be moving my stop up and then
 

4747
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,070

4749
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:28,550
hoping you can get up here at that
point. It looks good.

4750
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:28,560

 

4751
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,750

What's your target on ES? Um, well, I'd

4752
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:31,760
What's your target on ES? Um, well, I'd
 

4753
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,350
What's your target on ES? Um, well, I'd
say definitely whole number of 50s

4754
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:33,360
say definitely whole number of 50s
 

4755
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:36,310
say definitely whole number of 50s
coming up. Let's have a look. Yeah, you

4756
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:36,320
coming up. Let's have a look. Yeah, you
 

4757
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,950
coming up. Let's have a look. Yeah, you
have a you have like a a big big level

4758
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:38,960
have a you have like a a big big level
 

4759
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,990
have a you have like a a big big level
at 47 and 50 if you get acceptance into

4760
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:42,000
at 47 and 50 if you get acceptance into
 

4761
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,149
at 47 and 50 if you get acceptance into
that 67. So 47 to 50 is a huge level on

4762
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:48,159
that 67. So 47 to 50 is a huge level on

Uh I would say it depends.

4782
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:25,280
Uh I would say it depends.
 

4783
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,870
Uh I would say it depends.
It depends if we've had the low hanging

4784
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:26,880
It depends if we've had the low hanging
 

4785
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,109
It depends if we've had the low hanging
fruit. Like it'd be an area of interest,

4786
01:50:29,109 --> 01:50:29,119
fruit. Like it'd be an area of interest,
 

4787
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:31,350
fruit. Like it'd be an area of interest,
but you got to understand it depends

4788
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:31,360
but you got to understand it depends
 

4789
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,030

what this market looks like when we get

4790
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:33,040
what this market looks like when we get
 

4791
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,270
what this market looks like when we get
here. So let's say they fail this high

4792
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:35,280
here. So let's say they fail this high
 

4793
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:37,430
here. So let's say they fail this high
and they come down into here. But if

4794
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:37,440
and they come down into here. But if
 

4795
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:38,950
and they come down into here. But if
value is here on the day, you've got to

4796
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
value is here on the day, you've got to
 

4797
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,390
value is here on the day, you've got to
ask yourself why are you bidding at the

4798
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:40,400
ask yourself why are you bidding at the
 

4799
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,990
ask yourself why are you bidding at the
midpoint of the day, right? It's all

4800
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,000
midpoint of the day, right? It's all
 

4801
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,950
midpoint of the day, right? It's all
about context. All right. It's all about

4802
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
about context. All right. It's all about
 

4803

4805
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:52,709

Is it a important level? Possibly. But

4806
01:50:52,709 --> 01:50:52,719
Is it a important level? Possibly. But
 

4807
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:54,629
Is it a important level? Possibly. But
it depends what we've done before we get

4808
01:50:54,629 --> 01:50:54,639
it depends what we've done before we get
 

4809
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:56,229
it depends what we've done before we get
to that level. Have we taken the low

4810
01:50:56,229 --> 01:50:56,239
to that level. Have we taken the low
 

4811
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:57,750
to that level. Have we taken the low
hanging fruit? Is there anything else to

4812
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:57,760
hanging fruit? Is there anything else to
 

4813
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,390
hanging fruit? Is there anything else to
aim for? Has volume died right down? You

4814
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:00,400
aim for? Has volume died right down? You
 

4815
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,390
aim for? Has volume died right down? You
know, are we is does that previous day

point of control becoming the midpoint
 

4819
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,830
point of control becoming the midpoint
of the current day's range? Do you want

4820
01:51:05,830 --> 01:51:05,840
of the current day's range? Do you want
 

4821
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:07,109
of the current day's range? Do you want
to trade that then? Because you're at

4822
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,119
to trade that then? Because you're at
 

4823
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,470
to trade that then? Because you're at
one to one at each side. Do you know

4824
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:08,480
one to one at each side. Do you know
 

4825
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,390
one to one at each side. Do you know
what I mean? Like, so it's context. It

what I mean? Like, so it's context. It
 

4827

what I mean? Like, so it's context. It
really depends.

Hey, we'll just positive mental attitude

4834

Hey, we'll just positive mental attitude
 

4835
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:23,510
Hey, we'll just positive mental attitude
and just trade legit setups. Okay, no

4836
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:23,520
and just trade legit setups. Okay, no
 

4837
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,910
and just trade legit setups. Okay, no

4838
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:25,920

I've somehow been on the wrong side of

4840
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:28,080
I've somehow been on the wrong side of
 

4841
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,070
I've somehow been on the wrong side of
every trade the last two days. So, I'm

4842
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:30,080
every trade the last two days. So, I'm
 

4843
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,350
every trade the last two days. So, I'm
probably just going to wait till the new

4844
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:31,360
probably just going to wait till the new
 

4845
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,470
probably just going to wait till the new
year. I think that's a good idea to just

4846
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:34,480
year. I think that's a good idea to just
 

4847
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,990
year. I think that's a good idea to just
just wait now.

4848
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:38,000
just wait now.
 

4849
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,149
just wait now.

Are you targeting higher trades? 71
 

4853
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:52,229
Are you targeting higher trades? 71
714. You're a little late. Um well, my

714. You're a little late. Um well, my
 

4855
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:54,390
714. You're a little late. Um well, my
target would be up here. If you can get

4856
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:54,400
target would be up here. If you can get
 

4857
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,950
target would be up here. If you can get
up into searching here and it So, my

4858
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:56,960
up into searching here and it So, my
 

4859
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,709
up into searching here and it So, my
target would be depends how many you've

4860
01:51:58,709 --> 01:51:58,719
target would be depends how many you've
 

4861
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,229
target would be depends how many you've
got on. If you've got multiple, I'd be

4862
01:52:00,229 --> 01:52:00,239
got on. If you've got multiple, I'd be
 

4863
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:03,350
got on. If you've got multiple, I'd be
trimming some into 50.

4864
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:03,360
trimming some into 50.
 

4865
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:06,950
trimming some into 50.
What's this? Into 50. Into 60. and then

4866
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:06,960
What's this? Into 50. Into 60. and then
 

4867
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,430
What's this? Into 50. Into 60. and then
into 800. Basically, that would be my

4868
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:09,440
into 800. Basically, that would be my
 

4869
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:12,157
into 800. Basically, that would be my
target if I was you.

4870
01:52:12,157 --> 01:52:12,167
target if I was you.
 

4871

How close would I trail my stop? Uh,

4874
01:52:15,109 --> 01:52:15,119
How close would I trail my stop? Uh,
 

4875
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:16,870
How close would I trail my stop? Uh,
well, I don't know where your entry is.

4876
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:16,880
well, I don't know where your entry is.
 

4877
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,510
well, I don't know where your entry is.
So, it really depends where your entry

4878
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:19,520
So, it really depends where your entry
 

4879
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,550
So, it really depends where your entry
is. Fresh. If you're like Tyson and your

4880
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:22,560
is. Fresh. If you're like Tyson and your
 

4881
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,189
is. Fresh. If you're like Tyson and your
entry is Tyson's long from 80s, all

4882
01:52:25,189 --> 01:52:25,199
entry is Tyson's long from 80s, all
 

4883
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:26,790
entry is Tyson's long from 80s, all
right, then you can probably afford to

4884
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:26,800
right, then you can probably afford to
 

4885
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,709
right, then you can probably afford to
let it pull back if it really wanted to

4886
01:52:28,709 --> 01:52:28,719
let it pull back if it really wanted to
 

4887
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:30,390
let it pull back if it really wanted to
into here. If you're just small size

4888
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:30,400
into here. If you're just small size
 

4889
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,629
into here. If you're just small size
left, all right, you could afford to let

4890
01:52:32,629 --> 01:52:32,639
left, all right, you could afford to let
 

4891
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:34,070
left, all right, you could afford to let
it pull back into this kind of shelf

4892
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:34,080
it pull back into this kind of shelf
 

4893
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,550
it pull back into this kind of shelf
here and look for that. But if it does

4894
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:36,560
here and look for that. But if it does
 

4895
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,149
here and look for that. But if it does
this and it fails, you want to be out.

4896
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:38,159
this and it fails, you want to be out.
 

4897
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:39,430
this and it fails, you want to be out.
You don't want it to come back down and

4898
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:39,440
You don't want it to come back down and
 

4899
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,189
You don't want it to come back down and
retest. But it really depends where

4900
01:52:41,189 --> 01:52:41,199
retest. But it really depends where
 

4901
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:43,189
retest. But it really depends where
you're long from, you know, because if

4902
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:43,199
you're long from, you know, because if
 

4903
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,870
you're long from, you know, because if
you're long from here, [laughter]

4904
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:44,880
you're long from here, [laughter]
 

4905
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,470
you're long from here, [laughter]
you can't you can't be risking down

4906
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:46,480
you can't you can't be risking down
 

4907
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:47,589
you can't you can't be risking down
here. So, I don't know where you're long

4908
01:52:47,589 --> 01:52:47,599
here. So, I don't know where you're long
 

4909
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:52,149
here. So, I don't know where you're long
from. I need context.

4910
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:52,159

 

4911
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,149

Any experience with Borox? I do not.

01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:54,159
Any experience with Borox? I do not.
 

4913
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:56,870
Any experience with Borox? I do not.
I've never traded with them.

01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,750
going to attack these stops now.
And hopefully if there's enough stops up

5070
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:31,760
And hopefully if there's enough stops up
 

5071
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,669
And hopefully if there's enough stops up
here, you'll get a little swipe up,

5072
01:56:33,669 --> 01:56:33,679
here, you'll get a little swipe up,
 

5073
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:35,669
here, you'll get a little swipe up,
which you know, if you're sized on, I

5074
01:56:35,669 --> 01:56:35,679
which you know, if you're sized on, I
 

5075
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:37,109
which you know, if you're sized on, I
would be taking some profit into this

5076
01:56:37,109 --> 01:56:37,119
would be taking some profit into this
 

5077
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:38,950
would be taking some profit into this
move, which is coming right now. So,

5078
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:38,960
move, which is coming right now. So,
 

5079
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,470
move, which is coming right now. So,
here comes current high of day. And then

5080
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:40,480
here comes current high of day. And then
 

5081
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,470
here comes current high of day. And then
the top of the gray box is a pivot from

5082
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:42,480
the top of the gray box is a pivot from
 

5083
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,709
the top of the gray box is a pivot from
yesterday. Okay. So, we know this is an

5084
01:56:44,709 --> 01:56:44,719
yesterday. Okay. So, we know this is an
 

5085
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:46,550
yesterday. Okay. So, we know this is an
area shorts will want to protect. If we

5086
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:46,560
area shorts will want to protect. If we
 

5087
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,070
area shorts will want to protect. If we
get a run through it, then you want to

5088
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,080
get a run through it, then you want to
 

5089
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,589
get a run through it, then you want to
be selling into it. Right. While we talk

5090
01:56:49,589 --> 01:56:49,599
be selling into it. Right. While we talk
 

5091
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:50,629
be selling into it. Right. While we talk
about this, I'm going to use the

5092
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:50,639
about this, I'm going to use the
 

5093
01:56:50,639 --> 01:58:31,109
about this, I'm going to use the
bathroom. Just be smart.

5094
01:58:31,109 --> 01:58:31,119

 

5095
01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:33,589

All right, let's have a look. How's this

5096
01:58:33,589 --> 01:58:33,599
All right, let's have a look. How's this
 

5097
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:35,270
All right, let's have a look. How's this
looking at the highs? Some buyers

5098
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:35,280
looking at the highs? Some buyers
 

5099
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:43,030
looking at the highs? Some buyers
definitely caught there a little bit.

5100
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:43,040

 

5101
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,030

Strong selling coming in here. You

5102
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:45,040
Strong selling coming in here. You
 

5103
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,310
Strong selling coming in here. You
definitely had some buyers caught as

5104
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:46,320
definitely had some buyers caught as
 

5105
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,470
definitely had some buyers caught as
soon as I left there. This transition

5106
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,480
soon as I left there. This transition
 

5107
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:54,550
soon as I left there. This transition
right here.

5108
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:54,560

 

5109
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,149

Yeah.

5110
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159
Yeah.
 

5111
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:58,470
Yeah.
All right. So, you want to watch this.

5112
01:58:58,470 --> 01:58:58,480
All right. So, you want to watch this.
 

5113
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,709
All right. So, you want to watch this.
If they resell this, I'd probably be

5114
01:59:00,709 --> 01:59:00,719
If they resell this, I'd probably be
 

5115
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:02,229
If they resell this, I'd probably be
out. If they reclaim this, you're going

5116
01:59:02,229 --> 01:59:02,239
out. If they reclaim this, you're going
 

5117
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:03,750
out. If they reclaim this, you're going
to be good. That's what I'd be watching

5118
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:03,760
to be good. That's what I'd be watching
 

5119
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,070
to be good. That's what I'd be watching
at.

5120
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:06,080
at.
 

5121
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,589
at.
There is an imbalance all the way down

5122
01:59:07,589 --> 01:59:07,599
There is an imbalance all the way down
 

5123
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:09,430
There is an imbalance all the way down
here as well. So, sellers are starting

5124
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:09,440
here as well. So, sellers are starting
 

5125
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,589
here as well. So, sellers are starting
to come in here. It just all about

5126
01:59:11,589 --> 01:59:11,599
to come in here. It just all about
 

5127
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:13,910
to come in here. It just all about
whether they can rebid. Like I said, I

5128
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:13,920
whether they can rebid. Like I said, I
 

5129
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,149
whether they can rebid. Like I said, I
wouldn't be a new money long up here,

5130
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:16,159
wouldn't be a new money long up here,
 

5131
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:17,669
wouldn't be a new money long up here,
but you can manage your positions. You

5132
01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:17,679
but you can manage your positions. You
 

5133
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:18,950
but you can manage your positions. You
just want some of these shelves to hold

5134
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:18,960
just want some of these shelves to hold
 

5135
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,310
just want some of these shelves to hold
on. And you want to see like a little

5136
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:20,320
on. And you want to see like a little
 

5137
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,709
on. And you want to see like a little
trap and a reclaim.

5138
01:59:22,709 --> 01:59:22,719
trap and a reclaim.
 

5139
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:24,149
trap and a reclaim.
But yeah, I'll be definitely watching

5140
01:59:24,149 --> 01:59:24,159
But yeah, I'll be definitely watching
 

5141
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:27,030
But yeah, I'll be definitely watching
that 45. If you can't get back above 45,

5142
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:27,040
that 45. If you can't get back above 45,
 

5143
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,310
that 45. If you can't get back above 45,
then we're going to leave those buyers

5144
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,320
then we're going to leave those buyers
 

5145
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,229
then we're going to leave those buyers
stuck. I'm still bullish on this overall

5146
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:30,239
stuck. I'm still bullish on this overall
 

5147
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:31,910
stuck. I'm still bullish on this overall
for you guys managing your positions.

5148
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:31,920
for you guys managing your positions.
 

5149
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,830
for you guys managing your positions.
I'd still say there's a chance for this

5150
01:59:33,830 --> 01:59:33,840
I'd still say there's a chance for this
 

5151
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,910
I'd still say there's a chance for this
to move higher, but 45 is absolutely

5152
01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:35,920
to move higher, but 45 is absolutely
 

5153
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,070
to move higher, but 45 is absolutely
key. [snorts]

5154
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:40,080

 

5155
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:43,270

Yeah, exactly, Doie. It's why I'm

5156
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:43,280
Yeah, exactly, Doie. It's why I'm
 

5157
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,510
Yeah, exactly, Doie. It's why I'm
somewhat uninterested. You know, the ATR

5158
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:45,520
somewhat uninterested. You know, the ATR
 

5159
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,950
somewhat uninterested. You know, the ATR
is going to be low on these kind of

5160
01:59:46,950 --> 01:59:46,960
is going to be low on these kind of
 

5161
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:49,830
is going to be low on these kind of
days. And it's the funny thing is it

5162
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:49,840
days. And it's the funny thing is it
 

5163
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,070
days. And it's the funny thing is it
only takes someone who's like, "Fuck, we

5164
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:52,080
only takes someone who's like, "Fuck, we
 

5165

5167
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,669
forgot to reposition this for this

5169
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:58,149
client, right, cuz it's the last day to
do it." To come in and throw like a 500

5175
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:05,030

everything on the book in one go. And

everything on the book in one go. And
 

5177
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:07,038
everything on the book in one go. And
that's that's the other danger, right?

5178
02:00:07,038 --> 02:00:07,048
that's that's the other danger, right?
 

5179
02:00:07,048 --> 02:00:08,149
that's that's the other danger, right?

of an issue here. Right, you can see
 

5211

I hate it when it does this and I can't

I hate it when it does this and I can't
 

5217
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,149
I hate it when it does this and I can't
teach this. Low volume node is starting

5218
02:01:02,149 --> 02:01:02,159
teach this. Low volume node is starting
 

5219
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:04,149
teach this. Low volume node is starting
to be a problem. Buyers need to see

5220
02:01:04,149 --> 02:01:04,159
to be a problem. Buyers need to see
 

5221
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:05,750
to be a problem. Buyers need to see
something like this. If they fail to do

5222
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:05,760
something like this. If they fail to do
 

5223
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:07,830
something like this. If they fail to do
that, you will see a trade back down to

5224
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:07,840
that, you will see a trade back down to
 

5225
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,430
that, you will see a trade back down to
value probably. So, you're starting to

5226
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:09,440
value probably. So, you're starting to
 

5227
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,830
value probably. So, you're starting to
see the shift now in sentiment. You can

5228
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:11,840
see the shift now in sentiment. You can
 

5229
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:18,229
see the shift now in sentiment. You can
see the delta starting to flip here.

5230
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:18,239

 

5231
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:19,750

And you could sort of watch ES. If

5232
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:19,760
And you could sort of watch ES. If
 

5233
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:21,510
And you could sort of watch ES. If
you're trading ES, you'd want that to

5307
02:03:01,119 --> 02:03:02,709
got much time, like people think I I've
only got 30 minutes, I'm going to day

only got 30 minutes, I'm going to day
 

5309
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:04,470
only got 30 minutes, I'm going to day
trade. I would do the opposite. If I've

5310
02:03:04,470 --> 02:03:04,480
trade. I would do the opposite. If I've
 

5311
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:06,390

02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:12,709
swing trading. I'll be looking at
positioning myself long-term.

5316
02:03:12,709 --> 02:03:12,719

 

5317
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:18,229

Yes to which one of those? [laughter]

5318
02:03:18,229 --> 02:03:18,239

 

5319
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:20,790

5321
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:27,510
Thanks, Mr. Grant. Where am I based? Los
Angeles. Based in Los Angeles

5322
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:27,520

 

5323
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,950

every day. I'm not busy now. I'm here 8

5324
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:28,960
every day. I'm not busy now. I'm here 8
 

5325
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:31,430
every day. I'm not busy now. I'm here 8
to 10 hours a day. Okay, great. So, all

5326
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:31,440
to 10 hours a day. Okay, great. So, all
 

5327
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,990
to 10 hours a day. Okay, great. So, all
I'd say is don't focus on the money,

5328
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:34,000
I'd say is don't focus on the money,
 

5329
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,070
I'd say is don't focus on the money,
right? Because if you're new, you need

5330
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:36,080
right? Because if you're new, you need
 

5331
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,790
right? Because if you're new, you need
to clock up your 10,000 hours, right?

5332
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:38,800
to clock up your 10,000 hours, right?
 

5333
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,149
to clock up your 10,000 hours, right?
Same as you would for whatever your

5334
02:03:40,149 --> 02:03:40,159
Same as you would for whatever your
 

5335
02:03:40,159 --> 02:03:41,430
Same as you would for whatever your
other career was. You would have become

5336
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:41,440
other career was. You would have become
 

5337
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,189
other career was. You would have become
an expert in that to have a good

5338
02:03:43,189 --> 02:03:43,199
an expert in that to have a good
 

5339
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:45,990
an expert in that to have a good
company. So, 10,000 hours times on the

5340
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,000
company. So, 10,000 hours times on the
 

5341
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,109
company. So, 10,000 hours times on the
charts. Uh, I would say ES is probably

5342
02:03:49,109 --> 02:03:49,119
charts. Uh, I would say ES is probably
 

5343
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:50,950
charts. Uh, I would say ES is probably
the friendlier option if you're going to

5344
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:50,960
the friendlier option if you're going to
 

5345
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:53,669
the friendlier option if you're going to
trade futures. NQ is more violent, but

5346
02:03:53,669 --> 02:03:53,679
trade futures. NQ is more violent, but
 

5347
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:55,589
trade futures. NQ is more violent, but
more will give you more money. I would

5348
02:03:55,589 --> 02:03:55,599
more will give you more money. I would
 

5349
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:57,350
more will give you more money. I would
say pick one and learn it. Spend three

5350
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:57,360
say pick one and learn it. Spend three
 

5351
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:58,870
say pick one and learn it. Spend three
months on one of those and learn them

5352
02:03:58,870 --> 02:03:58,880
months on one of those and learn them
 

5353
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:00,229
months on one of those and learn them
first.

5354
02:04:00,229 --> 02:04:00,239
first.
 

5355
02:04:00,239 --> 02:04:02,870
first.
Um, also time of day. If you're going to

5356
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:02,880
Um, also time of day. If you're going to
 

5357
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:05,350
Um, also time of day. If you're going to
trade Asia, I'd focus more on gold.

5358
02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:05,360
trade Asia, I'd focus more on gold.
 

5359
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:07,669
trade Asia, I'd focus more on gold.
You're going to trade overnight. Yeah,

5360
02:04:07,669 --> 02:04:07,679
You're going to trade overnight. Yeah,
 

5361

5362
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:09,440

5363
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:11,589
exactly. Use micros. All the stuff I
talk about, use micro. Start on sim.

5364
02:04:11,589 --> 02:04:11,599
talk about, use micro. Start on sim.
 

5365
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:12,790
talk about, use micro. Start on sim.
Start on sim. You've got to learn

5366
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:12,800
Start on sim. You've got to learn
 

5367
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,870
Start on sim. You've got to learn
everything first. Learn the setups.

5368
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:14,880
everything first. Learn the setups.
 

5369
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:16,629
everything first. Learn the setups.
Learn to understand liquidity. Learn to

5370
02:04:16,629 --> 02:04:16,639
Learn to understand liquidity. Learn to

Learn to understand liquidity. Learn to
understand how the market acts, why it

5372
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:18,960
understand how the market acts, why it
 

5373
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,189
understand how the market acts, why it
acts that way. Then start to develop a

5374
02:04:21,189 --> 02:04:21,199
acts that way. Then start to develop a
 

5375
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:22,950
acts that way. Then start to develop a
system. So, focus on one setup at a

5376
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:22,960
system. So, focus on one setup at a
 

5377
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,550
system. So, focus on one setup at a
time. Maybe an opening range break,

5378
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:24,560
time. Maybe an opening range break,
 

5379
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,390
time. Maybe an opening range break,
maybe initial balance trade, maybe a

5380
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:26,400
maybe initial balance trade, maybe a
 

5381
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:29,990
maybe initial balance trade, maybe a
range um mean reversion trade, maybe an

5382
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:30,000
range um mean reversion trade, maybe an
 

5383
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,390
range um mean reversion trade, maybe an
expansion trade. Understand the models

5384
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:32,400
expansion trade. Understand the models
 

5385
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:37,350
expansion trade. Understand the models
and why they work. Start there.

5386
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:37,360

 

5387
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,030

What markets am I trading? ENQ. You're

5388
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:39,040
What markets am I trading? ENQ. You're
 

5389
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:41,990
What markets am I trading? ENQ. You're
watching the ENQ, the NASDAQ. My trading

5390
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:42,000
watching the ENQ, the NASDAQ. My trading
 

5391
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,830
watching the ENQ, the NASDAQ. My trading
next week, I think Monday, Monday,

5392
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:43,840
next week, I think Monday, Monday,
 

5393
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:46,229
next week, I think Monday, Monday,
Tuesday. What did we say? Monday,

5394
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:46,239
Tuesday. What did we say? Monday,
 

5395
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:49,189
Tuesday. What did we say? Monday,
Tuesday next week. Let me check.

5396
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:49,199
Tuesday next week. Let me check.
 

5397
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:52,310
Tuesday next week. Let me check.
Monday the 29th, Tuesday the 30th.

5398
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:52,320
Monday the 29th, Tuesday the 30th.
 

5399
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,310
Monday the 29th, Tuesday the 30th.
Wednesday I'll be off. Thursday I'll be

5400
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:54,320
Wednesday I'll be off. Thursday I'll be
 

5401
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,149
Wednesday I'll be off. Thursday I'll be
off. Likely we'll have a hangover. I'll

5402
02:04:56,149 --> 02:04:56,159
off. Likely we'll have a hangover. I'll
 

5403
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:57,430
off. Likely we'll have a hangover. I'll
think about the second and the third,

5404
02:04:57,430 --> 02:04:57,440
think about the second and the third,
 

5405
02:04:57,440 --> 02:05:01,990
think about the second and the third,
but we'll see. Um I want to like from

5406
02:05:01,990 --> 02:05:02,000
but we'll see. Um I want to like from
 

5407
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,070
but we'll see. Um I want to like from
the fifth we're back at it, guys. Right.

5408
02:05:04,070 --> 02:05:04,080
the fifth we're back at it, guys. Right.
 

5409
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,990
the fifth we're back at it, guys. Right.
So I will probably be here at least a

5410
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,000
So I will probably be here at least a
 

5411
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,750
So I will probably be here at least a
couple days next week, but from the

5412
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:07,760
couple days next week, but from the
 

5413
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,430
couple days next week, but from the
fifth we're back at it. That's when I

5414
02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:09,440
fifth we're back at it. That's when I
 

5415
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:10,709
fifth we're back at it. That's when I
expect volume to come back to the

5416
02:05:10,709 --> 02:05:10,719
expect volume to come back to the
 

5417
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:14,629
expect volume to come back to the
market.

5418
02:05:14,629 --> 02:05:14,639

 

5419
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:19,270

I have four funded Apex funded 150K

5420
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:19,280
I have four funded Apex funded 150K
 

5421
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:20,870
I have four funded Apex funded 150K
right now. They are slightly in draw

5422
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:20,880
right now. They are slightly in draw
 

5423
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,390
right now. They are slightly in draw
down. I'm getting chopped up. I was

5424
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:22,400
down. I'm getting chopped up. I was
 

5425
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:23,990
down. I'm getting chopped up. I was
doing well the past month, but the last

5426
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:24,000
doing well the past month, but the last
 

5427
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,589
doing well the past month, but the last
few days have been rough. Feel like I

5428
02:05:25,589 --> 02:05:25,599
few days have been rough. Feel like I
 

5429
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:26,950
few days have been rough. Feel like I
can't get in the sync with the market.

5430
02:05:26,950 --> 02:05:26,960
can't get in the sync with the market.
 

5431
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,709
can't get in the sync with the market.
Well, Breezy, if it's the last few days,

5432
02:05:28,709 --> 02:05:28,719
Well, Breezy, if it's the last few days,
 

5433
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:30,229
Well, Breezy, if it's the last few days,
I'd say it's probably because we've gone

5434
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:30,239
I'd say it's probably because we've gone
 

5435
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:32,310
I'd say it's probably because we've gone
into

5436
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:32,320
into
 

5437
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:36,310
into
Let me show you. This is why uh it's a

5438
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:36,320
Let me show you. This is why uh it's a
 

5439
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:39,990
Let me show you. This is why uh it's a
good hold here. This is if we reclaim

5440
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:40,000
good hold here. This is if we reclaim
 

5441
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,589
good hold here. This is if we reclaim
this is where shorts will need to defend

5442
02:05:41,589 --> 02:05:41,599
this is where shorts will need to defend
 

5443
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:43,750
this is where shorts will need to defend
42s. If we reclaim this, those guys who

5444
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:43,760
42s. If we reclaim this, those guys who
 

5445
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:45,189
42s. If we reclaim this, those guys who
are already long from down here, you'll

5446
02:05:45,189 --> 02:05:45,199
are already long from down here, you'll
 

5447
02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:47,189
are already long from down here, you'll
get your squeeze. If we fail in here,

5448
02:05:47,189 --> 02:05:47,199
get your squeeze. If we fail in here,
 

5449
02:05:47,199 --> 02:05:49,830
get your squeeze. If we fail in here,
they will collapse this. All right. The

5450
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:49,840
they will collapse this. All right. The
 

5451
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:52,149
they will collapse this. All right. The
reason you're struggling this month or

5452
02:05:52,149 --> 02:05:52,159
reason you're struggling this month or
 

5453
02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:54,950
reason you're struggling this month or
this week, sorry, versus the last few

5454
02:05:54,950 --> 02:05:54,960
this week, sorry, versus the last few
 

5455
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,189
this week, sorry, versus the last few
weeks, is the higher time frame. All

5456
02:05:57,189 --> 02:05:57,199
weeks, is the higher time frame. All
 

5457
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:58,550
weeks, is the higher time frame. All
right, let me pull this up so you can

5458
02:05:58,550 --> 02:05:58,560
right, let me pull this up so you can
 

5459
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,550
right, let me pull this up so you can
hear me properly. All right, it is the

5460
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:00,560
hear me properly. All right, it is the
 

5461
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:02,709
hear me properly. All right, it is the
higher time frame. If we zoom out, all

5462
02:06:02,709 --> 02:06:02,719
higher time frame. If we zoom out, all
 

5463
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:04,950
higher time frame. If we zoom out, all
right, and think about what we had for

5464
02:06:04,950 --> 02:06:04,960
right, and think about what we had for
 

5465
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,189
right, and think about what we had for
two weeks, we're in imbalance in a

5466
02:06:07,189 --> 02:06:07,199
two weeks, we're in imbalance in a
 

5467
02:06:07,199 --> 02:06:09,109
two weeks, we're in imbalance in a
balanced range, right? So, I didn't make

5468
02:06:09,109 --> 02:06:09,119
balanced range, right? So, I didn't make
 

5469
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:11,589
balanced range, right? So, I didn't make
very much money in here for two weeks.

5470
02:06:11,589 --> 02:06:11,599
very much money in here for two weeks.
 

5471
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:13,910
very much money in here for two weeks.
All right, we left that balance. So,

5472
02:06:13,910 --> 02:06:13,920
All right, we left that balance. So,
 

5473
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:16,390
All right, we left that balance. So,
someone asked me about like trend

5474
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:16,400
someone asked me about like trend
 

5475
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:18,310
someone asked me about like trend
trading or protren. Once we left that, I

5476
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:18,320
trading or protren. Once we left that, I
 

5477
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:19,910
trading or protren. Once we left that, I
was short and I was short with size

5478
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:19,920
was short and I was short with size
 

5479
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,830
was short and I was short with size
here. We pulled back in, I was short

5480
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:21,840
here. We pulled back in, I was short
 

5481
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,990
here. We pulled back in, I was short
with size here. We pulled back in, I was

5482
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:24,000
with size here. We pulled back in, I was
 

5483
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,669
with size here. We pulled back in, I was
short with size here. All right, so

5484
02:06:25,669 --> 02:06:25,679
short with size here. All right, so
 

5485
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:29,109
short with size here. All right, so
three big winning sessions, right?

5486
02:06:29,109 --> 02:06:29,119
three big winning sessions, right?
 

5487
02:06:29,119 --> 02:06:31,030
three big winning sessions, right?
Because we went protrend, leaving them

5488
02:06:31,030 --> 02:06:31,040
Because we went protrend, leaving them
 

5489
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:34,310
Because we went protrend, leaving them
trapped. Once we got down here, this was

5490
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:34,320
trapped. Once we got down here, this was
 

5491
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,229
trapped. Once we got down here, this was
our target of the weekly newsletter,

5492
02:06:36,229 --> 02:06:36,239
our target of the weekly newsletter,
 

5493
02:06:36,239 --> 02:06:38,950
our target of the weekly newsletter,
which I sent out. It was a naked naked

5494
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:38,960
which I sent out. It was a naked naked
 

5495
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,270
which I sent out. It was a naked naked
point of control on a weekly chart,

5496
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:41,280
point of control on a weekly chart,
 

5497
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,189
point of control on a weekly chart,
right? Once we drifted under that, we

5498
02:06:43,189 --> 02:06:43,199
right? Once we drifted under that, we
 

5499
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:45,589
right? Once we drifted under that, we
reclaimed it

5500
02:06:45,589 --> 02:06:45,599
reclaimed it
 

5501
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:47,830
reclaimed it
and we expect what? All right, if this

5502
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:47,840
and we expect what? All right, if this
 

5503
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:51,830
and we expect what? All right, if this
is how the chart looks, if we've broken

5504
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:51,840
is how the chart looks, if we've broken
 

5505
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,350
is how the chart looks, if we've broken
under this, what do we expect? At least

5506
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:53,360
under this, what do we expect? At least
 

5507
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:55,109
under this, what do we expect? At least
a pullback. All right, so we were long

5508
02:06:55,109 --> 02:06:55,119
a pullback. All right, so we were long
 

5509
02:06:55,119 --> 02:06:57,189
a pullback. All right, so we were long
bias from here. Now, look at the

5510
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:57,199
bias from here. Now, look at the
 

5511
02:06:57,199 --> 02:06:58,629
bias from here. Now, look at the
difference in the range. Look how much

5512
02:06:58,629 --> 02:06:58,639
difference in the range. Look how much
 

5513
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:00,950
difference in the range. Look how much
range we've got to play with here. So,

5514
02:07:00,950 --> 02:07:00,960
range we've got to play with here. So,
 

5515
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,550
range we've got to play with here. So,
we're long biased up here. Lots of

5516
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:02,560
we're long biased up here. Lots of
 

5517
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,069
we're long biased up here. Lots of
people wanted to get short here. And I

5518
02:07:04,069 --> 02:07:04,079
people wanted to get short here. And I
 

5519
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:07,109
people wanted to get short here. And I
said, be very, very careful now because

5520
02:07:07,109 --> 02:07:07,119
said, be very, very careful now because
 

5521
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:10,709
said, be very, very careful now because
we've done one, two, three. Bulls can

5522
02:07:10,709 --> 02:07:10,719
we've done one, two, three. Bulls can
 

5523
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:12,149
we've done one, two, three. Bulls can
trap here. But we've hit the target.

5524
02:07:12,149 --> 02:07:12,159
trap here. But we've hit the target.
 

5525
02:07:12,159 --> 02:07:13,669
trap here. But we've hit the target.

kind of market was we were in. In here,
 

5553
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:48,629

we know we're going to be choppy right
 

5555
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:50,310
we know we're going to be choppy right
now. We are between the two. Have we

5556
02:07:50,310 --> 02:07:50,320
now. We are between the two. Have we
 

5557
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,069
now. We are between the two. Have we
tested this this week? No. So, there's

5558
02:07:52,069 --> 02:07:52,079
tested this this week? No. So, there's
 

5559
02:07:52,079 --> 02:07:54,709
tested this this week? No. So, there's
been no weekly buyers able to take this

5560
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:54,719
been no weekly buyers able to take this
 

5561

buyers looking for that trade up. And
 

5573
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,030
buyers looking for that trade up. And
have we done anything else other than

02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,040
have we done anything else other than
 

5575
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,030

02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:15,199
holiday week. So, this is why you're
 

5581
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:16,390
holiday week. So, this is why you're
struggling this week because the

5582
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:16,400
struggling this week because the
 

5583
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:19,510

02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:23,280
counter trend pullback. They're
 

5589
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:25,350
counter trend pullback. They're
liquidity build on a on a week where

5590
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:25,360
liquidity build on a on a week where
 

5591
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:26,950
liquidity build on a on a week where
we're going to have very low liquidity.

5592
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:26,960
we're going to have very low liquidity.
 

5593
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,870
we're going to have very low liquidity.
All right? So, the conditions are

All right? So, the conditions are
 

5595
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:30,709
All right? So, the conditions are

02:09:54,079 --> 02:09:55,990
aggressive shorts. They didn't get the
breakdown underneath the last low. So

5678
02:09:55,990 --> 02:09:56,000
breakdown underneath the last low. So
 

5679
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,229
breakdown underneath the last low. So
they are now caught any pullback which

5680
02:09:58,229 --> 02:09:58,239
they are now caught any pullback which
 

5681
02:09:58,239 --> 02:10:00,310
they are now caught any pullback which
ho hold holds around here if they hold

5682
02:10:00,310 --> 02:10:00,320
ho hold holds around here if they hold
 

5683
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:03,270
ho hold holds around here if they hold
it I expect a new higher day

5684
02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:03,280
it I expect a new higher day
 

5685
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:04,310
it I expect a new higher day
right so we get back to that

5686
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:04,320
right so we get back to that
 

5687
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:05,990
right so we get back to that
conversation

5688
02:10:05,990 --> 02:10:06,000
conversation
 

5689
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,510
conversation
so

5690
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:07,520
so
 

5691
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:10,550
so
I just draw this out for you if longs

5692
02:10:10,550 --> 02:10:10,560
I just draw this out for you if longs
 

5693
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,629
I just draw this out for you if longs
hold this I expect a new high of day if

5694
02:10:12,629 --> 02:10:12,639
hold this I expect a new high of day if
 

5695
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:13,910
hold this I expect a new high of day if
you come under this you're going to get

5696
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:13,920
you come under this you're going to get
 

5697
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:15,990
you come under this you're going to get
the rotation so I'd be bullish on the

5698
02:10:15,990 --> 02:10:16,000
the rotation so I'd be bullish on the
 

5699
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,430
the rotation so I'd be bullish on the
hold of this okay so yes understand what

5700
02:10:19,430 --> 02:10:19,440
hold of this okay so yes understand what
 

5701
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:21,589
hold of this okay so yes understand what
trade setup is your favorite setup then

5702
02:10:21,589 --> 02:10:21,599
trade setup is your favorite setup then
 

5703
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:23,350
trade setup is your favorite setup then
understand what conditions are

5704
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:23,360
understand what conditions are
 

5705
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,910
understand what conditions are
preferable for that setup and focus on

5706
02:10:25,910 --> 02:10:25,920
preferable for that setup and focus on
 

5707
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:28,149
preferable for that setup and focus on
that setup in those conditions. Do not

5708
02:10:28,149 --> 02:10:28,159
that setup in those conditions. Do not
 

5709
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:31,270
that setup in those conditions. Do not
focus on those that set up in subpar

5710
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:31,280
focus on those that set up in subpar
 

5711
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:32,950
focus on those that set up in subpar
conditions. Where people get stuck is

5712
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:32,960
conditions. Where people get stuck is
 

5713
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:35,830
conditions. Where people get stuck is
they look for things like

5714
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:35,840
they look for things like
 

5715
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,990
they look for things like
I don't know like a breakout trade in a

5716
02:10:37,990 --> 02:10:38,000
I don't know like a breakout trade in a
 

5717
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,149
I don't know like a breakout trade in a
ranging market. A ranging market is not

5718
02:10:40,149 --> 02:10:40,159
ranging market. A ranging market is not
 

5719
02:10:40,159 --> 02:10:41,430
ranging market. A ranging market is not
going to give you a breakout trade,

5720
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:41,440
going to give you a breakout trade,
 

5721
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:42,870
going to give you a breakout trade,
right? A ranging market is going to give

5722
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:42,880
right? A ranging market is going to give
 

5723
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,430
right? A ranging market is going to give
you a failed breakout.

5724
02:10:45,430 --> 02:10:45,440
you a failed breakout.
 

5725
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:47,109
you a failed breakout.
All right? So, if you're a trend trader,

5726
02:10:47,109 --> 02:10:47,119
All right? So, if you're a trend trader,
 

5727
02:10:47,119 --> 02:10:50,069
All right? So, if you're a trend trader,
let's just come up here a second.

5728
02:10:50,069 --> 02:10:50,079
let's just come up here a second.
 

5729
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:52,709
let's just come up here a second.
All right. If we've done this and we've

5730
02:10:52,709 --> 02:10:52,719
All right. If we've done this and we've
 

5731
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:55,189
All right. If we've done this and we've
created a range,

5732
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199
created a range,
 

5733
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:57,109
created a range,
all right, if you try and take this

5734
02:10:57,109 --> 02:10:57,119
all right, if you try and take this
 

5735
02:10:57,119 --> 02:10:59,030
all right, if you try and take this
breakout, it's very likely that it's

5736
02:10:59,030 --> 02:10:59,040
breakout, it's very likely that it's
 

5737
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,470
breakout, it's very likely that it's
going to come back into the range. If

5738
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:00,480
going to come back into the range. If
 

5739
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,669
going to come back into the range. If
you try and take this breakout, it's

5740
02:11:01,669 --> 02:11:01,679
you try and take this breakout, it's
 

5741
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:03,030
you try and take this breakout, it's
very likely it's going to come back into

5742
02:11:03,030 --> 02:11:03,040
very likely it's going to come back into
 

5743
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,030
very likely it's going to come back into
the range. These are going to be failed

5744
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,040
the range. These are going to be failed
 

5745
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:06,709
the range. These are going to be failed
breakouts. All right? If you just look

5746
02:11:06,709 --> 02:11:06,719
breakouts. All right? If you just look
 

5747
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:09,510
breakouts. All right? If you just look
at WOFF, this is what we do. You want to

5748
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:09,520
at WOFF, this is what we do. You want to
 

5749
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:11,750
at WOFF, this is what we do. You want to
wait for an acceleration out of it and a

5750
02:11:11,750 --> 02:11:11,760
wait for an acceleration out of it and a
 

5751
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,510
wait for an acceleration out of it and a
pullback and a hold when we're leaving a

5752
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:13,520
pullback and a hold when we're leaving a
 

5753
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,669
pullback and a hold when we're leaving a
ranging market. Right? When we're in a

5754
02:11:15,669 --> 02:11:15,679
ranging market. Right? When we're in a
 

5755
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:17,990
ranging market. Right? When we're in a
trending market,

5756
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:18,000
trending market,
 

5757
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,430
trending market,
we're in a strong trending market and

5758
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:19,440
we're in a strong trending market and
 

5759
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,270
we're in a strong trending market and
you're early in the trend, pull back one

5760
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:21,280
you're early in the trend, pull back one
 

5761
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:23,350
you're early in the trend, pull back one
or pull back two, right? If you're not

5762
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:23,360
or pull back two, right? If you're not
 

5763
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,430
or pull back two, right? If you're not
going to trade longs from here, then you

5764
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:25,440
going to trade longs from here, then you
 

5765
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:26,870
going to trade longs from here, then you
can take a breakout here. It's much

5766
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:26,880
can take a breakout here. It's much
 

5767
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:28,629
can take a breakout here. It's much
safer to do. I wouldn't be doing it on

5768
02:11:28,629 --> 02:11:28,639
safer to do. I wouldn't be doing it on
 

5769
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:32,870
safer to do. I wouldn't be doing it on
the third leg, right? Leg one and two.

5770
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:32,880
the third leg, right? Leg one and two.
 

5771
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:34,229
the third leg, right? Leg one and two.
So, that's a prime example of

5772
02:11:34,229 --> 02:11:34,239
So, that's a prime example of
 

5773
02:11:34,239 --> 02:11:35,990
So, that's a prime example of
understanding the conditions of the

5774
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:36,000
understanding the conditions of the
 

5775
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:45,350
understanding the conditions of the
market and what you're looking for.

5776
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:45,360

 

5777
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,430

joining.
Higher time frame is key. Look at uh the

5784
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:54,960
Higher time frame is key. Look at uh the
 

5785
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,950
Higher time frame is key. Look at uh the
4K with ES reversed. It's like cheating.

5786
02:11:58,950 --> 02:11:58,960
4K with ES reversed. It's like cheating.
 

5787
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:01,589
4K with ES reversed. It's like cheating.
I was long on the ES for three days from

5788
02:12:01,589 --> 02:12:01,599
I was long on the ES for three days from
 

5789
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:05,990
I was long on the ES for three days from
6775. There you go.

5790
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,000
6775. There you go.
 

5791
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,910
6775. There you go.
Exactly. That's why strategies don't

5792
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:07,920
Exactly. That's why strategies don't
 

5793
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,669
Exactly. That's why strategies don't
work in every situation. That's why as

5794
02:12:09,669 --> 02:12:09,679
work in every situation. That's why as
 

5795
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:12,310
work in every situation. That's why as
you get better as a trader, you will

5796
02:12:12,310 --> 02:12:12,320
you get better as a trader, you will
 

5797
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:15,350
you get better as a trader, you will
start sorry, you will start developing a

5798
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:15,360
start sorry, you will start developing a
 

5799
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:17,030
start sorry, you will start developing a
playbook that works for each strategy.

5800
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:17,040
playbook that works for each strategy.
 

5801
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:19,589
playbook that works for each strategy.
So, as you become more proficient, for

5802
02:12:19,589 --> 02:12:19,599
So, as you become more proficient, for
 

5803
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:21,990
So, as you become more proficient, for
me, I'd say the easiest trade is a is a

5804
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:22,000
me, I'd say the easiest trade is a is a
 

5805
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,550
me, I'd say the easiest trade is a is a
trend trade, protrend, right? So, if

5806
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:24,560
trend trade, protrend, right? So, if
 

5807
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,470
trend trade, protrend, right? So, if
we're bullish, higher time frame, making

5808
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:26,480
we're bullish, higher time frame, making
 

5809
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,069
we're bullish, higher time frame, making
higher highs and higher lows on weekly,

5810
02:12:28,069 --> 02:12:28,079
higher highs and higher lows on weekly,
 

5811
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:30,069
higher highs and higher lows on weekly,
monthly, weekly, dailies, right? Then

5812
02:12:30,069 --> 02:12:30,079
monthly, weekly, dailies, right? Then
 

5813
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:31,109
monthly, weekly, dailies, right? Then
you're looking for a pullback on an

5814
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:31,119
you're looking for a pullback on an
 

5815
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:34,069
you're looking for a pullback on an
hourly to get long into. Simple, right?

5816
02:12:34,069 --> 02:12:34,079
hourly to get long into. Simple, right?
 

5817
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:35,510
hourly to get long into. Simple, right?
It's the first trade I would I would

5818
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:35,520
It's the first trade I would I would
 

5819
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,830
It's the first trade I would I would
advise. Once you get good at that, then

5820
02:12:37,830 --> 02:12:37,840
advise. Once you get good at that, then
 

5821
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,589
advise. Once you get good at that, then
maybe you can think about a range trade,

5822
02:12:39,589 --> 02:12:39,599
maybe you can think about a range trade,
 

5823
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:41,350
maybe you can think about a range trade,
right? I still hate range trades. I will

5824
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:41,360
right? I still hate range trades. I will
 

5825
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:43,109
right? I still hate range trades. I will
take them when there's enough space in

5826
02:12:43,109 --> 02:12:43,119
take them when there's enough space in
 

5827
02:12:43,119 --> 02:12:44,470
take them when there's enough space in
the range, but I don't like them. Maybe

5828
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:44,480
the range, but I don't like them. Maybe
 

5829
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:46,069
the range, but I don't like them. Maybe
then you can take the range trade. Maybe

5830
02:12:46,069 --> 02:12:46,079
then you can take the range trade. Maybe
 

5831
02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:47,990
then you can take the range trade. Maybe
then you can look at a breakout trade to

5832
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
then you can look at a breakout trade to
 

5833
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,310
then you can look at a breakout trade to
move away from value. You can look at

5834
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:50,320
move away from value. You can look at
 

5835
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:52,470
move away from value. You can look at
that. Maybe then you can look at things

5836
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:52,480
that. Maybe then you can look at things
 

5837
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:53,750
that. Maybe then you can look at things
like if you want to get aggressive at

5838
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:53,760
like if you want to get aggressive at
 

5839
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:55,830
like if you want to get aggressive at
the open like a 30 second opening range

5840
02:12:55,830 --> 02:12:55,840
the open like a 30 second opening range
 

5841
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:57,589
the open like a 30 second opening range
break, things like that. You can start

5842
02:12:57,589 --> 02:12:57,599
break, things like that. You can start
 

5843
02:12:57,599 --> 02:12:59,830
break, things like that. You can start
adding playbook, right? Think about any

5844
02:12:59,830 --> 02:12:59,840
adding playbook, right? Think about any
 

5845
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,830
adding playbook, right? Think about any
skill that you add. Think of train

5846
02:13:01,830 --> 02:13:01,840
skill that you add. Think of train
 

5847
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:05,990
skill that you add. Think of train
trading like a sport. You go and play,

5848
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:06,000
trading like a sport. You go and play,
 

5849
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,629
trading like a sport. You go and play,
I don't know, tennis for the first time.

5850
02:13:08,629 --> 02:13:08,639
I don't know, tennis for the first time.
 

5851
02:13:08,639 --> 02:13:10,550
I don't know, tennis for the first time.
You learn to just rally, right? Just hit

5852
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:10,560
You learn to just rally, right? Just hit
 

5853
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:12,229
You learn to just rally, right? Just hit
the ball over the net. Get good at just

5854
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:12,239
the ball over the net. Get good at just
 

5855
02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:13,750
the ball over the net. Get good at just
hitting the ball over the net. Then

5856
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:13,760
hitting the ball over the net. Then
 

5857
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:15,990
hitting the ball over the net. Then
maybe you develop a top spin. And then

5858
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,000
maybe you develop a top spin. And then
 

5859
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,910
maybe you develop a top spin. And then
maybe you develop a back a backhand top

5860
02:13:17,910 --> 02:13:17,920
maybe you develop a back a backhand top
 

5861
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:19,750
maybe you develop a back a backhand top
spin similar to the front hand top spin

5862
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:19,760
spin similar to the front hand top spin
 

5863
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:21,510
spin similar to the front hand top spin
but with your backhand. That could be

5864
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:21,520
but with your backhand. That could be
 

5865
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:23,510
but with your backhand. That could be
like your pull back long, pull back

5866
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:23,520
like your pull back long, pull back
 

5867
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,669
like your pull back long, pull back
short. Then you develop a slice backhand

5868
02:13:25,669 --> 02:13:25,679
short. Then you develop a slice backhand
 

5869
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:28,229
short. Then you develop a slice backhand
slice. That could be like, I don't know,

5870
02:13:28,229 --> 02:13:28,239
slice. That could be like, I don't know,
 

5871
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:31,030
slice. That could be like, I don't know,
your failed breakout or your mean

5872
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:31,040
your failed breakout or your mean
 

5873
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:32,790
your failed breakout or your mean
reversion short or your failure short.

5874
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:32,800
reversion short or your failure short.
 

5875
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,790
reversion short or your failure short.
And then you develop a slice on the

5876
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:34,800
And then you develop a slice on the
 

5877
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,629
And then you develop a slice on the
forehand. Then you develop your serve.

5878
02:13:36,629 --> 02:13:36,639
forehand. Then you develop your serve.
 

5879
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:39,669
forehand. Then you develop your serve.
Maybe your serves, your A+ trade when

5880
02:13:39,669 --> 02:13:39,679
Maybe your serves, your A+ trade when
 

5881
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:41,109
Maybe your serves, your A+ trade when
you know everything's going well. You're

5882
02:13:41,109 --> 02:13:41,119
you know everything's going well. You're
 

5883
02:13:41,119 --> 02:13:42,629
you know everything's going well. You're
looking for that big serve, right? Where

5884
02:13:42,629 --> 02:13:42,639
looking for that big serve, right? Where
 

5885
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:45,430
looking for that big serve, right? Where
you size in. It's like that, guys. You

5886
02:13:45,430 --> 02:13:45,440
you size in. It's like that, guys. You
 

5887
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:47,990
you size in. It's like that, guys. You
develop your playbook slowly over time.

5888
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,000
develop your playbook slowly over time.
 

5889
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:58,310
develop your playbook slowly over time.
You don't do it all at once.

5890
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:58,320

I was kind of rushing the market the

5950
02:15:04,310 --> 02:15:04,320
I was kind of rushing the market the
 

5951
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,149
I was kind of rushing the market the
last few days just trying to go small

5952
02:15:06,149 --> 02:15:06,159
last few days just trying to go small
 

5953
02:15:06,159 --> 02:15:08,629
last few days just trying to go small
base hits across multiple counts and one

5954
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639
base hits across multiple counts and one
 

5955
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:11,030
base hits across multiple counts and one
at once and just think it was a bad

5956
02:15:11,030 --> 02:15:11,040
at once and just think it was a bad
 

5957
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:13,750
at once and just think it was a bad
choice in hindsight trying to rush.

5958
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:13,760
choice in hindsight trying to rush.
 

5959
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:16,790
choice in hindsight trying to rush.
Yeah, definitely. No, there's ne

5965
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,470
been here a long time. There's never a
reason to rush. Never, ever, ever. You

5966
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:22,480
reason to rush. Never, ever, ever. You
 

5967
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:25,109
reason to rush. Never, ever, ever. You
you will see me miss trades on stream.

5968
02:15:25,109 --> 02:15:25,119
you will see me miss trades on stream.
 

5969
02:15:25,119 --> 02:15:27,510
you will see me miss trades on stream.
Most days I will miss trades on stream.

5970
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:27,520
Most days I will miss trades on stream.
 

5971
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:28,870
Most days I will miss trades on stream.
I'll be waiting to be picked up. it

What you won't get me doing is rushing

5978
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:34,400
What you won't get me doing is rushing
 

5979
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,030
What you won't get me doing is rushing
in afterwards. All right? Because I know

5980
02:15:37,030 --> 02:15:37,040
in afterwards. All right? Because I know
 

5981
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:38,629
in afterwards. All right? Because I know
whether it's that session, the next

5982
02:15:38,629 --> 02:15:38,639
whether it's that session, the next
 

5983
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:40,310
whether it's that session, the next
session, the next day, the next week,

5984
02:15:40,310 --> 02:15:40,320
session, the next day, the next week,
 

5985
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:42,390
session, the next day, the next week,
the next month, the market's going to

5986
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:42,400
the next month, the market's going to
 

5987
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:43,990
the next month, the market's going to
give you opportunities. It's just about

5988
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:44,000
give you opportunities. It's just about
 

5989
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,350
give you opportunities. It's just about
being here for it. You never need to

5990
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:45,360
being here for it. You never need to
 

5991
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,430
being here for it. You never need to
chase it. It will come back to you. It

5992
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:47,440
chase it. It will come back to you. It
 

5993
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:48,950
chase it. It will come back to you. It
will come back to you. What about

5994
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:48,960
will come back to you. What about
 

5995
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,910
will come back to you. What about
reversals? Yeah, you can trade reversals

5996
02:15:51,910 --> 02:15:51,920
reversals? Yeah, you can trade reversals
 

5997
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:53,270
reversals? Yeah, you can trade reversals
if that's part of your bread and butter.

5998
02:15:53,270 --> 02:15:53,280
if that's part of your bread and butter.
 

5999
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:56,149
if that's part of your bread and butter.
Trade reversals. Just don't be the wrong

6000
02:15:56,149 --> 02:15:56,159
Trade reversals. Just don't be the wrong
 

6001
02:15:56,159 --> 02:15:58,550
Trade reversals. Just don't be the wrong
side of it. Don't be fighting a big

6002
02:15:58,550 --> 02:15:58,560
side of it. Don't be fighting a big
 

6003
02:15:58,560 --> 02:15:59,990
side of it. Don't be fighting a big
trend day. So many people look for

6004
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:00,000
trend day. So many people look for
 

6005
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,589
trend day. So many people look for
shorts on big trend days. It's where I

6006
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599
shorts on big trend days. It's where I
 

6007
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:03,830
shorts on big trend days. It's where I
see most people fail.

6008
02:16:03,830 --> 02:16:03,840
see most people fail.
 

6009
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:07,109
see most people fail.
If I was having a trend day, let's say

6010
02:16:07,109 --> 02:16:07,119
If I was having a trend day, let's say
 

6011
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:10,870
If I was having a trend day, let's say
now, ignore all the levels. All right.

6012
02:16:10,870 --> 02:16:10,880
now, ignore all the levels. All right.
 

6013
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:13,270
now, ignore all the levels. All right.
What would I look for? If I would look

6014
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:13,280
What would I look for? If I would look
 

6015
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:16,390
What would I look for? If I would look
for taking out some liquidity, trapping

6016
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:16,400
for taking out some liquidity, trapping
 

6017
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:19,430
for taking out some liquidity, trapping
buyers at the highs, coming down,

6018
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:19,440
buyers at the highs, coming down,
 

6019
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:22,229
buyers at the highs, coming down,
producing a lower high into a volume

6020
02:16:22,229 --> 02:16:22,239
producing a lower high into a volume
 

6021
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:23,910
producing a lower high into a volume
shelf that I could rotate from. And I'd

6022
02:16:23,910 --> 02:16:23,920
shelf that I could rotate from. And I'd
 

6023
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:25,830
shelf that I could rotate from. And I'd
need a clear target down here. So, let's

6024
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:25,840
need a clear target down here. So, let's
 

6025
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:28,069
need a clear target down here. So, let's
pretend the profile looks like that and

6026
02:16:28,069 --> 02:16:28,079
pretend the profile looks like that and
 

6027
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:29,830
pretend the profile looks like that and
we could trade all the way down. That

6028
02:16:29,830 --> 02:16:29,840
we could trade all the way down. That
 

6029
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:31,669
we could trade all the way down. That
would be a reversal. I would not be

6030
02:16:31,669 --> 02:16:31,679
would be a reversal. I would not be
 

6031
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:34,070
would be a reversal. I would not be
short into these pushes. No way. That's

6032
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:34,080
short into these pushes. No way. That's
 

6033
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,669
short into these pushes. No way. That's
where most people get it wrong. But

6034
02:16:35,669 --> 02:16:35,679
where most people get it wrong. But
 

6035
02:16:35,679 --> 02:16:37,030
where most people get it wrong. But
yeah, reversals are legitimate

6036
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:37,040
yeah, reversals are legitimate
 

6037
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:41,190
yeah, reversals are legitimate
strategies. We play them all the time.

6038
02:16:41,190 --> 02:16:41,200
strategies. We play them all the time.
 

6039
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:42,790
strategies. We play them all the time.
Green on the last four days of December

6040
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:42,800
Green on the last four days of December
 

6041
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:44,150
Green on the last four days of December
is not bad. I would say it's pretty

6042
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:44,160
is not bad. I would say it's pretty
 

6043
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:46,309
is not bad. I would say it's pretty
great. Green four days at all was pretty

6044
02:16:46,309 --> 02:16:46,319
great. Green four days at all was pretty
 

6045
02:16:46,319 --> 02:16:48,389
great. Green four days at all was pretty

Jeremiah. That's really really kind of

6056
02:16:58,549 --> 02:16:58,559
Jeremiah. That's really really kind of
 

6057
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:01,750
Jeremiah. That's really really kind of
you. Where in LA are you? We go over the

6058
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:01,760
you. Where in LA are you? We go over the
 

6059
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,750
you. Where in LA are you? We go over the
open

6060
02:17:03,750 --> 02:17:03,760
open
 

6061
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:05,990
open
will do you mean will we go over the

6062
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,000
will do you mean will we go over the
 

6063
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,910
will do you mean will we go over the
open rate trade when it's good and when

6064
02:17:07,910 --> 02:17:07,920
open rate trade when it's good and when
 

6065
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:09,830
open rate trade when it's good and when
it's not a good idea? Oh, when when's

6066
02:17:09,830 --> 02:17:09,840
it's not a good idea? Oh, when when's
 

6067
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,270
it's not a good idea? Oh, when when's
the orb good and when's it not? I would

6068
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:11,280
the orb good and when's it not? I would
 

6069
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:13,669
the orb good and when's it not? I would
say when there's targets above. Right.

6070
02:17:13,669 --> 02:17:13,679
say when there's targets above. Right.
 

6071
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:17,669
say when there's targets above. Right.
So right if we have a 15minute orb today

6072
02:17:17,669 --> 02:17:17,679
So right if we have a 15minute orb today
 

6073
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:20,870
So right if we have a 15minute orb today
we this is our 15-minute orb. Right.

6074
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:20,880
we this is our 15-minute orb. Right.
 

6075
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:23,429
we this is our 15-minute orb. Right.
Today we traded inside, failed, traded

6076
02:17:23,429 --> 02:17:23,439
Today we traded inside, failed, traded
 

6077
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:27,190
Today we traded inside, failed, traded
down, held, right? If if we break away

6078
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:27,200
down, held, right? If if we break away
 

6079
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:30,150
down, held, right? If if we break away
from it, let's say

6080
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:30,160
from it, let's say
 

6081
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:32,389
from it, let's say
we have key level here. Let's say we've

6082
02:17:32,389 --> 02:17:32,399
we have key level here. Let's say we've
 

6083
02:17:32,399 --> 02:17:35,830
we have key level here. Let's say we've
traded here, right? And if we break away

6084
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:35,840
traded here, right? And if we break away
 

6085
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:37,910
traded here, right? And if we break away
from it here and we have a level here

6086
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:37,920
from it here and we have a level here
 

6087
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:40,950
from it here and we have a level here
and we know buyers got trapped, then I

6088
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:40,960
and we know buyers got trapped, then I
 

6089
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,709
and we know buyers got trapped, then I
trade downside. Same the opposite way.

6090
02:17:42,709 --> 02:17:42,719
trade downside. Same the opposite way.
 

6091
02:17:42,719 --> 02:17:44,629
trade downside. Same the opposite way.
It's all about same when I trade the

6092
02:17:44,629 --> 02:17:44,639
It's all about same when I trade the
 

6093
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:46,150
It's all about same when I trade the
open. Sometimes you'll see me trade the

6094
02:17:46,150 --> 02:17:46,160
open. Sometimes you'll see me trade the
 

6095
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:48,469
open. Sometimes you'll see me trade the
open. All right. Yesterday, I think

6096
02:17:48,469 --> 02:17:48,479
open. All right. Yesterday, I think
 

6097
02:17:48,479 --> 02:17:50,309
open. All right. Yesterday, I think
yesterday or Friday, I traded the open

6098
02:17:50,309 --> 02:17:50,319
yesterday or Friday, I traded the open
 

6099
02:17:50,319 --> 02:17:52,309
yesterday or Friday, I traded the open
aggressively once I saw momentum come

6100
02:17:52,309 --> 02:17:52,319
aggressively once I saw momentum come
 

6101
02:17:52,319 --> 02:17:54,629
aggressively once I saw momentum come
in. If we see momentum come one

6102
02:17:54,629 --> 02:17:54,639
in. If we see momentum come one
 

6103
02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:56,230
in. If we see momentum come one
direction and there is a clear

6104
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:56,240
direction and there is a clear
 

6105
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:58,309
direction and there is a clear
lowhanging fruit to aim for, I will

6106
02:17:58,309 --> 02:17:58,319
lowhanging fruit to aim for, I will
 

6107
02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:00,070
lowhanging fruit to aim for, I will
trade that. So, if I'm going to trade a

6108
02:18:00,070 --> 02:18:00,080
trade that. So, if I'm going to trade a
 

6109
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:02,549
trade that. So, if I'm going to trade a
break, I'll trade it. If momentum's on

6110
02:18:02,549 --> 02:18:02,559
break, I'll trade it. If momentum's on
 

6111
02:18:02,559 --> 02:18:04,150
break, I'll trade it. If momentum's on
my side and I know, okay, they're going

6112
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:04,160
my side and I know, okay, they're going
 

6113
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,990
my side and I know, okay, they're going
for that. I can see it's up there. I

6114
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:06,000
for that. I can see it's up there. I
 

6115
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,389
for that. I can see it's up there. I
know we want to go there. I'll trade it.

6116
02:18:08,389 --> 02:18:08,399
know we want to go there. I'll trade it.
 

6117
02:18:08,399 --> 02:18:10,790
know we want to go there. I'll trade it.
What I won't do is trade an orb inside a

6118
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:10,800
What I won't do is trade an orb inside a
 

6119
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:12,469
What I won't do is trade an orb inside a
range when there's nothing to do, right?

6120
02:18:12,469 --> 02:18:12,479
range when there's nothing to do, right?
 

6121
02:18:12,479 --> 02:18:15,270
range when there's nothing to do, right?
So let's say our orb is here and our

6122
02:18:15,270 --> 02:18:15,280
So let's say our orb is here and our
 

6123
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:18,150
So let's say our orb is here and our
profile is here from the current day or

6124
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:18,160
profile is here from the current day or
 

6125
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:20,549
profile is here from the current day or
previous day or previous week, right?

6126
02:18:20,549 --> 02:18:20,559
previous day or previous week, right?
 

6127
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:23,190
previous day or previous week, right?
Then what's likely to happen? Push fail,

6128
02:18:23,190 --> 02:18:23,200
Then what's likely to happen? Push fail,
 

6129
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:25,669
Then what's likely to happen? Push fail,
drop, fail, right? Because we're pinned

6130
02:18:25,669 --> 02:18:25,679
drop, fail, right? Because we're pinned
 

6131
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:27,589
drop, fail, right? Because we're pinned
in the ranging market. When's it going

6132

to be good? The orbs here and we're
 

6135
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,270
to be good? The orbs here and we're
bullish higher time frame. Let's say

we're bullish higher time frame. We've
got level of liquidity here. We're going

6140
02:18:34,549 --> 02:18:34,559
got level of liquidity here. We're going
 

6141
02:18:34,559 --> 02:18:36,309
got level of liquidity here. We're going
to trade that break because it makes way

6142
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:36,319
to trade that break because it makes way
 

6143
02:18:36,319 --> 02:18:42,070

to see you know a drastic drop and a

to see you know a drastic drop and a

failure underneath volume right and then
 

6245
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:31,590
failure underneath volume right and then
the problem with your cell then is where

6246
02:20:31,590 --> 02:20:31,600
the problem with your cell then is where
 

6247
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:33,030
the problem with your cell then is where
are you going to target I mean they can

6248
02:20:33,030 --> 02:20:33,040
are you going to target I mean they can
 

6249
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:36,230
are you going to target I mean they can
trap in here and you can target here we

6250
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:36,240
trap in here and you can target here we
 

6251
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:38,469
trap in here and you can target here we
can have a look at what that looked like

6252
02:20:38,469 --> 02:20:38,479
can have a look at what that looked like
 

6253
02:20:38,479 --> 02:20:44,710
can have a look at what that looked like
in terms of uh the footprint inside this

6254
02:20:44,710 --> 02:20:44,720

 

6255
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:46,950

you did catch a few buyers up here

6256
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:46,960
you did catch a few buyers up here
 

6257
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:49,750
you did catch a few buyers up here
versus 50s again

6258
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:49,760
versus 50s again
 

6259
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:51,270
versus 50s again
you still have a buying balance here

6260
02:20:51,270 --> 02:20:51,280
you still have a buying balance here
 

6261
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:53,030
you still have a buying balance here
structurally you're still holding pretty

6262
02:20:53,030 --> 02:20:53,040
structurally you're still holding pretty
 

6263
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:54,550
structurally you're still holding pretty
good.

6264
02:20:54,550 --> 02:20:54,560
good.
 

6265
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:58,630

Zoom out. Look at this on a 5m minute.

6266
02:20:58,630 --> 02:20:58,640
Zoom out. Look at this on a 5m minute.
 

6267

I can see some sellers came in here

6268
02:21:00,230 --> 02:21:00,240
I can see some sellers came in here
 

6269
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:02,710
I can see some sellers came in here
earlier. So sellers need it underneath

6270
02:21:02,710 --> 02:21:02,720
earlier. So sellers need it underneath
 

6271
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:04,070
earlier. So sellers need it underneath
these levels. This is where they came

6272
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:04,080
these levels. This is where they came
 

6273
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:06,710
these levels. This is where they came
flying in earlier and here, right? So

6274
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:06,720
flying in earlier and here, right? So
 

6275
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:08,070
flying in earlier and here, right? So
I'd say if you get a close under here

6276
02:21:08,070 --> 02:21:08,080
I'd say if you get a close under here
 

6277
02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:10,550
I'd say if you get a close under here
and you reject, then maybe, but I

6278
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:10,560
and you reject, then maybe, but I
 

6279
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:12,070
and you reject, then maybe, but I
personally wouldn't be picking tops up

6280
02:21:12,070 --> 02:21:12,080
personally wouldn't be picking tops up
 

6281
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,150
personally wouldn't be picking tops up
here. Yes, you'd swept the liquidity,

6282
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:14,160
here. Yes, you'd swept the liquidity,
 

6283
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:16,550
here. Yes, you'd swept the liquidity,
but in terms of what I'm seeing,

6284
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:16,560
but in terms of what I'm seeing,
 

6285
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:17,910
but in terms of what I'm seeing,
technically speaking, it's still

6286
02:21:17,910 --> 02:21:17,920
technically speaking, it's still
 

6287
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:19,590
technically speaking, it's still
bullish. You would need to leave it. For

6288
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:19,600
bullish. You would need to leave it. For
 

6289
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,030
bullish. You would need to leave it. For
me, I'd want to see it leave volume.

6290
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:21,040
me, I'd want to see it leave volume.
 

6291
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:22,630
me, I'd want to see it leave volume.
This is why I'm saying it's got to be

6292
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:22,640
This is why I'm saying it's got to be
 

6293
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:23,830
This is why I'm saying it's got to be
careful. Maybe some of you are trading

6294
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:23,840
careful. Maybe some of you are trading
 

6295
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,670
careful. Maybe some of you are trading
the IB trade back down and that's your

6296
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:25,680
the IB trade back down and that's your
 

6297
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,590
the IB trade back down and that's your
trade. You're focused on that specific

6298
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:27,600
trade. You're focused on that specific
 

6299
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:29,110
trade. You're focused on that specific
trade and you don't wait for

6300
02:21:29,110 --> 02:21:29,120
trade and you don't wait for
 

6301
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:30,790
trade and you don't wait for
confirmation. You're looking for IB

6302
02:21:30,790 --> 02:21:30,800
confirmation. You're looking for IB
 

6303
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:34,469
confirmation. You're looking for IB
close. Okay, go. Possible, right? I'd be

6304
02:21:34,469 --> 02:21:34,479
close. Okay, go. Possible, right? I'd be
 

6305
02:21:34,479 --> 02:21:37,030
close. Okay, go. Possible, right? I'd be
looking for that. And until I see that,

6306
02:21:37,030 --> 02:21:37,040
looking for that. And until I see that,
 

6307
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:38,630
looking for that. And until I see that,
I wouldn't be convinced that it's a

6308
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:38,640
I wouldn't be convinced that it's a
 

6309
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:42,469
I wouldn't be convinced that it's a
short because we still have targets if

6310
02:21:42,469 --> 02:21:42,479
short because we still have targets if
 

6311
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:44,469
short because we still have targets if
it wants to move higher. Okay, we still

6312
02:21:44,469 --> 02:21:44,479
it wants to move higher. Okay, we still
 

6313
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:46,870
it wants to move higher. Okay, we still
have this and this. It wants to be

6314
02:21:46,870 --> 02:21:46,880
have this and this. It wants to be
 

6315
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:49,590
have this and this. It wants to be
higher. So I would need to see strong

6316
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:49,600
higher. So I would need to see strong
 

6317
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,110
higher. So I would need to see strong
selling pull back in reject volume and

6318
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:53,120
selling pull back in reject volume and
 

6319
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:55,429
selling pull back in reject volume and
then you haven't got that far to aim for

6320
02:21:55,429 --> 02:21:55,439
then you haven't got that far to aim for
 

6321
02:21:55,439 --> 02:21:57,349
then you haven't got that far to aim for
really unfortunately you'd be looking at

6322
02:21:57,349 --> 02:21:57,359
really unfortunately you'd be looking at
 

6323
02:21:57,359 --> 02:22:00,630
really unfortunately you'd be looking at
sort of 30s to 15s and teens and maybe

6324
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:00,640
sort of 30s to 15s and teens and maybe
 

6325
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:02,550
sort of 30s to 15s and teens and maybe
if you got lucky down here. So you're

6326
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:02,560
if you got lucky down here. So you're
 

6327
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:04,790
if you got lucky down here. So you're
going to get 15 and 30 points if it

6328
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:04,800
going to get 15 and 30 points if it
 

6329
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:06,950
going to get 15 and 30 points if it
offers it at all. This is the problem

6330
02:22:06,950 --> 02:22:06,960
offers it at all. This is the problem
 

6331
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:08,790
offers it at all. This is the problem
with days like today. The range is just

6332
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:08,800
with days like today. The range is just
 

6333
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:22,950
with days like today. The range is just
not there folks.

6334

02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:33,200
easily. Let's get to 400 at least and
 

6439
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:34,790
easily. Let's get to 400 at least and
give away. We want to give away three

6440
02:24:34,790 --> 02:24:34,800
give away. We want to give away three
 

6441
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:41,270
give away. We want to give away three
Apex accounts.

6442
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:41,280

 

6443
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:42,630

Eric, thank you. You're the best. You're

6444
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:42,640
Eric, thank you. You're the best. You're
 

6445
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:43,830
Eric, thank you. You're the best. You're
welcome. Love your stream. Thanks for

6446
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:43,840
welcome. Love your stream. Thanks for
 

6447
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:46,150
welcome. Love your stream. Thanks for
all you do. Thanks, Brock.

6448
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:46,160
all you do. Thanks, Brock.
 

6449
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:49,270
all you do. Thanks, Brock.
I got the funded trading 90% reversal. I

6450
02:24:49,270 --> 02:24:49,280
I got the funded trading 90% reversal. I
 

6451
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,349
I got the funded trading 90% reversal. I
got sorry, I got all the funded trading

6452
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:51,359
got sorry, I got all the funded trading
 

6453
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:53,110
got sorry, I got all the funded trading
90% reversal and waited for clear lower

6454
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:53,120
90% reversal and waited for clear lower
 

6455
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,510
90% reversal and waited for clear lower
highs and a break of fair value gaps and

6456
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:55,520
highs and a break of fair value gaps and
 

6457
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:57,349
highs and a break of fair value gaps and
it was working. But for the past few

6458
02:24:57,349 --> 02:24:57,359
it was working. But for the past few
 

6459
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:00,630
it was working. But for the past few
days, front running reversals,

6460
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:00,640
days, front running reversals,
 

6461
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:01,990
days, front running reversals,
I think I'm going to wait for Jan. Yeah,

6462
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,000
I think I'm going to wait for Jan. Yeah,
 

6463
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,070
I think I'm going to wait for Jan. Yeah,
exactly. Exactly, Breezy. Like if you're

6464
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:04,080
exactly. Exactly, Breezy. Like if you're
 

6465
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:05,349
exactly. Exactly, Breezy. Like if you're
playing that strategy, just understand

6466
02:25:05,349 --> 02:25:05,359
playing that strategy, just understand
 

6467
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:08,790
playing that strategy, just understand
you've been in a range. So

6468
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:08,800
you've been in a range. So
 

6469
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:10,630
you've been in a range. So
you got to wait to trade trade the

6470
02:25:10,630 --> 02:25:10,640
you got to wait to trade trade the
 

6471
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:12,309
you got to wait to trade trade the
edges.

6472
02:25:12,309 --> 02:25:12,319
edges.
 

6473
02:25:12,319 --> 02:25:17,190
edges.
Rumo says, "I'm short. NQ 25 743."

6474
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:17,200
Rumo says, "I'm short. NQ 25 743."
 

6475
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:18,870
Rumo says, "I'm short. NQ 25 743."
So you're playing in this edge. Just be

6476
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:18,880
So you're playing in this edge. Just be
 

6477
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:20,630
So you're playing in this edge. Just be
careful. You've not let go of anything

6478
02:25:20,630 --> 02:25:20,640
careful. You've not let go of anything
 

6479
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:22,469
careful. You've not let go of anything
yet. All right. You've not let go of

6480
02:25:22,469 --> 02:25:22,479
yet. All right. You've not let go of
 

6481
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:24,710
yet. All right. You've not let go of
anything yet. This is your pivot. This

6482
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:24,720
anything yet. This is your pivot. This
 

6483
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:27,270
anything yet. This is your pivot. This
is your high. Until you break down away

6484
02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:27,280
is your high. Until you break down away
 

6485
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:29,429
is your high. Until you break down away
from this volume and do this, there's no

6486
02:25:29,429 --> 02:25:29,439
from this volume and do this, there's no
 

6487
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:31,990
from this volume and do this, there's no
short in my mind. But look, if if you're

6488
02:25:31,990 --> 02:25:32,000
short in my mind. But look, if if you're
 

6489
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,469
short in my mind. But look, if if you're
risking IB, I understand can be a legit

6490
02:25:34,469 --> 02:25:34,479
risking IB, I understand can be a legit
 

6491
02:25:34,479 --> 02:25:36,389
risking IB, I understand can be a legit
trade. If that's your strategy, IB to V

6492
02:25:36,389 --> 02:25:36,399
trade. If that's your strategy, IB to V
 

6493
02:25:36,399 --> 02:25:38,150
trade. If that's your strategy, IB to V
up, don't mind it. But I would say

6494
02:25:38,150 --> 02:25:38,160
up, don't mind it. But I would say
 

6495
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:39,750
up, don't mind it. But I would say
structurally in terms of volume, you've

6496
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:39,760
structurally in terms of volume, you've
 

6497
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:42,710
structurally in terms of volume, you've
not left volume, you've not pivoted yet.

6498
02:25:42,710 --> 02:25:42,720
not left volume, you've not pivoted yet.
 

6499
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:44,230
not left volume, you've not pivoted yet.
All right, so just be careful if you're

6500
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:44,240
All right, so just be careful if you're
 

6501
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:46,230
All right, so just be careful if you're
short in this already. Make sure you've

6502
02:25:46,230 --> 02:25:46,240
short in this already. Make sure you've
 

6503
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:49,190
short in this already. Make sure you've
got your risk set to somewhere that you

6504
02:25:49,190 --> 02:25:49,200
got your risk set to somewhere that you
 

6505
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:50,790
got your risk set to somewhere that you
feel that buyers are trapped. I would

6506
02:25:50,790 --> 02:25:50,800
feel that buyers are trapped. I would
 

6507
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:52,469
feel that buyers are trapped. I would
say, all right, even on Bitmap, we can

6508
02:25:52,469 --> 02:25:52,479
say, all right, even on Bitmap, we can
 

6509
02:25:52,479 --> 02:25:55,190
say, all right, even on Bitmap, we can
see there's a big buyer got caught 302

6510
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:55,200
see there's a big buyer got caught 302
 

6511
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,750
see there's a big buyer got caught 302
lot at 751. So, as long as you're under

6512
02:25:57,750 --> 02:25:57,760
lot at 751. So, as long as you're under
 

6513
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,750
lot at 751. So, as long as you're under
that, as long as they protect that, that

6514
02:25:59,750 --> 02:25:59,760
that, as long as they protect that, that
 

6515
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:01,270
that, as long as they protect that, that
would I would use that as your risk for

6516
02:26:01,270 --> 02:26:01,280
would I would use that as your risk for
 

6517
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:03,429
would I would use that as your risk for
those of you who are in it what I would

6518
02:26:03,429 --> 02:26:03,439
those of you who are in it what I would
 

6519
02:26:03,439 --> 02:26:06,550
those of you who are in it what I would
deem possibly a little bit early. 7:51.

6520
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:06,560
deem possibly a little bit early. 7:51.
 

6521
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:14,469
deem possibly a little bit early. 7:51.
You don't want it back over that.

6522
02:26:14,469 --> 02:26:14,479

 

6523
02:26:14,479 --> 02:26:16,550

What time will I trade till today? Uh,

6524
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:16,560
What time will I trade till today? Uh,
 

6525
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:18,950
What time will I trade till today? Uh,
another 25 minutes. We'll do giveaways

6526
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:18,960
another 25 minutes. We'll do giveaways
 

6527
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:23,750
another 25 minutes. We'll do giveaways
into the into the end of this stream.

6528
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:23,760

 

6529
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,270

really agree with you, but mentally I'm

6530
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:25,280
really agree with you, but mentally I'm
 

6531
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:27,830
really agree with you, but mentally I'm
stuck at 70%. I need to go back to

6532
02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:27,840
stuck at 70%. I need to go back to
 

6533
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,590
stuck at 70%. I need to go back to
value. So, I'm always looking for

6534
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:29,600
value. So, I'm always looking for
 

6535
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:31,270
value. So, I'm always looking for
reversals into VA. So, it sounds like

6536
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:31,280
reversals into VA. So, it sounds like
 

6537
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:32,550
reversals into VA. So, it sounds like
that's your trade, though. So, if that's

6538
02:26:32,550 --> 02:26:32,560
that's your trade, though. So, if that's
 

6539
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:33,910
that's your trade, though. So, if that's
your trade, that's that's what you're

6540
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:33,920
your trade, that's that's what you're
 

6541
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:35,670
your trade, that's that's what you're
looking for.

6542
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:35,680
looking for.
 

6543
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:40,550
looking for.
Short 732. Silly 732. Uh you're looking

6544
02:26:40,550 --> 02:26:40,560
Short 732. Silly 732. Uh you're looking
 

6545
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:42,469
Short 732. Silly 732. Uh you're looking
for the breakaway short. I I would let

6546
02:26:42,469 --> 02:26:42,479
for the breakaway short. I I would let
 

6547
02:26:42,479 --> 02:26:44,550
for the breakaway short. I I would let
it die under there first. I wouldn't

6548
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:44,560
it die under there first. I wouldn't
 

6549
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:45,830
it die under there first. I wouldn't
short there because this is what

6550
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:45,840
short there because this is what
 

6551
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:47,429
short there because this is what
happens, right? Like I talked about, you

6552
02:26:47,429 --> 02:26:47,439
happens, right? Like I talked about, you
 

6553
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:49,110
happens, right? Like I talked about, you
need it to trade down. I'd be very

6554
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:49,120
need it to trade down. I'd be very
 

6555
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:50,950
need it to trade down. I'd be very
careful with this node and you'd need it

6556
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:50,960
careful with this node and you'd need it
 

6557
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:53,270
careful with this node and you'd need it
to leave volume and then trade lower.

6558
02:26:53,270 --> 02:26:53,280
to leave volume and then trade lower.
 

6559
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:54,870
to leave volume and then trade lower.
you are starting to see it potentially

6560
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:54,880
you are starting to see it potentially
 

6561
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:56,389
you are starting to see it potentially
leave volume. But I'd be looking for

6562
02:26:56,389 --> 02:26:56,399
leave volume. But I'd be looking for
 

6563
02:26:56,399 --> 02:26:59,910
leave volume. But I'd be looking for
this if they're not kind, right? Two

6564
02:26:59,910 --> 02:26:59,920
this if they're not kind, right? Two
 

6565
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:01,030
this if they're not kind, right? Two
things are going to happen. They'll be

6566
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:01,040
things are going to happen. They'll be
 

6567
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:03,030
things are going to happen. They'll be
[\h__\h] and do this or they just do

6568
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:03,040
[\h__\h] and do this or they just do
 

6569
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,670
[\h__\h] and do this or they just do
that without offering this. Right? But I

6570
02:27:05,670 --> 02:27:05,680
that without offering this. Right? But I
 

6571
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:07,590
that without offering this. Right? But I
would, for me personally, I'd be looking

6572
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:07,600
would, for me personally, I'd be looking
 

6573
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:10,150
would, for me personally, I'd be looking
for this to fade away. All right? And

6574
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:10,160
for this to fade away. All right? And
 

6575
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:12,550
for this to fade away. All right? And
then reject a key level and trade lower.

6576
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:12,560
then reject a key level and trade lower.
 

6577
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:14,710
then reject a key level and trade lower.
Until that point, personally, I wouldn't

6578
02:27:14,710 --> 02:27:14,720
Until that point, personally, I wouldn't
 

6579
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:15,830
Until that point, personally, I wouldn't
be looking for a short. I'm not going to

6580
02:27:15,830 --> 02:27:15,840
be looking for a short. I'm not going to
 

6581
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,870
be looking for a short. I'm not going to
trade it at all today. But I'd be very

6582
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:18,880
trade it at all today. But I'd be very
 

6583
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:21,670
trade it at all today. But I'd be very
careful. Like I said, the structure this

6584
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:21,680
careful. Like I said, the structure this
 

6585
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:24,309
careful. Like I said, the structure this
low created this high. This is a volume

6586
02:27:24,309 --> 02:27:24,319
low created this high. This is a volume
 

6587
02:27:24,319 --> 02:27:26,309
low created this high. This is a volume
buildout. You've not left this volume

6588
02:27:26,309 --> 02:27:26,319
buildout. You've not left this volume
 

6589
02:27:26,319 --> 02:27:28,150
buildout. You've not left this volume
yet, right? And you haven't even come

6590
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:28,160
yet, right? And you haven't even come
 

6591
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:30,790
yet, right? And you haven't even come
into this node yet. So, I'd be somewhat

6592
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:30,800
into this node yet. So, I'd be somewhat
 

6593
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:33,030
into this node yet. So, I'd be somewhat
careful. Doesn't mean it can't move

6594
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:33,040
careful. Doesn't mean it can't move
 

6595
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:35,349
careful. Doesn't mean it can't move
lower, folks. It can come up here and do

6596
02:27:35,349 --> 02:27:35,359
lower, folks. It can come up here and do
 

6597
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:36,630
lower, folks. It can come up here and do
this and do this and do this. It can,

6598
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:36,640
this and do this and do this. It can,
 

6599
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:38,230
this and do this and do this. It can,
but it can also come up here, protect

6600
02:27:38,230 --> 02:27:38,240
but it can also come up here, protect
 

6601
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:40,710
but it can also come up here, protect
this, and finish the rotation and

6602
02:27:40,710 --> 02:27:40,720
this, and finish the rotation and
 

6603
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:42,550
this, and finish the rotation and
completion. ES is still above initial

6604
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:42,560
completion. ES is still above initial
 

6605
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:45,590
completion. ES is still above initial
balance high. VIX is still around low of

1370, guys. All right. So 1370 you're

6610
02:27:50,389 --> 02:27:50,399
1370, guys. All right. So 1370 you're
 

6611
02:27:50,399 --> 02:27:51,990
1370, guys. All right. So 1370 you're
looking for a short while VIX is very

6612
02:27:51,990 --> 02:27:52,000
looking for a short while VIX is very
 

6613
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,750
looking for a short while VIX is very
very low. And even on this last

6614
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:53,760
very low. And even on this last
 

6615
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:55,110
very low. And even on this last
pullback, let's look at the shorts that

6616
02:27:55,110 --> 02:27:55,120
pullback, let's look at the shorts that
 

6617
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:57,030
pullback, let's look at the shorts that
got caught in this last pullback.

6618
02:27:57,030 --> 02:27:57,040
got caught in this last pullback.
 

6619
02:27:57,040 --> 02:28:00,230
got caught in this last pullback.
They're all caught offside.

6620
02:28:00,230 --> 02:28:00,240
They're all caught offside.
 

6621
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:02,710
They're all caught offside.
Look at all these guys

6622
02:28:02,710 --> 02:28:02,720
Look at all these guys
 

6623
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:04,309
Look at all these guys
right into this block we talked about

6624
02:28:04,309 --> 02:28:04,319
right into this block we talked about
 

6625
02:28:04,319 --> 02:28:06,469
right into this block we talked about
earlier. Remember 2 minutes ago we came

6626
02:28:06,469 --> 02:28:06,479
earlier. Remember 2 minutes ago we came
 

6627
02:28:06,479 --> 02:28:07,910
earlier. Remember 2 minutes ago we came
back to this. All right. These shorts

6628
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:07,920
back to this. All right. These shorts
 

6629
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:10,150
back to this. All right. These shorts
are piling in here twice. Now until you

6630
02:28:10,150 --> 02:28:10,160
are piling in here twice. Now until you
 

6631
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:12,790
are piling in here twice. Now until you
get a break like this, these shorts can

6632
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:12,800
get a break like this, these shorts can
 

6633
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:14,950
get a break like this, these shorts can
be stuck. If they start rebidding over

6634
02:28:14,950 --> 02:28:14,960
be stuck. If they start rebidding over
 

6635
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:16,950
be stuck. If they start rebidding over
here, the next target will be this. And

6636
02:28:16,950 --> 02:28:16,960
here, the next target will be this. And
 

6637
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:18,389
here, the next target will be this. And
if they get through this, it's a

6638
02:28:18,389 --> 02:28:18,399
if they get through this, it's a
 

6639
02:28:18,399 --> 02:28:20,710
if they get through this, it's a
squeeze. So I would be very hesitant to

6640
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:20,720
squeeze. So I would be very hesitant to
 

6641
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:28,630
squeeze. So I would be very hesitant to
be too eager short in this right now.

6642
02:28:28,630 --> 02:28:28,640

 

6643
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:31,270

Can I please show the footprint settings

6644
02:28:31,270 --> 02:28:31,280
Can I please show the footprint settings
 

6645
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:34,389
Can I please show the footprint settings
if you can? Uh yeah, sure. These are

6646
02:28:34,389 --> 02:28:34,399
if you can? Uh yeah, sure. These are
 

6647
02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:37,590
if you can? Uh yeah, sure. These are
just how I use it. This is not might not

6648
02:28:37,590 --> 02:28:37,600
just how I use it. This is not might not
 

6649
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:40,790
just how I use it. This is not might not
be how you want it. Right. So I have row

levels four.
Right, I can't scroll down to show you

6668
02:29:04,550 --> 02:29:04,560
Right, I can't scroll down to show you
 

6669
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:06,469
Right, I can't scroll down to show you
that. I don't know why it's it's all

6670
02:29:06,469 --> 02:29:06,479
that. I don't know why it's it's all
 

6671
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:08,230
that. I don't know why it's it's all
stuck but hopefully that helps. Right,

6672
02:29:08,230 --> 02:29:08,240
stuck but hopefully that helps. Right,
 

6673
02:29:08,240 --> 02:29:09,990
stuck but hopefully that helps. Right,
these are the main ones you need. Row

6674
02:29:09,990 --> 02:29:10,000
these are the main ones you need. Row
 

6675

profile type delta. It's up to you

6678
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:14,800
profile type delta. It's up to you
 

6679
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:16,309
profile type delta. It's up to you
whether you have the gradient on or not,

6680
02:29:16,309 --> 02:29:16,319
whether you have the gradient on or not,
 

6681
02:29:16,319 --> 02:29:17,990
whether you have the gradient on or not,
but that's how I have it at the moment.

6682
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:18,000
but that's how I have it at the moment.
 

6683
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,630
but that's how I have it at the moment.
PC, I have it yellow so it stands out. I

6684
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:20,640
PC, I have it yellow so it stands out. I
 

6685
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:22,710
PC, I have it yellow so it stands out. I
can't show you that, but PC have it on

6686
02:29:22,710 --> 02:29:22,720
can't show you that, but PC have it on
 

6687
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:25,030
can't show you that, but PC have it on
set to yellow. Under that s uh show

6688
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:25,040
set to yellow. Under that s uh show
 

6689
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:27,110
set to yellow. Under that s uh show
summary info, I have the info box.

6690
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:27,120
summary info, I have the info box.
 

6691
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:31,990

That's it, folks.

6692
02:29:31,990 --> 02:29:32,000

 

6693
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,670

You could put delta on as well. Where

6694
02:29:33,670 --> 02:29:33,680
You could put delta on as well. Where
 

6695
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:39,190
You could put delta on as well. Where
would that be?

6696
02:29:39,190 --> 02:29:39,200

 

6697
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:41,349

There you go. You could have table.

6698
02:29:41,349 --> 02:29:41,359
There you go. You could have table.
 

6699
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:42,870
There you go. You could have table.
Let's do that. You could have table. I

6700
02:29:42,870 --> 02:29:42,880
Let's do that. You could have table. I
 

6701
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:45,990
Let's do that. You could have table. I
would take volume off session CVD P open

6702
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,000
would take volume off session CVD P open
 

6703
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,670
would take volume off session CVD P open
interest. Just have delta. It would look

6704
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:47,680
interest. Just have delta. It would look
 

6705
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:49,590
interest. Just have delta. It would look
like this then. And then you've got your

6706
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:49,600
like this then. And then you've got your
 

6707
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:52,150
like this then. And then you've got your
delta. So you can see heavy delta in

6708
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:52,160
delta. So you can see heavy delta in
 

6709
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:54,710
delta. So you can see heavy delta in
this 5m minute bar. You've got 10

6710
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:54,720
this 5m minute bar. You've got 10
 

6711
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:57,110
this 5m minute bar. You've got 10
seconds left. Question mark. Are we

6712
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,120
seconds left. Question mark. Are we
 

6713
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,750
seconds left. Question mark. Are we
moving lower? No. Who's stuck? Sellers.

6714
02:29:59,750 --> 02:29:59,760
moving lower? No. Who's stuck? Sellers.
 

6715
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:01,670
moving lower? No. Who's stuck? Sellers.
All right. They came flying in here and

6716
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:01,680
All right. They came flying in here and
 

6717
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:02,950
All right. They came flying in here and
they're not moving lower. Look at this

6718
02:30:02,950 --> 02:30:02,960
they're not moving lower. Look at this
 

6719
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:05,190
they're not moving lower. Look at this
heavy delta. Are we moving lower? No.

6720
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:05,200
heavy delta. Are we moving lower? No.
 

6721
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:07,190
heavy delta. Are we moving lower? No.
So, we've got passive buying here, and

6722
02:30:07,190 --> 02:30:07,200
So, we've got passive buying here, and
 

6723
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:08,870
So, we've got passive buying here, and
if they break, they're going to try and

6724
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:08,880
if they break, they're going to try and
 

6725
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:10,710
if they break, they're going to try and
take this out. Sellers need to come

6726
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:10,720
take this out. Sellers need to come
 

6727
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:12,230
take this out. Sellers need to come
under here. So, I'm saying I wouldn't be

6728
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:12,240
under here. So, I'm saying I wouldn't be
 

6729
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:14,309
under here. So, I'm saying I wouldn't be
early on the short yet, folks. They're

6730
02:30:14,309 --> 02:30:14,319
early on the short yet, folks. They're
 

6731
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:15,990
early on the short yet, folks. They're
piling in here, and they're not breaking

6732
02:30:15,990 --> 02:30:16,000
piling in here, and they're not breaking
 

6733
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,990
piling in here, and they're not breaking
lower, which means in here, you've got a

6734
02:30:17,990 --> 02:30:18,000
lower, which means in here, you've got a
 

6735
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,070
lower, which means in here, you've got a
buyer absorbing the tape. So, sellers

6736
02:30:20,070 --> 02:30:20,080

6811
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:53,270
it? I'm assuming you mean like director
funding. Very expensive. Very very very

6812
02:31:53,270 --> 02:31:53,280
funding. Very expensive. Very very very
 

6813
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:57,270
funding. Very expensive. Very very very
very expensive what it is. Uh secondly,

6814
02:31:57,270 --> 02:31:57,280
very expensive what it is. Uh secondly,
 

6815
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:59,830
very expensive what it is. Uh secondly,
very bad rules. Normally it's like 20%

6816
02:31:59,830 --> 02:31:59,840
very bad rules. Normally it's like 20%
 

6817

consistency or something on instant

6818
02:32:01,349 --> 02:32:01,359
consistency or something on instant
 

6819
02:32:01,359 --> 02:32:03,270
consistency or something on instant
funded. So you're paying to get direct

6820
02:32:03,270 --> 02:32:03,280
funded. So you're paying to get direct
 

6821
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:05,030
funded. So you're paying to get direct
in funding, but you're limiting what

6822
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:05,040
in funding, but you're limiting what
 

6823
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:06,710
in funding, but you're limiting what
you're able to do. I think you're better

6824
02:32:06,710 --> 02:32:06,720
you're able to do. I think you're better
 

6825
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:09,190
you're able to do. I think you're better
off to do something where you can pass

6826
02:32:09,190 --> 02:32:09,200
off to do something where you can pass
 

6827
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:11,830
off to do something where you can pass
in a couple days. All right? Or even one

6828
02:32:11,830 --> 02:32:11,840
in a couple days. All right? Or even one
 

6829
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:14,469
in a couple days. All right? Or even one
day and not have that 20% consistency.

6830
02:32:14,469 --> 02:32:14,479
day and not have that 20% consistency.

That's what I would say. Instant
 

6833
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:19,270
That's what I would say. Instant
funding, it's not a scam because they

an instant funding without consistency,

two. That's it. That's the only thing I
 

6891
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:32,630
two. That's it. That's the only thing I
change. Ticks per row two. You could

6892
02:33:32,630 --> 02:33:32,640
change. Ticks per row two. You could
 

6893
02:33:32,640 --> 02:33:34,630
change. Ticks per row two. You could
have it on columns at a th00and. It's

6894
02:33:34,630 --> 02:33:34,640
have it on columns at a th00and. It's
 

6895
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:43,510
have it on columns at a th00and. It's
the other way I would have it.

6896
02:33:43,510 --> 02:33:43,520

 

6897
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:45,190

Do you use volume profile starting at

6898
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:45,200
Do you use volume profile starting at
 

6899
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:48,070
Do you use volume profile starting at
the Asia session? No, I use it at RTH.

6900
02:33:48,070 --> 02:33:48,080
the Asia session? No, I use it at RTH.
 

6901
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:49,750
the Asia session? No, I use it at RTH.
So, New York session. Sometimes if

6902
02:33:49,750 --> 02:33:49,760
So, New York session. Sometimes if
 

6903
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:51,830
So, New York session. Sometimes if
Asia's had a big move, if there's been

6904
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:51,840
Asia's had a big move, if there's been
 

6905
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:53,750
Asia's had a big move, if there's been
some news overnight, I will mark out the

6906
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:53,760
some news overnight, I will mark out the
 

6907
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,510
some news overnight, I will mark out the
GlobeEx range, right? So, I'll go from

6908
02:33:55,510 --> 02:33:55,520
GlobeEx range, right? So, I'll go from
 

6909
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:58,150
GlobeEx range, right? So, I'll go from
the the open of the new session right up

6910
02:33:58,150 --> 02:33:58,160
the the open of the new session right up
 

6911
02:33:58,160 --> 02:34:00,389
the the open of the new session right up
to 9:30. If it's had a big move, I'm

6912
02:34:00,389 --> 02:34:00,399
to 9:30. If it's had a big move, I'm
 

6913
02:34:00,399 --> 02:34:02,309
to 9:30. If it's had a big move, I'm
interested in that. But otherwise, no,

6914
02:34:02,309 --> 02:34:02,319
interested in that. But otherwise, no,
 

6915
02:34:02,319 --> 02:34:03,750
interested in that. But otherwise, no,
because there's no volume there, right?

6916
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:03,760
because there's no volume there, right?
 

6917
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:05,910
because there's no volume there, right?
So, if we look overnight, look at the

6918
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:05,920
So, if we look overnight, look at the
 

6919
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:08,150
So, if we look overnight, look at the
difference in volume. So, I'm not really

6920
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:08,160
difference in volume. So, I'm not really
 

6921
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:10,550
difference in volume. So, I'm not really
I'm not too bothered.

6922
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:10,560
I'm not too bothered.
 

6923
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:12,870
I'm not too bothered.
So, here's the push, guys. So, if you're

6924
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:12,880
So, here's the push, guys. So, if you're
 

6925
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:14,870
So, here's the push, guys. So, if you're
still long, top of the gray box is your

6926
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:14,880
still long, top of the gray box is your
 

6927
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,630
still long, top of the gray box is your
next TP and then all the way up here.

6928
02:34:16,630 --> 02:34:16,640
next TP and then all the way up here.
 

6929
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:19,030
next TP and then all the way up here.
All right, this will be the third drive.

6930
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:19,040
All right, this will be the third drive.
 

6931
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:22,309
All right, this will be the third drive.
So, I'd be very cautious now. One, two,

6932
02:34:22,309 --> 02:34:22,319
So, I'd be very cautious now. One, two,
 

6933
02:34:22,319 --> 02:34:24,790
So, I'd be very cautious now. One, two,
three. All right, they need to get their

6934
02:34:24,790 --> 02:34:24,800
three. All right, they need to get their
 

6935
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:26,230
three. All right, they need to get their
take profit here. All right, we're

6936
02:34:26,230 --> 02:34:26,240
take profit here. All right, we're
 

6937
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:27,510
take profit here. All right, we're
starting to build this. This is not

6938
02:34:27,510 --> 02:34:27,520
starting to build this. This is not
 

6939
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:29,190
starting to build this. This is not
bullish in terms of structure at this

6940
02:34:29,190 --> 02:34:29,200
bullish in terms of structure at this
 

6941
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:31,429
bullish in terms of structure at this
point. I wouldn't be buying this move,

6942
02:34:31,429 --> 02:34:31,439
point. I wouldn't be buying this move,
 

6943
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:33,910
point. I wouldn't be buying this move,
but I would be selling your bullish

6944
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:33,920
but I would be selling your bullish
 

6945
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:35,270
but I would be selling your bullish
plays. Remember those of you who are

6946
02:34:35,270 --> 02:34:35,280
plays. Remember those of you who are
 

6947
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:37,030
plays. Remember those of you who are
long from down here, we sell in the top

6948
02:34:37,030 --> 02:34:37,040
long from down here, we sell in the top
 

6949
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:39,110
long from down here, we sell in the top
of the gray box and up here. I would not

6950
02:34:39,110 --> 02:34:39,120
of the gray box and up here. I would not
 

6951
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:41,349
of the gray box and up here. I would not
be getting bearish until you see

6952
02:34:41,349 --> 02:34:41,359
be getting bearish until you see
 

6953
02:34:41,359 --> 02:34:43,510
be getting bearish until you see
something like this. Okay, tried to make

that as clear as possible. And this

6956
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:46,640
that as clear as possible. And this
 

6957
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:50,710
that as clear as possible. And this
still just in that slow grind higher.

6958
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:50,720
still just in that slow grind higher.

Okay, there's your swipe. So your TP

7068
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:55,439
Okay, there's your swipe. So your TP
 

7069
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:57,270
Okay, there's your swipe. So your TP
just got hit. The only thing left now is

7070
02:37:57,270 --> 02:37:57,280
just got hit. The only thing left now is
 

7071
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:59,190
just got hit. The only thing left now is
up here. All right, but that was a good

7072
02:37:59,190 --> 02:37:59,200
up here. All right, but that was a good
 

7073
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:01,030
up here. All right, but that was a good
stop run up there. If we look at bookmap

7074
02:38:01,030 --> 02:38:01,040
stop run up there. If we look at bookmap
 

7075
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:03,270
stop run up there. If we look at bookmap
like we talked about, that's could well

7076
02:38:03,270 --> 02:38:03,280
like we talked about, that's could well
 

7077
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:04,950
like we talked about, that's could well
be the end of the auction, right? It

7078
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:04,960
be the end of the auction, right? It
 

7079
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,230
be the end of the auction, right? It
could well be the end of the auction

7080
02:38:06,230 --> 02:38:06,240
could well be the end of the auction
 

7081
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:07,910
could well be the end of the auction
now. So if we look at bookmap now, look

7082
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:07,920
now. So if we look at bookmap now, look
 

7083
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:12,389
now. So if we look at bookmap now, look
at this stop run up here. 22 31 33 112.

7084
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:12,399
at this stop run up here. 22 31 33 112.
 

7085
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:13,910
at this stop run up here. 22 31 33 112.
Right, so that's where they ran those

7086
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:13,920
Right, so that's where they ran those
 

7087
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:16,230
Right, so that's where they ran those
stops. They've got room higher if they

7088
02:38:16,230 --> 02:38:16,240
stops. They've got room higher if they
 

7089
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:17,830
stops. They've got room higher if they
really want to go for my red line on the

7090
02:38:17,830 --> 02:38:17,840
really want to go for my red line on the
 

7091
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:19,910
really want to go for my red line on the
chart. But again, I wouldn't be a new

7092
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:19,920
chart. But again, I wouldn't be a new
 

7093
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:22,070
chart. But again, I wouldn't be a new
money long. I'd be down to 5% of my

7094
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:22,080
money long. I'd be down to 5% of my
 

7095
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:23,349
money long. I'd be down to 5% of my
position here because they could easily

7096
02:38:23,349 --> 02:38:23,359
position here because they could easily
 

7097
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:25,110
position here because they could easily
collapse it. And look at the book. It's

7098
02:38:25,110 --> 02:38:25,120
collapse it. And look at the book. It's
 

7099
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:27,590
collapse it. And look at the book. It's
gone very, very thin all of a sudden.

7100
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:27,600
gone very, very thin all of a sudden.
 

7101
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:30,309
gone very, very thin all of a sudden.
Right? Very, very thin now. So hopefully

7102
02:38:30,309 --> 02:38:30,319
Right? Very, very thin now. So hopefully
 

7103
02:38:30,319 --> 02:38:32,230
Right? Very, very thin now. So hopefully
that made sense. Like even for you guys

7104
02:38:32,230 --> 02:38:32,240
that made sense. Like even for you guys
 

7105
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:34,469
that made sense. Like even for you guys
that were short, all right, and you were

7106
02:38:34,469 --> 02:38:34,479
that were short, all right, and you were
 

7107
02:38:34,479 --> 02:38:36,230
that were short, all right, and you were
asking me, hopefully that made sense.

7108
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:36,240
asking me, hopefully that made sense.
 

7109
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:37,429
asking me, hopefully that made sense.
That will help you next time you're

7110
02:38:37,429 --> 02:38:37,439
That will help you next time you're
 

7111
02:38:37,439 --> 02:38:38,790
That will help you next time you're
thinking about front running and getting

7112
02:38:38,790 --> 02:38:38,800
thinking about front running and getting
 

7113
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:41,750
thinking about front running and getting
short earlier, right? You have to ask

7114
02:38:41,750 --> 02:38:41,760
short earlier, right? You have to ask
 

7115
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:43,349
short earlier, right? You have to ask
yourself, remember, ask yourself before

7116
02:38:43,349 --> 02:38:43,359
yourself, remember, ask yourself before
 

7117
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:45,030
yourself, remember, ask yourself before

02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:49,590
location wasn't bad in this area. Was
momentum good? Location was okay. Was

7122
02:38:49,590 --> 02:38:49,600
momentum good? Location was okay. Was
 

7123
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:51,830
momentum good? Location was okay. Was
momentum good? No. What was the

7124
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:51,840
momentum good? No. What was the
 

7125
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:53,830
momentum good? No. What was the
structure? Well, that was your swing

7126
02:38:53,830 --> 02:38:53,840
structure? Well, that was your swing
 

7127
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:55,910
structure? Well, that was your swing
low. That was a swing high. Did you ever

trapped? Well, you had a very small
 

7141
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:09,510
trapped? Well, you had a very small
amount up here, but you also had a lot

7142
02:39:09,510 --> 02:39:09,520
amount up here, but you also had a lot
 

7143
02:39:09,520 --> 02:39:11,110
amount up here, but you also had a lot
of sellers, like we talked about trapped

7144
02:39:11,110 --> 02:39:11,120
of sellers, like we talked about trapped
 

7145
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:13,270

7149
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:17,270

7150
02:39:17,270 --> 02:39:17,280
liquidity. So, hopefully it's a nice
 

7151

looks. I know that there probably stops.
 

7189
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:11,750

02:40:43,670 --> 02:40:43,680
Is just using an anchored volume profile
 

7217
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:45,990
Is just using an anchored volume profile
tool that's just as good as indicators.

7218
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:46,000
tool that's just as good as indicators.
 

7219
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,990

7222
02:40:50,150 --> 02:40:50,160
profile. That's what this is. It's
 

7223
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:58,790
profile. That's what this is. It's
exactly what it is.

7224
02:40:58,790 --> 02:40:58,800

I notice you turn off session CVD
 

7227
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:04,070

Apex accounts and three introduction
 

7257
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:40,790
Apex accounts and three introduction
courses. These the courses are good for

7258
02:41:40,790 --> 02:41:40,800
courses. These the courses are good for
 

7259
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:42,150
courses. These the courses are good for
people who've never traded before,

7260
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:42,160
people who've never traded before,

people who've never traded before,
right? So, if you've traded before, you

7262
02:41:43,590 --> 02:41:43,600
right? So, if you've traded before, you
 

7263
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:44,870
right? So, if you've traded before, you
might not want to do it. You can give it

7264
02:41:44,870 --> 02:41:44,880
might not want to do it. You can give it
 

7265
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:47,429
might not want to do it. You can give it
to friends and family or we can just

7266
02:41:47,429 --> 02:41:47,439
to friends and family or we can just
 

7267
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:55,030
to friends and family or we can just
reroll it.

7268
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:55,040

 

7269
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:56,469

Can I tell you why there is an auction

7270
02:41:56,469 --> 02:41:56,479
Can I tell you why there is an auction
 

7271
02:41:56,479 --> 02:41:59,830
Can I tell you why there is an auction
or resting order above or why you felt

7272
02:41:59,830 --> 02:41:59,840
or resting order above or why you felt
 

7273
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:01,590
or resting order above or why you felt
the auction was done or dead around the

7274
02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:01,600
the auction was done or dead around the
 

7275
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:03,990
the auction was done or dead around the
location? I felt like it could be done

7276
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:04,000
location? I felt like it could be done
 

7277
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,389
location? I felt like it could be done
because it was all buy side. The resting

7278
02:42:06,389 --> 02:42:06,399
because it was all buy side. The resting
 

7279
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:08,630
because it was all buy side. The resting
orders above are all sellers up here.

7280
02:42:08,630 --> 02:42:08,640
orders above are all sellers up here.
 

7281
02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:10,950
orders above are all sellers up here.
So, they're probably buyers right off

7282
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:10,960
So, they're probably buyers right off
 

7283
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:13,670
So, they're probably buyers right off
the low looking to take profits. Uh the

7284
02:42:13,670 --> 02:42:13,680
the low looking to take profits. Uh the
 

7285
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:16,230
the low looking to take profits. Uh the
auction could have been done

7286
02:42:16,230 --> 02:42:16,240
auction could have been done
 

7287
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:18,389
auction could have been done
but isn't done because we had all buy

7288
02:42:18,389 --> 02:42:18,399
but isn't done because we had all buy
 

7289
02:42:18,399 --> 02:42:21,349
but isn't done because we had all buy

sell delta big volume and we weren't

02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:23,200
sell delta big volume and we weren't
 

7293
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:24,550
sell delta big volume and we weren't
willing to trade above it but now we're

7294
02:42:24,550 --> 02:42:24,560
willing to trade above it but now we're
 

7295
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:26,790
willing to trade above it but now we're
trading above it so it's it's irrelevant

7296
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:26,800
trading above it so it's it's irrelevant

Still long but only two micros left. Two
 

7507
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:21,030

7517
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:35,429

02:47:38,710 --> 02:47:38,720
does. I think the footprint charts are
 

7523
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:39,910
does. I think the footprint charts are
pretty good on Trader 8 as well from

02:47:39,910 --> 02:47:39,920
pretty good on Trader 8 as well from

7528
02:47:43,429 --> 02:47:43,439
as you're building out a little shelf
 

7529
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:47,269
as you're building out a little shelf
here.

7530
02:47:47,269 --> 02:47:47,279

 

7531
02:47:47,279 --> 02:47:48,710

Still bullish on this, but we are

7532
02:47:48,710 --> 02:47:48,720
Still bullish on this, but we are
 

7533
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:51,510
Still bullish on this, but we are
building out a bit of a shelf here.

7534
02:47:51,510 --> 02:47:51,520
building out a bit of a shelf here.
 

7535
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:52,870
building out a bit of a shelf here.
I'm going to get rid of this now as

7536
02:47:52,870 --> 02:47:52,880
I'm going to get rid of this now as
 

7537
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:54,790
I'm going to get rid of this now as
well, folks. Okay, because we've gone

7538
02:47:54,790 --> 02:47:54,800
well, folks. Okay, because we've gone
 

7539
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:57,510
well, folks. Okay, because we've gone
through it. You're extended here. So,

7540
02:47:57,510 --> 02:47:57,520
through it. You're extended here. So,
 

7541
02:47:57,520 --> 02:47:59,349
through it. You're extended here. So,
this is the three drive. They had to

7542
02:47:59,349 --> 02:47:59,359
this is the three drive. They had to
 

7543
02:47:59,359 --> 02:48:02,150
this is the three drive. They had to
successfully beat this drive. They did.

7544
02:48:02,150 --> 02:48:02,160
successfully beat this drive. They did.
 

7545
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:04,150
successfully beat this drive. They did.
And you're technically in a trend day

7546
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:04,160
And you're technically in a trend day
 

7547
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:09,429
And you're technically in a trend day
over this.

7548
02:48:09,429 --> 02:48:09,439

 

7549
02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:11,190

They can afford to come down here. If

7550
02:48:11,190 --> 02:48:11,200
They can afford to come down here. If
 

7551
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:12,550
They can afford to come down here. If
they hit that, maybe they come down.

7552
02:48:12,550 --> 02:48:12,560
they hit that, maybe they come down.
 

7553
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:13,670
they hit that, maybe they come down.
Maybe they come down early and have

7554
02:48:13,670 --> 02:48:13,680
Maybe they come down early and have
 

7555
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:15,429
Maybe they come down early and have
another attempt. I don't know. But uh

7556
02:48:15,429 --> 02:48:15,439
another attempt. I don't know. But uh
 

7557
02:48:15,439 --> 02:48:16,950
another attempt. I don't know. But uh
this is very bullish right now. It's in

7558
02:48:16,950 --> 02:48:16,960
this is very bullish right now. It's in
 

7559
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:23,190
this is very bullish right now. It's in
a squeeze.

7560
02:48:23,190 --> 02:48:23,200

 

7561
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:25,190

7643
02:49:57,439 --> 02:50:00,070
has found a little bit of a bid at these
lows. So, I'd just be somewhat cautious.

7644
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:00,080
lows. So, I'd just be somewhat cautious.
 

7645
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:01,990
lows. So, I'd just be somewhat cautious.

There's no like um monthly fee. The
 

7681
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:48,070
There's no like um monthly fee. The
reason I do that to be clear why it's

the same way who are looking at the same

7688
02:50:53,830 --> 02:50:53,840
the same way who are looking at the same
 

7689
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:56,950
the same way who are looking at the same
things. I think it builds like a better

7690
02:50:56,950 --> 02:50:56,960
things. I think it builds like a better
 

7691
02:50:56,960 --> 02:50:58,550
things. I think it builds like a better
working environment. Let's say if

7692
02:50:58,550 --> 02:50:58,560
working environment. Let's say if
 

7693
02:50:58,560 --> 02:50:59,910
working environment. Let's say if
everyone's looking at the same thing, it

7694
02:50:59,910 --> 02:50:59,920
everyone's looking at the same thing, it
 

7695
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:01,830
everyone's looking at the same thing, it
means they can call out trades which

7696
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:01,840
means they can call out trades which
 

7697
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:03,590
means they can call out trades which
they're seeing and other traders can be

7698
02:51:03,590 --> 02:51:03,600
they're seeing and other traders can be
 

7699
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:05,830
they're seeing and other traders can be
like, "Yeah, I like that." Or, "Uh, have

7700
02:51:05,830 --> 02:51:05,840
like, "Yeah, I like that." Or, "Uh, have
 

7701
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:07,030
like, "Yeah, I like that." Or, "Uh, have
you thought about this?" Because they've

7702
02:51:07,030 --> 02:51:07,040
you thought about this?" Because they've
 

7703
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:08,309
you thought about this?" Because they've
all done the same course. I think

7704
02:51:08,309 --> 02:51:08,319
all done the same course. I think
 

7705
02:51:08,319 --> 02:51:10,710
all done the same course. I think
Discords fail when they're free or

7706
02:51:10,710 --> 02:51:10,720
Discords fail when they're free or
 

7707
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:12,630
Discords fail when they're free or
they're monthly with no indic uh

7708
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:12,640
they're monthly with no indic uh

education. You get everyone trading in a

7710
02:51:14,790 --> 02:51:14,800
education. You get everyone trading in a
 

7711
02:51:14,800 --> 02:51:16,870
education. You get everyone trading in a
completely different way, arguing and

7712
02:51:16,870 --> 02:51:16,880
completely different way, arguing and
 

7713
02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:18,309
completely different way, arguing and
bitching with each other, and it causes

7714
02:51:18,309 --> 02:51:18,319
bitching with each other, and it causes
 

7715
02:51:18,319 --> 02:51:19,910
bitching with each other, and it causes
a nightmare. That's me talking from

7716
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:19,920
a nightmare. That's me talking from
 

7717
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:22,309
a nightmare. That's me talking from
personal experience. I've been part of

7718
02:51:22,309 --> 02:51:22,319
personal experience. I've been part of
 

7719
02:51:22,319 --> 02:51:23,990
personal experience. I've been part of
other Discords as a student, part of

7720
02:51:23,990 --> 02:51:24,000
other Discords as a student, part of
 

7721
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:25,910
other Discords as a student, part of
other Discords as a mentor. And the best

7722
02:51:25,910 --> 02:51:25,920
other Discords as a mentor. And the best
 

7723
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:27,990
other Discords as a mentor. And the best
way to do it is to have

7724
02:51:27,990 --> 02:51:28,000
way to do it is to have
 

7725
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,750
way to do it is to have
just everyone on the same page. That's

7726
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:29,760
just everyone on the same page. That's
 

7727
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:31,670
just everyone on the same page. That's
my feeling. So that that's why, okay,

7728
02:51:31,670 --> 02:51:31,680
my feeling. So that that's why, okay,
 

7729
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:33,670
my feeling. So that that's why, okay,
folks, it's not about the money. It's

7730
02:51:33,670 --> 02:51:33,680
folks, it's not about the money. It's
 

7731
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:35,190
folks, it's not about the money. It's
that I need everyone to be trading the

7732
02:51:35,190 --> 02:51:35,200
that I need everyone to be trading the
 

7733
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:36,950
that I need everyone to be trading the
same way. It also means when I'm not

7734
02:51:36,950 --> 02:51:36,960
same way. It also means when I'm not
 

7735
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:39,910
same way. It also means when I'm not
there, there are guys who can step up

7736
02:51:39,910 --> 02:51:39,920
there, there are guys who can step up
 

7737
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:41,750
there, there are guys who can step up
and say, "Hey, this is what we're

7738
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:41,760
and say, "Hey, this is what we're
 

7739
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:43,349
and say, "Hey, this is what we're
looking at today because they understand

7740
02:51:43,349 --> 02:51:43,359
looking at today because they understand
 

7741
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:45,750
looking at today because they understand
the process, right? That's not to say my

7742
02:51:45,750 --> 02:51:45,760
the process, right? That's not to say my
 

7743
02:51:45,760 --> 02:51:47,990
the process, right? That's not to say my
process is the right way. There's tons

7744
02:51:47,990 --> 02:51:48,000
process is the right way. There's tons
 

7745
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,510
process is the right way. There's tons
of processes. There's tons of way to

7746
02:51:49,510 --> 02:51:49,520
of processes. There's tons of way to
 

7747
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:51,670
of processes. There's tons of way to
trade one ways of trading. But when I've

7748
02:51:51,670 --> 02:51:51,680
trade one ways of trading. But when I've
 

7749
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:53,510
trade one ways of trading. But when I've
got 200 plus people all trading the same

7750
02:51:53,510 --> 02:51:53,520
got 200 plus people all trading the same
 

7751
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:55,510
got 200 plus people all trading the same
way, it creates a very healthy

7752
02:51:55,510 --> 02:51:55,520
way, it creates a very healthy
 

7753
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:57,190
way, it creates a very healthy
environment." All right. So, that's the

7754
02:51:57,190 --> 02:51:57,200
environment." All right. So, that's the
 

7755
02:51:57,200 --> 02:52:01,510
environment." All right. So, that's the
only reason, guys. All right. Let's do

7756
02:52:01,510 --> 02:52:01,520
only reason, guys. All right. Let's do
 

7757
02:52:01,520 --> 02:52:02,950
only reason, guys. All right. Let's do
How do we find out if you're on

7758
02:52:02,950 --> 02:52:02,960
How do we find out if you're on

7761
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:07,110

on tomorrow, I will post a live stream.

7762
02:52:07,110 --> 02:52:07,120
on tomorrow, I will post a live stream.
 

7763
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:09,670

Okay. Um, you're getting a bit wiggly

7764
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:09,680
Okay. Um, you're getting a bit wiggly
 

7765
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:11,190
Okay. Um, you're getting a bit wiggly
here. So, there's the move into the low

7766
02:52:11,190 --> 02:52:11,200
here. So, there's the move into the low
 

7767
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:12,630
here. So, there's the move into the low
volume node, which they just caught and

7768
02:52:12,630 --> 02:52:12,640
volume node, which they just caught and
 

7769
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:14,550
volume node, which they just caught and
trapped and they've instantly reclaimed

7770
02:52:14,550 --> 02:52:14,560
trapped and they've instantly reclaimed
 

7771
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:17,349
trapped and they've instantly reclaimed
here. So, buyers are still in control.

7772
02:52:17,349 --> 02:52:17,359
here. So, buyers are still in control.
 

7773
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:19,590
here. So, buyers are still in control.
This little trap here into this low

7774
02:52:19,590 --> 02:52:19,600
This little trap here into this low
 

7775
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:21,510
This little trap here into this low
volume node into the flow zones. Buyers

7776
02:52:21,510 --> 02:52:21,520
volume node into the flow zones. Buyers
 

7777
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:22,870
volume node into the flow zones. Buyers
are still in control. This is where they

7778
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:22,880
are still in control. This is where they
 

7779
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:25,510
are still in control. This is where they
want. They clearly want up here. is

7780

want. They clearly want up here. is
 

7781
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:27,269
want. They clearly want up here. is
absolutely clear as day. This is where

7782
02:52:27,269 --> 02:52:27,279
absolutely clear as day. This is where
 

7783
02:52:27,279 --> 02:52:29,670
absolutely clear as day. This is where
they want. So if you are a buyer, I

7784
02:52:29,670 --> 02:52:29,680
they want. So if you are a buyer, I
 

7785
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:31,510
they want. So if you are a buyer, I
would just be you probably not got much

7786
02:52:31,510 --> 02:52:31,520
would just be you probably not got much
 

7787
02:52:31,520 --> 02:52:33,990
would just be you probably not got much
left. Just sell into this push into

02:52:33,990 --> 02:52:34,000
left. Just sell into this push into
 

7789
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:35,910
left. Just sell into this push into
here. All right, you can hold like a

7790
02:52:35,910 --> 02:52:35,920
here. All right, you can hold like a
 

7791
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:38,630
here. All right, you can hold like a
tiny bit just in case we go all the way

02:52:38,630 --> 02:52:38,640
tiny bit just in case we go all the way
 

7793
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:40,150
tiny bit just in case we go all the way
up into the nines, but I would be

now, target is up here for runners. If

8020
02:58:36,469 --> 02:58:36,479
now, target is up here for runners. If
 

8021
02:58:36,479 --> 02:58:38,070
now, target is up here for runners. If
they're going to leave this volume

8022
02:58:38,070 --> 02:58:38,080
they're going to leave this volume
 

8023
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:39,670
they're going to leave this volume
trapped, then they're going to wash down

8024
02:58:39,670 --> 02:58:39,680
trapped, then they're going to wash down
 

8025
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:41,269
trapped, then they're going to wash down
to here. But right now, we're very, very

8026
02:58:41,269 --> 02:58:41,279
to here. But right now, we're very, very
 

8027
02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:43,349
to here. But right now, we're very, very
bullish. But I use volume as an

8028
02:58:43,349 --> 02:58:43,359
bullish. But I use volume as an
 

8029
02:58:43,359 --> 02:58:45,110
bullish. But I use volume as an
indication of where we build liquidity

8030
02:58:45,110 --> 02:58:45,120
indication of where we build liquidity
 

8031
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:47,830
indication of where we build liquidity
and I use it to exit that liquidity and

8032
02:58:47,830 --> 02:58:47,840
and I use it to exit that liquidity and
 

8033
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:49,750
and I use it to exit that liquidity and
look for the next level. And I use

8034
02:58:49,750 --> 02:58:49,760
look for the next level. And I use
 

8035
02:58:49,760 --> 02:58:51,590
look for the next level. And I use
bookmap or footprints to see trap

It's only fair. All right, ES is

8518
03:13:01,670 --> 03:13:01,680
It's only fair. All right, ES is
 

8519
03:13:01,680 --> 03:13:02,710
It's only fair. All right, ES is
starting to break out. I'll sit here

8520
03:13:02,710 --> 03:13:02,720
starting to break out. I'll sit here
 

8521
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:04,230
starting to break out. I'll sit here
with you for a little bit longer. ES is

8522
03:13:04,230 --> 03:13:04,240
with you for a little bit longer. ES is
 

8523
03:13:04,240 --> 03:13:05,910
with you for a little bit longer. ES is
starting to break out. You left the

8524
03:13:05,910 --> 03:13:05,920
starting to break out. You left the
 

8525
03:13:05,920 --> 03:13:07,590
starting to break out. You left the
volume there. You haven't rejected the

8526
03:13:07,590 --> 03:13:07,600
volume there. You haven't rejected the
 

8527
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:09,510
volume there. You haven't rejected the
volume there. So, like if you were going

8528
03:13:09,510 --> 03:13:09,520
volume there. So, like if you were going
 

8529
03:13:09,520 --> 03:13:11,269
volume there. So, like if you were going
to be short, you've probably already

8530
03:13:11,269 --> 03:13:11,279
to be short, you've probably already
 

8531
03:13:11,279 --> 03:13:12,950
to be short, you've probably already
stopped out. It needs to leave this. All

8532
03:13:12,950 --> 03:13:12,960
stopped out. It needs to leave this. All
 

8533
03:13:12,960 --> 03:13:14,389
stopped out. It needs to leave this. All
right. It needs to do this if you're

8534
03:13:14,389 --> 03:13:14,399
right. It needs to do this if you're
 

8535
03:13:14,399 --> 03:13:15,750
right. It needs to do this if you're
going to leave. We're building a new

8536
03:13:15,750 --> 03:13:15,760
going to leave. We're building a new
 

8537
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:17,429
going to leave. We're building a new
little base hit. It has got a target

8538
03:13:17,429 --> 03:13:17,439
little base hit. It has got a target
 

8539
03:13:17,439 --> 03:13:19,990
little base hit. It has got a target
above and ES is still going. All right.

8540
03:13:19,990 --> 03:13:20,000
above and ES is still going. All right.
 

8541
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:23,110
above and ES is still going. All right.
So, the strength on ES is still there.

8542
03:13:23,110 --> 03:13:23,120
So, the strength on ES is still there.
 

8543
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:24,950
So, the strength on ES is still there.
What just happened there? The strength

8544
03:13:24,950 --> 03:13:24,960
What just happened there? The strength
 

8545
03:13:24,960 --> 03:13:28,950
What just happened there? The strength
on ES is still there. Um,

8546
03:13:28,950 --> 03:13:28,960
on ES is still there. Um,
 

8547
03:13:28,960 --> 03:13:30,950
on ES is still there. Um,
I would say your point of control just

8548
03:13:30,950 --> 03:13:30,960
I would say your point of control just
 

8549
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:32,950
I would say your point of control just
shifted up as well. So, if you start to

8550
03:13:32,950 --> 03:13:32,960
shifted up as well. So, if you start to
 

8551
03:13:32,960 --> 03:13:34,870
shifted up as well. So, if you start to
leave this, there is a drift down into

8552
03:13:34,870 --> 03:13:34,880
leave this, there is a drift down into
 

8553
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:36,710
leave this, there is a drift down into
these, right? I wouldn't be bearish

8554
03:13:36,710 --> 03:13:36,720
these, right? I wouldn't be bearish
 

8555
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:38,550
these, right? I wouldn't be bearish
underneath that unless you really build

8556
03:13:38,550 --> 03:13:38,560
underneath that unless you really build
 

8557
03:13:38,560 --> 03:13:40,790
underneath that unless you really build
out. You're starting to see this this

8558
03:13:40,790 --> 03:13:40,800
out. You're starting to see this this
 

8559
03:13:40,800 --> 03:13:43,670
out. You're starting to see this this
gray box. They probably wicked you out.

8560
03:13:43,670 --> 03:13:43,680
gray box. They probably wicked you out.
 

8561
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:45,110
gray box. They probably wicked you out.
All right. So, if you were short here

8562
03:13:45,110 --> 03:13:45,120
All right. So, if you were short here
 

8563
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:46,550
All right. So, if you were short here
risking the other side of that, you

8564
03:13:46,550 --> 03:13:46,560
risking the other side of that, you
 

8565
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:47,990
risking the other side of that, you
probably just got wicked out. It's

8566
03:13:47,990 --> 03:13:48,000
probably just got wicked out. It's
 

8567
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:49,590
probably just got wicked out. It's
possible that you can have another go if

8568
03:13:49,590 --> 03:13:49,600
possible that you can have another go if
 

8569
03:13:49,600 --> 03:13:51,349
possible that you can have another go if
they if they let it go. They're being a

8570
03:13:51,349 --> 03:13:51,359
they if they let it go. They're being a
 

8571
03:13:51,359 --> 03:13:53,030
they if they let it go. They're being a
bit dirty today on ENQ, but it's

8572
03:13:53,030 --> 03:13:53,040
bit dirty today on ENQ, but it's
 

8573
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:55,190
bit dirty today on ENQ, but it's
probably because it's very low on volume

8574
03:13:55,190 --> 03:13:55,200
probably because it's very low on volume
 

8575
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:56,870
probably because it's very low on volume
and liquidity, and there's still a

8576
03:13:56,870 --> 03:13:56,880
and liquidity, and there's still a
 

8577
03:13:56,880 --> 03:13:59,510
and liquidity, and there's still a
target above. So, I'd be super careful

8578
03:13:59,510 --> 03:13:59,520
target above. So, I'd be super careful
 

8579
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:01,590
target above. So, I'd be super careful
about being bearish up here, right?

8580
03:14:01,590 --> 03:14:01,600
about being bearish up here, right?
 

8581
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:05,510
about being bearish up here, right?
Super careful.

8582
03:14:05,510 --> 03:14:05,520

the right of the ch uh chart. This is

8598
03:14:26,950 --> 03:14:26,960
the right of the ch uh chart. This is
 

8599
03:14:26,960 --> 03:14:28,790
the right of the ch uh chart. This is
anchored, right? This is anchored volume

8600
03:14:28,790 --> 03:14:28,800
anchored, right? This is anchored volume
 

8601
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:30,710
anchored, right? This is anchored volume
profile, right? So, if you want to get

8602
03:14:30,710 --> 03:14:30,720
profile, right? So, if you want to get
 

8603
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:33,750
profile, right? So, if you want to get
that, you need to come into here. Is it

8604
03:14:33,750 --> 03:14:33,760
that, you need to come into here. Is it
 

8605
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:35,349
that, you need to come into here. Is it
this one or is it this one? I always get

8606
03:14:35,349 --> 03:14:35,359
this one or is it this one? I always get
 

8607
03:14:35,359 --> 03:14:37,349
this one or is it this one? I always get
confused. This one. Okay. Okay. So, 1 2

8608
03:14:37,349 --> 03:14:37,359
confused. This one. Okay. Okay. So, 1 2
 

8609
03:14:37,359 --> 03:14:40,790
confused. This one. Okay. Okay. So, 1 2
3 4 5 down into here into projections

8610
03:14:40,790 --> 03:14:40,800
3 4 5 down into here into projections
 

8611
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:42,710
3 4 5 down into here into projections
anchored volume profile. And I just had

8612
03:14:42,710 --> 03:14:42,720
anchored volume profile. And I just had
 

8613
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:45,750
anchored volume profile. And I just had
that anchored from 9:30. All right. So,

8614
03:14:45,750 --> 03:14:45,760
that anchored from 9:30. All right. So,
 

8615
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:47,510
that anchored from 9:30. All right. So,
what you're looking at is what I call

8616
03:14:47,510 --> 03:14:47,520
what you're looking at is what I call
 

8617
03:14:47,520 --> 03:14:50,070
what you're looking at is what I call
cash. The reason I call it cash is it's

8618
03:14:50,070 --> 03:14:50,080
cash. The reason I call it cash is it's
 

8619
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:51,830
cash. The reason I call it cash is it's
the cash market. So, from the New York

8620
03:14:51,830 --> 03:14:51,840
the cash market. So, from the New York
 

8621
03:14:51,840 --> 03:14:53,750
the cash market. So, from the New York
open, this is looks like a very good

8622
03:14:53,750 --> 03:14:53,760
open, this is looks like a very good
 

8623
03:14:53,760 --> 03:14:55,429
open, this is looks like a very good
trend day right now. But this is thin in

8624
03:14:55,429 --> 03:14:55,439
trend day right now. But this is thin in
 

8625
03:14:55,439 --> 03:14:58,070
trend day right now. But this is thin in
here. If you leave this, the only short

8626
03:14:58,070 --> 03:14:58,080
here. If you leave this, the only short
 

8627
03:14:58,080 --> 03:14:59,830
here. If you leave this, the only short
opportunity right now is here. Just know

8628
03:14:59,830 --> 03:14:59,840
opportunity right now is here. Just know
 

8629
03:14:59,840 --> 03:15:01,429
opportunity right now is here. Just know
that they haven't taken this liquidity

8630
03:15:01,429 --> 03:15:01,439
that they haven't taken this liquidity
 

8631
03:15:01,439 --> 03:15:03,510
that they haven't taken this liquidity
yet. I'd say the only short opportunity

8632
03:15:03,510 --> 03:15:03,520
yet. I'd say the only short opportunity
 

8633
03:15:03,520 --> 03:15:04,870
yet. I'd say the only short opportunity
is down into there. If you get a

8634
03:15:04,870 --> 03:15:04,880
is down into there. If you get a
 

8635
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:06,870
is down into there. If you get a
collapse under here, maybe you get very

8636
03:15:06,870 --> 03:15:06,880
collapse under here, maybe you get very
 

8637
03:15:06,880 --> 03:15:08,550
collapse under here, maybe you get very
lucky and get into this. Um, but they

8638
03:15:08,550 --> 03:15:08,560
lucky and get into this. Um, but they
 

8639
03:15:08,560 --> 03:15:11,110
lucky and get into this. Um, but they
can. Any short today is counter trend. I

8640
03:15:11,110 --> 03:15:11,120
can. Any short today is counter trend. I
 

8641
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:13,190
can. Any short today is counter trend. I
want to make that clear. All right. You

8642
03:15:13,190 --> 03:15:13,200
want to make that clear. All right. You
 

8643
03:15:13,200 --> 03:15:15,030
want to make that clear. All right. You
are above initial balance. You are above

8644
03:15:15,030 --> 03:15:15,040
are above initial balance. You are above
 

8645
03:15:15,040 --> 03:15:17,590
are above initial balance. You are above
opening range. You are above this level

8646
03:15:17,590 --> 03:15:17,600
opening range. You are above this level
 

8647
03:15:17,600 --> 03:15:19,429
opening range. You are above this level
here. It's counter trend. So, if you're

8648
03:15:19,429 --> 03:15:19,439
here. It's counter trend. So, if you're
 

8649
03:15:19,439 --> 03:15:21,349
here. It's counter trend. So, if you're
going to be adamant on taking this, it's

8650
03:15:21,349 --> 03:15:21,359
going to be adamant on taking this, it's
 

8651
03:15:21,359 --> 03:15:22,870
going to be adamant on taking this, it's
counter trend. You better be aggressive

8652
03:15:22,870 --> 03:15:22,880
counter trend. You better be aggressive
 

8653
03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:25,030
counter trend. You better be aggressive
with your stops because this is where

8654
03:15:25,030 --> 03:15:25,040
with your stops because this is where
 

8655
03:15:25,040 --> 03:15:26,950

they want to come. They are trying to

03:15:30,710 --> 03:15:30,720
they trap too many buyers here? Leave
 

8661
03:15:30,720 --> 03:15:32,710
they trap too many buyers here? Leave
them and do this move. I don't know.

It's what the flow zones are. Rolling

8746
03:17:34,870 --> 03:17:34,880
It's what the flow zones are. Rolling
 

8747
03:17:34,880 --> 03:17:41,990
It's what the flow zones are. Rolling
fibs. They're useful.

8748
03:17:41,990 --> 03:17:42,000

 

8749
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:44,309

The chat slacks.

8750
03:17:44,309 --> 03:17:44,319
The chat slacks.
 

8751
03:17:44,319 --> 03:17:48,150
The chat slacks.
Oh, it's uh delayed, is it? Yeah. I

8752
03:17:48,150 --> 03:17:48,160
Oh, it's uh delayed, is it? Yeah. I
 

8753
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:49,590
Oh, it's uh delayed, is it? Yeah. I
didn't know how much by. Hopefully not

8754
03:17:49,590 --> 03:17:49,600
didn't know how much by. Hopefully not
 

8755
03:17:49,600 --> 03:17:51,510
didn't know how much by. Hopefully not
too much.

8756
03:17:51,510 --> 03:17:51,520
too much.
 

8757
03:17:51,520 --> 03:17:54,710
too much.
No worries, Jeremiah. Right. So these

8758
03:17:54,710 --> 03:17:54,720
No worries, Jeremiah. Right. So these
 

8759
03:17:54,720 --> 03:17:56,229
No worries, Jeremiah. Right. So these
are the only players I would not be a

8760
03:17:56,229 --> 03:17:56,239
are the only players I would not be a
 

8761
03:17:56,239 --> 03:17:58,469
are the only players I would not be a
new money long, right? So you're either

8762
03:17:58,469 --> 03:17:58,479
new money long, right? So you're either
 

8763
03:17:58,479 --> 03:18:00,870
new money long, right? So you're either
long from all the way down here that we

8764
03:18:00,870 --> 03:18:00,880
long from all the way down here that we
 

8765
03:18:00,880 --> 03:18:02,229
long from all the way down here that we
talked about. Some of you took this

8766
03:18:02,229 --> 03:18:02,239
talked about. Some of you took this
 

8767
03:18:02,239 --> 03:18:04,389
talked about. Some of you took this
long. I mean, this was a fantastic long

8768
03:18:04,389 --> 03:18:04,399
long. I mean, this was a fantastic long
 

8769
03:18:04,399 --> 03:18:06,630
long. I mean, this was a fantastic long
on the reclaim. That's the best long of

8770
03:18:06,630 --> 03:18:06,640
on the reclaim. That's the best long of
 

8771
03:18:06,640 --> 03:18:07,990
on the reclaim. That's the best long of
the day. The next best long of the day

8772
03:18:07,990 --> 03:18:08,000
the day. The next best long of the day
 

8773
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:10,070
the day. The next best long of the day
was this in here that we called out. You

8774
03:18:10,070 --> 03:18:10,080
was this in here that we called out. You
 

8775
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:11,349
was this in here that we called out. You
don't want to be long up here. All

8776
03:18:11,349 --> 03:18:11,359
don't want to be long up here. All
 

8777
03:18:11,359 --> 03:18:13,269
don't want to be long up here. All
right? You do not want to be long up

8778
03:18:13,269 --> 03:18:13,279
right? You do not want to be long up
 

8779
03:18:13,279 --> 03:18:14,950
right? You do not want to be long up
here. You want to be selling your

8780
03:18:14,950 --> 03:18:14,960
here. You want to be selling your
 

8781
03:18:14,960 --> 03:18:16,950
here. You want to be selling your
profits. And you can only exit. You can

8782
03:18:16,950 --> 03:18:16,960
profits. And you can only exit. You can
 

8783
03:18:16,960 --> 03:18:18,309
profits. And you can only exit. You can
only look for a short if we're going to

8784
03:18:18,309 --> 03:18:18,319
only look for a short if we're going to
 

8785
03:18:18,319 --> 03:18:21,429
only look for a short if we're going to
do this or if you see something where we

8786
03:18:21,429 --> 03:18:21,439
do this or if you see something where we
 

8787
03:18:21,439 --> 03:18:23,510
do this or if you see something where we
do some kind of blowoff, right? where we

8788
03:18:23,510 --> 03:18:23,520
do some kind of blowoff, right? where we
 

8789
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:25,590
do some kind of blowoff, right? where we
do something like maybe we run this and

8790
03:18:25,590 --> 03:18:25,600
do something like maybe we run this and
 

8791
03:18:25,600 --> 03:18:27,750
do something like maybe we run this and
trap more up here and then you'd have to

8792
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:27,760
trap more up here and then you'd have to
 

8793
03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:30,070
trap more up here and then you'd have to
cover into this and this. You have to

8794
03:18:30,070 --> 03:18:30,080
cover into this and this. You have to
 

8795
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:32,950
cover into this and this. You have to
respect the nodes, right? You have to

8796
03:18:32,950 --> 03:18:32,960
respect the nodes, right? You have to
 

8797
03:18:32,960 --> 03:18:36,150
respect the nodes, right? You have to
expect all of these to hold. Traps can

8798
03:18:36,150 --> 03:18:36,160
expect all of these to hold. Traps can
 

8799
03:18:36,160 --> 03:18:37,830
expect all of these to hold. Traps can
live in here, but if they die, then I

8800
03:18:37,830 --> 03:18:37,840
live in here, but if they die, then I
 

8801
03:18:37,840 --> 03:18:40,389
live in here, but if they die, then I
expect to come down to this point.

8802
03:18:40,389 --> 03:18:40,399
expect to come down to this point.
 

8803
03:18:40,399 --> 03:18:42,710
expect to come down to this point.
That would be some decent relief because

8804
03:18:42,710 --> 03:18:42,720
That would be some decent relief because
 

8805
03:18:42,720 --> 03:18:45,269
That would be some decent relief because
this is quite a big swing. 100 plus

8806
03:18:45,269 --> 03:18:45,279
this is quite a big swing. 100 plus
 

8807
03:18:45,279 --> 03:18:47,830
this is quite a big swing. 100 plus
points and it'll be a third of a relief,

8808
03:18:47,830 --> 03:18:47,840
points and it'll be a third of a relief,
 

8809
03:18:47,840 --> 03:18:49,910
points and it'll be a third of a relief,
which is somewhat warranted right now. I

8810
03:18:49,910 --> 03:18:49,920
which is somewhat warranted right now. I
 

8811
03:18:49,920 --> 03:18:52,469
which is somewhat warranted right now. I
would say

8812
03:18:52,469 --> 03:18:52,479
would say
 

8813
03:18:52,479 --> 03:18:54,389
would say
the markets have been so unkind this

8814
03:18:54,389 --> 03:18:54,399
the markets have been so unkind this
 

8815
03:18:54,399 --> 03:18:56,229
the markets have been so unkind this
month. I don't know what to believe

8816
03:18:56,229 --> 03:18:56,239
month. I don't know what to believe
 

8817
03:18:56,239 --> 03:18:58,389
month. I don't know what to believe
anymore. Shorting or longing? Now, you

8818
03:18:58,389 --> 03:18:58,399
anymore. Shorting or longing? Now, you
 

8819
03:18:58,399 --> 03:18:59,990
anymore. Shorting or longing? Now, you
need to think about both, right? When

8820
03:18:59,990 --> 03:19:00,000
need to think about both, right? When
 

8821
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:01,349
need to think about both, right? When
we're in balance, you need to be

8822
03:19:01,349 --> 03:19:01,359
we're in balance, you need to be
 

8823
03:19:01,359 --> 03:19:03,110
we're in balance, you need to be
prepared to not have too much of a bias

8824
03:19:03,110 --> 03:19:03,120
prepared to not have too much of a bias
 

8825
03:19:03,120 --> 03:19:05,670
prepared to not have too much of a bias
and be willing to play both.

8826
03:19:05,670 --> 03:19:05,680
and be willing to play both.
 

8827
03:19:05,680 --> 03:19:09,349
and be willing to play both.
What course platform do I use?

8828
03:19:09,349 --> 03:19:09,359
What course platform do I use?
 

8829
03:19:09,359 --> 03:19:12,870
What course platform do I use?
Think thick or smart? Uh neither. I use

8830
03:19:12,870 --> 03:19:12,880
Think thick or smart? Uh neither. I use
 

8831
03:19:12,880 --> 03:19:15,590
Think thick or smart? Uh neither. I use
uh I just moved to go high level. Before

8832
03:19:15,590 --> 03:19:15,600
uh I just moved to go high level. Before
 

8833
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:17,349
uh I just moved to go high level. Before
that, I was at Teachable. Everything I

8834
03:19:17,349 --> 03:19:17,359
that, I was at Teachable. Everything I
 

8835
03:19:17,359 --> 03:19:19,030
that, I was at Teachable. Everything I
do is at goh high level now. So it's all

do is at goh high level now. So it's all
in one place. So

8838
03:19:23,030 --> 03:19:23,040

 

8839
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:25,269

here.
There we go.

8844
03:19:31,830 --> 03:19:31,840

 

8845
03:19:31,840 --> 03:19:34,229

Ticks per row. Two ticks per row. I

8846
03:19:34,229 --> 03:19:34,239
Ticks per row. Two ticks per row. I
 

8847
03:19:34,239 --> 03:19:35,429
Ticks per row. Two ticks per row. I
leave everything else. Everything else

8848
03:19:35,429 --> 03:19:35,439
leave everything else. Everything else
 

8849
03:19:35,439 --> 03:19:37,110
leave everything else. Everything else
is the same. And then I just place it on

8850
03:19:37,110 --> 03:19:37,120
is the same. And then I just place it on
 

8851
03:19:37,120 --> 03:19:38,630
is the same. And then I just place it on
the right. Right. Anchored volume

8852
03:19:38,630 --> 03:19:38,640
the right. Right. Anchored volume
 

8853
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:41,750
the right. Right. Anchored volume

profile. Everything else is the same,
 

8855
03:19:41,760 --> 03:19:43,349

03:19:43,349 --> 03:19:43,359
guys. This is all I change. Ticks per
 

8857
03:19:43,359 --> 03:19:44,870
guys. This is all I change. Ticks per
row. If you want to do numbers of rows,

8858
03:19:44,870 --> 03:19:44,880
row. If you want to do numbers of rows,
 

8859
03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:47,190
row. If you want to do numbers of rows,
I would just do it to a th00and. You are

8860
03:19:47,190 --> 03:19:47,200
I would just do it to a th00and. You are
 

8861
03:19:47,200 --> 03:19:48,630
I would just do it to a th00and. You are
starting to see a bit of a rejection of

8862
03:19:48,630 --> 03:19:48,640
starting to see a bit of a rejection of
 

8863
03:19:48,640 --> 03:19:51,190
starting to see a bit of a rejection of
this volume up here. This gray box. They

8864
03:19:51,190 --> 03:19:51,200
this volume up here. This gray box. They
 

8865
03:19:51,200 --> 03:19:54,790
this volume up here. This gray box. They
are struggling to get back through this.

8866
03:19:54,790 --> 03:19:54,800
are struggling to get back through this.
 

8867
03:19:54,800 --> 03:19:59,190
are struggling to get back through this.
What time is that?

03:20:39,349 --> 03:20:39,359
write some cards,
 

8901
03:20:39,359 --> 03:20:41,830
write some cards,
all that good stuff.

8902
03:20:41,830 --> 03:20:41,840
all that good stuff.
 

8903
03:20:41,840 --> 03:20:44,790
all that good stuff.
Be a husband, be a good dog dad, all

Be a husband, be a good dog dad, all
 

8905
03:20:44,800 --> 03:20:46,710
Be a husband, be a good dog dad, all
that stuff. Back into this gray box

8906
03:20:46,710 --> 03:20:46,720
that stuff. Back into this gray box
 

8907
03:20:46,720 --> 03:20:48,950
that stuff. Back into this gray box
again. ES is still going. New high

8908
03:20:48,950 --> 03:20:48,960
again. ES is still going. New high
 

8909
03:20:48,960 --> 03:20:51,030
again. ES is still going. New high
coming here on ES. Relative strength

8910
03:20:51,030 --> 03:20:51,040
coming here on ES. Relative strength
 

8911
03:20:51,040 --> 03:20:57,590
coming here on ES. Relative strength
over there.

8912
03:20:57,590 --> 03:20:57,600

 

8913
03:20:57,600 --> 03:20:59,349

Yeah, go high level is really good, man.

8914
03:20:59,349 --> 03:20:59,359
Yeah, go high level is really good, man.
 

8915
03:20:59,359 --> 03:21:02,389
Yeah, go high level is really good, man.
It took me a while to move, but um

8916
03:21:02,389 --> 03:21:02,399
It took me a while to move, but um
 

8917
03:21:02,399 --> 03:21:03,910
It took me a while to move, but um
you're obviously into this stuff. Future

8918
03:21:03,910 --> 03:21:03,920
you're obviously into this stuff. Future
 

8919
03:21:03,920 --> 03:21:05,670
you're obviously into this stuff. Future
if basically I had all my stuff split

8920
03:21:05,670 --> 03:21:05,680
if basically I had all my stuff split
 

8921
03:21:05,680 --> 03:21:08,710
if basically I had all my stuff split
between loads of different um platforms.

8922
03:21:08,710 --> 03:21:08,720
between loads of different um platforms.
 

8923
03:21:08,720 --> 03:21:11,670
between loads of different um platforms.
Um so it's still I'm learning it, but

8924
03:21:11,670 --> 03:21:11,680
Um so it's still I'm learning it, but
 

8925
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:13,349
Um so it's still I'm learning it, but
it's really good because they can host

8926
03:21:13,349 --> 03:21:13,359
it's really good because they can host
 

8927
03:21:13,359 --> 03:21:16,389
it's really good because they can host
websites. They do all your CRM. It's

8928
03:21:16,389 --> 03:21:16,399
websites. They do all your CRM. It's
 

8929
03:21:16,399 --> 03:21:19,670
websites. They do all your CRM. It's
like the funnels are strong on it. Um

8930
03:21:19,670 --> 03:21:19,680
like the funnels are strong on it. Um
 

8931
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:21,349
like the funnels are strong on it. Um
I'm barely I've barely scratched the

8932
03:21:21,349 --> 03:21:21,359
I'm barely I've barely scratched the
 

8933
03:21:21,359 --> 03:21:26,630
I'm barely I've barely scratched the
surface with it, but it's pretty good.

8934
03:21:26,630 --> 03:21:26,640

 

8935
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:29,349

Long to 27800. That's your final target.

8936
03:21:29,349 --> 03:21:29,359
Long to 27800. That's your final target.
 

8937
03:21:29,359 --> 03:21:31,670
Long to 27800. That's your final target.
Yeah, your final basically this area

8938
03:21:31,670 --> 03:21:31,680
Yeah, your final basically this area
 

8939
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:33,750
Yeah, your final basically this area
here is where bulls were trapped

8940
03:21:33,750 --> 03:21:33,760
here is where bulls were trapped
 

8941
03:21:33,760 --> 03:21:35,910
here is where bulls were trapped
yesterday, right? So this is your final

8942
03:21:35,910 --> 03:21:35,920
yesterday, right? So this is your final
 

8943
03:21:35,920 --> 03:21:37,910
yesterday, right? So this is your final
target on your long. So if you were long

8944
03:21:37,910 --> 03:21:37,920
target on your long. So if you were long
 

8945
03:21:37,920 --> 03:21:40,150
target on your long. So if you were long
from

8946
03:21:40,150 --> 03:21:40,160
from
 

8947
03:21:40,160 --> 03:21:42,550
from
what was the entry we get this morning?

8948
03:21:42,550 --> 03:21:42,560
what was the entry we get this morning?
 

8949
03:21:42,560 --> 03:21:45,110
what was the entry we get this morning?
If you were long from this entry here,

8950
03:21:45,110 --> 03:21:45,120
If you were long from this entry here,
 

8951
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:46,710
If you were long from this entry here,
all right, this is your final target.

8952
03:21:46,710 --> 03:21:46,720
all right, this is your final target.
 

8953
03:21:46,720 --> 03:21:49,269
all right, this is your final target.
You should be down to 5 to 10% I would

8954
03:21:49,269 --> 03:21:49,279
You should be down to 5 to 10% I would
 

8955
03:21:49,279 --> 03:21:51,030
You should be down to 5 to 10% I would
say, right? Because you probably sold

8956
03:21:51,030 --> 03:21:51,040
say, right? Because you probably sold
 

8957
03:21:51,040 --> 03:21:53,110
say, right? Because you probably sold
some, sold some, sold some, you're into

8958
03:21:53,110 --> 03:21:53,120
some, sold some, sold some, you're into
 

8959
03:21:53,120 --> 03:21:54,630
some, sold some, sold some, you're into
a runner now. If it gets up there,

8960
03:21:54,630 --> 03:21:54,640
a runner now. If it gets up there,
 

8961
03:21:54,640 --> 03:21:57,269
a runner now. If it gets up there,
great. But we it doesn't have to get up

8962
03:21:57,269 --> 03:21:57,279
great. But we it doesn't have to get up
 

8963
03:21:57,279 --> 03:21:59,429
great. But we it doesn't have to get up
there. And I wouldn't be long up here. I

8964
03:21:59,429 --> 03:21:59,439
there. And I wouldn't be long up here. I
 

8965
03:21:59,439 --> 03:22:01,190
there. And I wouldn't be long up here. I
you do not want to as in you don't want

8966
03:22:01,190 --> 03:22:01,200
you do not want to as in you don't want
 

8967
03:22:01,200 --> 03:22:03,670
you do not want to as in you don't want
to start a new entry here. The entry was

8968
03:22:03,670 --> 03:22:03,680
to start a new entry here. The entry was
 

8969
03:22:03,680 --> 03:22:06,630
to start a new entry here. The entry was
down here or even better

8970
03:22:06,630 --> 03:22:06,640
down here or even better
 

8971
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:08,550
down here or even better
this failure to break lower. Okay? But

8972
03:22:08,550 --> 03:22:08,560
this failure to break lower. Okay? But
 

8973
03:22:08,560 --> 03:22:10,070
this failure to break lower. Okay? But
that was the first entry since your

8974
03:22:10,070 --> 03:22:10,080
that was the first entry since your
 

8975
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:11,750
that was the first entry since your
entry is down in this region. You don't

8976
03:22:11,750 --> 03:22:11,760
entry is down in this region. You don't
 

8977
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:13,190
entry is down in this region. You don't
want to be getting long here. If it goes

8978
03:22:13,190 --> 03:22:13,200
want to be getting long here. If it goes
 

8979
03:22:13,200 --> 03:22:15,590
want to be getting long here. If it goes
higher, then it goes higher. It is what

8980
03:22:15,590 --> 03:22:15,600
higher, then it goes higher. It is what
 

8981
03:22:15,600 --> 03:22:18,229
higher, then it goes higher. It is what
it is. But this is a poor entry for a

8982
03:22:18,229 --> 03:22:18,239
it is. But this is a poor entry for a
 

8983
03:22:18,239 --> 03:22:20,630
it is. But this is a poor entry for a
long. Very poor entry for a long up

8984
03:22:20,630 --> 03:22:20,640
long. Very poor entry for a long up
 

8985
03:22:20,640 --> 03:22:22,710
long. Very poor entry for a long up
here. Even if it goes higher without

8986
03:22:22,710 --> 03:22:22,720
here. Even if it goes higher without
 

8987
03:22:22,720 --> 03:22:24,550
here. Even if it goes higher without
you, just be okay with that. You stick

8988
03:22:24,550 --> 03:22:24,560
you, just be okay with that. You stick
 

8989
03:22:24,560 --> 03:22:29,269
you, just be okay with that. You stick
to the process.

8990
03:22:29,269 --> 03:22:29,279

 

8991
03:22:29,279 --> 03:22:31,190

I try. [laughter]

8992
03:22:31,190 --> 03:22:31,200
I try. [laughter]
 

8993
03:22:31,200 --> 03:22:33,269
I try. [laughter]
I try. Sometimes I'm I'm good. Sometimes

8994
03:22:33,269 --> 03:22:33,279
I try. Sometimes I'm I'm good. Sometimes
 

8995
03:22:33,279 --> 03:22:35,190
I try. Sometimes I'm I'm good. Sometimes
I feel like I get it wrong. There you

8996
03:22:35,190 --> 03:22:35,200
I feel like I get it wrong. There you
 

8997
03:22:35,200 --> 03:22:36,950
I feel like I get it wrong. There you
go. Rejection of volume. So this is the

8998
03:22:36,950 --> 03:22:36,960
go. Rejection of volume. So this is the
 

8999
03:22:36,960 --> 03:22:38,790
go. Rejection of volume. So this is the
gray box. First time now. Going to

9000
03:22:38,790 --> 03:22:38,800
gray box. First time now. Going to
 

9001
03:22:38,800 --> 03:22:40,950
gray box. First time now. Going to
repric some of this thin volume. We can

9002
03:22:40,950 --> 03:22:40,960
repric some of this thin volume. We can
 

9003
03:22:40,960 --> 03:22:42,630
repric some of this thin volume. We can
have a look on footprint where we might

9004
03:22:42,630 --> 03:22:42,640
have a look on footprint where we might
 

9005
03:22:42,640 --> 03:22:46,309
have a look on footprint where we might
price to.

9006
03:22:46,309 --> 03:22:46,319

 

9007
03:22:46,319 --> 03:22:50,150

Okay. So first imbalance here right. So

9008
03:22:50,150 --> 03:22:50,160
Okay. So first imbalance here right. So
 

9009
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:51,910
Okay. So first imbalance here right. So
how we act here becomes key and if we

9010
03:22:51,910 --> 03:22:51,920
how we act here becomes key and if we
 

9011
03:22:51,920 --> 03:22:57,429
how we act here becomes key and if we
get through this right if we reject this

9012
03:22:57,429 --> 03:22:57,439

 

9013
03:22:57,439 --> 03:22:59,590

this is possible

9014
03:22:59,590 --> 03:22:59,600
this is possible
 

9015
03:22:59,600 --> 03:23:02,150
this is possible
and we got buyers trapped up here. So

9016
03:23:02,150 --> 03:23:02,160
and we got buyers trapped up here. So
 

9017
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:03,429
and we got buyers trapped up here. So
this move here. So remember we're

9018
03:23:03,429 --> 03:23:03,439
this move here. So remember we're
 

9019
03:23:03,439 --> 03:23:04,710
this move here. So remember we're
counter trend. If you're going to be

9020
03:23:04,710 --> 03:23:04,720
counter trend. If you're going to be
 

9021
03:23:04,720 --> 03:23:06,070
counter trend. If you're going to be
short here you're counter trend. This is

9022
03:23:06,070 --> 03:23:06,080
short here you're counter trend. This is
 

9023
03:23:06,080 --> 03:23:08,389
short here you're counter trend. This is
the gray box. If you're short here

9024
03:23:08,389 --> 03:23:08,399
the gray box. If you're short here
 

9025
03:23:08,399 --> 03:23:09,670
the gray box. If you're short here
you're counter trend. So you're partial

9026
03:23:09,670 --> 03:23:09,680
you're counter trend. So you're partial
 

9027
03:23:09,680 --> 03:23:12,150
you're counter trend. So you're partial
partial because you don't know when

9028
03:23:12,150 --> 03:23:12,160
partial because you don't know when
 

9029
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:14,150
partial because you don't know when
buyers come in because the main trend is

9030
03:23:14,150 --> 03:23:14,160
buyers come in because the main trend is
 

9031
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:16,309
buyers come in because the main trend is
up. So if you're counter trend, you are

9032
03:23:16,309 --> 03:23:16,319
up. So if you're counter trend, you are
 

9033
03:23:16,319 --> 03:23:18,150
up. So if you're counter trend, you are
taking money off the table or at least

9034
03:23:18,150 --> 03:23:18,160
taking money off the table or at least
 

9035
03:23:18,160 --> 03:23:20,229
taking money off the table or at least
you're moving your stops. We can see

9036
03:23:20,229 --> 03:23:20,239
you're moving your stops. We can see
 

9037
03:23:20,239 --> 03:23:23,030
you're moving your stops. We can see
this node right here that we've

9038
03:23:23,030 --> 03:23:23,040
this node right here that we've
 

9039
03:23:23,040 --> 03:23:25,510
this node right here that we've
identified here is now starting to act

9040
03:23:25,510 --> 03:23:25,520
identified here is now starting to act
 

9041
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:27,269
identified here is now starting to act
as resistance. They've had few attempts

9042
03:23:27,269 --> 03:23:27,279
as resistance. They've had few attempts
 

9043
03:23:27,279 --> 03:23:29,349
as resistance. They've had few attempts
to break through

9044
03:23:29,349 --> 03:23:29,359
to break through
 

9045
03:23:29,359 --> 03:23:31,590
to break through
this trade into here. I would be partial

9046
03:23:31,590 --> 03:23:31,600
this trade into here. I would be partial
 

9047
03:23:31,600 --> 03:23:33,830
this trade into here. I would be partial
one into this wick

9048
03:23:33,830 --> 03:23:33,840
one into this wick
 

9049
03:23:33,840 --> 03:23:36,150
one into this wick
and partial two into here, partial three

9050
03:23:36,150 --> 03:23:36,160
and partial two into here, partial three
 

9051
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:37,590
and partial two into here, partial three
into here. And if you got very lucky,

9052
03:23:37,590 --> 03:23:37,600
into here. And if you got very lucky,
 

9053
03:23:37,600 --> 03:23:39,830
into here. And if you got very lucky,
you come all the way down. I would find

9054
03:23:39,830 --> 03:23:39,840

So, someone asked, "How do I use volume

9178
03:25:58,309 --> 03:25:58,319
So, someone asked, "How do I use volume
 

9179
03:25:58,319 --> 03:25:59,910
So, someone asked, "How do I use volume
profile?" And I said, "I'll have to

9180
03:25:59,910 --> 03:25:59,920
profile?" And I said, "I'll have to
 

9181
03:25:59,920 --> 03:26:01,030
profile?" And I said, "I'll have to
teach you next time." Well, here's a

9182
03:26:01,030 --> 03:26:01,040
teach you next time." Well, here's a
 

9183
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:03,030
teach you next time." Well, here's a
good example, right? We're leaving trap

9184
03:26:03,030 --> 03:26:03,040
good example, right? We're leaving trap
 

9185
03:26:03,040 --> 03:26:07,910
good example, right? We're leaving trap
volume. We're trading. We're prot,

9186
03:26:07,910 --> 03:26:07,920

 

9187
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:09,910

right? Because we don't expect it to

9188
03:26:09,910 --> 03:26:09,920
right? Because we don't expect it to
 

9189
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:11,429
right? Because we don't expect it to
completely collapse. They might very

9190
03:26:11,429 --> 03:26:11,439
completely collapse. They might very
 

9191
03:26:11,439 --> 03:26:13,510
completely collapse. They might very
well bid off value and have another

9192
03:26:13,510 --> 03:26:13,520
well bid off value and have another
 

9193
03:26:13,520 --> 03:26:15,110
well bid off value and have another
attempt, right? So, you have to be

9194
03:26:15,110 --> 03:26:15,120
attempt, right? So, you have to be
 

9195
03:26:15,120 --> 03:26:16,550
attempt, right? So, you have to be
proactive. If you're playing counter

9196
03:26:16,550 --> 03:26:16,560
proactive. If you're playing counter
 

9197
03:26:16,560 --> 03:26:19,830
proactive. If you're playing counter
trend short, you proactive.

9198
03:26:19,830 --> 03:26:19,840

Trade next trade? I would shut down your
 

9209
03:26:33,760 --> 03:26:36,070
Trade next trade? I would shut down your
MAC, right? The opportunities today are

9210
03:26:36,070 --> 03:26:36,080
MAC, right? The opportunities today are
 

9211
03:26:36,080 --> 03:26:37,590
MAC, right? The opportunities today are
few and far between. Best moves have

9212
03:26:37,590 --> 03:26:37,600
few and far between. Best moves have
 

9213
03:26:37,600 --> 03:26:40,150

Thanks, Alex. Uh, Richard, Alex, do you
 

9227
03:26:54,560 --> 03:26:56,630
Thanks, Alex. Uh, Richard, Alex, do you
know how to set up volume profile in NT

9228
03:26:56,630 --> 03:26:56,640
know how to set up volume profile in NT
 

9229
03:26:56,640 --> 03:27:00,309
know how to set up volume profile in NT
to look like the one in Trading View you

9230
03:27:00,309 --> 03:27:00,319
to look like the one in Trading View you
 

9231
03:27:00,319 --> 03:27:02,790
to look like the one in Trading View you
use? If so, catch. Yeah, we can have a

9232
03:27:02,790 --> 03:27:02,800
use? If so, catch. Yeah, we can have a
 

9233
03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:05,429
use? If so, catch. Yeah, we can have a
chat in in Discord later, Richard. Um,

9234
03:27:05,429 --> 03:27:05,439
chat in in Discord later, Richard. Um,
 

9235
03:27:05,439 --> 03:27:07,030
chat in in Discord later, Richard. Um,
I'm doing it, but I'm using a different

9236
03:27:07,030 --> 03:27:07,040
I'm doing it, but I'm using a different
 

9237
03:27:07,040 --> 03:27:10,389
I'm doing it, but I'm using a different
platform for it.

9238
03:27:10,389 --> 03:27:10,399
platform for it.
 

9239
03:27:10,399 --> 03:27:12,229
platform for it.
Good entry for short. You've probably

9240
03:27:12,229 --> 03:27:12,239
Good entry for short. You've probably
 

9241
03:27:12,239 --> 03:27:14,389
Good entry for short. You've probably
missed it. It was probably in in here.

9242
03:27:14,389 --> 03:27:14,399
missed it. It was probably in in here.
 

9243
03:27:14,399 --> 03:27:16,070
missed it. It was probably in in here.
If I took this, I'd have I'll be honest.

9244
03:27:16,070 --> 03:27:16,080
If I took this, I'd have I'll be honest.
 

9245
03:27:16,080 --> 03:27:17,269
If I took this, I'd have I'll be honest.
I would have got short here and got

9246
03:27:17,269 --> 03:27:17,279
I would have got short here and got
 

9247
03:27:17,279 --> 03:27:18,870
I would have got short here and got
knocked out. And I've got short again

9248
03:27:18,870 --> 03:27:18,880
knocked out. And I've got short again
 

9249
03:27:18,880 --> 03:27:20,469
knocked out. And I've got short again
and this one would have worked. And now

9250
03:27:20,469 --> 03:27:20,479
and this one would have worked. And now
 

9251
03:27:20,479 --> 03:27:27,910
and this one would have worked. And now
you have to see if this holds.

9252
03:27:27,910 --> 03:27:27,920

 

9253
03:27:27,920 --> 03:27:30,389

All right. You could be short now and

9254
03:27:30,389 --> 03:27:30,399
All right. You could be short now and
 

9255
03:27:30,399 --> 03:27:32,469
All right. You could be short now and
you wouldn't want buyers to take back

9256
03:27:32,469 --> 03:27:32,479
you wouldn't want buyers to take back
 

9257
03:27:32,479 --> 03:27:35,910
you wouldn't want buyers to take back
control of 72. So you could think about

9258
03:27:35,910 --> 03:27:35,920
control of 72. So you could think about
 

9259
03:27:35,920 --> 03:27:37,670
control of 72. So you could think about
if you're really adamant on playing

9260
03:27:37,670 --> 03:27:37,680
if you're really adamant on playing
 

9261
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:39,269
if you're really adamant on playing
this, I'd be very cautious because we've

9262
03:27:39,269 --> 03:27:39,279
this, I'd be very cautious because we've
 

9263
03:27:39,279 --> 03:27:41,269
this, I'd be very cautious because we've
come down to a key level. But you could

9264
03:27:41,269 --> 03:27:41,279
come down to a key level. But you could
 

9265
03:27:41,279 --> 03:27:43,349
come down to a key level. But you could
think about a short here. But uh I don't

9266
03:27:43,349 --> 03:27:43,359
think about a short here. But uh I don't
 

9267
03:27:43,359 --> 03:27:45,429
think about a short here. But uh I don't
like what I'm seeing here. I'd probably

9268
03:27:45,429 --> 03:27:45,439
like what I'm seeing here. I'd probably
 

9269
03:27:45,439 --> 03:27:47,830
like what I'm seeing here. I'd probably
leave this alone at this point. it. You

9270
03:27:47,830 --> 03:27:47,840
leave this alone at this point. it. You
 

9271
03:27:47,840 --> 03:27:49,190
leave this alone at this point. it. You
should have been short in that first

9272
03:27:49,190 --> 03:27:49,200
should have been short in that first
 

9273
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:50,870
should have been short in that first
attempt at the gray box. You could

9274
03:27:50,870 --> 03:27:50,880
attempt at the gray box. You could
 

9275
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:53,349
attempt at the gray box. You could
consider this for this move. It's not

9276
03:27:53,349 --> 03:27:53,359
consider this for this move. It's not
 

9277
03:27:53,359 --> 03:27:55,830
consider this for this move. It's not
out the question, but uh it's not as

9278
03:27:55,830 --> 03:27:55,840
out the question, but uh it's not as
 

9279
03:27:55,840 --> 03:27:57,429
out the question, but uh it's not as
pretty, right? It's basically the same

9280
03:27:57,429 --> 03:27:57,439
pretty, right? It's basically the same
 

9281
03:27:57,439 --> 03:28:00,150
pretty, right? It's basically the same
thing. It's repricing this.

9282
03:28:00,150 --> 03:28:00,160
thing. It's repricing this.
 

9283
03:28:00,160 --> 03:28:02,710
thing. It's repricing this.
You'd want this to hold now. I'd be

9284
03:28:02,710 --> 03:28:02,720
You'd want this to hold now. I'd be
 

9285
03:28:02,720 --> 03:28:04,630
You'd want this to hold now. I'd be
short here looking for that. But again,

9286
03:28:04,630 --> 03:28:04,640
short here looking for that. But again,
 

9287
03:28:04,640 --> 03:28:06,150
short here looking for that. But again,
if they don't break underneath this,

9288
03:28:06,150 --> 03:28:06,160
if they don't break underneath this,
 

9289
03:28:06,160 --> 03:28:07,590
if they don't break underneath this,
this is going to be very bullish now

9290
03:28:07,590 --> 03:28:07,600
this is going to be very bullish now
 

9291
03:28:07,600 --> 03:28:09,590
this is going to be very bullish now
because this remember the protrend is

9292
03:28:09,590 --> 03:28:09,600
because this remember the protrend is
 

9293
03:28:09,600 --> 03:28:11,429
because this remember the protrend is
up. So what's if we think about the

9294
03:28:11,429 --> 03:28:11,439
up. So what's if we think about the
 

9295
03:28:11,439 --> 03:28:15,670
up. So what's if we think about the
legs, this is all this is right with

9296
03:28:15,670 --> 03:28:15,680
legs, this is all this is right with
 

9297
03:28:15,680 --> 03:28:17,910
legs, this is all this is right with
this potential move. So when we trade

9298
03:28:17,910 --> 03:28:17,920
this potential move. So when we trade
 

9299
03:28:17,920 --> 03:28:19,590
this potential move. So when we trade
these shorts for these counter trends

9300
03:28:19,590 --> 03:28:19,600
these shorts for these counter trends
 

9301
03:28:19,600 --> 03:28:22,710
these shorts for these counter trends
where we trap volume, we cover into

9302
03:28:22,710 --> 03:28:22,720
where we trap volume, we cover into
 

9303
03:28:22,720 --> 03:28:24,710
where we trap volume, we cover into
these because the protrend will want to

9304
03:28:24,710 --> 03:28:24,720
these because the protrend will want to
 

9305
03:28:24,720 --> 03:28:27,429
these because the protrend will want to
go up. We don't know if we've timed

9306
03:28:27,429 --> 03:28:27,439
go up. We don't know if we've timed
 

9307
03:28:27,439 --> 03:28:29,910
go up. We don't know if we've timed
that, right? We don't know. We know we

9308
03:28:29,910 --> 03:28:29,920
that, right? We don't know. We know we
 

9309
03:28:29,920 --> 03:28:31,990
that, right? We don't know. We know we
cover some, we can hold some. If we get

9310
03:28:31,990 --> 03:28:32,000
cover some, we can hold some. If we get
 

9311
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:33,830
cover some, we can hold some. If we get
lucky, we get this. But if they go back

9312
03:28:33,830 --> 03:28:33,840
lucky, we get this. But if they go back
 

9313
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:36,070
lucky, we get this. But if they go back
protrend, well, that's the move because

9314
03:28:36,070 --> 03:28:36,080
protrend, well, that's the move because
 

9315
03:28:36,080 --> 03:28:38,950
protrend, well, that's the move because
this is the lowh hanging fruit that I

9316
03:28:38,950 --> 03:28:38,960
this is the lowh hanging fruit that I
 

9317
03:28:38,960 --> 03:28:40,229
this is the lowh hanging fruit that I
always talk about, right? This is where

9318
03:28:40,229 --> 03:28:40,239
always talk about, right? This is where
 

9319
03:28:40,239 --> 03:28:42,950
always talk about, right? This is where
buyers are trying to go. So, would I

9320
03:28:42,950 --> 03:28:42,960
buyers are trying to go. So, would I
 

9321
03:28:42,960 --> 03:28:46,070
buyers are trying to go. So, would I
reshort this? Personally, probably not.

9322
03:28:46,070 --> 03:28:46,080
reshort this? Personally, probably not.
 

9323
03:28:46,080 --> 03:28:47,910
reshort this? Personally, probably not.
Could it go? It could work, right? If

9324
03:28:47,910 --> 03:28:47,920
Could it go? It could work, right? If
 

9325
03:28:47,920 --> 03:28:50,389
Could it go? It could work, right? If
they repric this and stay heavy, yes.

9326
03:28:50,389 --> 03:28:50,399
they repric this and stay heavy, yes.
 

9327
03:28:50,399 --> 03:28:52,389
they repric this and stay heavy, yes.
But just the counter trend and I think

9328
03:28:52,389 --> 03:28:52,399
But just the counter trend and I think
 

9329
03:28:52,399 --> 03:28:53,830
But just the counter trend and I think
it's had the opportunity to do it.

9330
03:28:53,830 --> 03:28:53,840
it's had the opportunity to do it.
 

9331
03:28:53,840 --> 03:28:55,750
it's had the opportunity to do it.
You've washed this, you've protected

9332
03:28:55,750 --> 03:28:55,760
You've washed this, you've protected
 

9333
03:28:55,760 --> 03:28:58,389
You've washed this, you've protected
this, ES still looks very strong. I'd be

9334
03:28:58,389 --> 03:28:58,399
this, ES still looks very strong. I'd be
 

9335
03:28:58,399 --> 03:29:00,309
this, ES still looks very strong. I'd be
somewhat wary about having a new short

9336
03:29:00,309 --> 03:29:00,319
somewhat wary about having a new short
 

9337
03:29:00,319 --> 03:29:06,309
somewhat wary about having a new short
up here.

9338
03:29:06,309 --> 03:29:06,319

 

9339
03:29:06,319 --> 03:29:09,190

I go grocery shopping and we only have

622. Yeah, I mean that's the pre that's
just just above previous day high,

9394
03:30:14,389 --> 03:30:14,399
just just above previous day high,
 

9395
03:30:14,399 --> 03:30:17,269
just just above previous day high,
right? So if you look at the cues 62163

9396
03:30:17,269 --> 03:30:17,279
right? So if you look at the cues 62163
 

9397
03:30:17,279 --> 03:30:19,910
right? So if you look at the cues 62163
previous day high 62 if that's the GEX

9398
03:30:19,910 --> 03:30:19,920
previous day high 62 if that's the GEX
 

9399
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:21,910
previous day high 62 if that's the GEX
level. The only thing is the way we've

level. The only thing is the way we've
 

9401
03:30:21,920 --> 03:30:25,269
level. The only thing is the way we've
built structure into 620 62030s is

9402
03:30:25,269 --> 03:30:25,279
built structure into 620 62030s is
 

9403
03:30:25,279 --> 03:30:28,710
built structure into 620 62030s is
pretty good. So, you know, any bearish

9404
03:30:28,710 --> 03:30:28,720
pretty good. So, you know, any bearish
 

9405
03:30:28,720 --> 03:30:30,870
pretty good. So, you know, any bearish
move is likely to be absorbed there

9406
03:30:30,870 --> 03:30:30,880
move is likely to be absorbed there
 

9407
03:30:30,880 --> 03:30:32,710
move is likely to be absorbed there
until they let go of that. That's the

9408
03:30:32,710 --> 03:30:32,720
until they let go of that. That's the
 

9409
03:30:32,720 --> 03:30:34,790
until they let go of that. That's the
one thing I'd be careful of th those of

9410
03:30:34,790 --> 03:30:34,800
one thing I'd be careful of th those of
 

9411
03:30:34,800 --> 03:30:37,830
one thing I'd be careful of th those of
