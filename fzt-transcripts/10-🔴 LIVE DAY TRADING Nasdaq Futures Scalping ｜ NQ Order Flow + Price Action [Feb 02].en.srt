daily, two standard deviations. We came
 

35
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,749
daily, two standard deviations. We came
up here, what was this? Wednesday,

00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
up here, what was this? Wednesday,
 

37
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,350
up here, what was this? Wednesday,
Thursday last week, couldn't close

38
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
Thursday last week, couldn't close
 

39
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,590
Thursday last week, couldn't close
outside. Failed back to the mean. Failed

00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
down to the lower bottom and Ballinger
 

45
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,270
down to the lower bottom and Ballinger
bottom ballinger band. Right. Everything

46
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
bottom ballinger band. Right. Everything
 

47
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,110
bottom ballinger band. Right. Everything
we talk about all the time. How many

48
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
we talk about all the time. How many
 

49
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,710
we talk about all the time. How many
times do we go over this? Many, many

50
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
times do we go over this? Many, many
 

51
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,230
times do we go over this? Many, many
times. basically every time I open the

52
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
times. basically every time I open the
 

53
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,909
times. basically every time I open the
chart. All right, so the rotation has

54
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
chart. All right, so the rotation has
 

55
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,029
chart. All right, so the rotation has
completed. We have found a bid of this

56
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
completed. We have found a bid of this
 

57
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,790
completed. We have found a bid of this
and we have an undercut. All right, the

58
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
and we have an undercut. All right, the
 

59
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,590
and we have an undercut. All right, the
key is here, this level here because

60
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
key is here, this level here because
 

61
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,749
key is here, this level here because
this created this sort of swing into

62
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
this created this sort of swing into
 

63
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,590
this created this sort of swing into
this. If we start getting stuck under

64
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:49,600
this. If we start getting stuck under
 

65
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,510
this. If we start getting stuck under
here this week, right? If we start

66
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
here this week, right? If we start
 

67
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,670
here this week, right? If we start
building liquidity down here around the

68
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
building liquidity down here around the
 

69
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,110
building liquidity down here around the
sort of 300s down to the 25,000s, 300

70
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
sort of 300s down to the 25,000s, 300
 

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,110
sort of 300s down to the 25,000s, 300
point range here. If we build liquidity

72
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
point range here. If we build liquidity
 

73
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,029
point range here. If we build liquidity
down here, all right, later in the week

74
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
down here, all right, later in the week
 

75
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,909
down here, all right, later in the week
and snap, then I would assume we are

76
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
and snap, then I would assume we are
 

77
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,110
and snap, then I would assume we are
then going to drive lower. We're not

78
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
then going to drive lower. We're not
 

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,550
then going to drive lower. We're not
seeing that yet. It might well build

80
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
seeing that yet. It might well build
 

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,790
seeing that yet. It might well build
out, folks. Right, it's a Monday morning

82
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
out, folks. Right, it's a Monday morning
 

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,390
out, folks. Right, it's a Monday morning
and we're not open yet. So, let's just

84
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
and we're not open yet. So, let's just
 

85
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,629
and we're not open yet. So, let's just
see how we go. We've got to be somewhat

86
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
see how we go. We've got to be somewhat
 

87
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,469
see how we go. We've got to be somewhat
careful of these key levels. You can see

88
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
careful of these key levels. You can see
 

89
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,150
careful of these key levels. You can see
we're going straight back into here

90
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
we're going straight back into here
 

91
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,790
we're going straight back into here
again with no change. And why is it lost

92
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
again with no change. And why is it lost
 

93
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,110
again with no change. And why is it lost
my volume? There we go. So big shelf

94
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
my volume? There we go. So big shelf
 

95
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,070
my volume? There we go. So big shelf
here uh off the last 12 months comes

96
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
here uh off the last 12 months comes
 

97
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,469
here uh off the last 12 months comes
into 671 and then over that into 865. So

98
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
into 671 and then over that into 865. So
 

99
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,150
into 671 and then over that into 865. So
6 670 is pretty big level. 670 is a

100
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
6 670 is pretty big level. 670 is a
 

101
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,749
6 670 is pretty big level. 670 is a
pretty big level. All right, moving down

102
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
pretty big level. All right, moving down
 

103
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,150
pretty big level. All right, moving down
into the hourlys.

104
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
into the hourlys.
 

105
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,510
into the hourlys.
Make sure you guys can see this. I'm

106
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
Make sure you guys can see this. I'm
 

107
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,629
Make sure you guys can see this. I'm
just going to make this one a little bit

108
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
just going to make this one a little bit
 

109
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,350
just going to make this one a little bit
bigger so you can see it. All right. So,

110
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
bigger so you can see it. All right. So,
 

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,430
bigger so you can see it. All right. So,
previous week

112
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
previous week
 

113
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,150
previous week
profile right here. What do we just say?

114
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
profile right here. What do we just say?
 

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,790
profile right here. What do we just say?
670s is a pretty big level that will

116
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
670s is a pretty big level that will
 

117
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,469
670s is a pretty big level that will
kind of line up with this old point of

118
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
kind of line up with this old point of
 

119
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,469
kind of line up with this old point of
control. So, we know that this level in

120
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
control. So, we know that this level in
 

121
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,430
control. So, we know that this level in
here 670s into 700 is huge. If we're

122
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
here 670s into 700 is huge. If we're
 

123
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,350
here 670s into 700 is huge. If we're
going to reclaim previous week's value,

124
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
going to reclaim previous week's value,
 

125
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,869
going to reclaim previous week's value,
we're driving up into it already. All

126
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
we're driving up into it already. All
 

127
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,550
we're driving up into it already. All
right. There's previous week's value,

128
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
right. There's previous week's value,
 

129
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,070
right. There's previous week's value,
previous day above here. We can get rid

130
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
previous day above here. We can get rid
 

131
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,909
previous day above here. We can get rid
of that in a moment once we go over it.

132
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
of that in a moment once we go over it.
 

133
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,749
of that in a moment once we go over it.
So, the big test now is do we find

134
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
So, the big test now is do we find
 

135
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,350
So, the big test now is do we find
acceptance? All right. Do we find

136
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
acceptance? All right. Do we find
 

137
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,070
acceptance? All right. Do we find
acceptance back above these 600s? Right.

138
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
acceptance back above these 600s? Right.
 

139
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,390
acceptance back above these 600s? Right.
Is this a look below into this gray box

140
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
Is this a look below into this gray box
 

141
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,390
Is this a look below into this gray box
that finds a bid and do we find

142
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
that finds a bid and do we find
 

143
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,430
that finds a bid and do we find
acceptance back above here? If we find

144
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
acceptance back above here? If we find
 

145
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,589
acceptance back above here? If we find
acceptance back above the 600s, all

146
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
acceptance back above the 600s, all
 

147
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,790
acceptance back above the 600s, all
right, then we are going to see a

148
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
right, then we are going to see a
 

149
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,790
right, then we are going to see a
rotation. This would be a failed

150
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
rotation. This would be a failed
 

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,550
rotation. This would be a failed
breakdown underneath previous week's

152
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
breakdown underneath previous week's
 

153
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,550
breakdown underneath previous week's
value, a hold of the week before and

154
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
value, a hold of the week before and
 

155
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,550
value, a hold of the week before and
then we would expect a rotation up to

156
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
then we would expect a rotation up to
 

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,550
then we would expect a rotation up to
700s. And if it gets through that, like

158
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
700s. And if it gets through that, like
 

159
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,149
700s. And if it gets through that, like
we said, that's a massive shelf, then

160
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
we said, that's a massive shelf, then
 

161
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,589
we said, that's a massive shelf, then
maybe up to 800s. The other option is of

162
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
maybe up to 800s. The other option is of
 

163
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,670
maybe up to 800s. The other option is of
course they reject this that they say,

164
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
course they reject this that they say,
 

165
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,430
course they reject this that they say,
"Hey, no, we're not going back inside

166
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
"Hey, no, we're not going back inside
 

167
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,029
"Hey, no, we're not going back inside
last week's value. That was actually too

168
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
last week's value. That was actually too
 

169
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,389
last week's value. That was actually too
expensive. We don't think there's any

170
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
expensive. We don't think there's any
 

171
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,150
expensive. We don't think there's any
fair value up there and we're going to

172
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
fair value up there and we're going to
 

173
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,070
fair value up there and we're going to
drive down." Obviously, these are naked

174
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
drive down." Obviously, these are naked
 

175
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,590
drive down." Obviously, these are naked
points of control. All right, previous

176
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
points of control. All right, previous
 

177
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,110
points of control. All right, previous
day, previous week. We haven't tested

178
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
day, previous week. We haven't tested
 

179
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,710
day, previous week. We haven't tested
that yet. We do expect that to get

180
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
that yet. We do expect that to get
 

181
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,110
that yet. We do expect that to get
tested within the first two days. So

182
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
tested within the first two days. So
 

183
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,350
tested within the first two days. So
maybe we see something like this and

184
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
maybe we see something like this and
 

185
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,949
maybe we see something like this and
then this and then it has to make its

186
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
then this and then it has to make its
 

187
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,870
then this and then it has to make its
mind up which way it's going. Very

188
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
mind up which way it's going. Very
 

189
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,870
mind up which way it's going. Very
possible. So this is what I'm looking

190
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
possible. So this is what I'm looking
 

191
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,470
possible. So this is what I'm looking
for this morning. I want to see how we

192
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
for this morning. I want to see how we
 

193
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,790
for this morning. I want to see how we
react here into the edge of previous day

194
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
react here into the edge of previous day
 

195
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,470
react here into the edge of previous day
and previous week. If we reclaim it,

196
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
and previous week. If we reclaim it,
 

197
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,550
and previous week. If we reclaim it,
then I'm waiting to see how we act here

198
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
then I'm waiting to see how we act here
 

199
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,630
then I'm waiting to see how we act here
into 700s and 800s. They've made it

200
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
into 700s and 800s. They've made it
 

201
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,470
into 700s and 800s. They've made it
quite easy. They've made it pretty easy.

202
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
quite easy. They've made it pretty easy.
 

203
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,710
quite easy. They've made it pretty easy.
700 and 800 850. They've made it the

204
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
700 and 800 850. They've made it the
 

205
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,949
700 and 800 850. They've made it the
whole numbers. So, o over six, maybe

206
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
whole numbers. So, o over six, maybe
 

207
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,870
whole numbers. So, o over six, maybe
seven over 7 850. Uh if we reject seven,

208
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
seven over 7 850. Uh if we reject seven,
 

209
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,509
seven over 7 850. Uh if we reject seven,
back to six. And if we reject six, then

210
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
back to six. And if we reject six, then
 

211
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,870
back to six. And if we reject six, then
back into these lows. All right. So,

212
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
back into these lows. All right. So,
 

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,509
back into these lows. All right. So,
they're making it somewhat easy for us.

214
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
they're making it somewhat easy for us.
 

215
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,990
they're making it somewhat easy for us.
If we move up to what we did in GlobeEx,

216
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
If we move up to what we did in GlobeEx,
 

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,350
If we move up to what we did in GlobeEx,
going to zoom in in here, make sure you

218
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
going to zoom in in here, make sure you
 

219
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,030
going to zoom in in here, make sure you
can see it. Oh, there we go. Right,

220
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
can see it. Oh, there we go. Right,
 

221
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,829
can see it. Oh, there we go. Right,
here's previous days or Friday. We can

222
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
here's previous days or Friday. We can
 

223
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,750
here's previous days or Friday. We can
call this Friday. Friday's value. You

224
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
call this Friday. Friday's value. You
 

225
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,750
call this Friday. Friday's value. You
can see that we rotated all through

226
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
can see that we rotated all through
 

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,710
can see that we rotated all through
Friday. All right, rejecting the 20-day

228
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
Friday. All right, rejecting the 20-day
 

229
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,269
Friday. All right, rejecting the 20-day
and we started to get a gap overnight.

230
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
and we started to get a gap overnight.
 

231
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,509
and we started to get a gap overnight.
So, this was the Sunday gap. They drove

232
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
So, this was the Sunday gap. They drove
 

233
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,030
So, this was the Sunday gap. They drove
up, they filled the gap, and as soon as

234
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
up, they filled the gap, and as soon as
 

235
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,630
up, they filled the gap, and as soon as
they filled it, became efficient, we

236
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
they filled it, became efficient, we
 

237
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,110
they filled it, became efficient, we
rejected it. Big sell off in GlobeEx,

238
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
rejected it. Big sell off in GlobeEx,
 

239
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,910
rejected it. Big sell off in GlobeEx,
new low, bid back up. This is the swing

240
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
new low, bid back up. This is the swing
 

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,030
new low, bid back up. This is the swing
point. All right. So, we're watching

242
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
point. All right. So, we're watching
 

243
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,509
point. All right. So, we're watching
this swing point right here into what is

244
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
this swing point right here into what is
 

245
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,150
this swing point right here into what is
this? 620s or whatever it is. 640s

246
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
this? 620s or whatever it is. 640s
 

247
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,990
this? 620s or whatever it is. 640s
somewhere around that. Lines up pretty

248
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
somewhere around that. Lines up pretty
 

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,509
somewhere around that. Lines up pretty
well with these value areas. That's what

250
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
well with these value areas. That's what
 

251
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,750
well with these value areas. That's what
I'm watching this morning.

252
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm watching this morning.
 

253
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,430
I'm watching this morning.
All right, move it up into the lower

254
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
All right, move it up into the lower
 

255
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,110
All right, move it up into the lower
time frame just quickly so you can see

256
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
time frame just quickly so you can see
 

257
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,990
time frame just quickly so you can see
the previous day. We can Why is this

258
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
the previous day. We can Why is this
 

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,829
the previous day. We can Why is this
red? Let's get rid of you. You should

260
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
red? Let's get rid of you. You should
 

261
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,990
red? Let's get rid of you. You should
not be red. We're going to flip you. All

262
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
not be red. We're going to flip you. All
 

263
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,829
not be red. We're going to flip you. All
right. This is an area here that we're

264
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
right. This is an area here that we're
 

265
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,790
right. This is an area here that we're
watching. This kind of area here to see

266
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
watching. This kind of area here to see
 

267
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,750
watching. This kind of area here to see
if and how we act. This can be red.

268
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
if and how we act. This can be red.
 

269
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,150
if and how we act. This can be red.
There we go.

270
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
There we go.
 

271
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,590
There we go.
Right. So, we're watching how we react

272
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
Right. So, we're watching how we react
 

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,509
Right. So, we're watching how we react
here. Point of control and then this

274
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
here. Point of control and then this
 

275
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,030
here. Point of control and then this
block right the way up here, which was

276
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
block right the way up here, which was
 

277
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,110
block right the way up here, which was
volume. Right. So, balance between this

278
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
volume. Right. So, balance between this
 

279
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,949
volume. Right. So, balance between this
over this, maybe a drive up, fail

280
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
over this, maybe a drive up, fail
 

281
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,710
over this, maybe a drive up, fail
breakout back down into this, and maybe

282
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
breakout back down into this, and maybe
 

283
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,030
breakout back down into this, and maybe
a snap back down into this area here.

284
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
a snap back down into this area here.
 

285
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,310
a snap back down into this area here.
Let's have a look at some of the broader

286
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
Let's have a look at some of the broader
 

287
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,509
Let's have a look at some of the broader
markets. Quick look at ES for you.

288
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
markets. Quick look at ES for you.
 

289
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,230
markets. Quick look at ES for you.
Should look fairly similar.

290
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240

 

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,910

Yes, very, very similar. snapped the

292
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
Yes, very, very similar. snapped the
 

293
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,870
Yes, very, very similar. snapped the
previous day low, expanded into what is

294
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
previous day low, expanded into what is
 

295
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,590
previous day low, expanded into what is
this? The old weekly. All right. Found a

296
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
this? The old weekly. All right. Found a
 

297
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,949
this? The old weekly. All right. Found a
bid underneath, failed breakout,

298
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
bid underneath, failed breakout,
 

299
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,870
bid underneath, failed breakout,
reclaimed that level, that old weekly

300
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
reclaimed that level, that old weekly
 

301
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,710
reclaimed that level, that old weekly
and then has driven straight the way

302
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
and then has driven straight the way
 

303
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,910
and then has driven straight the way
back up into developing point of control

304
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
back up into developing point of control
 

305
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,310
back up into developing point of control
um from the last month or so. All right,

306
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
um from the last month or so. All right,
 

307
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,069
um from the last month or so. All right,
so from the last month or so. So very

308
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
so from the last month or so. So very
 

309
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,670
so from the last month or so. So very
very similar gap fill would be up here

310
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
very similar gap fill would be up here
 

311
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,030
very similar gap fill would be up here
if it's going to fill that gap. We can

312
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
if it's going to fill that gap. We can
 

313
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,470
if it's going to fill that gap. We can
talk about that as well by the way in

314
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
talk about that as well by the way in
 

315
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,550
talk about that as well by the way in
the cues. If we are going to fill that

316
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
the cues. If we are going to fill that
 

317
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,990
the cues. If we are going to fill that
gap, we got to come right the way back

318
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
gap, we got to come right the way back
 

319
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,870
gap, we got to come right the way back
up to 673 so that you're all aware. Uh

320
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
up to 673 so that you're all aware. Uh
 

321
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,110
up to 673 so that you're all aware. Uh
QQQ

322
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
QQQ
 

323
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,470
QQQ
uh same kind of story. All right,

324
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
uh same kind of story. All right,
 

325
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,750
uh same kind of story. All right,
remember we didn't get all the overnight

326
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
remember we didn't get all the overnight
 

327
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,509
remember we didn't get all the overnight
action. So we got a big old gap down

328
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
action. So we got a big old gap down
 

329
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,430
action. So we got a big old gap down
pre-market failed to break lower and

330
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
pre-market failed to break lower and
 

331
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,190
pre-market failed to break lower and
we're driving back up. Previous day low

332
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
we're driving back up. Previous day low
 

333
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,269
we're driving back up. Previous day low
here on the QQQ. We can watch that if we

334
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
here on the QQQ. We can watch that if we
 

335
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,350
here on the QQQ. We can watch that if we
get inside it. Gap fill if we reject

336
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
get inside it. Gap fill if we reject
 

337
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,590
get inside it. Gap fill if we reject
previous day low back down here. ETFs

338
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
previous day low back down here. ETFs
 

339
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,030
previous day low back down here. ETFs
are going to make it a bit easier today,

340
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
are going to make it a bit easier today,
 

341
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,790
are going to make it a bit easier today,
I would say. So we can watch this level,

342
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
I would say. So we can watch this level,
 

343
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,870
I would say. So we can watch this level,
but we can set price alerts in for gap

344
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
but we can set price alerts in for gap
 

345
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,590
but we can set price alerts in for gap
fill. Add alert here. We call that gap

346
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
fill. Add alert here. We call that gap
 

347
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,110
fill. Add alert here. We call that gap
fill. No, we won't. We call that PDL tap

348
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
fill. No, we won't. We call that PDL tap
 

349
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,470
fill. No, we won't. We call that PDL tap
and then gap fill up here on QQQ.

350
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
and then gap fill up here on QQQ.
 

351
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,910
and then gap fill up here on QQQ.
My bad. Almost got that wrong on a

352
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
My bad. Almost got that wrong on a
 

353
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,990
My bad. Almost got that wrong on a
Monday morning.

354
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
Monday morning.
 

355
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,030
Monday morning.
Gap fill QQQ. And you can do the same

356
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
Gap fill QQQ. And you can do the same
 

357
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,310
Gap fill QQQ. And you can do the same
thing for the uh spiders. Wondering why

358
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
thing for the uh spiders. Wondering why
 

359
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,670
thing for the uh spiders. Wondering why
we do that. It's just so that we

360
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
we do that. It's just so that we
 

361
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,470
we do that. It's just so that we
understand the cash gaps on the ETFs. So

362
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
understand the cash gaps on the ETFs. So
 

363
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,550
understand the cash gaps on the ETFs. So
spiders already through previous day

364
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
spiders already through previous day
 

365
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,150
spiders already through previous day
low. The only thing left for them is a

366
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
low. The only thing left for them is a
 

367
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,269
low. The only thing left for them is a
gap fill which is uh up here. Right. So

368
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
gap fill which is uh up here. Right. So
 

369
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,870
gap fill which is uh up here. Right. So
it's almost there on the spy. Dixie has

370
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
it's almost there on the spy. Dixie has
 

371
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,629
it's almost there on the spy. Dixie has
found a bid. All right, Dixie's found a

372
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
found a bid. All right, Dixie's found a
 

373
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,190
found a bid. All right, Dixie's found a
bid. So, we'll have to see how how this

374
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
bid. So, we'll have to see how how this
 

375
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,910
bid. So, we'll have to see how how this
sort of uh yen Dixie and uh bonds

376
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
sort of uh yen Dixie and uh bonds
 

377
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,509
sort of uh yen Dixie and uh bonds
situation plays out. But you can see

378
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
situation plays out. But you can see
 

379
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,190
situation plays out. But you can see
that old inverse head and shoulder. All

380
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
that old inverse head and shoulder. All
 

381
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,790
that old inverse head and shoulder. All
right. And it's probably going to come

382
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
right. And it's probably going to come
 

383
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,389
right. And it's probably going to come
want to come up here. Pretty good for

384
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
want to come up here. Pretty good for
 

385
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,230
want to come up here. Pretty good for
the market if we do that. It's pretty

386
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
the market if we do that. It's pretty
 

387
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,509
the market if we do that. It's pretty
good. VIX still pretty much in this old

388
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
good. VIX still pretty much in this old
 

389
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,790
good. VIX still pretty much in this old
channel, right? Still pretty much in

390
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
channel, right? Still pretty much in
 

391
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,870
channel, right? Still pretty much in
this old channel. No change. Still has

392
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
this old channel. No change. Still has
 

393
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,470
this old channel. No change. Still has
increased volatility if it wants to go.

394
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
increased volatility if it wants to go.
 

395
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,150
increased volatility if it wants to go.
Let's have a quick look at the mag.

396
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
Let's have a quick look at the mag.
 

397

Let's have a quick look at the mag.
We've got to get move on. Right, Apple

398
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
We've got to get move on. Right, Apple
 

399
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,550
We've got to get move on. Right, Apple
in its range. That is absolutely

400
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
in its range. That is absolutely
 

401
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,110
in its range. That is absolutely
disgusting. But it is is holding that

402
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
disgusting. But it is is holding that
 

403
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,509
disgusting. But it is is holding that
key level of the 50s. Now just in a

404
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
key level of the 50s. Now just in a
 

405
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,670
key level of the 50s. Now just in a
range with a failed breakout here that

406
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
range with a failed breakout here that
 

407
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,750
range with a failed breakout here that
was on the earnings. All right. Uh

408
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
was on the earnings. All right. Uh
 

409
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,829
was on the earnings. All right. Uh
Amazon, right, has caught a bid down

here. This is blue box we talked about
 

413
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,509
here. This is blue box we talked about
coming back into. It's caught a bid so

414
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
coming back into. It's caught a bid so
 

415
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,350
coming back into. It's caught a bid so
far. Does it close his gap? Does it find

416
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
far. Does it close his gap? Does it find
 

417
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,470
far. Does it close his gap? Does it find
acceptance? Remember, it's a Monday

It's got a gap fill above. It all
 

427
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,670
It's got a gap fill above. It all
depends if they sell that gap fill. This

428
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
depends if they sell that gap fill. This
 

429
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,350
depends if they sell that gap fill. This
is seems to be the story of the tape

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
Microsoft, all right, that looks
 

447
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,590
Microsoft, all right, that looks
dreadful. Big sell off, right? It won't

448
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
dreadful. Big sell off, right? It won't
 

449
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,550
dreadful. Big sell off, right? It won't
get going until it gets a break over 39

450
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
get going until it gets a break over 39
 

451
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,310
get going until it gets a break over 39
and you might as well call it 440 break

452
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
and you might as well call it 440 break
 

453
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,710
and you might as well call it 440 break
on Microsoft probably opens the door for

454
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
on Microsoft probably opens the door for
 

455
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,030
on Microsoft probably opens the door for
a bit of a reclaim up into these. Until

456
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
a bit of a reclaim up into these. Until
 

457
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,590
a bit of a reclaim up into these. Until
that point, it looks pretty bleak. And

458
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
that point, it looks pretty bleak. And
 

459
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,829
that point, it looks pretty bleak. And
Nvidia, that's a gap down on Nvidia back

460
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
Nvidia, that's a gap down on Nvidia back
 

461
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,430
Nvidia, that's a gap down on Nvidia back
into the range. Same thing. All right,

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
play a bounce. You're probably going to
 

621
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,309
play a bounce. You're probably going to
look to sell into here.

622
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319

 

623
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,309

All right, let's have a quick look at

624
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
All right, let's have a quick look at
 

625
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:17,110
All right, let's have a quick look at
liquidity on the book as well.

626
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120

 

627
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,949

Got any big players in this morning?

628
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
Got any big players in this morning?
 

629
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,829
Got any big players in this morning?
Anywhere dancing around? Yes. Okay.

630
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839
Anywhere dancing around? Yes. Okay.
 

631
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,270
Anywhere dancing around? Yes. Okay.
600 625 which will be into our sort of

632
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
600 625 which will be into our sort of
 

633
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,990
600 625 which will be into our sort of
key levels. Okay, nice. Let's see if we

634
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
key levels. Okay, nice. Let's see if we
 

635
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,470
key levels. Okay, nice. Let's see if we
can get a morning drive and see if they

636
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
can get a morning drive and see if they
 

637
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,390
can get a morning drive and see if they
fail that drive and we can sell into it

638
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
fail that drive and we can sell into it
 

639
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,830
fail that drive and we can sell into it
if they're going to do that. We want to

640
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
if they're going to do that. We want to
 

641
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,070
if they're going to do that. We want to
be very careful if we complete the gap

642
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
be very careful if we complete the gap
 

643
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,070
be very careful if we complete the gap
fill and start to base above. So,

644
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
fill and start to base above. So,
 

645
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,029
fill and start to base above. So,
patience this morning.

646
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
patience this morning.
 

647
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,190
patience this morning.
Curious if I have a bias going into the

648
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
Curious if I have a bias going into the
 

649
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,590
Curious if I have a bias going into the
day. Um I don't want to be too biased,

650
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
day. Um I don't want to be too biased,
 

651
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,669
day. Um I don't want to be too biased,
but I you know there's potential that

652
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
but I you know there's potential that
 

653
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,590
but I you know there's potential that
they sell this early in the morning into

654
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
they sell this early in the morning into
 

655
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,110
they sell this early in the morning into
600s maybe the point of control.

656
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
600s maybe the point of control.
 

657
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,110
600s maybe the point of control.
Um but if we just look at the hourlys,

658
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
Um but if we just look at the hourlys,
 

659
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,110
Um but if we just look at the hourlys,
right, we think about where we are. It's

660
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
right, we think about where we are. It's
 

661
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,470
right, we think about where we are. It's
completed most of the move, hasn't it?

662
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
completed most of the move, hasn't it?
 

663
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,390
completed most of the move, hasn't it?
It's come and done this move here.

664
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
It's come and done this move here.
 

665
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,310
It's come and done this move here.
Here's last week. All right, we want to

666
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
Here's last week. All right, we want to
 

667
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,750
Here's last week. All right, we want to
see are they going to sell this or

668
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
see are they going to sell this or
 

669
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,029
see are they going to sell this or
they're going to sell this for this move

670
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
they're going to sell this for this move
 

671
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,310
they're going to sell this for this move
down. Then we have to take a partial

672
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
down. Then we have to take a partial
 

673
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,830
down. Then we have to take a partial
into this because we don't know if it

674
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
into this because we don't know if it
 

675
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,270
into this because we don't know if it
cracks. It might just build out

676
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
cracks. It might just build out
 

677
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,710
cracks. It might just build out
liquidity down here like we talked about

678
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
liquidity down here like we talked about
 

679
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,029
liquidity down here like we talked about
at the beginning. So, I would want to

680
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
at the beginning. So, I would want to
 

681
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,029
at the beginning. So, I would want to
see if we sell this or sell this early

682
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
see if we sell this or sell this early
 

683
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,230
see if we sell this or sell this early
on in the day. That's what I'm going to

684
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
on in the day. That's what I'm going to
 

685
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,750
on in the day. That's what I'm going to
be looking for. Do they sell this down?

686
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
be looking for. Do they sell this down?
 

687
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,270
be looking for. Do they sell this down?
Do they sell this down? If the answer is

688
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
Do they sell this down? If the answer is
 

689
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,789
Do they sell this down? If the answer is
no, right? If we're building out

690
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
no, right? If we're building out
 

691
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,549
no, right? If we're building out
liquidity here, then I'm going to expect

692
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
liquidity here, then I'm going to expect
 

693
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,549
liquidity here, then I'm going to expect
this drive up here. So, I want to see

694
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
this drive up here. So, I want to see
 

695
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,950
this drive up here. So, I want to see
how we build out early in the morning.

696
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
how we build out early in the morning.
 

697
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,270
how we build out early in the morning.
Okay. But this drive that we've done uh

698
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
Okay. But this drive that we've done uh
 

699
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,950
Okay. But this drive that we've done uh
since well, what time is this? Since

700
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
since well, what time is this? Since
 

701
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,029
since well, what time is this? Since
this low we've put in since 2:00 a.m.,

702
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
this low we've put in since 2:00 a.m.,
 

703
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,510
this low we've put in since 2:00 a.m.,
it's pretty good, right? It's uh well

704
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
it's pretty good, right? It's uh well
 

705
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,230
it's pretty good, right? It's uh well
approaching 350 plus points drive out.

706
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
approaching 350 plus points drive out.
 

707
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,190
approaching 350 plus points drive out.
So, waiting to see if there's a short

708
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
So, waiting to see if there's a short
 

709
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,669
So, waiting to see if there's a short
opportunity. Um, probably at the open.

710
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
opportunity. Um, probably at the open.
 

711
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,510
opportunity. Um, probably at the open.
That's probably the best way I can put

712
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
That's probably the best way I can put
 

713
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,549
That's probably the best way I can put
it. Hope that makes sense.

714
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559

 

715
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,950

Right. Bell coming here in just over 30

716
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
Right. Bell coming here in just over 30
 

717
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,029
Right. Bell coming here in just over 30
seconds, folks.

718
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
seconds, folks.
 

719
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,630
seconds, folks.
Right. So, I'll be looking to see if the

720
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
Right. So, I'll be looking to see if the
 

721
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,909
Right. So, I'll be looking to see if the
market very clearly if we're going to

722
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
market very clearly if we're going to
 

723
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,310
market very clearly if we're going to
fail here or here. Gap fill is here. So,

724
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
fail here or here. Gap fill is here. So,
 

725
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,470
fail here or here. Gap fill is here. So,
are we going to do one of these moves?

726
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
are we going to do one of these moves?
 

727
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,990
are we going to do one of these moves?
If the answer is no and we do this,

728
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
If the answer is no and we do this,
 

729
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,270
If the answer is no and we do this,
we're going to build liquidity to go

730
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
we're going to build liquidity to go
 

731
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,029
we're going to build liquidity to go
higher. If we build liquidity lower,

732
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
higher. If we build liquidity lower,
 

733
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,150
higher. If we build liquidity lower,
then I'm thinking about that trade

734
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
then I'm thinking about that trade
 

735
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,390
then I'm thinking about that trade
underneath as well.

736
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,400
underneath as well.
 

737
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,230
underneath as well.
That's what I'm looking at. Right. That

738
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
That's what I'm looking at. Right. That
 

739
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,510
That's what I'm looking at. Right. That
is what I'm looking at.

740
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
is what I'm looking at.
 

741
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,909
is what I'm looking at.
Can do that. I want this one gone.

742
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:19,919
Can do that. I want this one gone.
 

743
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,630
Can do that. I want this one gone.
Right. Here we go, folks. 10 seconds.

744
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
Right. Here we go, folks. 10 seconds.
 

745
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,110
Right. Here we go, folks. 10 seconds.
Good luck, everyone.

746
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
Good luck, everyone.
 

747
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,630
Good luck, everyone.
Don't do anything stupid. Monday

748
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
Don't do anything stupid. Monday
 

749
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,390
Don't do anything stupid. Monday
morning. Don't force your way into

750
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
morning. Don't force your way into
 

751
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,630
morning. Don't force your way into
anything. This wants to lift up to 700

752
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,640
anything. This wants to lift up to 700
 

753
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,029
anything. This wants to lift up to 700
first. It will. Right. Here's the

754
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
first. It will. Right. Here's the
 

755
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,150
first. It will. Right. Here's the
morning drive.

756
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
morning drive.
 

757
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,390
morning drive.
Up we come into the value areas into

758
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
Up we come into the value areas into
 

759
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,070
Up we come into the value areas into
these 600s. Remember it can lift all the

760
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
these 600s. Remember it can lift all the
 

761
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,310
these 600s. Remember it can lift all the
way up to 680 even sevens if it wants to

762
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
way up to 680 even sevens if it wants to
 

763
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,990
way up to 680 even sevens if it wants to
go and then we'll see what we do once we

764
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
go and then we'll see what we do once we
 

765
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,029
go and then we'll see what we do once we
get here. But big big squeeze out this

766
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
get here. But big big squeeze out this
 

767
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,789
get here. But big big squeeze out this
morning.

768
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
morning.
 

769
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,230
morning.
And if they don't find acceptance

770
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,240
And if they don't find acceptance
 

771
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,909
And if they don't find acceptance
through here then I will be interested

772
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:51,919
through here then I will be interested
 

773
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,669
through here then I will be interested
in the short. Right. So if they don't

774
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
in the short. Right. So if they don't
 

775
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,190
in the short. Right. So if they don't
find acceptance through here watching

776
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
find acceptance through here watching
 

777
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,789
find acceptance through here watching
this there's some sellers up here into

778
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:56,799
this there's some sellers up here into
 

779
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,350
this there's some sellers up here into
605s. Wouldn't mind it a bit higher at

780
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,360
605s. Wouldn't mind it a bit higher at
 

781
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,950
605s. Wouldn't mind it a bit higher at
the moment. See how far they can squeeze

782
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
the moment. See how far they can squeeze
 

783
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,150
the moment. See how far they can squeeze
it. And that 700's going to be a big

784
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,160
it. And that 700's going to be a big
 

785
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,070
it. And that 700's going to be a big
level. Go. They're going for Gapville at

786
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
level. Go. They're going for Gapville at
 

787
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,350
level. Go. They're going for Gapville at
the moment, folks. They're going for

788
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
the moment, folks. They're going for
 

789
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,669
the moment, folks. They're going for
Gapville. Big buyer up here. Probably

790
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
Gapville. Big buyer up here. Probably
 

791
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,029
Gapville. Big buyer up here. Probably
going to get himself caught. 91 lot.

792
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
going to get himself caught. 91 lot.
 

793
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,630
going to get himself caught. 91 lot.
Okay. So, we see if we come back under

794
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
Okay. So, we see if we come back under
 

795
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:23,750
Okay. So, we see if we come back under
600 or if they hold the bid.

796
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760

 

797
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,070

So, GlobeEx sitting at 45 is where we

798
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
So, GlobeEx sitting at 45 is where we
 

799
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,310
So, GlobeEx sitting at 45 is where we
are now. There or thereabouts. 35 sorry.

800
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
are now. There or thereabouts. 35 sorry.
 

801
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,510
are now. There or thereabouts. 35 sorry.
And then gap up here into 70s. Let's see

802
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
And then gap up here into 70s. Let's see
 

803
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,350
And then gap up here into 70s. Let's see
if they hold 600 or if they fail this on

804
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
if they hold 600 or if they fail this on
 

805
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,990
if they hold 600 or if they fail this on
the push. right in this now. Taking

806
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
the push. right in this now. Taking
 

807
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,510
the push. right in this now. Taking
partial straight away in case they find

808
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,520
partial straight away in case they find
 

809
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,950
partial straight away in case they find
a bid. Locking some in. Nice move to

810
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
a bid. Locking some in. Nice move to
 

811
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,870
a bid. Locking some in. Nice move to
start the date into that current point

812
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
start the date into that current point
 

813
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,029
start the date into that current point
of control. So, as soon as they failed

814
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
of control. So, as soon as they failed
 

815
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,950
of control. So, as soon as they failed
six, just took it straight back down

816
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
six, just took it straight back down
 

817
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,310
six, just took it straight back down
into this area. The reason I'm being

818
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
into this area. The reason I'm being
 

819
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,990
into this area. The reason I'm being
very quick there on the opening drive is

820
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
very quick there on the opening drive is
 

821
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,909
very quick there on the opening drive is
cuz they can now rebid this red zone.

822
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
cuz they can now rebid this red zone.
 

823
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:52,950
cuz they can now rebid this red zone.
All right. So, if we're going to get

824
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
All right. So, if we're going to get
 

825
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,950
All right. So, if we're going to get
continuation, it's going to be under

826
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
continuation, it's going to be under
 

827
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,630
continuation, it's going to be under
here. All right. And if they're going to

828
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
here. All right. And if they're going to
 

829
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,390
here. All right. And if they're going to
hold this, it's going to flip this whole

830
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
hold this, it's going to flip this whole
 

831
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,789
hold this, it's going to flip this whole
block for this move here. So short for

832
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
block for this move here. So short for
 

833
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,870
block for this move here. So short for
the 600 break straight down into this

834
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
the 600 break straight down into this
 

835
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,789
the 600 break straight down into this
taking a partial. Wait and see now if we

836
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
taking a partial. Wait and see now if we
 

837
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,390
taking a partial. Wait and see now if we
get acceptance lower. The answer is no.

838
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
get acceptance lower. The answer is no.
 

839
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,270
get acceptance lower. The answer is no.
So out and cover. And now we just wait

840
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
So out and cover. And now we just wait
 

841
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,950
So out and cover. And now we just wait
for the next trade setup. Probably the

842
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
for the next trade setup. Probably the
 

843
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,510
for the next trade setup. Probably the
very very similar setup

844
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
very very similar setup
 

845
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,669
very very similar setup
in the morning. Very very quick.

846
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679

 

847
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,310

Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's

848
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's
 

849
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,950
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's
see.

850
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960

 

851
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,710

Watch your ATR here. Well over 50

852
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
Watch your ATR here. Well over 50
 

853
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,750
Watch your ATR here. Well over 50
points. They look like they're going for

854
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
points. They look like they're going for
 

855
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,149
points. They look like they're going for
gap fill here.

856
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159

 

857
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,149

There's the GlobeEx. Let's see if they

858
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
There's the GlobeEx. Let's see if they
 

859
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,909
There's the GlobeEx. Let's see if they
get up into gap fill. And then remember

860
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
get up into gap fill. And then remember
 

861
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,510
get up into gap fill. And then remember
these are naked. Previous day point of

862
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
these are naked. Previous day point of
 

863
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,870
these are naked. Previous day point of
control, previous week point of control.

864
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
control, previous week point of control.
 

865
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,390
control, previous week point of control.
Those are both naked. 700 is going to be

866
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
Those are both naked. 700 is going to be
 

867
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,070
Those are both naked. 700 is going to be
a massive level. Here they go for gap

868
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,080
a massive level. Here they go for gap
 

869
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,830
a massive level. Here they go for gap
fill then. So the continuation long was

870
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,840
fill then. So the continuation long was
 

871
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,430
fill then. So the continuation long was
the play there off this red block which

872
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
the play there off this red block which
 

873
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,510
the play there off this red block which
is now blue. So, we now know that this

874
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
is now blue. So, we now know that this
 

875
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,909
is now blue. So, we now know that this
is a support structure. All right. So,

876
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
is a support structure. All right. So,
 

877
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,510
is a support structure. All right. So,
they're going to try and get up into gap

878
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
they're going to try and get up into gap
 

879
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,190
they're going to try and get up into gap
fill. This is gap fill. Now, let's make

880
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
fill. This is gap fill. Now, let's make
 

881
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,710
fill. This is gap fill. Now, let's make
sure the Q's are closing as well. Yeah,

882
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
sure the Q's are closing as well. Yeah,
 

883
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,789
sure the Q's are closing as well. Yeah,
Q's closing the gap. Spider's got a

884
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
Q's closing the gap. Spider's got a
 

885
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,029
Q's closing the gap. Spider's got a
little bit longer to go. I want to see

886
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
little bit longer to go. I want to see
 

887
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,350
little bit longer to go. I want to see
now if they react here or not. And if

888
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
now if they react here or not. And if
 

889
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,950
now if they react here or not. And if
no, then they're going to base out and

890
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
no, then they're going to base out and
 

891
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,789
no, then they're going to base out and
they look for a bigger squeeze.

892
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799

 

893
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,789

So, gap almost filled that. Pretty much

894
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
So, gap almost filled that. Pretty much
 

895
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,110
So, gap almost filled that. Pretty much
filled. Missed it by what? A tick. A

896
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
filled. Missed it by what? A tick. A
 

897
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,310
filled. Missed it by what? A tick. A
bloody tick. It mixed it by a bloody

898
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,320
bloody tick. It mixed it by a bloody
 

899
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,630
bloody tick. It mixed it by a bloody
tick.

900
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
tick.
 

901
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,909
tick.
Let's see if they've got a bit more

902
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
Let's see if they've got a bit more
 

903
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,430
Let's see if they've got a bit more
juice for one more shove up. I'll give

904
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
juice for one more shove up. I'll give
 

905
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,549
juice for one more shove up. I'll give
you a little read out of the market.

906
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559
you a little read out of the market.
 

907
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,310
you a little read out of the market.

913
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,190
Google over 4% down. Amazon half% up.
And Apple 1 and a half% up. They look

914
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
And Apple 1 and a half% up. They look
 

915
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,549
And Apple 1 and a half% up. They look
like they just want to fill this gap and

916
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
like they just want to fill this gap and
 

917
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,149
like they just want to fill this gap and
then maybe flush it back down. But we'll

918
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
then maybe flush it back down. But we'll
 

919
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,669
then maybe flush it back down. But we'll
see. If they get through the gap fill,

920
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
see. If they get through the gap fill,
 

921
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,190
see. If they get through the gap fill,
then they can look for the 700s.

922
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
then they can look for the 700s.
 

923
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,029
then they can look for the 700s.
700s for me is going to be a big level

924
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
700s for me is going to be a big level
 

925
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,270
700s for me is going to be a big level
up into this. This is going to be a big

926
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
up into this. This is going to be a big
 

927
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,310
up into this. This is going to be a big
big big level up here

928
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
big big level up here
 

929
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,310
big big level up here
on Ninja. By the way, I have my previous

930
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
on Ninja. By the way, I have my previous
 

931
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,789
on Ninja. By the way, I have my previous
day value area low up there as well. So,

932
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
day value area low up there as well. So,
 

933
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,070
day value area low up there as well. So,
I should probably do this because

934
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
I should probably do this because
 

935
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,789
I should probably do this because
there's a divergence between these. I do

936
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
there's a divergence between these. I do
 

937
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,549
there's a divergence between these. I do
this and I call it NT

938
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
this and I call it NT
 

939
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,470
this and I call it NT
Ninja Trader previous day value low.

940
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
Ninja Trader previous day value low.
 

941
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,230
Ninja Trader previous day value low.
Right. So, let's watch again. If we get

942
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
Right. So, let's watch again. If we get
 

943
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,669
Right. So, let's watch again. If we get
weak under all of this, there's a new

944
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
weak under all of this, there's a new
 

945
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,190
weak under all of this, there's a new
short opportunity.

946
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200

 

947
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,950

Watching this very very carefully to see

948
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
Watching this very very carefully to see
 

949
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,470
Watching this very very carefully to see
if they flush under here where this big

950
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
if they flush under here where this big
 

951
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,870
if they flush under here where this big
buyer came in last time. No, still

952
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
buyer came in last time. No, still
 

953
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:34,789
buyer came in last time. No, still
bidding here right now.

954
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799

 

955
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,950

They're still bidding here. We're

956
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
They're still bidding here. We're
 

957
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,950
They're still bidding here. We're
extended. Would be much better if they

958
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
extended. Would be much better if they
 

959
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,870
extended. Would be much better if they
filled that gap and did 700 and then

960
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
filled that gap and did 700 and then
 

961
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,630
filled that gap and did 700 and then
failed to be quite honest at this point

962
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
failed to be quite honest at this point
 

963
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,750
failed to be quite honest at this point
because they can rebid this. I don't

964
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
because they can rebid this. I don't
 

965
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,510
because they can rebid this. I don't
want to be short versus this squeeze.

966
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
want to be short versus this squeeze.
 

967
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,830
want to be short versus this squeeze.
want to see them come up here, fill this

968
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
want to see them come up here, fill this
 

969
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,909
want to see them come up here, fill this
gap. Ideally, ES fills the gap as well,

970
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
gap. Ideally, ES fills the gap as well,
 

971
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,430
gap. Ideally, ES fills the gap as well,
and then we can sell it. Otherwise,

972
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
and then we can sell it. Otherwise,
 

973
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,710
and then we can sell it. Otherwise,
we're going to have to sell down here,

974
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:52,720
we're going to have to sell down here,
 

975
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,710
we're going to have to sell down here,
which is fine, but it's not ideal. I'd

976
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
which is fine, but it's not ideal. I'd
 

977
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,470
which is fine, but it's not ideal. I'd
like to get a premium price as close to

978
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:56,480
like to get a premium price as close to
 

979
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:06,070
like to get a premium price as close to
in here as possible.

980
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080

 

981
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,510

Let's put some volume on for the session

982
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
Let's put some volume on for the session
 

983
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,590
Let's put some volume on for the session
as well before we forget. No, that's not

984
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600
as well before we forget. No, that's not
 

985
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,830
as well before we forget. No, that's not
what I want. I want this one right here,

986
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,840
what I want. I want this one right here,
 

987
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,149
what I want. I want this one right here,
please.

988
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:16,159
please.
 

989
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,950
please.
There we go.

990
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
There we go.
 

991
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,190
There we go.
There we go. Right. Let's see. Ideally,

992
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
There we go. Right. Let's see. Ideally,
 

993
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,549
There we go. Right. Let's see. Ideally,
they squeeze this out a little bit

994
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
they squeeze this out a little bit
 

995
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,470
they squeeze this out a little bit
higher.

996
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
higher.
 

997
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,909
higher.
A little bit higher. Going to watch VIX

998
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919
A little bit higher. Going to watch VIX
 

999
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:38,470
A little bit higher. Going to watch VIX
into that 1750 for it gap fill as well.

1000
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480

 

1001
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,390

Building liquidity here. We're just

1002
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,400
Building liquidity here. We're just
 

1003
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,230
Building liquidity here. We're just
stuck in this value area on the session

1004
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
stuck in this value area on the session
 

1005
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,390
stuck in this value area on the session
right now. Ideally, we squeeze up into

1006
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400
right now. Ideally, we squeeze up into
 

1007
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,909
right now. Ideally, we squeeze up into
this and then fail.

1008
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919

 

1009
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,149

The sloped line moving average. This one

1010
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
The sloped line moving average. This one
 

1011
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,909
The sloped line moving average. This one
is what I call my higher time frame

1012
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
is what I call my higher time frame
 

1013
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,830
is what I call my higher time frame
algo. All right. So, when we're building

1014
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
algo. All right. So, when we're building
 

1015
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,190
algo. All right. So, when we're building
between higher time frame, lower time

1016
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
between higher time frame, lower time
 

1017
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,789
between higher time frame, lower time
frame algo is down here. Higher time

1018
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
frame algo is down here. Higher time
 

1019
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,310
frame algo is down here. Higher time
frame algo is up here. It's how I

1020
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,320
frame algo is up here. It's how I
 

1021
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,549
frame algo is up here. It's how I
dictate if the market's in a higher time

1022
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
dictate if the market's in a higher time
 

1023
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,990
dictate if the market's in a higher time
frame liquidity build from lower time

1024
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
frame liquidity build from lower time
 

1025
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,110
frame liquidity build from lower time
frame to higher time frame, which

1026
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
frame to higher time frame, which
 

1027
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,310
frame to higher time frame, which
currently it is. That's why we've got

1028
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,320
currently it is. That's why we've got
 

1029
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,070
currently it is. That's why we've got
this box up here. we start bidding above

1030
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
this box up here. we start bidding above
 

1031
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,350
this box up here. we start bidding above
this and the lower time frame catches

1032
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
this and the lower time frame catches
 

1033
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,190
this and the lower time frame catches
up, we can go on a big old squeeze. But

1034
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200
up, we can go on a big old squeeze. But
 

1035
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,390
up, we can go on a big old squeeze. But
right now, I think there's probably a

1036
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:14,400
right now, I think there's probably a
 

1037
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,990
right now, I think there's probably a
rotation between these two for a bit,

1038
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
rotation between these two for a bit,
 

1039
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,230
rotation between these two for a bit,
which is why I'm looking to see if they

1040
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
which is why I'm looking to see if they
 

1041
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,630
which is why I'm looking to see if they
fade the market up here. If they don't

1042
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
fade the market up here. If they don't
 

1043
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,390
fade the market up here. If they don't
and they catch a giant squeeze, then the

1044
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
and they catch a giant squeeze, then the
 

1045
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,350
and they catch a giant squeeze, then the
next stop is 850s, 800 850s. If they get

1046
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360
next stop is 850s, 800 850s. If they get
 

1047
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,350
next stop is 850s, 800 850s. If they get
through this 700s, they're going to go

1048
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
through this 700s, they're going to go
 

1049
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,590
through this 700s, they're going to go
850s. So, remember, we expected the

1050
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
850s. So, remember, we expected the
 

1051
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,029
850s. So, remember, we expected the
market to drive up this morning at the

1052
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
market to drive up this morning at the
 

1053
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,789
market to drive up this morning at the
opening bell. We're waiting to see if it

1054
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
opening bell. We're waiting to see if it
 

1055
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,430
opening bell. We're waiting to see if it
runs out of gas on a retest up here. So,

1056
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
runs out of gas on a retest up here. So,
 

1057
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,750
runs out of gas on a retest up here. So,
we're getting close now into this area

1058
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
we're getting close now into this area
 

1059
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,430
we're getting close now into this area
up here. Sevens would be interested. If

1060
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
up here. Sevens would be interested. If
 

1061
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,350
up here. Sevens would be interested. If
we base over sevens, we have to wait for

1062
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,360
we base over sevens, we have to wait for
 

1063
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,190
we base over sevens, we have to wait for
it for the EMAs to catch up and then

1064
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
it for the EMAs to catch up and then
 

1065
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,950
it for the EMAs to catch up and then
we'll look for a long to 850. Otherwise,

1066
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
we'll look for a long to 850. Otherwise,
 

1067
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,590
we'll look for a long to 850. Otherwise,
I'm looking to sell this if I see buyers

1068
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm looking to sell this if I see buyers
 

1069
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,350
I'm looking to sell this if I see buyers
get stuck. Right? If I see buyers get

1070
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
get stuck. Right? If I see buyers get
 

1071
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:58,549
get stuck. Right? If I see buyers get
stuck, not if I don't.

1072
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559

 

1073
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,430

Here it goes. So, towards the sevens now

1074
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
Here it goes. So, towards the sevens now
 

1075
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,710
Here it goes. So, towards the sevens now
getting very squeezy. Uh ES now filled

1076
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
getting very squeezy. Uh ES now filled
 

1077
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,789
getting very squeezy. Uh ES now filled
its gap. Spy now filled its gap as well.

1078
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
its gap. Spy now filled its gap as well.
 

1079
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,310
its gap. Spy now filled its gap as well.
So, those have completed the move. So,

1080
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
So, those have completed the move. So,
 

1081
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,750
So, those have completed the move. So,
this is the area where if they're going

1082
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,760
this is the area where if they're going
 

1083
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,510
this is the area where if they're going
to sell it, they should sell it around

1084
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
to sell it, they should sell it around
 

1085
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,950
to sell it, they should sell it around
here. If not, then they're going to come

1086
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
here. If not, then they're going to come
 

1087
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,070
here. If not, then they're going to come
all the way up here, and we're going to

1088
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
all the way up here, and we're going to
 

1089
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,350
all the way up here, and we're going to
have to look for a long. But, if they're

1090
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
have to look for a long. But, if they're
 

1091
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,830
have to look for a long. But, if they're
going to sell it up here, I'm interested

1092
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:17,840
going to sell it up here, I'm interested
 

1093
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,750
going to sell it up here, I'm interested
if they trap enough buyers. How we

1094
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,760

1095
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,950

It happens more frequently when the

It happens more frequently when the
 

1139
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,590
It happens more frequently when the
Ballinger bands are getting tighter. You

1140
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
Ballinger bands are getting tighter. You
 

1141
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,870
Ballinger bands are getting tighter. You
can see we're starting to struggle to

1142
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
can see we're starting to struggle to

struggle to move higher. Can we trap
 

1155
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,070
struggle to move higher. Can we trap
enough buyers here or have they got a

1156

enough buyers here or have they got a
 

1157
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,830
enough buyers here or have they got a

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:31,840
resqueeze up to 850s?
 

1159
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,070
resqueeze up to 850s?
gap filled now QQQ. So just got the

1160
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
gap filled now QQQ. So just got the
 

1161

1163
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,789

That is a slow alert trading view.

1164
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:38,799
That is a slow alert trading view.
 

1165
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,630
That is a slow alert trading view.
All right, VPO now moving up here. We

1166
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
All right, VPO now moving up here. We
 

1167
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,149
All right, VPO now moving up here. We
see we're starting to build out a shelf

1168
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
see we're starting to build out a shelf
 

1169
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,310
see we're starting to build out a shelf
up here now. Watching this for your as

1170
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
up here now. Watching this for your as
 

1171
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,029
up here now. Watching this for your as
your as an over and under for sentiment.

1172
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039

 

1173
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,070

Can we change that, please?

1174
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
Can we change that, please?
 

1175
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,549
Can we change that, please?
There we go. All right, back down into

1176
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:54,559
There we go. All right, back down into
 

1177
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,230
There we go. All right, back down into
this previous day value area low on

1178
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,240
this previous day value area low on
 

1179
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,750
this previous day value area low on
Ninja Trader. So, did they find

1180
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
Ninja Trader. So, did they find
 

1181
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,510
Ninja Trader. So, did they find
acceptance through that or not is the

1182
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520
acceptance through that or not is the
 

1183
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,470
acceptance through that or not is the
question.

1184
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
question.
 

1185
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,909
question.
If they keep bidding here, then there's

1186
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:01,919
If they keep bidding here, then there's
 

1187
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,590
If they keep bidding here, then there's
a resqueeze. If they fail this, we can

1188
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
a resqueeze. If they fail this, we can
 

1189
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,269
a resqueeze. If they fail this, we can
come back down. The big buyer came in at

1190
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
come back down. The big buyer came in at
 

1191
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,110
come back down. The big buyer came in at
97. So, we're I'm going to watch sort of

1192
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
97. So, we're I'm going to watch sort of
 

1193
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,430
97. So, we're I'm going to watch sort of
700 break here. Here's the break towards

1194
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
700 break here. Here's the break towards
 

1195
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,149
700 break here. Here's the break towards
97. So, we know there's a big buyer who

1196
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
97. So, we know there's a big buyer who
 

1197
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,070
97. So, we know there's a big buyer who
stepped in last time at 97. So, we're

1198
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080
stepped in last time at 97. So, we're
 

1199
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,789
stepped in last time at 97. So, we're
going to need it under 97 under this

1200
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
going to need it under 97 under this
 

1201
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,149
going to need it under 97 under this
shelf here. Under that shelf here,

1202
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
shelf here. Under that shelf here,
 

1203
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,269
shelf here. Under that shelf here,
there's a big big flush possible. If we

1204
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
there's a big big flush possible. If we
 

1205
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,950
there's a big big flush possible. If we
come under this sort of shelf right

1206
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
come under this sort of shelf right
 

1207
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,909
come under this sort of shelf right
here, right? If we start losing the bid

1208
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:25,919
here, right? If we start losing the bid
 

1209
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,669
here, right? If we start losing the bid
here, then there's a big flush down

1210
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
here, then there's a big flush down
 

1211
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,669
here, then there's a big flush down
possible. like we're potentially going

1212
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
possible. like we're potentially going
 

1213
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,950
possible. like we're potentially going
to start doing. Need to see them get

1214
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
to start doing. Need to see them get
 

1215
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,710
to start doing. Need to see them get
aggressive and stay heavy.

1216
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
aggressive and stay heavy.
 

1217
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,070
aggressive and stay heavy.
Not before that.

1218
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
Not before that.
 

1219
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,310
Not before that.
So 97 still protected. Here comes the

1220
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
So 97 still protected. Here comes the
 

1221
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,710
So 97 still protected. Here comes the
flush. I want to watch 97 on a retest.

1222
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
flush. I want to watch 97 on a retest.
 

1223
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,230
flush. I want to watch 97 on a retest.
See if they stay heavy. They are staying

1224
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
See if they stay heavy. They are staying
 

1225
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,029
See if they stay heavy. They are staying
heavy versus 97. So interested if they

1226
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,039
heavy versus 97. So interested if they
 

1227
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,029
heavy versus 97. So interested if they
stay heavy.

1228
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
stay heavy.
 

1229
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,389
stay heavy.

I was just watching the tape here. Um,

1302
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
I was just watching the tape here. Um,
 

1303
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,470
I was just watching the tape here. Um,
where are you guys? No, this one. All

1304
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
where are you guys? No, this one. All
 

1305
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,070
where are you guys? No, this one. All
right. I was watching this. We kept

1306
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
right. I was watching this. We kept
 

1307
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,990
right. I was watching this. We kept
holding this like imbalance here. wanted

1308
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
holding this like imbalance here. wanted
 

1309
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,750
holding this like imbalance here. wanted
to see this seller move down and walk it

1310
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:21,760
to see this seller move down and walk it
 

1311
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,350
to see this seller move down and walk it
lower. We didn't see it. So, a small

1312
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
lower. We didn't see it. So, a small
 

1313
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,389
lower. We didn't see it. So, a small
size versus sevens, right? I was looking

1314
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
size versus sevens, right? I was looking
 

1315
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,230
size versus sevens, right? I was looking
to see if we'd flush this and fill this

1316
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
to see if we'd flush this and fill this
 

1317
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,630
to see if we'd flush this and fill this
in. We didn't. So, we can now if we

1318
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
in. We didn't. So, we can now if we
 

1319
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,870
in. We didn't. So, we can now if we
rebid, there is a chance to come higher

1320
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
rebid, there is a chance to come higher
 

1321
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,710
rebid, there is a chance to come higher
into the eights like we talked about.

1322
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:34,720
into the eights like we talked about.
 

1323
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,149
into the eights like we talked about.
All right. So, it's messy in here. This

1324
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
All right. So, it's messy in here. This
 

1325
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,909
All right. So, it's messy in here. This
shelf is messy. All right. If they bid

1326
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
shelf is messy. All right. If they bid
 

1327
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,029
shelf is messy. All right. If they bid
over this shelf, they're going to come

1328
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
over this shelf, they're going to come
 

1329
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,470
over this shelf, they're going to come
for a big squeeze. If they lose the

1330
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,480
for a big squeeze. If they lose the
 

1331
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,909
for a big squeeze. If they lose the
shelf, we can think about the same trade

1332
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:43,919
shelf, we can think about the same trade
 

1333
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,990
shelf, we can think about the same trade
again. We've got news coming in three

1334
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,000
again. We've got news coming in three
 

1335
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,669
again. We've got news coming in three
minutes. It's a little bit risky.

1336
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679

 

1337
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,190

They're going to do it now, aren't they?

1338
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
They're going to do it now, aren't they?
 

1339
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,389
They're going to do it now, aren't they?
You bastards. It's the story of my life

1340
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:58,399
You bastards. It's the story of my life
 

1341
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,389
You bastards. It's the story of my life
right now. VIX almost filled its gap.

1342
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
right now. VIX almost filled its gap.
 

1343
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,950
right now. VIX almost filled its gap.
Not quite there.

1344
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:02,960
Not quite there.
 

1345
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,110
Not quite there.
Almost filled its gap. Not quite there.

1346
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,120
Almost filled its gap. Not quite there.
 

1347
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,070
Almost filled its gap. Not quite there.
So, VIX trading now at 58. Gap fill on

1348
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,080
So, VIX trading now at 58. Gap fill on
 

1349
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:15,190
So, VIX trading now at 58. Gap fill on
the VIX would be 42s.

1350
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200

 

1351
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,190

If they rebid this, they can come up

1352
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
If they rebid this, they can come up
 

1353
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,029
If they rebid this, they can come up
here.

1354
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039

 

1355
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,190

That would be very aggressive,

1356
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,200
That would be very aggressive,
 

1357
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,470
That would be very aggressive,
especially with the mag looking the way

1358
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
especially with the mag looking the way
 

1359
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,909
especially with the mag looking the way
it is. That would be amazingly

1360
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
it is. That would be amazingly
 

1361
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,830
it is. That would be amazingly
aggressive. Apple starting to lose its

1362
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:27,840
aggressive. Apple starting to lose its
 

1363
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,029
aggressive. Apple starting to lose its
bid. All right, remember that one and a

1364
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
bid. All right, remember that one and a
 

1365
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:37,029
bid. All right, remember that one and a
half% up. It's now just 0.20% up.

1366
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039

 

1367
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,029

We are holding bids though. There's no

1368
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
We are holding bids though. There's no
 

1369
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,149
We are holding bids though. There's no
doubt about it. We're right into this

1370
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
doubt about it. We're right into this
 

1371
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,149
doubt about it. We're right into this
thick area from Friday. So, it's a big

1372
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:44,159
thick area from Friday. So, it's a big
 

1373
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,990
thick area from Friday. So, it's a big
area from Friday, but if they squeeze

1374
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
area from Friday, but if they squeeze
 

1375
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,750
area from Friday, but if they squeeze
through this,

1376
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
through this,
 

1377
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,750
through this,
88 850s is possible. Here's the squeeze.

1378
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:49,760
88 850s is possible. Here's the squeeze.
 

1379
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,990
88 850s is possible. Here's the squeeze.
So, not in this long. Might kick myself

1380
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
So, not in this long. Might kick myself
 

1381
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,630
So, not in this long. Might kick myself
for this. 8 to 850 is possible. Failed

1382
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:56,640

00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
down. If they're going to let it go,
 

1427
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,870

1471
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,269

When I say tape, you mean footprint and

1472
00:33:59,269 --> 00:33:59,279
When I say tape, you mean footprint and
 

1473
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,990
When I say tape, you mean footprint and
not time and sales, right? I mean time

1479
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,710
on bookmap. That is the tape.
Time and sales. Like however you want to

1480
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
Time and sales. Like however you want to
 

1481
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,389
Time and sales. Like however you want to
look at that. But for me, if I'm looking

1482
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
look at that. But for me, if I'm looking
 

1483
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,750
look at that. But for me, if I'm looking

00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:13,760
at the tape, the story of the tape, I'm
 

1485
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,310
at the tape, the story of the tape, I'm
actually watching bookmap. Bookmap gives

1486
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
actually watching bookmap. Bookmap gives
 

1487
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,389
actually watching bookmap. Bookmap gives
me more of a story of the tape than uh

1488
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,399
me more of a story of the tape than uh
 

1489
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,389

footprint does. Footprint does. It's

00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:20,399
footprint does. Footprint does. It's
 

1491
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,550
footprint does. Footprint does. It's
very hard to see like in each second

1492
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,560
very hard to see like in each second
 

1493
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,629
very hard to see like in each second
what's happening. Whereas in bookmap, I

1494
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
what's happening. Whereas in bookmap, I
 

1495
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,310
what's happening. Whereas in bookmap, I
can see every single tick that's coming

1496
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
can see every single tick that's coming
 

1497
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,909
can see every single tick that's coming
through.

1498
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:29,919

 

1499
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,109

Okay, opening range now sets.

1517
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,589
in now at 7:15 lot. So, they're trying
to get aggressive. We might leave this

1518
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:51,599
to get aggressive. We might leave this
 

1519
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,190
to get aggressive. We might leave this
tape now. This is what I'm looking for.

1520
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
tape now. This is what I'm looking for.
 

1521
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,030
tape now. This is what I'm looking for.
Can we leave this shelf now and be

1522
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
Can we leave this shelf now and be
 

1523
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,230
Can we leave this shelf now and be
aggressive?

1524
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,240

 

1525
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,069

Still, they are bidding and holding down

1526
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
Still, they are bidding and holding down
 

1527

1528
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
here. So, no break underneath where that
 

1529
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,990
here. So, no break underneath where that
big uh participant came in earlier in

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,000
big uh participant came in earlier in
 

1531
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,150
big uh participant came in earlier in
the day. 97s, remember 97s is where they

1532
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,160
the day. 97s, remember 97s is where they
 

1533
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,750

1535
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,829
came in. So, it's kind of ugly here.
We've got one shelf here and then we've

1536
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839
We've got one shelf here and then we've
 

1537
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,150
We've got one shelf here and then we've
got like another little low here. So, we

1538
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
got like another little low here. So, we
 

1539
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,829
got like another little low here. So, we
really got to come under this. We can

1540
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:15,839
really got to come under this. We can
 

1541
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,430
really got to come under this. We can
move this down. We've really got to lose

1542
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
move this down. We've really got to lose
 

1543
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,069
move this down. We've really got to lose
this whole section here. Until we lose

1544
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
this whole section here. Until we lose
 

1545
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,430
this whole section here. Until we lose
that, we can't really think about the

1546
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
that, we can't really think about the
 

1547
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,950
that, we can't really think about the
short. We'd have to lose that whole

1548
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
short. We'd have to lose that whole
 

1549
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,910
short. We'd have to lose that whole
section.

1550
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920

 

1551
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,710

How much more juice has it got it?

1552
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:32,720
How much more juice has it got it?
 

1553
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,750
How much more juice has it got it?
Right. Point control here now shifted up

1554
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:35,760
Right. Point control here now shifted up

going to play that long up there today.
 

1575

It feels like suicides to me right now,

1576
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:09,839
It feels like suicides to me right now,
 

1577
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,870
It feels like suicides to me right now,
especially without a trap underneath.

1578
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
especially without a trap underneath.
 

1579
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,310
especially without a trap underneath.
Maybe they just do it. Maybe they just

1580
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,320
Maybe they just do it. Maybe they just
 

1581
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,030
Maybe they just do it. Maybe they just
turn the algo on and go.

1582
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,040
turn the algo on and go.
 

1583
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,190
turn the algo on and go.
Right, VIX now filled its gap. So VIX

1584
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,200
Right, VIX now filled its gap. So VIX
 

1585
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,790
Right, VIX now filled its gap. So VIX
has now filled its gap as well. So we

1586
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
has now filled its gap as well. So we
 

1587
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,109
has now filled its gap as well. So we
have a completely efficient market.

1588
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:23,119
have a completely efficient market.
 

1589
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,630
have a completely efficient market.
Let's see if VIX is going to fade under

1590
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,640
Let's see if VIX is going to fade under
 

1591
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,150
Let's see if VIX is going to fade under
this gap. Market will continue to

1592
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
this gap. Market will continue to
 

1593
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,670
this gap. Market will continue to
squeeze higher. So 8 850s is still

1594
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
squeeze higher. So 8 850s is still
 

1595
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,230
squeeze higher. So 8 850s is still
possible here. 8 to 850s is still

1596
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
possible here. 8 to 850s is still
 

1597
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,030
possible here. 8 to 850s is still
possible here. It's a mine in my mind,

1598
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,040
possible here. It's a mine in my mind,
 

1599
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,710
possible here. It's a mine in my mind,
it's a very dangerous move to trade from

1600
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:36,720
it's a very dangerous move to trade from
 

1601
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,550
it's a very dangerous move to trade from
here to there, especially without like a

1602
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:38,560
here to there, especially without like a
 

1603
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,990
here to there, especially without like a
flush. If they'd flushed back down and

1604
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
flush. If they'd flushed back down and
 

1605
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,150
flush. If they'd flushed back down and
reclaimed, if they'd done something like

1606
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,160
reclaimed, if they'd done something like
 

1607
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,670
reclaimed, if they'd done something like
this,

1608
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
this,
 

1609
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,190
this,
right, I'd be more willing to take it.

1610
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,200
right, I'd be more willing to take it.
 

1611
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,550
right, I'd be more willing to take it.
But I'm more interested in this move

1612
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:46,560
But I'm more interested in this move
 

1613
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,550
But I'm more interested in this move
down into here

1614
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:48,560
down into here
 

1615
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,310
down into here
and then then I can think about the

1616
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,320
and then then I can think about the
 

1617
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,470
and then then I can think about the
long. But the way we're building this

1618
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
long. But the way we're building this
 

1619
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,310
long. But the way we're building this
squeeze base, squeeze base, squeeze. Not

1620
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,320
squeeze base, squeeze base, squeeze. Not
 

1621
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,750
squeeze base, squeeze base, squeeze. Not
really interested, especially when you

1622
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:57,760
really interested, especially when you
 

1623
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,430
really interested, especially when you
consider where we've come from.

1624
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,440
consider where we've come from.
 

1625
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,550
consider where we've come from.
Yeah, it's a big move into this same

1626
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:04,560
Yeah, it's a big move into this same
 

1627
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:14,870
Yeah, it's a big move into this same
kind of shelf. It's a very big move.

1628
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880

 

1629
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,910

We will see.

1630
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
We will see.
 

1631
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,349
We will see.
Still stalking that same move.

1632
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
Still stalking that same move.
 

1633
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,510
Still stalking that same move.
Seeing some weakness now. Do they stay

1634
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
Seeing some weakness now. Do they stay
 

1635
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,550
Seeing some weakness now. Do they stay
heavy under this key level?

1636
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:26,560
heavy under this key level?
 

1637
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,990
heavy under this key level?
Point of control. Now I'm watching point

1638
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
Point of control. Now I'm watching point
 

1639
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,230
Point of control. Now I'm watching point
of control. 707s

1640
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
of control. 707s
 

1641
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,630
of control. 707s
and 97s. Remember 97's where they kept

1642
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:32,640
and 97s. Remember 97's where they kept
 

1643
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,950
and 97s. Remember 97's where they kept
defending earlier.

1644
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:34,960
defending earlier.
 

1645
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,030
defending earlier.
Back to this point of control.

1646
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040

 

1647
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,630

watching. They're stalking this now in

1648
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
watching. They're stalking this now in
 

1649
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,069
watching. They're stalking this now in
case they offer it.

1650
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
case they offer it.
 

1651
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,390
case they offer it.
Still, they're absorbing down here. They

1652
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
Still, they're absorbing down here. They
 

1653
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,870
Still, they're absorbing down here. They
are relentless down there.

1654
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:54,880

 

1655
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,390

That's a fail break higher. If they

1656
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
That's a fail break higher. If they
 

1657
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,990
That's a fail break higher. If they
don't break higher now, I'm feeling

1658
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,000
don't break higher now, I'm feeling
 

1659
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,990
don't break higher now, I'm feeling
better about it. If we come underneath

1660
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,000
better about it. If we come underneath
 

1661
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,470
better about it. If we come underneath
the uh 700s,

1662
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:02,480
the uh 700s,
 

1663
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,150
the uh 700s,
they're still bidding this gray shelf.

1664
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,160
they're still bidding this gray shelf.
 

1665
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,990
they're still bidding this gray shelf.
We still possibly come up here. It would

1666
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
We still possibly come up here. It would
 

1667
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,990
We still possibly come up here. It would
be a huge squeeze day if we come up

1668
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
be a huge squeeze day if we come up
 

1669
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,270
be a huge squeeze day if we come up
there. If the low of overnight is 150

1670
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,280
there. If the low of overnight is 150
 

1671
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,349
there. If the low of overnight is 150
and we squeeze all the way up to 850,

1672
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359
and we squeeze all the way up to 850,
 

1673
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,670
and we squeeze all the way up to 850,
that is

1674
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:15,680
that is
 

1675
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,510
that is
without a significant pullback. That is

1676
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,520
without a significant pullback. That is
 

1677
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,550
without a significant pullback. That is
going some. That's really impressive.

1678
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560

 

1679
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,630

Yeah, PMI 10 minutes. Yeah.

1680
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:26,640
Yeah, PMI 10 minutes. Yeah.
 

1681
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,349
Yeah, PMI 10 minutes. Yeah.
So, we just had some news drop

So, we just had some news drop
 

1683

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,310
52.4. Previous was 51.8. There was no
forecast on it.

1692
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,320
forecast on it.
 

1693
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,550
forecast on it.
Okay. 750 being added on the tape above

1694
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,560
Okay. 750 being added on the tape above
 

1695
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,310
Okay. 750 being added on the tape above
us now. So, we've got passive sellers.

1696
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,320
us now. So, we've got passive sellers.
 

1697
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,150
us now. So, we've got passive sellers.

Yes. 800 is on the tape. What the [\h__\h]
 

1703
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,310
Yes. 800 is on the tape. What the [\h__\h]

They're really just going to do a giant

1706
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:01,760
They're really just going to do a giant
 

1707
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,270
They're really just going to do a giant
squeeze today to 800s. Maybe.

1708
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280
squeeze today to 800s. Maybe.
 

1709
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,829
squeeze today to 800s. Maybe.
Maybe.

1710
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:09,839

 

1711
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,589

It's a relentless bid up here this

1712
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:11,599
It's a relentless bid up here this
 

1713
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,310
It's a relentless bid up here this
morning.

1714
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,320
morning.
 

1715
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,670
morning.
The more I look at it, the more I think

1716
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,680
The more I look at it, the more I think
 

1717
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,030
The more I look at it, the more I think
we're going for that previous week point

1718
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
we're going for that previous week point
 

1719
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,109
we're going for that previous week point
of control. But there's no way I'm

1720
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119
of control. But there's no way I'm
 

1721
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,430
of control. But there's no way I'm
playing that move. That is, in my mind,

1722
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
playing that move. That is, in my mind,
 

1723
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,150
playing that move. That is, in my mind,
is a complete psychopath move for a

1724
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,160
is a complete psychopath move for a
 

1725
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,390
is a complete psychopath move for a
straight up squeeze from the GlobeEx

1726
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
straight up squeeze from the GlobeEx
 

1727
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,990
straight up squeeze from the GlobeEx
low. If we're going to move from 150 or

1728
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,000
low. If we're going to move from 150 or
 

1729
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,870
low. If we're going to move from 150 or
180, whatever it is, to 850 with no

1730
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
180, whatever it is, to 850 with no
 

1731
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,470
180, whatever it is, to 850 with no
significant pullback. I mean, look at

1732
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,480
significant pullback. I mean, look at
 

1733
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,829
significant pullback. I mean, look at
this New York open. We've already

1734
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:35,839
this New York open. We've already
 

1735
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,750
this New York open. We've already
traded,

1736
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:37,760
traded,
 

1737
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,470
traded,
right? We've already traded from five,

1738
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,480
right? We've already traded from five,
 

1739
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,950
right? We've already traded from five,
but we're already 200 points higher

1740
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
but we're already 200 points higher
 

1741
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,030
but we're already 200 points higher
without any significant pullback. Here

1742
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,040
without any significant pullback. Here
 

1743
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,390
without any significant pullback. Here
we go. They're just going to do a giant

1744
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,400
we go. They're just going to do a giant
 

1745
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,550
we go. They're just going to do a giant
squeeze here then by the looks of it.

1746
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
squeeze here then by the looks of it.
 

1747
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,790
squeeze here then by the looks of it.
Nutters. Absolute nutters. But that's

1748
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:50,800
Nutters. Absolute nutters. But that's
 

1749
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,950
Nutters. Absolute nutters. But that's
what they are.

1750
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960

 

1751
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,589

mental.

1752
00:39:59,589 --> 00:39:59,599
mental.
 

1753
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,829
mental.
Someone's stuck. Do they want previous

1754
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
Someone's stuck. Do they want previous
 

1755
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,230
Someone's stuck. Do they want previous
day high on spy?

1756
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,240

 

1757
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,390

Yep, it looks like they do. They want

1758
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,400
Yep, it looks like they do. They want
 

1759
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,910
Yep, it looks like they do. They want
that five day and previous day high.

1760
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:09,920
that five day and previous day high.
 

1761
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,470
that five day and previous day high.
They are ripping this thing now. Nothing

1762
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
They are ripping this thing now. Nothing
 

1763
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,390
They are ripping this thing now. Nothing
to do here. Maybe if you if you traded

1764
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:14,400
to do here. Maybe if you if you traded
 

1765
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,190
to do here. Maybe if you if you traded
that gray box, you're braver than me.

1766
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,200
that gray box, you're braver than me.
 

1767
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,550
that gray box, you're braver than me.
But uh this is where it's coming now.

1768
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,560
But uh this is where it's coming now.
 

1769
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,310
But uh this is where it's coming now.
This is the target then for them. This

1770
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:22,320
This is the target then for them. This
 

1771
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,230
This is the target then for them. This
is where they're going.

1772
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,240
is where they're going.
 

1773
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,310
is where they're going.
Look at this squeeze. They caught them

1774
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:26,320
Look at this squeeze. They caught them
 

1775
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,950
Look at this squeeze. They caught them
all offside. This is their target.

1776
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:28,960
all offside. This is their target.
 

1777
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,190
all offside. This is their target.
So 800's coming up

1778
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,200

 

1779
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,030

and no acceptance underneath the

1780
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,040
and no acceptance underneath the
 

1781
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,950
and no acceptance underneath the
previous week. No acceptance underneath

1782
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
previous week. No acceptance underneath
 

1783
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,470
previous week. No acceptance underneath
the previous day. And we're going to

1784
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
the previous day. And we're going to
 

1785
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,069
the previous day. And we're going to
come right up to this naked point of

1786
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
come right up to this naked point of
 

1787
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,589
come right up to this naked point of
control by the looks of it. This is a

1788
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
control by the looks of it. This is a
 

1789
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,069
control by the looks of it. This is a
huge huge uh move to do in one go is the

1790
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:46,079
huge huge uh move to do in one go is the
 

1791
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,589
huge huge uh move to do in one go is the
best way of me saying it. To do in one

1792
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:47,599
best way of me saying it. To do in one
 

1793
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,069
best way of me saying it. To do in one
go. It's not necessarily huge move to do

1794
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:50,079
go. It's not necessarily huge move to do
 

1795
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,630
go. It's not necessarily huge move to do
without a significant bull back is uh is

1796
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
without a significant bull back is uh is
 

1797
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:02,470
without a significant bull back is uh is
very very aggressive.

1798
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:02,480

 

1799
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,990

So I'm selling here and if they keep

1800
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,000
So I'm selling here and if they keep
 

1801
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,990
So I'm selling here and if they keep
absorbing versus 85 they've got a chance

1802
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
absorbing versus 85 they've got a chance
 

1803
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,109
absorbing versus 85 they've got a chance
to move higher.

1804
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:09,119
to move higher.
 

1805
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,550
to move higher.
So you can see a little bit of a new

1806
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
So you can see a little bit of a new
 

1807
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,790
So you can see a little bit of a new
shelf developing here.

1808
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:14,800

 

1809
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,030

They squeezed up. If they let go of 85,

1810
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,040
They squeezed up. If they let go of 85,
 

1811
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,510
They squeezed up. If they let go of 85,
they can come back down. But we just

1812
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:19,520
they can come back down. But we just
 

1813
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,990
they can come back down. But we just
have to see how they operate on that on

1814
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
have to see how they operate on that on
 

1815
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,030
have to see how they operate on that on
that move.

1816
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
that move.
 

1817
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,589
that move.
Big seller came in at 90 there. So 90 is

1818
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
Big seller came in at 90 there. So 90 is
 

1819
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,510
Big seller came in at 90 there. So 90 is
a big overunder now. Gray box. So if

1820
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520
a big overunder now. Gray box. So if
 

1821
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,829
a big overunder now. Gray box. So if
they retap into 90 and and lose it,

1822
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:33,839
they retap into 90 and and lose it,
 

1823
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,150
they retap into 90 and and lose it,
there's a possible wash down lower. So

1824
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
there's a possible wash down lower. So
 

1825
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,910
there's a possible wash down lower. So
90s is your level, your overunder. If

1826
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
90s is your level, your overunder. If
 

1827
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,270
90s is your level, your overunder. If
they reclaim 90s, then we're going to

1828
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
they reclaim 90s, then we're going to
 

1829
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,710
they reclaim 90s, then we're going to
expect 850s.

1830
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:42,720

 

1831
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,710

For me, spy looks like it wants previous

1832
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:44,720
For me, spy looks like it wants previous
 

1833
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,910
For me, spy looks like it wants previous
day high. They all look like the one

1834
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
day high. They all look like the one
 

1835
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,190
day high. They all look like the one
previous day high right now. So, we're

1836
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
previous day high right now. So, we're
 

1837
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,190
previous day high right now. So, we're
losing 90s at the moment. Do they come

1838
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
losing 90s at the moment. Do they come
 

1839
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,710
losing 90s at the moment. Do they come
and fill some of this imbalance down to

1840
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
and fill some of this imbalance down to
 

1841
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,510
and fill some of this imbalance down to
these 50s and below now

1842
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
these 50s and below now
 

1843
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,910
these 50s and below now
in this short

1844
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:55,920
in this short
 

1845
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,069
in this short
and we fill an imbalance the next

1846
00:41:58,069 --> 00:41:58,079
and we fill an imbalance the next
 

1847
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,349
and we fill an imbalance the next
imbalance? We've tapped the first one.

1848
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
imbalance? We've tapped the first one.
 

1849
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,309
imbalance? We've tapped the first one.
Next one's down at uh 60 now.

So, short versus 90. Stop in the money.

1852
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
So, short versus 90. Stop in the money.
 

1853
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,829
So, short versus 90. Stop in the money.
We either get paid or we don't here.

00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:09,839
We either get paid or we don't here.
 

1855
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,470
We either get paid or we don't here.
So, short from here versus 90. Looking

00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
So, short from here versus 90. Looking
 

1857
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,950
So, short from here versus 90. Looking
for this play down into here.

1858
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:14,960
for this play down into here.
 

1859
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,470
for this play down into here.
Really, I'm more interested down into

1860
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:16,480
Really, I'm more interested down into
 

1861
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,829
Really, I'm more interested down into
here, but I'm playing this pullback. If

1862
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
here, but I'm playing this pullback. If
 

1863
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,670
here, but I'm playing this pullback. If
they base down here, I don't mind

1864
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
they base down here, I don't mind
 

1865
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,950
they base down here, I don't mind
playing that long, and I don't mind

1866
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:20,960
playing that long, and I don't mind
 

1867

00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
playing that short.
 

1869
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:37,190
playing that short.
Here we go.

1870
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,200

 

1871
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,630

Next imbalance will be 60s. Here we go.

1872
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640
Next imbalance will be 60s. Here we go.
 

1873
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,589
Next imbalance will be 60s. Here we go.
Almost got it. Next imbalance is 60s.

1874
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:43,599
Almost got it. Next imbalance is 60s.
 

1875

Almost got it. Looking for a TP into 60s
here.

1878

1879
00:42:49,599 --> 00:43:03,190

Protecting it so far.

1880

1881
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,670

Yeah. 65s

1882

Yeah. 65s
 

1883
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,910
Yeah. 65s
and 60s. Yeah, they're still finding a

1884
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
and 60s. Yeah, they're still finding a
 

1885
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,270
and 60s. Yeah, they're still finding a
beard in front of that balance at the

1886
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,280
beard in front of that balance at the
 

1887
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:23,510
beard in front of that balance at the
moment.

1888
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520

 

1889
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,510

Going to protect my stop here again

1890
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
Going to protect my stop here again
 

1891
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,150
Going to protect my stop here again
because I am counter trend here at 90.

1892
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,160
because I am counter trend here at 90.
 

1893
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,109
because I am counter trend here at 90.
Any reclaim of 90, I'm out. Any reclaim

1894
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
Any reclaim of 90, I'm out. Any reclaim
 

1895

Any reclaim of 90, I'm out. Any reclaim
of that, I'm out.

1896
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
of that, I'm out.
 

1897
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,750
of that, I'm out.
How long we got some news? Five minutes.

1898
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
How long we got some news? Five minutes.
 

1899
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,589
How long we got some news? Five minutes.
Here we go. Coming for these 60s now.

1900
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:37,599
Here we go. Coming for these 60s now.
 

1901
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:45,190
Here we go. Coming for these 60s now.
Give me that TP.

1902
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200

 

1903
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,030

They front ran it. You can see even on

1904
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,040
They front ran it. You can see even on
 

1905
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,870
They front ran it. You can see even on
the on bookmat.

1906
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:50,880

 

1907
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,990

Oh, they front run it just here. All

1908
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:54,000
Oh, they front run it just here. All
 

1909
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,750
Oh, they front run it just here. All
right. Looking to get filled into 60s.

1910
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:55,760
right. Looking to get filled into 60s.
 

1911
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,870
right. Looking to get filled into 60s.
There's an imbalance down here. They

1912
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:56,880
There's an imbalance down here. They
 

1913
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,349
There's an imbalance down here. They
front ran it twice now. So, this guy's

1914
00:43:59,349 --> 00:43:59,359
front ran it twice now. So, this guy's
 

1915
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,790
front ran it twice now. So, this guy's
now stepping up. Very, very bullish

1916
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:00,800
now stepping up. Very, very bullish
 

1917
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,309
now stepping up. Very, very bullish
under there. If they use his pain, we

1918
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:02,319
under there. If they use his pain, we
 

1919
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,069
under there. If they use his pain, we
can go lower. So, watching this very

1920
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
can go lower. So, watching this very
 

1921
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,150
can go lower. So, watching this very
carefully.

1922
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,160

 

1923
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,230

I will happily play long if they uh come

1924
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,240
I will happily play long if they uh come
 

1925
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,950
I will happily play long if they uh come
back down to the 700s and base out now.

1926
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:14,960
back down to the 700s and base out now.
 

1927
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,190
back down to the 700s and base out now.
Tell you that much. There's just no way

1928
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
Tell you that much. There's just no way
 

1929
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,270
Tell you that much. There's just no way
I'm bidding up here.

1930
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280

 

1931
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,109

This guy's moving up. Look at this guy

1932
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
This guy's moving up. Look at this guy
 

1933
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:33,510
This guy's moving up. Look at this guy
chasing the market higher now.

1934
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520

 

1935
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,750

All right, sellers coming in at 75. So

1936
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:35,760
All right, sellers coming in at 75. So
 

1937
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,950
All right, sellers coming in at 75. So
75 and 90 of the level

1938
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:40,960

 

1939
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,349

news coming here in 5 minutes. Need to

1940
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
news coming here in 5 minutes. Need to
 

1941
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,990
news coming here in 5 minutes. Need to
let this news come. Uh what you guys

1942
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,000
let this news come. Uh what you guys
 

1943
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,430
let this news come. Uh what you guys
saying? I watch a pullback video and

1944
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:47,440
saying? I watch a pullback video and
 

1945
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,030
saying? I watch a pullback video and
it's very helpful.

1946
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040

 

1947
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,470

What would be my next entry? Um

1948
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
What would be my next entry? Um
 

1949
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,990
What would be my next entry? Um
if I'm going to play the counter trend

1950
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
if I'm going to play the counter trend
 

1951
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,750
if I'm going to play the counter trend
fade, I'm looking for a rejection of

1952
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,760
fade, I'm looking for a rejection of
 

1953
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,030
fade, I'm looking for a rejection of
here. I got to be careful because they

1954
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,040
here. I got to be careful because they
 

1955
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,950
here. I got to be careful because they
keep building it out really nasty. I

1956
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
keep building it out really nasty. I
 

1957
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,390
keep building it out really nasty. I
think they want to come up here. So if

1958
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:02,400
think they want to come up here. So if
 

1959
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,750
think they want to come up here. So if
I'm going to replay this, I'm looking

1960
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
I'm going to replay this, I'm looking
 

1961
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,430
I'm going to replay this, I'm looking
for that.

1962
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,440
for that.
 

1963
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,150
for that.
If we base down here, I'll consider

1964
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,160
If we base down here, I'll consider
 

1965
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,990
If we base down here, I'll consider
longs down here. Right? If we do

1966
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,000
longs down here. Right? If we do
 

1967
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,349
longs down here. Right? If we do
something like this, I'll consider

1968
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:11,359
something like this, I'll consider
 

1969
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,030
something like this, I'll consider
longs. Especially if we don't take this

1970
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,040
longs. Especially if we don't take this
 

1971
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,109
longs. Especially if we don't take this
out. If we already take this out and

1972
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:15,119
out. If we already take this out and
 

1973
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,349
out. If we already take this out and
reject, I'm far less interested in the

1974
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:17,359
reject, I'm far less interested in the
 

1975
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,270
reject, I'm far less interested in the
longs. So, I'm willing to play both

1976
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,280
longs. So, I'm willing to play both
 

1977
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,670
longs. So, I'm willing to play both
sides at the moment. Why? Because if we

1978
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:21,680
sides at the moment. Why? Because if we
 

1979
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,550
sides at the moment. Why? Because if we
zoom out and think about where we are.

1980
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:24,560
zoom out and think about where we are.
 

1981
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,630
zoom out and think about where we are.
We expected the squeeze this morning and

1982
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,640
We expected the squeeze this morning and
 

1983
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,990
We expected the squeeze this morning and
I said to you, it's either going to

1984
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
I said to you, it's either going to
 

1985
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,309
I said to you, it's either going to
stop. They will end the squeeze here or

1986
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
stop. They will end the squeeze here or
 

1987
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,230
stop. They will end the squeeze here or
here. All right? We're between the two

1988
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,240
here. All right? We're between the two
 

1989
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,750
here. All right? We're between the two
right now. Remember that this morning?

1990
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
right now. Remember that this morning?
 

1991
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,270
right now. Remember that this morning?
We're likely to see a squeeze up to

1992
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
We're likely to see a squeeze up to
 

1993
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,270
We're likely to see a squeeze up to
here, here, or here. I would rip

1994
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:37,280
here, here, or here. I would rip
 

1995
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,190
here, here, or here. I would rip
straight through the first one into this

1996
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,200
straight through the first one into this
 

1997
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,270
straight through the first one into this
node. This is the next point. All right.

1998
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,280
node. This is the next point. All right.
 

1999
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,589
node. This is the next point. All right.
So, I would expect a pullback to happen

2000
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:43,599
So, I would expect a pullback to happen
 

2001
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,589
So, I would expect a pullback to happen
somewhere in here at some point. All

2002
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:45,599
somewhere in here at some point. All
 

2003
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,750
somewhere in here at some point. All
right. So, 800, 850 down to five, just

2004
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:49,760
right. So, 800, 850 down to five, just
 

2005
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,349
right. So, 800, 850 down to five, just
call it 600. There's probably a 200

2006
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
call it 600. There's probably a 200
 

2007
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,190
call it 600. There's probably a 200
point pullback in here somewhere, right?

2008
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
point pullback in here somewhere, right?
 

2009
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,190
point pullback in here somewhere, right?
While they build out this and then they

2010
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
While they build out this and then they
 

2011
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,510
While they build out this and then they
have to make the decision, are they

2012
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:57,520
have to make the decision, are they
 

2013
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,870
have to make the decision, are they
going to do that or are they going to do

2014
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:58,880
going to do that or are they going to do
 

2015
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,950
going to do that or are they going to do
that, right? So we expect this squeeze

2016
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
that, right? So we expect this squeeze
 

2017
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,589
that, right? So we expect this squeeze
here's look at the structure right we

2018
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:03,599
here's look at the structure right we
 

2019
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,910
here's look at the structure right we
expect this

2020
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
expect this
 

2021
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,309
expect this
then we expect this then I don't know

2022
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
then we expect this then I don't know
 

2023
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,990
then we expect this then I don't know
because then it has to make its decision

2024
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,000
because then it has to make its decision
 

2025
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,069
because then it has to make its decision
once it's built liquidity is it doing

2026
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
once it's built liquidity is it doing
 

2027
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,710
once it's built liquidity is it doing
this or is it doing this

2028
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720

 

2029
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,390

uh one of you asked where I get Discord

2030
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,400
uh one of you asked where I get Discord
 

2031
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,829
uh one of you asked where I get Discord
if you've done the course go to the end

2032
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:21,839
if you've done the course go to the end
 

2033
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:22,950
if you've done the course go to the end
of the course it would tell you how to

2034
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
of the course it would tell you how to
 

2035
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,390
of the course it would tell you how to
get the Discord if you've bought the

2036
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:24,400
get the Discord if you've bought the
 

2037
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:37,829
get the Discord if you've bought the
course go to the end of

2038
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:37,839

 

2039
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,390

Still holding bits here.

2040
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,400
Still holding bits here.
 

2041
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,910
Still holding bits here.
Here come the 60s.

2042
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:45,920

 

2043
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:54,309

Come on.

2044
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:54,319

 

2045
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,069

Still holding bids. flow zone starting

2046
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:56,079
Still holding bids. flow zone starting
 

2047
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,750
Still holding bids. flow zone starting
to catch up. Order flow is still bullish

2048
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:57,760
to catch up. Order flow is still bullish
 

2049
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,790
to catch up. Order flow is still bullish
right now.

the way to the end. If you really want
 

2055
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,589
the way to the end. If you really want

down here or 20s. Right. So we're
 

2069
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,349
down here or 20s. Right. So we're
filling in some of this. We want to see

2070
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,359
filling in some of this. We want to see
 

2071

00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:23,599
if we come down into this and then do
 

2073
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,069
if we come down into this and then do
they rebid off this or do we use that as

2074
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:26,079
they rebid off this or do we use that as
 

2075
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,069
they rebid off this or do we use that as
a complete collapse and leave buyers

2076
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:28,079
a complete collapse and leave buyers
 

2077
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,430
a complete collapse and leave buyers
trapped. Here we go. So, no matter what

going to protect my stop now and we just
see if we're going to come lower now at

2082
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:35,119
see if we're going to come lower now at
 

2083
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,109
see if we're going to come lower now at
this point into this block. Here we go,

2084
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,119
this point into this block. Here we go,
 

2085
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,190

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,470
folks. Jesus Christ. They squeeze that
for a long time today.

2088
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480
for a long time today.
 

2089
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,390
for a long time today.
So, they're bidding here at 40s or just

2090
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,400
So, they're bidding here at 40s or just
 

2091
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,349
So, they're bidding here at 40s or just
under 40s 75 lot here into this opening

2092
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
under 40s 75 lot here into this opening
 

2093
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,309
under 40s 75 lot here into this opening
range. And like we said, this can be

2094
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:50,319
range. And like we said, this can be
 

2095
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,150
range. And like we said, this can be
absorbed down here. Now we built out big

2096
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,160
absorbed down here. Now we built out big
 

2097
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,829
absorbed down here. Now we built out big
shelf. So this is a big cover point for

2098
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
shelf. So this is a big cover point for
 

2099
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,589
shelf. So this is a big cover point for
us. If we get under it, we can think

2100
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:55,599
us. If we get under it, we can think
 

2101
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,109
us. If we get under it, we can think
about lower. Right. They just filled

2102
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:57,119
about lower. Right. They just filled
 

2103
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,870
about lower. Right. They just filled
this buyer here.

2104
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:00,880

 

2105
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,390

They just filled this buyer.

2106
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:04,400
They just filled this buyer.
 

2107
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,990
They just filled this buyer.
Change some of this. Make sure this

2108
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
Change some of this. Make sure this
 

2109
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,670
Change some of this. Make sure this
looks a little bit better for the day on

2110
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
looks a little bit better for the day on
 

2111
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,829
looks a little bit better for the day on
my Ninja Trader. Go build this shelf

2112
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:09,839
my Ninja Trader. Go build this shelf
 

2113
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,990
my Ninja Trader. Go build this shelf
out. Let's see if we can get into the

2114
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
out. Let's see if we can get into the
 

2115
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,589
out. Let's see if we can get into the
20s here. Opening range here. You can

2116
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:13,599
20s here. Opening range here. You can
 

2117
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,230
20s here. Opening range here. You can
move your stop tighter here. See if we

2118
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,240
move your stop tighter here. See if we
 

2119
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,829
move your stop tighter here. See if we
can get down into this gray box next.

2120
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839
can get down into this gray box next.
 

2121
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,470
can get down into this gray box next.
So, we're short versus the 90s, right?

2122
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,480
So, we're short versus the 90s, right?
 

2123
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,790
So, we're short versus the 90s, right?
Short versus the 90s. We're 50 points up

2124
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:22,800
Short versus the 90s. We're 50 points up
 

2125
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,150
Short versus the 90s. We're 50 points up
now already. Let's see if we can get

2126
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,160
now already. Let's see if we can get
 

2127
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,230
now already. Let's see if we can get
down into here. Looks good.

2128
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240
down into here. Looks good.
 

2129
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,990
down into here. Looks good.
Nice. Here's the opening range. Let's

2130
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,000
Nice. Here's the opening range. Let's
 

2131
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,790
Nice. Here's the opening range. Let's
go. Come on.

2132
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:32,800
go. Come on.
 

2133
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,630
go. Come on.
So, there's an imbalance upside now into

2134
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:34,640
So, there's an imbalance upside now into
 

2135
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,990
So, there's an imbalance upside now into
60. If they want to come up to that

2136
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:36,000
60. If they want to come up to that
 

2137
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,270
60. If they want to come up to that
imbalance and then fade it, which it

2138
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,280
imbalance and then fade it, which it
 

2139
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,030
imbalance and then fade it, which it
looks like they're trying to do. So, we

2140
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,040
looks like they're trying to do. So, we
 

2141
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,630
looks like they're trying to do. So, we
have to see if they reject 60. they only

2142
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
have to see if they reject 60. they only
 

2143
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,549
have to see if they reject 60. they only
reclaim a 60 now and then I'm not really

2144
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:42,559
reclaim a 60 now and then I'm not really
 

2145
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,430
reclaim a 60 now and then I'm not really
that interested in holding it especially

2146
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:45,440
that interested in holding it especially
 

2147
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,230
that interested in holding it especially

It doesn't really matter what the

matters is how the market react reacts
 

2239
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,109
matters is how the market react reacts

do not trade fundamentals. I trade the

00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
reaction to it. Otherwise, you're going
 

2247
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,710
reaction to it. Otherwise, you're going
to be susceptible to sell the news, buy

00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
to be susceptible to sell the news, buy
 

2249
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,549

opening yourself up. Right? If we've bid

2252
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:03,680
opening yourself up. Right? If we've bid
 

2253
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,670

2257
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,710
and days and the news is positive, you
think they're going to bid up more? No,

2258
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,720
think they're going to bid up more? No,
 

2259
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,069
think they're going to bid up more? No,
they're not. They're going to use it to

2260
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
they're not. They're going to use it to
 

2261
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,309
they're not. They're going to use it to
sell into it liquidity. Okay, back down

2262
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:12,319
sell into it liquidity. Okay, back down
 

2263
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:21,430
sell into it liquidity. Okay, back down
to this opening range again.

2265
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,430

Why CFD moves differently? Yeah, because

2266
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:23,440
Why CFD moves differently? Yeah, because
 

2267
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,190
Why CFD moves differently? Yeah, because
it's not a centralized exchange. It

2268
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
it's not a centralized exchange. It
 

2269
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,270
it's not a centralized exchange. It
doesn't have as much liquidity and

2270
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
doesn't have as much liquidity and
 

2271
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,710
doesn't have as much liquidity and
because the broker's job there is

2272
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:28,720
because the broker's job there is
 

2273
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,270
because the broker's job there is
completely [\h__\h] you over on slips. All

2274
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,280
completely [\h__\h] you over on slips. All
 

2275
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,270
completely [\h__\h] you over on slips. All
right. So that's why I would not trade

2276
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
right. So that's why I would not trade
 

2277
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,349
right. So that's why I would not trade
CFDs. If you can avoid trading CFDs,

2278
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:35,359
CFDs. If you can avoid trading CFDs,
 

2279
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,349
CFDs. If you can avoid trading CFDs,
especially on markets where you could,

2280
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:37,359
especially on markets where you could,
 

2281
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,270
especially on markets where you could,
you know, trade the what you would call

2282
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,280
you know, trade the what you would call
 

2283
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,349
you know, trade the what you would call
the pair, you could trade the futures

2284
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:41,359
the pair, you could trade the futures
 

2285
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,030
the pair, you could trade the futures
exchange for it. Why bother? Why not

2286
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
exchange for it. Why bother? Why not
 

2287
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,030
exchange for it. Why bother? Why not
trade the centralized exchange which is

2288
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
trade the centralized exchange which is
 

2289
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,630
trade the centralized exchange which is
regulated?

2290
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:50,640

 

2291
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,910

What do I think of silver? I think

2292
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
What do I think of silver? I think
 

2293
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,670
What do I think of silver? I think
silver probably do a bounce and then

2294
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,680
silver probably do a bounce and then
 

2295
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,710
silver probably do a bounce and then
we'll see if they fade it on on on the

2296
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:56,720
we'll see if they fade it on on on the
 

2297
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,470
we'll see if they fade it on on on the
bounce. All right, so they're still

2298
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
bounce. All right, so they're still
 

2299
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,710
bounce. All right, so they're still
finding bids on flow zones and straight

2300
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
finding bids on flow zones and straight
 

2301
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,549
finding bids on flow zones and straight
back to this level. I still think at the

2302
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:02,559
back to this level. I still think at the
 

2303
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,710
back to this level. I still think at the
moment they want to revisit up here and

2304
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:04,720
moment they want to revisit up here and
 

2305
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,470
moment they want to revisit up here and
it looks like very much to me like ES

2306
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:06,480
it looks like very much to me like ES
 

2307
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,829
it looks like very much to me like ES
wants previous day high right now. So ES

2308
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:09,839
wants previous day high right now. So ES
 

2309
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,950
wants previous day high right now. So ES
previous day high is at 94s. SPY

2310
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
previous day high is at 94s. SPY
 

2311
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,430
previous day high is at 94s. SPY
previous day high is at about the same

2312
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,440
previous day high is at about the same
 

2313
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,190
previous day high is at about the same
94s

2314
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,200
94s
 

2315
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,870
94s
with the 5day up there.

2316
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:20,880
with the 5day up there.
 

2317
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,309
with the 5day up there.
We can't get through this shelf at the

2318
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,319
We can't get through this shelf at the
 

2319
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,549
We can't get through this shelf at the
moment. I think we will. Oh, it says OBS

2320
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:24,559
moment. I think we will. Oh, it says OBS
 

2321
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:32,630
moment. I think we will. Oh, it says OBS
disconnected. you guys there?

2322
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:32,640

 

2323
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,630

No, you don't need to say sorry at all.

2324
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
No, you don't need to say sorry at all.
 

2325
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,470
No, you don't need to say sorry at all.
You don't need to say sorry. I'm just

2326
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:36,480
You don't need to say sorry. I'm just
 

2327
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,069
You don't need to say sorry. I'm just
trying to help you guys. There's there's

2328
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:38,079
trying to help you guys. There's there's
 

2329
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,390
trying to help you guys. There's there's
no sorry about uh the news being bearish

2330
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400
no sorry about uh the news being bearish
 

2331
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,750
no sorry about uh the news being bearish
or anything. You don't need to say

2332
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:41,760
or anything. You don't need to say
 

2333
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,190
or anything. You don't need to say
sorry, but just it's like the that

2334
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:45,200
sorry, but just it's like the that
 

2335
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,790
sorry, but just it's like the that
easiest play in the game, right? That

2336
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
easiest play in the game, right? That
 

2337
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,390
easiest play in the game, right? That
they they will uh use a print and go the

2338
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,400
they they will uh use a print and go the
 

2339
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,470
they they will uh use a print and go the
other way, right? It's the most obvious

2340
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:52,480
other way, right? It's the most obvious
 

2341
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,470
other way, right? It's the most obvious
thing in the game that they can do. You

2342
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
thing in the game that they can do. You
 

2343
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,829
thing in the game that they can do. You
have to understand where we are

2344
00:52:55,829 --> 00:52:55,839
have to understand where we are
 

2345
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,990
have to understand where we are
positionally in technicals. Where we are

2346
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,000
positionally in technicals. Where we are
 

2347
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,349
positionally in technicals. Where we are
into that print, right? You just said

2348
00:52:59,349 --> 00:52:59,359
into that print, right? You just said
 

2349
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,710
into that print, right? You just said
news was bearish. What are we doing?

2350
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:00,720
news was bearish. What are we doing?
 

2351
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,829
news was bearish. What are we doing?
We're printing upside. How many

2352
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:01,839
We're printing upside. How many
 

2353
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,349
We're printing upside. How many
fundamental traders went, okay, we're

2354
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:03,359
fundamental traders went, okay, we're
 

2355
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,030
fundamental traders went, okay, we're
going to be bearish, right? Well, guess

2356
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,040
going to be bearish, right? Well, guess
 

2357
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,030
going to be bearish, right? Well, guess
what? If they've all piled in short,

2358
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
what? If they've all piled in short,
 

2359
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,109
what? If they've all piled in short,
right, on that news, then we are going

2360
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
right, on that news, then we are going
 

2361
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,870
right, on that news, then we are going
to use them to go higher. Don't get

2362
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
to use them to go higher. Don't get
 

2363
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,470
to use them to go higher. Don't get
don't get too caught up in the news.

2364
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:12,480
don't get too caught up in the news.
 

2365
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,390
don't get too caught up in the news.
Worry about the reaction of the chart.

2366
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:16,400
Worry about the reaction of the chart.
 

2367
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,069
Worry about the reaction of the chart.
If it's breaking news, which isn't

2368
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
If it's breaking news, which isn't
 

2369
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,670
If it's breaking news, which isn't
priced in, it's a little bit different,

2370
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
priced in, it's a little bit different,
 

2371
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,990
priced in, it's a little bit different,
right? If we get some huge headline that

2372
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,000
right? If we get some huge headline that
 

2373
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,829
right? If we get some huge headline that
comes out, big war news or something

2374
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
comes out, big war news or something
 

2375
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,750
comes out, big war news or something
really really big that is not priced in.

2376
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:27,760
really really big that is not priced in.
 

2377
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,349
really really big that is not priced in.
Remember, most news is already priced

2378
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:29,359
Remember, most news is already priced
 

2379
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:34,390
Remember, most news is already priced
in.

2380
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:34,400

 

2381
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,710

Let me come back to this same level.

2382
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:40,720

 

2383
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,910

There you go. React don't predict.

2384
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:41,920
There you go. React don't predict.
 

2385
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,589
There you go. React don't predict.
That's exactly it. Okay. So, it looks to

2386
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:43,599
That's exactly it. Okay. So, it looks to
 

2387
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,030
That's exactly it. Okay. So, it looks to
me like they want to squeeze up here at

2388
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,040
me like they want to squeeze up here at
 

2389
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,549
me like they want to squeeze up here at
the moment. So, they held in front of

2390
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
the moment. So, they held in front of
 

2391
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,309
the moment. So, they held in front of
this shelf. We didn't quite get down to

2392
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:48,319
this shelf. We didn't quite get down to
 

2393
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,150
this shelf. We didn't quite get down to
it. Like I said, I was willing to bid

2394
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,160
it. Like I said, I was willing to bid
 

2395
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,470
it. Like I said, I was willing to bid
long down here if we did something like

2396
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:52,480
long down here if we did something like
 

2397
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,790
long down here if we did something like
this. And I think now they'll try and

2398
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:54,800
this. And I think now they'll try and
 

2399
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,630
this. And I think now they'll try and
complete this and we'll watch ES into

2400
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:56,640
complete this and we'll watch ES into
 

2401
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,990
complete this and we'll watch ES into
previous day high. And then we'll look

2402
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
previous day high. And then we'll look
 

2403
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,750
previous day high. And then we'll look
to see if they do a fail breakout above

2404
00:53:59,750 --> 00:53:59,760
to see if they do a fail breakout above
 

2405
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,069
to see if they do a fail breakout above
that or not. OBS keeps telling me it's

2406
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:02,079
that or not. OBS keeps telling me it's
 

2407
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,309
that or not. OBS keeps telling me it's
disconnecting. If we get stuttery today,

2408
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:04,319
disconnecting. If we get stuttery today,
 

2409
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:13,109
disconnecting. If we get stuttery today,
please just let me know.

2410
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119

 

2411
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,109

Vick's getting caught at that 1750. So,

2412
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:15,119
Vick's getting caught at that 1750. So,
 

2413
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,069
Vick's getting caught at that 1750. So,
no full reclaim.

2414
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
no full reclaim.
 

2415
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,510
no full reclaim.
Market probably going to slow down a bit

2416
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:19,520
Market probably going to slow down a bit
 

2417
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,270
Market probably going to slow down a bit
here. Coming into that whole number 800.

2418
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,280
here. Coming into that whole number 800.
 

2419
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,870
here. Coming into that whole number 800.
I still think it wants higher at the

2420
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:22,880
I still think it wants higher at the
 

2421
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,030
I still think it wants higher at the
moment. I think it wants this naked

2422
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:25,040
moment. I think it wants this naked
 

2423
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,190
moment. I think it wants this naked
level up into here.

2424
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200

 

2425
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,950

It's what it looks like to me. It gets

2426
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
It's what it looks like to me. It gets
 

2427
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,870
It's what it looks like to me. It gets
very thick. If we look at the hourly

2428
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:32,880
very thick. If we look at the hourly
 

2429
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,430
very thick. If we look at the hourly
when we went there last week, this is a

2430
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:35,440
when we went there last week, this is a
 

2431
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,030
when we went there last week, this is a
big big level. We talked about this in

2432
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:37,040
big big level. We talked about this in
 

2433
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,349
big big level. We talked about this in
the newsletter. This level here is big,

2434
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:39,359
the newsletter. This level here is big,
 

2435
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,670
the newsletter. This level here is big,
right? Bears have got to defend this. If

2436
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,680
right? Bears have got to defend this. If
 

2437
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,109
right? Bears have got to defend this. If
Bears fail to defend this and we do

2438
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:43,119
Bears fail to defend this and we do
 

2439
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,430
Bears fail to defend this and we do
this, then we can go rotation right to

2440
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,440
this, then we can go rotation right to
 

2441
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,990
this, then we can go rotation right to
where? Top end and probably top side of

2442
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
where? Top end and probably top side of
 

2443
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,390
where? Top end and probably top side of
Ballinger, which will be Ballingers is

2444
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
Ballinger, which will be Ballingers is
 

2445
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,309
Ballinger, which will be Ballingers is
here. That's how tight the Ballinger is

2446
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:52,319
here. That's how tight the Ballinger is
 

2447
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,510
here. That's how tight the Ballinger is
right now. 176. We could go from lower

2448
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:55,520
right now. 176. We could go from lower
 

2449
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,230
right now. 176. We could go from lower
bowl to upper bowl in a day right now as

2450
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
bowl to upper bowl in a day right now as
 

2451
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,069
bowl to upper bowl in a day right now as
we build out the the rotation, which

2452
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,079
we build out the the rotation, which
 

2453
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,390
we build out the the rotation, which
would be kind of gross, but it's very

2454
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
would be kind of gross, but it's very
 

2455
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,390
would be kind of gross, but it's very
very possible at the moment. All right,

2456
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:04,400
very possible at the moment. All right,
 

2457
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,950
very possible at the moment. All right,
here they go. So, they're lifting.

2458
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:06,960
here they go. So, they're lifting.
 

2459
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,309
here they go. So, they're lifting.
All right, orderflow bullish. Flow

2460
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
All right, orderflow bullish. Flow
 

2461
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,589
All right, orderflow bullish. Flow
zone's bullish. I played this little

2462
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:09,599
zone's bullish. I played this little
 

2463
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,750
zone's bullish. I played this little
short back down into this Waiting now to

2464
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
short back down into this Waiting now to
 

2465
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,430
short back down into this Waiting now to
see how we react up here. Might be

2466
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
see how we react up here. Might be
 

2467
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,710
see how we react up here. Might be
kicking myself that I didn't just buy

2468
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:14,720
kicking myself that I didn't just buy
 

2469
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:26,390
kicking myself that I didn't just buy
dips all morning today, but there we go.

2470
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:26,400

 

2471
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,790

I'm going to come up to here.

2472
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:30,800

 

2473
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,230

26 210 26. Yeah. All the way up here

2474
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,240
26 210 26. Yeah. All the way up here
 

2475
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,910
26 210 26. Yeah. All the way up here
will be top bolt. It's possible. It

2476
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
will be top bolt. It's possible. It
 

2477
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:42,710
will be top bolt. It's possible. It
would be pretty mad, but it's possible.

2478
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:42,720

 

2479
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,950

I think they want a little bit higher

2480
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:44,960
I think they want a little bit higher
 

2481
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,109
I think they want a little bit higher
here

2482
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:47,119
here
 

2483
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,670
here
this out.

2484
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
this out.
 

2485
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,150
this out.
Yeah, look at this 161. That would be

2486
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
Yeah, look at this 161. That would be
 

2487
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,309
Yeah, look at this 161. That would be
perfect into this kind of level. Even a

2488
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:54,319
perfect into this kind of level. Even a
 

2489
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,630
perfect into this kind of level. Even a
two measured move will be fine. They're

2490
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
two measured move will be fine. They're
 

2491
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,789
two measured move will be fine. They're
almost there. They're almost there. And

2492
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
almost there. They're almost there. And
 

2493
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,470
almost there. They're almost there. And
I imagine that would be a big target for

2494
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
I imagine that would be a big target for
 

2495
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,230
I imagine that would be a big target for
them once they get up into that. That

2496
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,240
them once they get up into that. That
 

2497
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,829
them once they get up into that. That
they might call it a day there. Unless

2498
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
they might call it a day there. Unless
 

2499
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,069
they might call it a day there. Unless
they really want to turn the jets on.

2500
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:06,079
they really want to turn the jets on.
 

2501
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,309
they really want to turn the jets on.
they will have to get over 900 then for

2502
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319
they will have to get over 900 then for
 

2503
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,750
they will have to get over 900 then for
a move back up to 26,100.

2504
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
a move back up to 26,100.
 

2505
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,910
a move back up to 26,100.
So into this level and if they base over

2506
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:13,920
So into this level and if they base over
 

2507
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,789
So into this level and if they base over
at 26,100 but I would say that's fairly

2508
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:16,799
at 26,100 but I would say that's fairly
 

2509
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,109
at 26,100 but I would say that's fairly
unlikely. I would think it's more likely

2510
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:19,119
unlikely. I would think it's more likely
 

2511
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,589
unlikely. I would think it's more likely
that they shove up into here and then

2512
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
that they shove up into here and then
 

2513
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,750
that they shove up into here and then
sell their inventory. But we will see

2514
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:23,760
sell their inventory. But we will see
 

2515
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,789
sell their inventory. But we will see
folks. We will see. Could be like last

2516
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:26,799
folks. We will see. Could be like last
 

2517
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,190
folks. We will see. Could be like last
week where Monday, Tuesday,

2518
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
week where Monday, Tuesday,
 

2519
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,589
week where Monday, Tuesday,
even Wednesday bid up and then uh flush

2520
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:31,599
even Wednesday bid up and then uh flush
 

2521
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,990
even Wednesday bid up and then uh flush
back down. So almost there on uh the ES.

2522
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:36,000
back down. So almost there on uh the ES.
 

2523
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,510
back down. So almost there on uh the ES.
We talked about that previous day high.

2524
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:37,520
We talked about that previous day high.
 

2525
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,630
We talked about that previous day high.
It's very very very close on the ES

2526
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
It's very very very close on the ES
 

2527
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,109
It's very very very close on the ES
right now. Very very very close about to

2528
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119
right now. Very very very close about to
 

2529
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,789
right now. Very very very close about to
actually five day. SPY is already

2530
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:44,799
actually five day. SPY is already
 

2531
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,390
actually five day. SPY is already
through it. It's just the ES. And then

2532
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
through it. It's just the ES. And then
 

2533
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,950
through it. It's just the ES. And then
you can think about that 7,000. SPY

2534
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
you can think about that 7,000. SPY
 

2535
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,309
you can think about that 7,000. SPY
already through it. My stomach is

2536
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:52,319
already through it. My stomach is
 

2537
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,390
already through it. My stomach is
rolling.

2538
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
rolling.
 

2539
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,870
rolling.
Need some food.

2540
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,880

 

2541
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,630

Right. Watching this level. See how we

2542
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:00,640
Right. Watching this level. See how we
 

2543
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,870
Right. Watching this level. See how we
react. previous day value area high,

2544
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:02,880
react. previous day value area high,
 

2545
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,150
react. previous day value area high,
previous week point of control. So,

2546
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,160
previous week point of control. So,
 

2547
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,630
previous week point of control. So,
we've completed a full rotation from

2548
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:06,640
we've completed a full rotation from
 

2549
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,470
we've completed a full rotation from
previous day value area low right back

2550
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
previous day value area low right back
 

2551
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,150
previous day value area low right back
up to previous day value area high. So,

2552
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:10,160
up to previous day value area high. So,
 

2553
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,150
up to previous day value area high. So,
no auction underneath it. No rejection

2554
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
no auction underneath it. No rejection
 

2555
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,630
no auction underneath it. No rejection
of it, no rejection of previous day

2556
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
of it, no rejection of previous day
 

2557
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,470
of it, no rejection of previous day
point of control, right up to previous

2558
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,480
point of control, right up to previous
 

2559
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,390
point of control, right up to previous
day value area high and previous week

2560
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,400
day value area high and previous week
 

2561
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,750
day value area high and previous week
point of control. I would imagine in

2562
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,760
point of control. I would imagine in
 

2563
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,190
point of control. I would imagine in
here there'll be a look above and a

2564
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,200
here there'll be a look above and a
 

2565
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,109
here there'll be a look above and a
fail. I would imagine unless they're

2566
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:23,119
fail. I would imagine unless they're
 

2567
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:24,549
fail. I would imagine unless they're
really going to go mental for the

2568
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:24,559
really going to go mental for the
 

2569
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:30,230
really going to go mental for the
26,100s.

2570
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240

 

2571
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,309

ES almost there folks. We do have

2572
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:32,319
ES almost there folks. We do have
 

2573
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,990
ES almost there folks. We do have
divergence between the ES and the

2574
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,000
divergence between the ES and the
 

2575
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,750
divergence between the ES and the
spiders, right? Cash is already over

2576
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:35,760
spiders, right? Cash is already over
 

2577
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:41,349
spiders, right? Cash is already over
previous day high. ES is not.

2578
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:41,359

 

2579
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,270

What did I miss, Tyson? Starting with 5

2580
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:43,280
What did I miss, Tyson? Starting with 5
 

2581
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,950
What did I miss, Tyson? Starting with 5
PAS today. Most I've had at one time.

2582
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
PAS today. Most I've had at one time.
 

2583
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,950
PAS today. Most I've had at one time.
Nice work.

2584
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:46,960
Nice work.
 

2585
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,710
Nice work.
Yeah, I'm very hungry. Can you hear my

2586
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
Yeah, I'm very hungry. Can you hear my
 

2587
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,789
Yeah, I'm very hungry. Can you hear my
stomach rumbling? I'm very, very hungry.

2588
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:50,799
stomach rumbling? I'm very, very hungry.
 

2589
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,870
stomach rumbling? I'm very, very hungry.
It's what, 8 7 in the morning. So, we're

2590
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:54,880
It's what, 8 7 in the morning. So, we're
 

2591
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,789
It's what, 8 7 in the morning. So, we're
watching this shelf here. All right. So,

2592
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:56,799
watching this shelf here. All right. So,
 

2593
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,789
watching this shelf here. All right. So,
I'd like them to complete the squeeze.

2594
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799
I'd like them to complete the squeeze.
 

2595
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,309
I'd like them to complete the squeeze.
If I'm going to play the short, I'm

2596
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:00,319
If I'm going to play the short, I'm
 

2597
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,910
If I'm going to play the short, I'm
going to need to see some buyers trapped

2598
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:01,920
going to need to see some buyers trapped
 

2599
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,069
going to need to see some buyers trapped
on up here and then short down into

2600
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
on up here and then short down into
 

2601
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,750
on up here and then short down into
here. And then if we find acceptance,

2602
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:05,760
here. And then if we find acceptance,
 

2603
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,829
here. And then if we find acceptance,
this move here,

2604
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:07,839
this move here,
 

2605
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,109
this move here,
not before that. We're not going to

2606
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
not before that. We're not going to
 

2607
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,710
not before that. We're not going to
short on the way up. All right, we're

2608
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:10,720
short on the way up. All right, we're
 

2609

course for the indicator should tell you
what to do.

2762
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760

 

2763
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,510

All right, almost there. It's almost at

2764
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:49,520
All right, almost there. It's almost at
 

2765
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,789
All right, almost there. It's almost at
that low hanging fruit

2766
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:52,799
that low hanging fruit
 

2767
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,030
that low hanging fruit
right into here. Sort of 850ish

2768
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:55,040
right into here. Sort of 850ish
 

2769
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,270
right into here. Sort of 850ish
somewhere around that. And uh remember

2770
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:57,280
somewhere around that. And uh remember
 

2771
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,829
somewhere around that. And uh remember
above 900s if we base out between 900

2772
01:01:59,829 --> 01:01:59,839
above 900s if we base out between 900
 

2773
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,390
above 900s if we base out between 900
and 850. We can go all the way up to

2774
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
and 850. We can go all the way up to
 

2775
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,470
and 850. We can go all the way up to
26,100s.

2776
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:04,480
26,100s.
 

2777
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:10,470
26,100s.
Definitely 26,80s.

2778
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480

All right. So, all low hanging fruit has

2812
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:54,079
All right. So, all low hanging fruit has
 

2813
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,589
All right. So, all low hanging fruit has
been taken. If you were long, I would be

2814
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:55,599
been taken. If you were long, I would be
 

2815
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,510
been taken. If you were long, I would be
out 90% of your position. If you're very

2816
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520
out 90% of your position. If you're very
 

2817
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,630
out 90% of your position. If you're very
lucky, you'll come all the way up here,

2818
01:02:58,630 --> 01:02:58,640
lucky, you'll come all the way up here,
 

2819
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,630
lucky, you'll come all the way up here,
but I would be out 90% of your position.

2820
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:00,640
but I would be out 90% of your position.
 

2821
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,710
but I would be out 90% of your position.
Now, if you were long, uh, you've just

2822
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:02,720
Now, if you were long, uh, you've just
 

2823
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,950
Now, if you were long, uh, you've just
hit all the key moves. I would not be

2824
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:04,960
hit all the key moves. I would not be
 

2825
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,870
hit all the key moves. I would not be
holding, looking for anything beyond

2826
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:06,880
holding, looking for anything beyond
 

2827
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,630
holding, looking for anything beyond
this. You would be very, very lucky if

2828
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640
this. You would be very, very lucky if
 

2829
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,470
this. You would be very, very lucky if
they continue to squeeze beyond this.

2830
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
they continue to squeeze beyond this.
 

2831
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,910
they continue to squeeze beyond this.
might very well be that you get very

2832
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
might very well be that you get very
 

2833
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,510
might very well be that you get very
lucky, but I wouldn't be holding beyond

2834
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
lucky, but I wouldn't be holding beyond
 

2835
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,150
lucky, but I wouldn't be holding beyond
it. Okay? Don't think there's a reason

2836
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:16,160
it. Okay? Don't think there's a reason
 

2837
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,309
it. Okay? Don't think there's a reason
to hold beyond this. They are being very

2838
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
to hold beyond this. They are being very
 

2839
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,829
to hold beyond this. They are being very
aggressive with the bid this morning,

2840
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:19,839
aggressive with the bid this morning,
 

2841
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,990
aggressive with the bid this morning,
but your job is to make money and lock

2842
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:22,000
but your job is to make money and lock
 

2843
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,309
but your job is to make money and lock
it in, isn't it? Your job is not to, you

2844
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:24,319
it in, isn't it? Your job is not to, you
 

2845
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,789
it in, isn't it? Your job is not to, you
know, gamble for the next move. Your job

2846
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
know, gamble for the next move. Your job
 

2847
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:32,549
know, gamble for the next move. Your job
is to lock in money where possible.

2848
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:32,559

 

2849
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,870

Now, starting to see if they can base

2850
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:34,880
Now, starting to see if they can base
 

2851
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,870
Now, starting to see if they can base
above this. I will not be playing longs

2852
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:36,880
above this. I will not be playing longs
 

2853
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,230
above this. I will not be playing longs
from previous week point of control

2854
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:38,240
from previous week point of control
 

2855
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,750
from previous week point of control
unless we build out a huge amount of

2856
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:39,760
unless we build out a huge amount of
 

2857
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,630
unless we build out a huge amount of
liquidity up into this level here next.

2858
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:42,640
liquidity up into this level here next.
 

2859
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,470
liquidity up into this level here next.
I would imagine there will be a fade

2860
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:44,480
I would imagine there will be a fade
 

2861
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,950
I would imagine there will be a fade
coming because they've done not really

2862
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
coming because they've done not really
 

2863
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,029
coming because they've done not really
built up much liquidity but at the

2864
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
built up much liquidity but at the
 

2865
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,349
built up much liquidity but at the
moment they had just been bid up bid up

2866
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:51,359
moment they had just been bid up bid up
 

2867
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,870
moment they had just been bid up bid up
bid up bid up all morning long and they

2868
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
bid up bid up all morning long and they
 

2869
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,190
bid up bid up all morning long and they
still bid up bid up bid up. It's very

2870
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
still bid up bid up bid up. It's very
 

2871
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,510
still bid up bid up bid up. It's very
very very aggressive here. This is

2872
01:03:59,510 --> 01:03:59,520
very very aggressive here. This is
 

2873
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,390
very very aggressive here. This is
madness. Previous day point of control

2874
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:02,400
madness. Previous day point of control
 

2875
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,190
madness. Previous day point of control
on Ninja Trader is at 79. So I'd be

2876
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:05,200
on Ninja Trader is at 79. So I'd be
 

2877
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,309
on Ninja Trader is at 79. So I'd be
watching this is what I talking about

2878
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:06,319
watching this is what I talking about
 

2879
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,589
watching this is what I talking about
the divergence between NT

2880
01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:09,599
the divergence between NT
 

2881
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,349
the divergence between NT
still it's going VIX might want previous

2882
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:11,359
still it's going VIX might want previous
 

2883
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,750
still it's going VIX might want previous
day low here. This is a huge squeeze out

2884
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:13,760
day low here. This is a huge squeeze out
 

2885
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,029
day low here. This is a huge squeeze out
for the day off GlobeEx low and we are

2886
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
for the day off GlobeEx low and we are
 

2887
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,349
for the day off GlobeEx low and we are
now what 800 points higher or something

2888
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:19,359
now what 800 points higher or something
 

2889
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,270
now what 800 points higher or something
ridiculous. 700 points higher.

2890
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:23,280
ridiculous. 700 points higher.
 

2891
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,789
ridiculous. 700 points higher.
Very hard to get in. Yeah, we should

2892
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:24,799
Very hard to get in. Yeah, we should
 

2893
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,309
Very hard to get in. Yeah, we should
have just bought that drive this

2894
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:26,319
have just bought that drive this
 

2895
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:42,150
have just bought that drive this
morning.

2896
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,160

 

2897
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,510

chat buys there for sure.

2898
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,520
chat buys there for sure.
 

2899
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,349
chat buys there for sure.
Might be a fade coming soon. Soon

2900
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:47,359
Might be a fade coming soon. Soon
 

2901
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,109
Might be a fade coming soon. Soon
enough. We know that this level here is

2902
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:49,119
enough. We know that this level here is
 

2903
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,309
enough. We know that this level here is
key. This gray box is key.

2904
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:52,319
key. This gray box is key.
 

2905
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,470
key. This gray box is key.
Here it comes. So, we've got imbalances

2906
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
Here it comes. So, we've got imbalances
 

2907
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,349
Here it comes. So, we've got imbalances
now down to 50s and 40s.

2908
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
now down to 50s and 40s.
 

2909
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,190
now down to 50s and 40s.
Big old squeeze. Don't love the excess

2910
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:01,200
Big old squeeze. Don't love the excess
 

2911
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,630
Big old squeeze. Don't love the excess
at the high yet. There is a decent

2912
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
at the high yet. There is a decent
 

2913
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,789
at the high yet. There is a decent
amount of 74s, but we haven't really

2914
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:04,799
amount of 74s, but we haven't really
 

2915
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:15,349
amount of 74s, but we haven't really
retested it yet. So, we'll see.

2916
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:15,359

 

2917
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:24,870

There's the 60s.

2923
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,109
at 70s 74s. If they leave 74s and we
trade under 60s, they might get a bit

2924
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:33,119
trade under 60s, they might get a bit
 

2925
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,589
trade under 60s, they might get a bit
more aggressive under here. We leave

2926
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
more aggressive under here. We leave
 

2927
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:41,589
more aggressive under here. We leave
74s.

2943
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,589

with only really this little pullback
 

2957
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,029
with only really this little pullback

2959
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,109

has offered. All right, that's the first
 

2967
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,630
has offered. All right, that's the first
reattack of 75. So, they haven't got

2968
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:36,640
reattack of 75. So, they haven't got
 

2969
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,390
reattack of 75. So, they haven't got
through the 75s that we just talked

2970
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
through the 75s that we just talked
 

2971
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,549
through the 75s that we just talked
about.

2972
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:40,559

Are they going to come a little bit

2974
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:41,920
Are they going to come a little bit
 

2975
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,470
Are they going to come a little bit
higher? Looks like the answer is yes. is

01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,109
which would be 917.
All right, based on NT 917 which is up

2990
01:06:59,109 --> 01:06:59,119
All right, based on NT 917 which is up

here. Is there anything left? This is so
 

2993
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,789
here. Is there anything left? This is so
squeezy. It's crazy

01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,270

And we have got stops to aim for at 944.

3000
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:25,280
And we have got stops to aim for at 944.
 

3001
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,510
And we have got stops to aim for at 944.
If we start basing up here like oh my

god, talk about a turnaround.
 

3005
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,230
god, talk about a turnaround.
We talk about a turnaround. If we base

3006
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,240
We talk about a turnaround. If we base
 

3007
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,710
We talk about a turnaround. If we base
up here, this is going to be quite a big

3008
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
up here, this is going to be quite a big

We'll see. This is only the first test,
 

3015
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:47,829
We'll see. This is only the first test,
though.

3016
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:47,839

 

3017
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,910

So I have an old point of control from

the day I said the divergence between NT

3032
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:05,760
the day I said the divergence between NT
 

3033
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:11,270
the day I said the divergence between NT

front side. The only way you've lost

3054
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
front side. The only way you've lost
 

3055
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,030
front side. The only way you've lost
this is if you're betting against it on

3056
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
this is if you're betting against it on
 

3057
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,669
this is if you're betting against it on
on the way up. Just don't do that. If

3058
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
on the way up. Just don't do that. If
 

3059
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,189
on the way up. Just don't do that. If
you want to play the fade, it's going to

3060
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:41,199
you want to play the fade, it's going to
 

3061
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:42,709
you want to play the fade, it's going to
have to like wash out and leave

3069
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,189
You entered at 880. You entered what? At
880. If you longed at 880, you're nuts.

3070
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:57,199
880. If you longed at 880, you're nuts.
 

3071
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,189
880. If you longed at 880, you're nuts.
And if you've shorted at 880, there's no

3072
01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
And if you've shorted at 880, there's no
 

3073
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,030
And if you've shorted at 880, there's no
reason to short. There's literally you

3074
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,040
reason to short. There's literally you
 

3075
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,870
reason to short. There's literally you
haven't left anything yet.

3076
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:04,880

 

3077
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,110

So if you've if you've longed at 880 and

3078
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,120
So if you've if you've longed at 880 and
 

3079
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,349
So if you've if you've longed at 880 and
you've lost all your money, you how have

3080
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
you've lost all your money, you how have
 

3081
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,910
you've lost all your money, you how have
you lost all your money? You must be so

3082
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:11,920
you lost all your money? You must be so
 

3083
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,749
you lost all your money? You must be so
oversized.

3084
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759

 

3085
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,269

All right, so looks like previous day

3086
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:17,279
All right, so looks like previous day
 

3087
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,269
All right, so looks like previous day
value area high based on NT is the next

3088
01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:19,279
value area high based on NT is the next
 

3089
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:23,590
value area high based on NT is the next
area. Then 920s here. Oh my gosh, here

3090
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:23,600
area. Then 920s here. Oh my gosh, here
 

3091
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,189
area. Then 920s here. Oh my gosh, here
we go. 920 is coming up.

3092
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:27,199
we go. 920 is coming up.
 

3093
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,749
we go. 920 is coming up.
920 is coming up. I would say big buyer

3094
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:29,759
920 is coming up. I would say big buyer
 

3095
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,510
920 is coming up. I would say big buyer
came in at 900. So all the time they're

3096
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:31,520
came in at 900. So all the time they're
 

3097
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,390
came in at 900. So all the time they're
above 900. 920s is what they're looking

3098
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
above 900. 920s is what they're looking
 

3099
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,390
above 900. 920s is what they're looking
for, which is previous day value high

3100
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:36,400
for, which is previous day value high
 

3101
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,030
for, which is previous day value high
based on just on Ninja Trader. If we get

3102
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
based on just on Ninja Trader. If we get
 

3103
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,470
based on just on Ninja Trader. If we get
through 920s and we base above, you

3104
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,480
through 920s and we base above, you
 

3105
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,470
through 920s and we base above, you
cannot rule out 26,070s.

3106
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:46,480

 

3107
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,910

Can't rule out up here if they get a

3108
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:49,920
Can't rule out up here if they get a
 

3109
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,630
Can't rule out up here if they get a
base above it. Back to the 900s we go.

3110
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:54,640
base above it. Back to the 900s we go.
 

3111
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,149
base above it. Back to the 900s we go.
Right.

3112
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:56,159
Right.
 

3113
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:13,030
Right.
So buyers now caught at 900s and above.

3114
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040

 

3115
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,910

I don't want to get long now.

3116
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:15,920
I don't want to get long now.
 

3117
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,070
I don't want to get long now.
I don't want to get long now. We've uh

3118
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,080
I don't want to get long now. We've uh
 

3119
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,830
I don't want to get long now. We've uh
completed this whole move on NT. If we

3120
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:19,840
completed this whole move on NT. If we
 

3121
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,750
completed this whole move on NT. If we
think about this,

3122
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:21,760
think about this,
 

3123
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,310
think about this,
all right, based on Ninja Trader, this

3124
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
all right, based on Ninja Trader, this
 

3125
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,910
all right, based on Ninja Trader, this
was previous days, but this is so

3126
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:25,920
was previous days, but this is so
 

3127
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,149
was previous days, but this is so
different to uh

3128
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
different to uh
 

3129
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,950
different to uh
to what we were seeing on um Trading

3130
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:30,960
to what we were seeing on um Trading
 

3131
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,030
to what we were seeing on um Trading
View, but this like reclaim and a

3132
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:33,040
View, but this like reclaim and a
 

3133
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,310
View, but this like reclaim and a
straight squeeze without a pullback.

3134
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
straight squeeze without a pullback.
 

3135
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,910
straight squeeze without a pullback.
We've we've literally reclaimed the

3136
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:35,920
We've we've literally reclaimed the
 

3137
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,350
We've we've literally reclaimed the
whole of the previous week and previous

3138
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:37,360
whole of the previous week and previous
 

3139
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,590
whole of the previous week and previous
day, the whole way back up without a

3140
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:39,600
day, the whole way back up without a
 

3141
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,030
day, the whole way back up without a
pullback. I definitely don't want to be

3142
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:41,040
pullback. I definitely don't want to be
 

3143
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,390
pullback. I definitely don't want to be
long up here. I want it's going to have

3144
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:42,400
long up here. I want it's going to have
 

3145
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,070
long up here. I want it's going to have
to do a significant pullback and build

3146
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:44,080
to do a significant pullback and build
 

3147
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,149
to do a significant pullback and build
out a lot of liquidity for me to

3148
01:10:46,149 --> 01:10:46,159
out a lot of liquidity for me to
 

3149
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,750
out a lot of liquidity for me to
consider any form of long. And I just uh

3150
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:49,760
consider any form of long. And I just uh
 

3151
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,750
consider any form of long. And I just uh
it's way way way too risky. The only

3152
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
it's way way way too risky. The only
 

3153
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,430
it's way way way too risky. The only
long opportunity I guess was here and we

3154
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:53,440
long opportunity I guess was here and we
 

3155
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,790
long opportunity I guess was here and we
were looking for a long down here into

3156
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:54,800
were looking for a long down here into
 

3157
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,229
were looking for a long down here into
700 off it. Didn't offer it. Do not do

3158
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:58,239
700 off it. Didn't offer it. Do not do
 

3159
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:03,270
700 off it. Didn't offer it. Do not do
not get overly bullish at the highs.

3160
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280

 

3161
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,070

Nice, Tyson. Great work. Right. Big buy

3162
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:06,080
Nice, Tyson. Great work. Right. Big buy
 

3163
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,709
Nice, Tyson. Great work. Right. Big buy
came in at 900. We haven't quite got to

3164
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
came in at 900. We haven't quite got to
 

3165
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:25,830
came in at 900. We haven't quite got to
those 20s yet. We're not far away.

3166
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:25,840

 

3167
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,149

Indy on the footprint. So this is sell

3168
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:28,159
Indy on the footprint. So this is sell
 

3169
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:37,750
Indy on the footprint. So this is sell
side mount. It's 2645.

3170
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:37,760

 

3171
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,270

What time frame are we looking at? Like

3172
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,280
What time frame are we looking at? Like
 

3173
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,070
What time frame are we looking at? Like
15 minute or something.

3174
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:42,080
15 minute or something.
 

3175
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,390
15 minute or something.
Yeah, up here. There is. You're right.

3176
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:44,400
Yeah, up here. There is. You're right.
 

3177
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,310
Yeah, up here. There is. You're right.
There is

3178
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,320
There is
 

3179
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,550
There is
definitely.

3180
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:48,560
definitely.
 

3181
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,149
definitely.
Okay. Buy still caught at 900.

3182
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
Okay. Buy still caught at 900.
 

3183
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:55,830
Okay. Buy still caught at 900.
Tape still bullish.

3184
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:55,840

 

3185
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,270

No shelf to leave yet. I'm going to get

3186
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,280
No shelf to leave yet. I'm going to get
 

3187
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,870
No shelf to leave yet. I'm going to get
rid of this. This was a thick area from

3188
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:58,880
rid of this. This was a thick area from
 

3189
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,149
rid of this. This was a thick area from
last week. I'm going to get rid of that

3190
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:00,159
last week. I'm going to get rid of that
 

3191
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:05,830
last week. I'm going to get rid of that
for a moment. We've traded through it.

3192
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840

 

3193
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,229

We know 830s is the level. It's the same

3194
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:08,239
We know 830s is the level. It's the same
 

3195
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,669
We know 830s is the level. It's the same
level here. So, we can build liquidity

3196
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:09,679
level here. So, we can build liquidity
 

3197
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:18,550
level here. So, we can build liquidity
in here for a bit if it wants.

3198
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:18,560

 

3199
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,070

Bro, you wouldn't even go short from

3200
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,080
Bro, you wouldn't even go short from
 

3201
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,229
Bro, you wouldn't even go short from
here. I will go short from here once it

3202
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
here. I will go short from here once it
 

3203
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,550
here. I will go short from here once it
tells me it's ready.

3204
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:24,560
tells me it's ready.
 

3205
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,870
tells me it's ready.
What's your trigger? Just that it's up

3206
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:26,880
What's your trigger? Just that it's up
 

3207
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,510
What's your trigger? Just that it's up
high. That's not a trigger. If we start

3208
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,520
high. That's not a trigger. If we start
 

3209
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,350
high. That's not a trigger. If we start
leaving volume trapped, that's a

3210
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360
leaving volume trapped, that's a
 

3211
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,070
leaving volume trapped, that's a
trigger. Just because a stock's up high

3212
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
trigger. Just because a stock's up high
 

3213
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,910
trigger. Just because a stock's up high
and you go, "Ah, it's gone up too high."

3214
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:35,920
and you go, "Ah, it's gone up too high."
 

3215
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:41,270
and you go, "Ah, it's gone up too high."
That's not a trigger to go short, is it?

3216
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:41,280

 

3217
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,430

I'm watching these 900s and I know

3218
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
I'm watching these 900s and I know
 

3219
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,669
I'm watching these 900s and I know
previous day value area high based on NT

3220
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:45,679
previous day value area high based on NT
 

3221
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,510
previous day value area high based on NT
like we talked about we have like the

3222
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:47,520
like we talked about we have like the
 

3223
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,350
like we talked about we have like the
divergence on the tape. NT value area

3224
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:49,360
divergence on the tape. NT value area
 

3225
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,350
divergence on the tape. NT value area
high is up here. So I'm wondering if

3226
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:51,360
high is up here. So I'm wondering if
 

3227
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,630
high is up here. So I'm wondering if
we're going to go all the way up there

3228
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:52,640
we're going to go all the way up there
 

3229
01:12:52,640 --> 01:13:01,990
we're going to go all the way up there
right now. That's what I'm wondering.

3230
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,000

 

3231
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,270

Starting to build out volume here. So

3232
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:03,280
Starting to build out volume here. So
 

3233
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:30,630
Starting to build out volume here. So
I'm watching this now.

3234
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:30,640

 

3235
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,310

fix from almost previous day low. Just

3236
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:32,320
fix from almost previous day low. Just
 

3237
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,669
fix from almost previous day low. Just
got a little bit more to go

3238
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
got a little bit more to go
 

3239
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,830
got a little bit more to go
to the edge of this volume shelf. We if

3240
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
to the edge of this volume shelf. We if
 

3241
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,149
to the edge of this volume shelf. We if
we leave this, it' be interesting. We do

3242
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:40,159
we leave this, it' be interesting. We do
 

3243
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:41,750
we leave this, it' be interesting. We do
have excess at the high. Here's the

3244
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:41,760
have excess at the high. Here's the
 

3245
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,669
have excess at the high. Here's the
imbalance down to 85. If we start

3246
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:43,679
imbalance down to 85. If we start
 

3247
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,510
imbalance down to 85. If we start
leaving this, I'm interested.

3249
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,350

Not if we don't. If we keep finding just

01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:49,360
Not if we don't. If we keep finding just
 

3251
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,189
Not if we don't. If we keep finding just
duck under and holding imbalances and

3253
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,510

3374
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:55,920
Still absorbing here. There's a move
 

3375
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,070
Still absorbing here. There's a move
down into here. Possible 820. So that

3376
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
down into here. Possible 820. So that
 

3377
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,709
down into here. Possible 820. So that
there is a full move if we reject this.

3378
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:00,719
there is a full move if we reject this.
 

3379
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,870
there is a full move if we reject this.
There is this move is available. Uh the

3380
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:02,880
There is this move is available. Uh the
 

3381
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,189
There is this move is available. Uh the
other option is that go it goes 920 then

3382
01:17:05,189 --> 01:17:05,199
other option is that go it goes 920 then
 

3383
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,270
other option is that go it goes 920 then
does this move. Those are both available

3384
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:07,280
does this move. Those are both available
 

3385
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,950
does this move. Those are both available
right now. Seeing if I can get involved

3386
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:08,960
right now. Seeing if I can get involved
 

3387
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,390
right now. Seeing if I can get involved
in this somehow. Here we go.

3388
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
in this somehow. Here we go.
 

3389
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,990
in this somehow. Here we go.
So this is current value area high on

3390
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:14,000
So this is current value area high on
 

3391
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,270
So this is current value area high on
the day. Here comes all the way back

We've got a shelf here developed into

3402
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
We've got a shelf here developed into
 

3403
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,229
We've got a shelf here developed into
60s under here. Here it gets fun. Really

3404
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:28,239
60s under here. Here it gets fun. Really

30s if we get lucky. But I'm covering

3416
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
30s if we get lucky. But I'm covering
 

3417
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,590
30s if we get lucky. But I'm covering
some in 60s because we can very well

3418
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
some in 60s because we can very well
 

3419
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,750
some in 60s because we can very well
hold up here.

3420
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:45,760
hold up here.
 

3421
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,430

isn't it? Every time I need a coffee or

3424
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:50,239
isn't it? Every time I need a coffee or
 

3425
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,870
isn't it? Every time I need a coffee or
a pee, the market moves.

3426
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:52,880
a pee, the market moves.
 

3427
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:58,709
a pee, the market moves.
It's true. It's absolutely true.

3428
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719

 

3429
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:00,229

I just got a little piece left. I had to

3430
01:18:00,229 --> 01:18:00,239
I just got a little piece left. I had to
 

3431
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,709
I just got a little piece left. I had to
chase a bit there, but uh covered most

3432
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:02,719
chase a bit there, but uh covered most
 

3433
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,950
chase a bit there, but uh covered most
out here into these 60s in front of

3434
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:04,960
out here into these 60s in front of
 

3435
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,870
out here into these 60s in front of
these 60s. Let's see if we can get under

3436
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:06,880
these 60s. Let's see if we can get under
 

3437
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,550
these 60s. Let's see if we can get under
this now and get into this next shelf

3438
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:08,560
this now and get into this next shelf
 

3439
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,510
this now and get into this next shelf
down here. All right. And then we would

3440
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:11,520
down here. All right. And then we would
 

3441
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,750
down here. All right. And then we would
expect buyers might want to step back up

3442
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:13,760
expect buyers might want to step back up
 

3443
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,229
expect buyers might want to step back up
and go for the 20s.

3444
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
and go for the 20s.
 

3445
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,189
and go for the 20s.
Been quite the squeeze this morning.

3446
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:19,199
Been quite the squeeze this morning.
 

3447
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,590
Been quite the squeeze this morning.
It has been quite the squeeze this

3448
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:21,600
It has been quite the squeeze this
 

3449
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,030
It has been quite the squeeze this
morning.

3450
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:25,040

 

3451
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,709

That's what I'm saying. Who was I forget

3452
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:26,719
That's what I'm saying. Who was I forget
 

3453
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,550
That's what I'm saying. Who was I forget
who was looking short on you got to let

3454
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
who was looking short on you got to let
 

3455
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,990
who was looking short on you got to let
it build out volume. See how we build

3456
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,000
it build out volume. See how we build
 

3457
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,590
it build out volume. See how we build
out volume and then we leave it. Right

3458
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
out volume and then we leave it. Right
 

3459
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,270
out volume and then we leave it. Right
now it needs to reject this volume. If

3460
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,280
now it needs to reject this volume. If
 

3461
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,470
now it needs to reject this volume. If
it doesn't reject this volume, you're

3462
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:34,480
it doesn't reject this volume, you're
 

3463
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,350
it doesn't reject this volume, you're
going to have an inverse head and

3464
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:35,360
going to have an inverse head and
 

3465
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,630
going to have an inverse head and
shoulder. Right? If it doesn't reject

3466
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
shoulder. Right? If it doesn't reject
 

3467
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,390
shoulder. Right? If it doesn't reject
this, right? Then you're going to do

3468
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,400
this, right? Then you're going to do
 

3469
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,790
this, right? Then you're going to do
this and 920s is possible. Right? You

3470
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:40,800
this and 920s is possible. Right? You
 

3471
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,270
this and 920s is possible. Right? You
have to understand you cannot be short

3472
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:43,280
have to understand you cannot be short
 

3473
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,229
have to understand you cannot be short
on squeezes up just hoping. You have to

3474
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:46,239
on squeezes up just hoping. You have to
 

3475
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,709
on squeezes up just hoping. You have to
see it leave an area. All right? And

3476
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:48,719
see it leave an area. All right? And
 

3477
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,630
see it leave an area. All right? And
then you're counter trend and you better

3478
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,640
then you're counter trend and you better
 

3479
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,669
then you're counter trend and you better
be covering into each node. All right?

3480
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:53,679
be covering into each node. All right?
 

3481
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:55,350
be covering into each node. All right?
And protecting yourself because you

3482
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:55,360
And protecting yourself because you
 

3483
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,270
And protecting yourself because you
don't know if we're a protrend. If this

3484
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
don't know if we're a protrend. If this
 

3485
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,430
don't know if we're a protrend. If this
is the pivot, right, this is the pivot,

3486
01:18:59,430 --> 01:18:59,440
is the pivot, right, this is the pivot,
 

3487
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,270
is the pivot, right, this is the pivot,
right? It might very well catch bids

3488
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
right? It might very well catch bids
 

3489
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,709
right? It might very well catch bids
around here and go back higher. You

3490
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:02,719
around here and go back higher. You
 

3491
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,310
around here and go back higher. You
can't be expecting the whole thing to

3492
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
can't be expecting the whole thing to
 

3493
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,790
can't be expecting the whole thing to
roll over. It might happen, but you

3494
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:06,800
roll over. It might happen, but you
 

3495
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:12,709
roll over. It might happen, but you
cannot have that that as an expectation.

3496
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:12,719

 

3497
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:19,669

Here we go. Come on. Come on.

3498
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
Here we go. Come on. Come on.
 

3499
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,750
Here we go. Come on. Come on.
Little bit lower. Can we get into here?

3500
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
Little bit lower. Can we get into here?
 

3501
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,630

30s would be very, very, very nice. Can

3502
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:24,640

3503
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,510
30s would be very, very, very nice. Can
we go to 30s? The moment we keep

3504
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:27,520
we go to 30s? The moment we keep
 

3505
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,910
we go to 30s? The moment we keep
protecting that level.

3506
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
protecting that level.
 

3507
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,550
protecting that level.
We get down into 30s. Here we go, folks.

3508
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
We get down into 30s. Here we go, folks.
 

3509

3511
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,189

Want to see us just drop under this and

3512
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:39,199
Want to see us just drop under this and
 

3513
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,950
Want to see us just drop under this and
snap down into here. And then I'll be

3514
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:40,960
snap down into here. And then I'll be
 

3515
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,110
snap down into here. And then I'll be
taking most my position out here.

3516
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
taking most my position out here.
 

3517
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,790
taking most my position out here.
Big level here in previous week. Here we

3518
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:46,800
Big level here in previous week. Here we
 

3519
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,750
Big level here in previous week. Here we
go, folks. 50s. We've got imbalances

3520
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
go, folks. 50s. We've got imbalances
 

3521
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,910
go, folks. 50s. We've got imbalances
here into 50s and then another one down

3522
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:51,920
here into 50s and then another one down
 

3523
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,990
here into 50s and then another one down
at 37. All right. So, imbalances here.

3524
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:54,000
at 37. All right. So, imbalances here.
 

3525

We're going to get most out into this.

3526
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
We're going to get most out into this.
 

3527
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,550
We're going to get most out into this.
We want to be very, very careful.

3528
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
We want to be very, very careful.
 

3529
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,390
We want to be very, very careful.
Remember, we're counter trend in this

3530
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,400
Remember, we're counter trend in this
 

3531
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,550
Remember, we're counter trend in this
short. We want to be careful here.

3532
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,560
short. We want to be careful here.
 

3533
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,310
short. We want to be careful here.
Covering some into this 50 because I can

3534
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:02,320
Covering some into this 50 because I can
 

3535
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,790
Covering some into this 50 because I can
see a player trying to step up here. And

3536
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
see a player trying to step up here. And
 

3537
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,990
see a player trying to step up here. And
then through this, we should get a

3538
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,000
then through this, we should get a
 

3539
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:15,350
then through this, we should get a
flush. Just covered some into that.

3540
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:15,360

 

3541
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,030

Be patient for it. It cannot be front

3542
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
Be patient for it. It cannot be front
 

3543
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,110
Be patient for it. It cannot be front
side. Here we go. Right. Let's see if we

3544
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,120
side. Here we go. Right. Let's see if we
 

3545
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,510
side. Here we go. Right. Let's see if we
can get gray box. I'll be 90% out into

3546
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
can get gray box. I'll be 90% out into
 

3547
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,070
can get gray box. I'll be 90% out into
gray box. Here we go. 50. So, imbalance

3548
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:24,080
gray box. Here we go. 50. So, imbalance
 

3549
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,870
gray box. Here we go. 50. So, imbalance
filled here. Next imbalance is down to

3550
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:26,880
filled here. Next imbalance is down to
 

3551
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,510
filled here. Next imbalance is down to
38.

3552
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:29,520
38.
 

3553
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,950
38.
Hopefully some of you guys are in this

3554
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:30,960
Hopefully some of you guys are in this
 

3555
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,189
Hopefully some of you guys are in this
short with me. Do not be overly

3556
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:33,199
short with me. Do not be overly

overly aggressive. Just manage your
position. and we're counter trend short

3562
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:38,560
position. and we're counter trend short
 

3563
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,950
position. and we're counter trend short
after a big squeeze out which has done a

3564
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:40,960
after a big squeeze out which has done a
 

3565
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,470
after a big squeeze out which has done a
full rotation. So, we're just playing

3566
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
full rotation. So, we're just playing
 

3567
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,709
full rotation. So, we're just playing
the short back down after that rotation

3568
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:44,719
the short back down after that rotation
 

3569
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,550
the short back down after that rotation
and we will go from there. See what sets

3570
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:46,560
and we will go from there. See what sets
 

3571
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,390
and we will go from there. See what sets
up afterwards.

3572
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400

 

3573
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,470

Uh over a thousand of you have not smash

3574
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
Uh over a thousand of you have not smash
 

3575

Uh over a thousand of you have not smash
that like button for me. Please do me a

3576
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,000
that like button for me. Please do me a
 

3577
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,630
that like button for me. Please do me a
favor, hit that like button and I don't

3578
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:56,640
favor, hit that like button and I don't
 

3579
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,110
favor, hit that like button and I don't
have to say it anymore. Makes my life

3580
01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,120
have to say it anymore. Makes my life
 

3581
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,350
have to say it anymore. Makes my life
easier.

3582
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:01,360
easier.
 

3583
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,110
easier.
And we will want this protected. If they

3584
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,120
And we will want this protected. If they
 

3585
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,750
And we will want this protected. If they
do not protect this, then we will expect

3586
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:05,760
do not protect this, then we will expect
 

3587
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,750
do not protect this, then we will expect
new highs, right? If this is if we're

3588
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
new highs, right? If this is if we're
 

3589
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,430
new highs, right? If this is if we're
going to measure out, we just talked

3590
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:09,440
going to measure out, we just talked
 

3591
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,630
going to measure out, we just talked
about this. If we're going to measure

3592
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:10,640
about this. If we're going to measure
 

3593
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,110
about this. If we're going to measure
out this leg, right, we want to try and

3594
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:13,120
out this leg, right, we want to try and
 

3595
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,110
out this leg, right, we want to try and
get down into here. It might be that

3596
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:15,120
get down into here. It might be that
 

3597
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,110
get down into here. It might be that
they don't do it. So, if we've built

3598
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,120
they don't do it. So, if we've built
 

3599
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,110
they don't do it. So, if we've built
liquidity and they do this, then we can

3600
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,120
liquidity and they do this, then we can
 

3601
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,950
liquidity and they do this, then we can
expect 820. And if they want to be

3602
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:20,960
expect 820. And if they want to be
 

3603
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,390
expect 820. And if they want to be
really nasty, they're going to come all

3604
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:22,400
really nasty, they're going to come all
 

3605
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,310
really nasty, they're going to come all
the way up there, which will be previous

3606
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:24,320
the way up there, which will be previous
 

3607
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,110
the way up there, which will be previous
week value area high. I cannot tell you

3608
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:27,120
week value area high. I cannot tell you
 

3609
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,590
week value area high. I cannot tell you
how insane a move that is when you

3610
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:29,600
how insane a move that is when you
 

3611
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,950
how insane a move that is when you
understand how we've got there. All

3612
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
understand how we've got there. All
 

3613
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,550
understand how we've got there. All
right? If you understand how we've got

3614
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:32,560
right? If you understand how we've got
 

3615
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,149
right? If you understand how we've got
there,

3616
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:34,159
there,
 

3617
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:38,229
there,
here's previous week value area low.

3618
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:38,239
here's previous week value area low.
 

3619
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:41,910
here's previous week value area low.
Right here, there's the gap fill. No

01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:41,920
Right here, there's the gap fill. No
 

3621
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,390
Right here, there's the gap fill. No
acceptance reclaim. Remember, reclaim a

acceptance reclaim. Remember, reclaim a
 

3623
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,430
acceptance reclaim. Remember, reclaim a
weekly level.

3624
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:47,440
weekly level.
 

3625
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,990
weekly level.
That will be insane. This is a whole

3626
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:50,000
That will be insane. This is a whole
 

3627
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,070
That will be insane. This is a whole
week we might well do in a New York

3628
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,080
week we might well do in a New York
 

3629
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,229
week we might well do in a New York
session. And if you don't think this is

3630
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
session. And if you don't think this is
 

3631
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:58,070

insane, that is this is this is normal.

insane, that is this is this is normal.
This is insane. That is a straight up

This is insane. That is a straight up
 

3635
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,110
This is insane. That is a straight up
squeeze, guys.

3636

01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,470
really good trade on Friday towards the
end of stream and then I think it went

3682
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:34,480
end of stream and then I think it went
 

3683
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,910
end of stream and then I think it went
might have gone without me. I can't

3684
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:35,920
might have gone without me. I can't
 

3685
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,149
might have gone without me. I can't
really remember but uh in the private

3686
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
really remember but uh in the private
 

3687
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,629
really remember but uh in the private
lesson in Discord uh everything we

3688
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:40,639
lesson in Discord uh everything we
 

3689
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,550
lesson in Discord uh everything we
talked about set up which was great. All

3690
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:42,560
talked about set up which was great. All
 

3691
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,149
talked about set up which was great. All
right. Flowzone still holding previous

3692
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:44,159
right. Flowzone still holding previous
 

3693
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,470
right. Flowzone still holding previous
week point of control still holding here

3694
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:46,480
week point of control still holding here
 

3695
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,709
week point of control still holding here
as a bid. If they want to complete a bid

3696
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:48,719
as a bid. If they want to complete a bid
 

3697
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,390
as a bid. If they want to complete a bid
from here, all right, then they would

3698
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:50,400
from here, all right, then they would
 

3699
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,189
from here, all right, then they would
look for this move up here to 600 26,73.

3700
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
look for this move up here to 600 26,73.
 

3701
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,910
look for this move up here to 600 26,73.
It's insane, but it's you cannot rule it

3702
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
It's insane, but it's you cannot rule it
 

3703
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,830
It's insane, but it's you cannot rule it
out. All I'm saying is you cannot rule

3704
01:23:59,830 --> 01:23:59,840
out. All I'm saying is you cannot rule
 

3705
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,390
out. All I'm saying is you cannot rule
that move out. ES holding its 5day and

3706
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:02,400
that move out. ES holding its 5day and
 

3707
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,990
that move out. ES holding its 5day and
its previous day high, finding a bid

3708
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,000
its previous day high, finding a bid
 

3709
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,709
its previous day high, finding a bid
there. VIX still yet to close its gap.

3710
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:08,719
there. VIX still yet to close its gap.
 

3711
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:10,149
there. VIX still yet to close its gap.
I caught 30 points and then it went

3712
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159
I caught 30 points and then it went
 

3713
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:13,189
I caught 30 points and then it went
without me. There you go. So MG

3714
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:13,199
without me. There you go. So MG
 

3715
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,350
without me. There you go. So MG
saying what happened. I seem to remember

3716
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,360
saying what happened. I seem to remember
 

3717
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,950
saying what happened. I seem to remember
having like two or three goes at it and

3718
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:16,960
having like two or three goes at it and
 

3719
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,149
having like two or three goes at it and
then end up doing it. You got funded

3720
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:20,159
then end up doing it. You got funded
 

3721
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:24,950
then end up doing it. You got funded
because of Friday. Awesome. Fantastic.

3722
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:24,960

 

3723
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,709

IB to VWAP would be quite a move. Yeah,

3724
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:26,719
IB to VWAP would be quite a move. Yeah,
 

3725
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:29,990
IB to VWAP would be quite a move. Yeah,
it would. It would.

3726
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:30,000
it would. It would.
 

3727
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,149
it would. It would.
Right. Still watching this gray level

3728
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:32,159
Right. Still watching this gray level
 

3729
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:33,830
Right. Still watching this gray level
here and we have a new shelf here. So,

3730
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:33,840
here and we have a new shelf here. So,
 

3731
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,350
here and we have a new shelf here. So,
this is a rotation between the two. If

3732
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:35,360
this is a rotation between the two. If
 

3733
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,550
this is a rotation between the two. If
we if if it's a big if we keep rejecting

3734
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:38,560
we if if it's a big if we keep rejecting
 

3735
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,470
we if if it's a big if we keep rejecting
this and we come under this, this move

3736
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:40,480
this and we come under this, this move
 

3737
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,030
this and we come under this, this move
here is possible. Big if. If they

3738
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:43,040
here is possible. Big if. If they
 

3739
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,470
here is possible. Big if. If they
reclaim this, you do not want to be

3740
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
reclaim this, you do not want to be
 

3741
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,070
reclaim this, you do not want to be
short. If they start reclaiming this,

3742
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:46,080
short. If they start reclaiming this,
 

3743
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,590
short. If they start reclaiming this,
you do not want to be short. You are

3744
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:47,600
you do not want to be short. You are
 

3745
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,149
you do not want to be short. You are
better to let it pop and fade back under

3746
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:50,159
better to let it pop and fade back under
 

3747
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,510
better to let it pop and fade back under
and then think about the short. Do not

3748
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:51,520
and then think about the short. Do not
 

3749
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,350
and then think about the short. Do not
guess the high of day, folks. It's a

3750
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,360
guess the high of day, folks. It's a
 

3751
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:58,790
guess the high of day, folks. It's a
sure way to get absolutely wrecked.

3752
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800

 

3753
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,189

Hopefully that makes sense.

3754
01:25:01,189 --> 01:25:01,199
Hopefully that makes sense.
 

3755
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,110
Hopefully that makes sense.
Called it well. Yeah, it was all right.

3756
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:03,120
Called it well. Yeah, it was all right.
 

3757
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,470
Called it well. Yeah, it was all right.
I wasn't too bothered about Friday

3758
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:04,480
I wasn't too bothered about Friday
 

3759
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,070
I wasn't too bothered about Friday
because I remember I think the day

3760
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,080
because I remember I think the day
 

3761
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,030
because I remember I think the day
before we had a net of 600 points or

3762
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,040
before we had a net of 600 points or
 

3763
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,669
before we had a net of 600 points or
something. It was a last week was a very

3764
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:11,679
something. It was a last week was a very
 

3765
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:14,470
something. It was a last week was a very
big uh week for me. Very very big week

3766
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
big uh week for me. Very very big week
 

3767
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,629
big uh week for me. Very very big week
for me. So not I wasn't too fussed about

3768
01:25:16,629 --> 01:25:16,639
for me. So not I wasn't too fussed about
 

3769
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,470
for me. So not I wasn't too fussed about
Friday.

3770
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:20,480

 

3771
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,910

I'm going to buy the course someday with

3772
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:21,920
I'm going to buy the course someday with
 

3773
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,350
I'm going to buy the course someday with
the profit with your methods. There you

3774
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:23,360
the profit with your methods. There you
 

3775
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,950
the profit with your methods. There you
go. I mean there's no pressure to do

3776
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:24,960
go. I mean there's no pressure to do
 

3777
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,470
go. I mean there's no pressure to do
that but if if you think it will help

3778
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:26,480
that but if if you think it will help
 

3779
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,110
that but if if you think it will help
you definitely do it.

3780
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:29,120
you definitely do it.
 

3781
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,110
you definitely do it.
Okay. Point of control shifted up here

3782
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:31,120
Okay. Point of control shifted up here
 

3783
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,590
Okay. Point of control shifted up here
now.

3784
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:33,600
now.
 

3785
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,350
now.
So previous day point of control current

3786
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:35,360
So previous day point of control current
 

3787
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,030
So previous day point of control current
day point of control both at the same

3788
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:37,040
day point of control both at the same
 

3789
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,070
day point of control both at the same
area. This is fair value 880.

3790
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
area. This is fair value 880.
 

3791
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,910
area. This is fair value 880.
If we leave point of control, then we

3792
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:41,920
If we leave point of control, then we
 

3793
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,990
If we leave point of control, then we
can look for this move down here. We are

3794
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,000
can look for this move down here. We are
 

3795
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,750
can look for this move down here. We are
developing out some kind of volume shelf

3796
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:45,760
developing out some kind of volume shelf
 

3797
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,669
developing out some kind of volume shelf
here, though it's messy how they're

3798
01:25:47,669 --> 01:25:47,679
here, though it's messy how they're
 

3799
01:25:47,679 --> 01:26:02,790
here, though it's messy how they're
developing this. So, I'll say that much.

3800
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:02,800

 

3801
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,189

Let me email him.

3802
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199

 

3803
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:08,870

get some new codes for you guys so we

3804
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:08,880
get some new codes for you guys so we
 

3805
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,030
get some new codes for you guys so we
can do some giveaways. Sure. I've got

3806
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:11,040
can do some giveaways. Sure. I've got
 

3807
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,629
can do some giveaways. Sure. I've got
some

3808
01:26:12,629 --> 01:26:12,639
some
 

3809
01:26:12,639 --> 01:27:04,790
some
set up.

3810
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800

 

3811
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:14,550

Okay, still watching that gray box.

3812
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:14,560

 

3813
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,870

Uh, I chased the short. I had to chase.

3814
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:16,880
Uh, I chased the short. I had to chase.
 

3815
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,149
Uh, I chased the short. I had to chase.
Someone asked was I short. I had to

3816
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:18,159
Someone asked was I short. I had to
 

3817
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:21,350
Someone asked was I short. I had to
chase down here for that flush. I had to

3818
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:21,360
chase down here for that flush. I had to
 

3819
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,790
chase down here for that flush. I had to
chase it. All right, watching this gray

3820
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:22,800
chase it. All right, watching this gray
 

3821
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,910
chase it. All right, watching this gray
box. Now, this is key. If they get

3822
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:25,920
box. Now, this is key. If they get
 

3823
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,910
box. Now, this is key. If they get
through this gray box, I expect 820s and

3824
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:27,920
through this gray box, I expect 820s and
 

3825
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,430
through this gray box, I expect 820s and
new highs. If we reject this gray box,

3826
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:29,440
new highs. If we reject this gray box,
 

3827
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,350
new highs. If we reject this gray box,
it would be failure to follow through as

3828
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:31,360
it would be failure to follow through as
 

3829
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,709
it would be failure to follow through as
downside price action. Buyers are

3830
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:32,719
downside price action. Buyers are
 

3831
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,270
downside price action. Buyers are
currently stuck above 900.

3832
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280
currently stuck above 900.
 

3833
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,030
currently stuck above 900.
Um so above that you will get a

3834
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040
Um so above that you will get a
 

3835
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,189
Um so above that you will get a
resqueeze out. We have previous day

3836
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:39,199
resqueeze out. We have previous day
 

3837
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:42,310
resqueeze out. We have previous day
value area high around 920 and previous

3838
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,320
value area high around 920 and previous
 

3839
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,550
value area high around 920 and previous
week all the way up at 26,074

3840
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
week all the way up at 26,074
 

3841
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,590
week all the way up at 26,074
and previous day high 26,020.

3842
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
and previous day high 26,020.
 

3843
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,990
and previous day high 26,020.
So the next opportunities are basically

3844
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:52,000
So the next opportunities are basically
 

3845
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,189
So the next opportunities are basically
this is what I've been thinking about.

3846
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
this is what I've been thinking about.
 

3847
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,350
this is what I've been thinking about.
Either we reject this and we roll. We

3848
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,360
Either we reject this and we roll. We
 

3849
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,910
Either we reject this and we roll. We
take it, we go 920, we reject and we

3850
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
take it, we go 920, we reject and we
 

3851
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,470
take it, we go 920, we reject and we
roll. We take it, we base and we start

3852
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:00,480
roll. We take it, we base and we start
 

3853
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,030
roll. We take it, we base and we start
to come up into here. Right? These are

3854
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:03,040

3855
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,910
to come up into here. Right? These are
all available. And then that we are very

3856
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:05,920
all available. And then that we are very
 

3857
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,310
all available. And then that we are very
very very very very bullish on the day.

3858
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:08,320
very very very very bullish on the day.
 

3859
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,910
very very very very bullish on the day.
The order flow has been very very

3860
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:09,920
The order flow has been very very

coming into pre like the most premium
 

3873
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,590
coming into pre like the most premium
area of Friday. So it is not an ideal

3874
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:25,600
area of Friday. So it is not an ideal
 

3875
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:31,110
area of Friday. So it is not an ideal
area to be buying off right now. Okay.

3876
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:31,120

 

3877
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,189

Do I have any codes to reset pro

3878
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:33,199
Do I have any codes to reset pro
 

3879
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,950
Do I have any codes to reset pro
accounts for take profit trader? I wish,

3880
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:34,960
accounts for take profit trader? I wish,
 

3881
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,350
accounts for take profit trader? I wish,
buddy. I'm sorry. No, they no codes or

3882
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:37,360
buddy. I'm sorry. No, they no codes or
 

3883
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,470
buddy. I'm sorry. No, they no codes or
anything like that for take profit

3884
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:38,480
anything like that for take profit
 

3885
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,870
anything like that for take profit
trader. I am working on uh getting

3886
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:40,880
trader. I am working on uh getting
 

3887
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,950
trader. I am working on uh getting
stuff, but no, I don't think they would

3888
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:42,960
stuff, but no, I don't think they would
 

3889
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,430
stuff, but no, I don't think they would
do resets for pros. Resets are very

3890
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:45,440
do resets for pros. Resets are very
 

3891
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,790
do resets for pros. Resets are very
expensive for pro accounts. I think it

3892
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800
expensive for pro accounts. I think it
 

3893
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,990
expensive for pro accounts. I think it
would cost you about 600 bucks.

3894
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,000
would cost you about 600 bucks.
 

3895
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,070
would cost you about 600 bucks.
Honestly, you're better off, in my

not resetting, paying 100 or whatever it

3900
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:54,560
not resetting, paying 100 or whatever it
 

3901
01:28:54,560 --> 01:29:00,790
not resetting, paying 100 or whatever it
is, and just passing a new uh email.

3902
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:00,800

 

3903
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,990

What was the bias at New York open? Why

3904
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:04,000
What was the bias at New York open? Why
 

3905
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,590
What was the bias at New York open? Why
rally towards previous week, previous

3906
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:05,600
rally towards previous week, previous
 

3907
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,950
rally towards previous week, previous
day value? Because of the bullish

3908
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
day value? Because of the bullish
 

3909
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,189
day value? Because of the bullish
structure from London section and would

3910
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:09,199
structure from London section and would
 

3911
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,189
structure from London section and would
you have been ready for a long the bias

3912
01:29:11,189 --> 01:29:11,199
you have been ready for a long the bias
 

3913
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:14,790
you have been ready for a long the bias
was uh to at least back test, right? So

3914
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:14,800
was uh to at least back test, right? So
 

3915
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,709
was uh to at least back test, right? So
I I was telling you guys that it's

3916
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:16,719
I I was telling you guys that it's
 

3917
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,470
I I was telling you guys that it's
probably a long um up for the back test

3918
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
probably a long um up for the back test
 

3919
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,510
probably a long um up for the back test
of sort of 600 over 600. We talked about

3920
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:23,520
of sort of 600 over 600. We talked about
 

3921
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,590
of sort of 600 over 600. We talked about
a back test of seven over seven 850

3922
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:27,600
a back test of seven over seven 850
 

3923
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,910
a back test of seven over seven 850
and over 859

3924
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:29,920
and over 859
 

3925
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,590
and over 859
26,100.

3926
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:31,600
26,100.
 

3927
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,030
26,100.
Why? Just structure, right? So this is

3928
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
Why? Just structure, right? So this is
 

3929
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,390
Why? Just structure, right? So this is
what we talked about this morning.

3930
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:38,400
what we talked about this morning.
 

3931
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,390
what we talked about this morning.
We think about this, right? Think about

3932
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:40,400
We think about this, right? Think about
 

3933
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,430
We think about this, right? Think about
previous week

3934
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:43,440
previous week
 

3935
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,390
previous week
and previous days in here. So gap down,

3936
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:46,400
and previous days in here. So gap down,
 

3937
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,550
and previous days in here. So gap down,
no acceptance. We expect a back test of

3938
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,560
no acceptance. We expect a back test of
 

3939
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,550
no acceptance. We expect a back test of
this. If we sell this, we said we'd sell

3940
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:50,560
this. If we sell this, we said we'd sell
 

3941
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,070
this. If we sell this, we said we'd sell
that back down to here. If they don't

3942
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:52,080
that back down to here. If they don't
 

3943
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,470
that back down to here. If they don't
stop here, they're going to come in for

3944
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:54,480
stop here, they're going to come in for
 

3945
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,629
stop here, they're going to come in for
700 test. All right, this node here,

3946
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
700 test. All right, this node here,
 

3947
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,470
700 test. All right, this node here,
this level here. If they don't stop

3948
01:29:58,470 --> 01:29:58,480
this level here. If they don't stop
 

3949
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,229
this level here. If they don't stop
there, they're going to come up for this

3950
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:00,239
there, they're going to come up for this
 

3951
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:01,669
there, they're going to come up for this
level here that we're now at. All right,

3952
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:01,679
level here that we're now at. All right,
 

3953
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:02,950
level here that we're now at. All right,
if they don't sell this, then they're

3954
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:02,960
if they don't sell this, then they're
 

3955
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,709
if they don't sell this, then they're
going to come up for the next level

3956
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:04,719
going to come up for the next level
 

3957
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:06,470
going to come up for the next level
above, right? So, we don't This is what

3958
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,480
above, right? So, we don't This is what
 

3959
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,830
above, right? So, we don't This is what
I always tell you guys why the counter

3960
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:07,840
I always tell you guys why the counter
 

3961
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,470
I always tell you guys why the counter
trend's hard. We don't know where it's

3962
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
trend's hard. We don't know where it's
 

3963
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,310
trend's hard. We don't know where it's
going to stop. So, we have to wait for

3964
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,320
going to stop. So, we have to wait for
 

3965
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,790
going to stop. So, we have to wait for
volume to be built out. If they don't

3966
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,800
volume to be built out. If they don't
 

3967
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,390
volume to be built out. If they don't
build volume out, think about why is

3968
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:16,400
build volume out, think about why is
 

3969
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,669
build volume out, think about why is
this squeezing? I tell you why it's

3970
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:17,679
this squeezing? I tell you why it's
 

3971
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,910
this squeezing? I tell you why it's
squeezing. because shorts tried here and

3972
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:19,920
squeezing. because shorts tried here and
 

3973
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,350
squeezing. because shorts tried here and
tried here and tried here and they're

01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:23,679
adding and they are fueling this fire
 

3977
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,430
adding and they are fueling this fire
up. Yeah, there's a bid also, don't get

3978
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:25,440
up. Yeah, there's a bid also, don't get
 

3979
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,590
up. Yeah, there's a bid also, don't get
me wrong, but I don't really want to bid

3980
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:27,600
me wrong, but I don't really want to bid
 

3981
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,669
me wrong, but I don't really want to bid
here for this. This is so risky to bid

3982
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:29,679
here for this. This is so risky to bid
 

3983
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:34,310
here for this. This is so risky to bid
here for this.

3984

3985
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,990

All right, failure to break out here

3986
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:36,000
All right, failure to break out here
 

3987
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,390
All right, failure to break out here
gray box. So, we would imagine now the

3988
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:38,400
gray box. So, we would imagine now the
 

3989
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,149
gray box. So, we would imagine now the
rotation will happen between here. Here

3990
01:30:40,149 --> 01:30:40,159
rotation will happen between here. Here
 

3991
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,390
rotation will happen between here. Here
are the important areas now for this

3992
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:42,400
are the important areas now for this
 

3993
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,510
are the important areas now for this
current current part. That was a failure

3994
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,520
current current part. That was a failure
 

3995
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,990
current current part. That was a failure
to take a high. ES did take the high.

3996
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,000
to take a high. ES did take the high.
 

3997
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,590
to take a high. ES did take the high.
So, we had slight divergence here. We go

3998
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:49,600
So, we had slight divergence here. We go
 

3999
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,270
So, we had slight divergence here. We go
gray box to gray box until they're done

4000
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:51,280
gray box to gray box until they're done
 

4001
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:55,910
gray box to gray box until they're done
with it and we can see what's what.

4002
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:55,920
with it and we can see what's what.
 

4003
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,070
with it and we can see what's what.
Yeah, 900s and above. They keep getting

4004
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:58,080
Yeah, 900s and above. They keep getting
 

4005
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,669
Yeah, 900s and above. They keep getting
stuck. The buyers, you can see it on the

4006
01:30:59,669 --> 01:30:59,679
stuck. The buyers, you can see it on the
 

4007
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,030
stuck. The buyers, you can see it on the
tape. That's where they keep getting

4008
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:01,040
tape. That's where they keep getting
 

4009
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,669
tape. That's where they keep getting
stuck. You can see we can see maybe

4010
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:03,679
stuck. You can see we can see maybe
 

4011
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:09,510
stuck. You can see we can see maybe
here,

4012
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:09,520

 

4013
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,470

right? 900s and above. It's all buy

4014
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:12,480
right? 900s and above. It's all buy
 

4015
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,709
right? 900s and above. It's all buy
side. If we look at all this, it's all

4016
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:14,719
side. If we look at all this, it's all
 

4017
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,790
side. If we look at all this, it's all
buy side. It's all buyers. keep getting

4018
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
buy side. It's all buyers. keep getting
 

4019
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,550
buy side. It's all buyers. keep getting
caught up there. So, at the moment,

4020
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:18,560
caught up there. So, at the moment,
 

4021
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,390
caught up there. So, at the moment,
we're not seeing a passive buyer step in

4022
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:20,400
we're not seeing a passive buyer step in
 

4023
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,910
we're not seeing a passive buyer step in
and support a bid above that. We're just

4024
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:21,920
and support a bid above that. We're just
 

4025
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,189
and support a bid above that. We're just
seeing aggressive buyers get caught.

4026
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:23,199
seeing aggressive buyers get caught.
 

4027
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,189
seeing aggressive buyers get caught.
Gray box to gray box is the current

4028
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:25,199
Gray box to gray box is the current
 

4029
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:36,470
Gray box to gray box is the current
rotation.

4030
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:36,480

 

4031
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,669

Yes, rejecting IB high as well.

4032
01:31:39,669 --> 01:31:39,679
Yes, rejecting IB high as well.
 

4033
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,070
Yes, rejecting IB high as well.
Okay, that down to this other gray box,

4034
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:42,080
Okay, that down to this other gray box,
 

4035
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,629
Okay, that down to this other gray box,
point of control. If we leave this, it

4036
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:44,639
point of control. If we leave this, it
 

4037
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,149
point of control. If we leave this, it
would get nasty. If they keep bidding

4038
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:46,159
would get nasty. If they keep bidding
 

4039
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,510
would get nasty. If they keep bidding
this, they've still got a chance to move

4040
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:47,520
this, they've still got a chance to move
 

4041
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,110
this, they've still got a chance to move
higher. We've got now got lots of stops

4042
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:49,120
higher. We've got now got lots of stops
 

4043
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,910
higher. We've got now got lots of stops
based up here. I have an anchored VWAP

4044
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:51,920
based up here. I have an anchored VWAP
 

4045
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,229
based up here. I have an anchored VWAP
or anchor volume profile to 930. I have

4046
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:54,239
or anchor volume profile to 930. I have
 

4047
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:55,590
or anchor volume profile to 930. I have
two ticks per row, but it doesn't look

4048
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:55,600
two ticks per row, but it doesn't look
 

4049
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,030
two ticks per row, but it doesn't look
like yours. Have I got it wrong? No,

4050
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:57,040
like yours. Have I got it wrong? No,
 

4051
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,189
like yours. Have I got it wrong? No,
that's right. What if you It should look

4052
01:31:59,189 --> 01:31:59,199
that's right. What if you It should look
 

4053
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:00,709
that's right. What if you It should look
like this. You might need to reset it.

4054
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:00,719
like this. You might need to reset it.
 

4055
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,270
like this. You might need to reset it.
That's exactly what to do. Should look

4056
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:03,280
That's exactly what to do. Should look
 

4057
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,709
That's exactly what to do. Should look
the same. Maybe you got to change the

4058
01:32:04,709 --> 01:32:04,719
the same. Maybe you got to change the
 

4059
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,550
the same. Maybe you got to change the
width to 20%. Maybe that will help you.

4060
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:08,560
width to 20%. Maybe that will help you.
 

4061
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:13,189
width to 20%. Maybe that will help you.
Okay. Seeing some sellers step in here.

4062
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
Okay. Seeing some sellers step in here.
 

4063
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,270
Okay. Seeing some sellers step in here.

Nothing's really changed here. Gray box

4066
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,120
Nothing's really changed here. Gray box
 

4067
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,270
Nothing's really changed here. Gray box
to gray box. If we start leaving one, we

4068
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:19,280
to gray box. If we start leaving one, we
 

4069
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,669
to gray box. If we start leaving one, we
can think about lower prices, but not

4070
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:21,679
can think about lower prices, but not
 

4071
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,750
can think about lower prices, but not
before then.

4072
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:23,760
before then.
 

4073
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,990
before then.
Certainly not before then.

4074
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:30,000

 

4075
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,830

They are trying to leave this area.

4076
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
They are trying to leave this area.
 

4077
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,910

Watching ES into previous day high as

4078
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:35,920
Watching ES into previous day high as
 

4079
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,910
Watching ES into previous day high as
well. Right, ES into previous day high.

4080
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:37,920
well. Right, ES into previous day high.
 

4081
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:45,189
well. Right, ES into previous day high.
It keeps bidding there this morning.

4082
01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:45,199

 

4083
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,470

I think they're going to try and clean

4084
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:46,480
I think they're going to try and clean
 

4085
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,229
I think they're going to try and clean
up some of these guys a bit lower into

4086
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:48,239
up some of these guys a bit lower into
 

4087
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:53,350
up some of these guys a bit lower into
60s again and then see what happens

4088
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:53,360

 

4089
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,229

the right level. Yeah, let's see if we

4090
01:32:56,229 --> 01:32:56,239
the right level. Yeah, let's see if we
 

4091
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:58,629
the right level. Yeah, let's see if we
leave here then now and how we act.

4092
01:32:58,629 --> 01:32:58,639
leave here then now and how we act.
 

4093
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,990
leave here then now and how we act.
We're building out a huge amount of

4094
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:00,000
We're building out a huge amount of
 

4095
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,590
We're building out a huge amount of
volume. It's a shame that they've left

4096
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:01,600
volume. It's a shame that they've left
 

4097
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,110
volume. It's a shame that they've left
this little low volume node. It's going

4098
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,120
this little low volume node. It's going
 

4099
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,709
this little low volume node. It's going
to be pretty dangerous how they're

4100
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:04,719
to be pretty dangerous how they're
 

4101
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:14,070
to be pretty dangerous how they're
setting this up.

4102
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,080

 

4103
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:18,950

still protecting this sort of edge here.

4104
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:18,960
still protecting this sort of edge here.
 

4105
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,350
still protecting this sort of edge here.
I let this develop a little bit there.

4106
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,360
I let this develop a little bit there.
 

4107
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,669
I let this develop a little bit there.
There's

4108
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:23,679
There's
 

4109
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:25,030
There's
there's a couple opportunities here,

4110
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,040
there's a couple opportunities here,
 

4111
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,790
there's a couple opportunities here,
right? If we go sideways long enough and

4112
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:26,800
right? If we go sideways long enough and
 

4113
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,870
right? If we go sideways long enough and
they leave it, there's a there's a big

4114
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:28,880
they leave it, there's a there's a big
 

4115
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,910
they leave it, there's a there's a big
uh fail down into here somewhere. Very,

4116
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:31,920
uh fail down into here somewhere. Very,
 

4117
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,070
uh fail down into here somewhere. Very,
very possible. If they go long enough

4118
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:34,080
very possible. If they go long enough
 

4119
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,669
very possible. If they go long enough
and they start bidding above, then I'm

4120
01:33:35,669 --> 01:33:35,679
and they start bidding above, then I'm
 

4121
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,110
and they start bidding above, then I'm
gonna get more aggressively thinking

4122
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:37,120
gonna get more aggressively thinking
 

4123
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,310
gonna get more aggressively thinking
that we're going to go up here. I'm not

4124
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:38,320
that we're going to go up here. I'm not
 

4125
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,470
that we're going to go up here. I'm not
going to play the long up. I'm just not

4126
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
going to play the long up. I'm just not
 

4127
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,229
going to play the long up. I'm just not
I'm gonna ban myself. If I was going to

4128
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,239
I'm gonna ban myself. If I was going to
 

4129
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:43,910
I'm gonna ban myself. If I was going to
be long, I should have like said what I

4130
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:43,920
be long, I should have like said what I
 

4131
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,510
be long, I should have like said what I
was going to do, which was just like buy

4132
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:45,520
was going to do, which was just like buy
 

4133
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,350
was going to do, which was just like buy
the drive up and buy the whole that dip

4134
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:47,360
the drive up and buy the whole that dip
 

4135
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,470
the drive up and buy the whole that dip
had been a bit better. I would have

4136
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:48,480
had been a bit better. I would have
 

4137
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,830
had been a bit better. I would have
thought about it. If this structure had

4138
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:49,840
thought about it. If this structure had
 

4139
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,189
thought about it. If this structure had

4175
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,110

There are bids lower. Someone's trying

There are bids lower. Someone's trying
 

4193

There are bids lower. Someone's trying
to chase this down here and he keeps

to chase this down here and he keeps
 

4195
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,189
to chase this down here and he keeps
getting stuck. I'm just waiting for a

4196
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:29,199
getting stuck. I'm just waiting for a
 

4197
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,750
getting stuck. I'm just waiting for a
pop to see a pop up get really sold into

4198
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:31,760
pop to see a pop up get really sold into
 

4199
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,830
pop to see a pop up get really sold into
heavily again. Then I'll be more

4200
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:33,840
heavily again. Then I'll be more
 

4201
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:39,189
heavily again. Then I'll be more
interested

4202
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199

 

4203
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,110

and balances down to 50. We have got

4204
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:41,120
and balances down to 50. We have got
 

4205
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:44,390
and balances down to 50. We have got
bids down at 50 and under. I want to see

4206
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:44,400
bids down at 50 and under. I want to see
 

4207
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,870
bids down at 50 and under. I want to see
a pop up get sold into more aggressively

4208
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:46,880
a pop up get sold into more aggressively
 

4209
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,990
a pop up get sold into more aggressively
and then I'm going to be more

4210
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,000
and then I'm going to be more
 

4211
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,669
and then I'm going to be more
interested. I'm very concerned if they

4212
01:35:49,669 --> 01:35:49,679
interested. I'm very concerned if they
 

4213
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,110
interested. I'm very concerned if they
keep holding here long enough without

4214
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:51,120
keep holding here long enough without
 

4215
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,990
keep holding here long enough without
breaking down that we're going to go the

4216
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,000
breaking down that we're going to go the
 

4217
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,270
breaking down that we're going to go the
uh 920 kind of shove. So I want to be

4218
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:57,280
uh 920 kind of shove. So I want to be
 

4219
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,950
uh 920 kind of shove. So I want to be
careful. ES still holding previous day

4220
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:58,960
careful. ES still holding previous day
 

4221
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,310
careful. ES still holding previous day
high. That's going to be a good trigger

4222
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:00,320
high. That's going to be a good trigger
 

4223
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,229
high. That's going to be a good trigger
as well. So, we can watch ES as well. If

4224
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:02,239
as well. So, we can watch ES as well. If
 

4225
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,790
as well. So, we can watch ES as well. If
ES starts collapsing under PDH, then we

4226
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:04,800
ES starts collapsing under PDH, then we
 

4227
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,990
ES starts collapsing under PDH, then we
know there's probably a bigger trade

4228
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
know there's probably a bigger trade
 

4229
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,310
know there's probably a bigger trade
back down to that New York VWAP kind of

4230
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,320
back down to that New York VWAP kind of
 

4231
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,189
back down to that New York VWAP kind of
area on the ES, which maybe we can get

4232
01:36:11,189 --> 01:36:11,199
area on the ES, which maybe we can get
 

4233
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:13,270
area on the ES, which maybe we can get
down into these two areas on Q. So, I'm

4234
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:13,280
down into these two areas on Q. So, I'm
 

4235
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,510
down into these two areas on Q. So, I'm
watching. Need pops to fail though for

4236
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:15,520
watching. Need pops to fail though for
 

4237
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,830
watching. Need pops to fail though for
me to be interested.

4238
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:19,840

 

4239
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,070

We'll see folks.

4240
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:24,080

 

4241
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,870

When I say they, um, it's just a way of

4242
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:26,880
When I say they, um, it's just a way of
 

4243
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,870
When I say they, um, it's just a way of
observing the market, right? So, it's,

4244
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:28,880
observing the market, right? So, it's,
 

4245
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,030
observing the market, right? So, it's,
yes, you you could say market makers and

4246
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:31,040
yes, you you could say market makers and
 

4247
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,189
yes, you you could say market makers and

the market. All right? If I say they,
 

4251
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,790
the market. All right? If I say they,
the people in control of the market, if

4252
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:36,800
the people in control of the market, if
 

4253
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,310
the people in control of the market, if
we we view the market as one entity, all

4254
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:40,320
we we view the market as one entity, all

4257
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,070
right, if you just view it as one big
trader, it's an easier way to look at

4258
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,080
trader, it's an easier way to look at
 

4259
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,030
trader, it's an easier way to look at
it.

4260

these 50s to see if they actually have
 

4273
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,229
these 50s to see if they actually have

There's a balance here at 50s and then

35. So, watching down here to see if we
 

4281
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,109
35. So, watching down here to see if we
break under this and start like really

Alex, if you need to react fast via bid

4306
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
Alex, if you need to react fast via bid
 

4307

Alex, if you need to react fast via bid
ask or always stop limit orders. Uh

4308
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,040
ask or always stop limit orders. Uh
 

4309
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,750
ask or always stop limit orders. Uh
yeah, I like I chased a little bit here.

4310
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:57,760
yeah, I like I chased a little bit here.
 

4311
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,270
yeah, I like I chased a little bit here.
Normally I would have a stop or a limit

4312
01:37:59,270 --> 01:37:59,280
Normally I would have a stop or a limit
 

4313
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,430
Normally I would have a stop or a limit
order and my uh covers would always be

4314
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:01,440
order and my uh covers would always be
 

4315
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,189
order and my uh covers would always be
limit orders, but I've got hotkeys as

4316
01:38:03,189 --> 01:38:03,199
limit orders, but I've got hotkeys as
 

4317
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,270
limit orders, but I've got hotkeys as
well, right? So like if I feel like I'm

4318
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:05,280
well, right? So like if I feel like I'm
 

4319
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,070
well, right? So like if I feel like I'm
not getting filled, I can either move a

4320
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:08,080
not getting filled, I can either move a
 

4321
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,990
not getting filled, I can either move a
limit order with my mouse or I can mark

4322
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,000
limit order with my mouse or I can mark
 

4323
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,229
limit order with my mouse or I can mark
it out or I can close all with a hotkey

4324
01:38:12,229 --> 01:38:12,239
it out or I can close all with a hotkey
 

4325
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:17,990
it out or I can close all with a hotkey
or I can move break even with a hotkey.

4326
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:18,000

 

4327
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,910

We leave this shelf. We can get more

4328
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:19,920
We leave this shelf. We can get more
 

4329
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,910
We leave this shelf. We can get more
aggressive here down into this area of

4330
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:21,920
aggressive here down into this area of
 

4331
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,510
aggressive here down into this area of
30. So we're just waiting to see this

4332
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:23,520
30. So we're just waiting to see this
 

4333
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,790
30. So we're just waiting to see this
sort of previous week point of control.

4334
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:24,800
sort of previous week point of control.
 

4335
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,149
sort of previous week point of control.
We're going to start being aggressive.

4336
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:26,159
We're going to start being aggressive.
 

4337
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:27,910
We're going to start being aggressive.
They're trying. So that's that first

4338
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:27,920
They're trying. So that's that first
 

4339
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,070
They're trying. So that's that first
imbalance filled into 50s we just talked

4340
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:30,080
imbalance filled into 50s we just talked
 

4341
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,790
imbalance filled into 50s we just talked
about. Instantly bid off 50 there. So

4342
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:32,800
about. Instantly bid off 50 there. So
 

4343
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,390
about. Instantly bid off 50 there. So
there was an imbalance at 50. The next

4344
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:34,400
there was an imbalance at 50. The next
 

4345
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:38,070
there was an imbalance at 50. The next
imbalance is down at 38 to 35. So it was

4346
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,080
imbalance is down at 38 to 35. So it was
 

4347
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,990
imbalance is down at 38 to 35. So it was
a flush to 50 instantly caught. You can

4348
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:40,000
a flush to 50 instantly caught. You can
 

4349
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,070
a flush to 50 instantly caught. You can
see on bookmap we had like a 70 lot at

4350
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,080
see on bookmap we had like a 70 lot at
 

4351
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,550
see on bookmap we had like a 70 lot at
the low of that sell side who just got

4352
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:46,560
the low of that sell side who just got
 

4353
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,990
the low of that sell side who just got
paired against. So they filled that

4354
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:48,000
paired against. So they filled that
 

4355
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,870
paired against. So they filled that
imbalance and held. ES held 5day and

4356
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:50,880
imbalance and held. ES held 5day and
 

4357
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,870
imbalance and held. ES held 5day and
previous day high still holding for now.

4358
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:52,880
previous day high still holding for now.
 

4359
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,870
previous day high still holding for now.
Can we get acceptance lower? I'm buying

4360
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:54,880
Can we get acceptance lower? I'm buying
 

4361
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,030
Can we get acceptance lower? I'm buying
this for a short but really I don't want

this for a short but really I don't want
 

4363
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,790
this for a short but really I don't want
to chase down here. I want pots to start

4364
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:58,800
to chase down here. I want pots to start
 

4365
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,910
to chase down here. I want pots to start
failing. I just wonder if they're going

4366
01:38:59,910 --> 01:38:59,920
failing. I just wonder if they're going
 

4367
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,390

to leave this area at the moment. back

are failing, but just wonder if they're
 

4377
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,310
are failing, but just wonder if they're
going to roll this all the way down.

4378
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:16,320
going to roll this all the way down.

Explain the imbalance. It's it's where

01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:01,840
Explain the imbalance. It's it's where

way up,
 

4419
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:07,030
way up,
right? It's here. It's where

4420
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:07,040
right? It's here. It's where
 

4421
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,390
right? It's here. It's where
participants didn't get filled on the

participants didn't get filled on the
 

4423

01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:10,239
way up, right? Where we've had a big
 

4425
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,470
way up, right? Where we've had a big
squeeze out and there's an imbalance in

4426
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:12,480
squeeze out and there's an imbalance in
 

4427
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,030
squeeze out and there's an imbalance in
the market where people are likely to be

the market where people are likely to be
 

4429
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,030
the market where people are likely to be
waiting to be filled. Right? So, we have

4430
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,040
waiting to be filled. Right? So, we have
 

4431
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,790
waiting to be filled. Right? So, we have
sell side imbalances up here, buy side

01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,709
this squeezes on, if they reject this,
then maybe we get some downside

then maybe we get some downside
 

4447
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,310
then maybe we get some downside

01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,070
pressure. I really don't like it how
they built this. This is uh you'll be

4450
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:42,080
they built this. This is uh you'll be
 

4451
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,470
they built this. This is uh you'll be
very careful here. You need to be very

4452
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:44,480
very careful here. You need to be very
 

4453
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,030
very careful here. You need to be very
careful here,

4454
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:47,040
careful here,
 

4455
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,430
careful here,
right? You need to see this here for

4456
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:49,440
right? You need to see this here for
 

4457
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,149
right? You need to see this here for
sellers. If we do this for long enough,

4458
01:40:52,149 --> 01:40:52,159
sellers. If we do this for long enough,
 

4459
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:56,229
sellers. If we do this for long enough,
they're going to open this up.

4460
01:40:56,229 --> 01:40:56,239

 

4461
01:40:56,239 --> 01:41:00,709

Our

4462
01:41:00,709 --> 01:41:00,719

 

4463
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:09,510

bids down at 50 still.

4464
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:09,520

 

4465
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,510

Tricky market, tricky conditions today,

4466
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:11,520
Tricky market, tricky conditions today,
 

4467
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:19,910
Tricky market, tricky conditions today,
I would say how they've built this out.

4468
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:19,920

 

4469
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,109

You still feel they want to take

4470
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:21,119
You still feel they want to take
 

4471
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,750
You still feel they want to take
previous day high first? It's quite a

4472
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:23,760
previous day high first? It's quite a
 

4473
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,470
previous day high first? It's quite a
big ask. It's possible.

4474
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:26,480
big ask. It's possible.
 

4475
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,870
big ask. It's possible.
Um, I have that as previous day value

4476
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:28,880
Um, I have that as previous day value
 

4477
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,030
Um, I have that as previous day value
area high on Ninja Trader as well, but

4478
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:31,040
area high on Ninja Trader as well, but
 

4479
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,750
area high on Ninja Trader as well, but
it's asking so much without a

4480
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:33,760
it's asking so much without a
 

4481
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,830
it's asking so much without a
significant pullback,

4482
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:35,840
significant pullback,
 

4483
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,750
significant pullback,
but it's very it it's possible. The way

4484
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:37,760
but it's very it it's possible. The way
 

4485
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,669
but it's very it it's possible. The way
they're building out N is nasty. No, I'm

4486
01:41:39,669 --> 01:41:39,679
they're building out N is nasty. No, I'm
 

4487
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:41,270
they're building out N is nasty. No, I'm
still not sure, guys. I'm still not

4488
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:41,280
still not sure, guys. I'm still not
 

4489
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,470
still not sure, guys. I'm still not
sure. I'm watching this at the moment,

4490
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,480
sure. I'm watching this at the moment,
 

4491
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,790
sure. I'm watching this at the moment,
though, because that last pop up into

4492
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:44,800
though, because that last pop up into
 

4493
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,830
though, because that last pop up into
that 65 area was interesting. Watching

4494
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:47,840
that 65 area was interesting. Watching
 

4495
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,109
that 65 area was interesting. Watching
this now to see if we get follow

4496
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:49,119
this now to see if we get follow
 

4497
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,830
this now to see if we get follow
through. 65 was

4498
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:51,840
through. 65 was
 

4499
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,229
through. 65 was
uh current point of control and previous

4500
01:41:54,229 --> 01:41:54,239
uh current point of control and previous
 

4501
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:55,270
uh current point of control and previous
week point of control there or

4502
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:55,280
week point of control there or
 

4503
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,870
week point of control there or
thereabouts. So if they sell that

4504
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:56,880
thereabouts. So if they sell that
 

4505
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,830
thereabouts. So if they sell that
aggressively, I will join the tape

4506
01:41:59,830 --> 01:41:59,840
aggressively, I will join the tape
 

4507
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:04,149
aggressively, I will join the tape
back to these 50s again

4508
01:42:04,149 --> 01:42:04,159

 

4509
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,070

and keep trying to bid down here at 50s.

4510
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:06,080
and keep trying to bid down here at 50s.
 

4511
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,510
and keep trying to bid down here at 50s.
That old imbalance. Like I said, there's

4512
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:07,520
That old imbalance. Like I said, there's
 

4513
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,430
That old imbalance. Like I said, there's
an imbalance down to 37s. I'll try and

4514
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:09,440
an imbalance down to 37s. I'll try and
 

4515
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,750
an imbalance down to 37s. I'll try and
show you what I'm looking at. Right, I'm

4516
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
show you what I'm looking at. Right, I'm
 

4517
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,430
show you what I'm looking at. Right, I'm
watching. We had one imbalance here.

4518
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:13,440
watching. We had one imbalance here.
 

4519
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,350
watching. We had one imbalance here.
We've tapped into this one here at 37s.

4520
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:15,360
We've tapped into this one here at 37s.
 

4521
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,430
We've tapped into this one here at 37s.
There's a flush point down here. if we

4522
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:17,440
There's a flush point down here. if we
 

4523
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,350
There's a flush point down here. if we
let go of the shelf, not not before it.

4524
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:19,360
let go of the shelf, not not before it.
 

4525
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:20,709
let go of the shelf, not not before it.
So, we've got to let go of this and get

4526
01:42:20,709 --> 01:42:20,719
So, we've got to let go of this and get
 

4527
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,550
So, we've got to let go of this and get
through this to trade down. It's kind of

4528
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:22,560
through this to trade down. It's kind of
 

4529
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,830
through this to trade down. It's kind of
messy the way they've built out all

4530
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:23,840
messy the way they've built out all
 

4531
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,950
messy the way they've built out all
these nodes. We're going to have to be

4532
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960
these nodes. We're going to have to be
 

4533
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,229
these nodes. We're going to have to be
very very careful if we're going to

4534
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:26,239
very very careful if we're going to
 

4535
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:29,430
very very careful if we're going to
trade counter trend today.

4536
01:42:29,430 --> 01:42:29,440
trade counter trend today.
 

4537
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:32,229
trade counter trend today.
Uh reclaiming again.

4538
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:32,239
Uh reclaiming again.
 

4539
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:33,910
Uh reclaiming again.
So, this can be a two-leg and they can

4540
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:33,920
So, this can be a two-leg and they can
 

4541
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,350
So, this can be a two-leg and they can
rip this if they really want. So, I want

4542
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:35,360
rip this if they really want. So, I want
 

4543
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,910
rip this if they really want. So, I want
to be very very careful here if I'm

4544
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:37,920
to be very very careful here if I'm
 

4545
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,709
to be very very careful here if I'm
going to think about it

4546
01:42:40,709 --> 01:42:40,719
going to think about it
 

4547
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:52,390
going to think about it
into this gray box again.

4548
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:52,400

 

4549
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:56,149

patience.

4550
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159

 

4551
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:57,030

Should have, would have, could have.

4552
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:57,040
Should have, would have, could have.
 

4553
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,310
Should have, would have, could have.
Bought the open. Should have, would

4554
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:58,320
Bought the open. Should have, would
 

4555
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,229
Bought the open. Should have, would
have, could have.

4556
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:00,239
have, could have.
 

4557
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,910
have, could have.
I tell you what, I know I said, you

4558
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:01,920
I tell you what, I know I said, you
 

4559
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,430
I tell you what, I know I said, you
know, I gave you the areas where we

4560
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:03,440
know, I gave you the areas where we
 

4561
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,350
know, I gave you the areas where we
might come up to. I didn't actually

4562
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:05,360
might come up to. I didn't actually
 

4563
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,750
might come up to. I didn't actually
think we'd get up into the 900s in the

4564
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:07,760
think we'd get up into the 900s in the
 

4565
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:14,310
think we'd get up into the 900s in the
first hour of trading. I'll be honest.

4566
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:14,320

 

4567
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,830

If you if you thought we were going to

4568
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:15,840
If you if you thought we were going to
 

4569
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,229
If you if you thought we were going to
get up to the 900s in the first hour of

4570
01:43:18,229 --> 01:43:18,239
get up to the 900s in the first hour of
 

4571
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:19,669
get up to the 900s in the first hour of
trading, if you thought we were going to

4572
01:43:19,669 --> 01:43:19,679
trading, if you thought we were going to
 

4573
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:22,310
trading, if you thought we were going to
go from five, we're going to do like a

4574
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:22,320
go from five, we're going to do like a
 

4575
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,550
go from five, we're going to do like a
400 point ripper in the first hour of

4576
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:24,560
400 point ripper in the first hour of
 

4577
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,790
400 point ripper in the first hour of
trading. You should be very rich person.

4578
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:26,800
trading. You should be very rich person.
 

4579
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,990
trading. You should be very rich person.
I didn't think we'd do it in the first

4580
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:28,000
I didn't think we'd do it in the first
 

4581
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,510
I didn't think we'd do it in the first
hour. I thought we could potentially do

4582
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:29,520
hour. I thought we could potentially do
 

4583
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:36,229
hour. I thought we could potentially do
it today, but not in the first hour.

4584
01:43:36,229 --> 01:43:36,239

 

4585
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:37,910

Footprint, man. If you're looking for

4586
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:37,920
Footprint, man. If you're looking for
 

4587
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,910
Footprint, man. If you're looking for
imbalances, footprint, you're going to

4588
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:39,920
imbalances, footprint, you're going to
 

4589
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:42,870
imbalances, footprint, you're going to
need to watch a footprint chart.

4590
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:42,880
need to watch a footprint chart.
 

4591
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:48,229
need to watch a footprint chart.
You can't do it otherwise.

4592
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:48,239

 

4593
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,149

Still rejecting up here. Move this down

4594
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:50,159
Still rejecting up here. Move this down
 

4595
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:52,629
Still rejecting up here. Move this down
a little bit. It's like that. It's

4596
01:43:52,629 --> 01:43:52,639
a little bit. It's like that. It's
 

4597
01:43:52,639 --> 01:44:10,790
a little bit. It's like that. It's
messy. It's so messy, guys. So messy.

4598
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:10,800

 

4599
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:17,510

Still rejecting that PC at the moment.

4600
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:17,520

 

4601
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,229

It's tempting. It's tempting. I just

4602
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:20,239
It's tempting. It's tempting. I just
 

4603
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:22,470
It's tempting. It's tempting. I just
don't see the heaviness on the tape at

4604
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:22,480
don't see the heaviness on the tape at
 

4605
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,229
don't see the heaviness on the tape at
the moment. It's very tempting to get

4606
01:44:24,229 --> 01:44:24,239
the moment. It's very tempting to get
 

4607
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:28,229
the moment. It's very tempting to get
short here and look for this wash, but

4608
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:28,239
short here and look for this wash, but
 

4609
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:30,709
short here and look for this wash, but
I'm not convinced yet. I might have to

4610
01:44:30,709 --> 01:44:30,719
I'm not convinced yet. I might have to
 

4611
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:33,590
I'm not convinced yet. I might have to
join late, which is not ideal, but I

4612
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
join late, which is not ideal, but I
 

4613
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,149
join late, which is not ideal, but I
want to be convinced that bears are

4614
01:44:36,149 --> 01:44:36,159
want to be convinced that bears are
 

4615
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,750
want to be convinced that bears are
turning up. Like ES isn't even under

4616
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:37,760
turning up. Like ES isn't even under
 

4617
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,550
turning up. Like ES isn't even under
previous day high yet. VIX is still

4618
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:40,560
previous day high yet. VIX is still
 

4619
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,390
previous day high yet. VIX is still
coming downside.

4620
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:42,400
coming downside.
 

4621
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,149
coming downside.
If VIX fails to break lower, then I'll

4622
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
If VIX fails to break lower, then I'll
 

4623
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,750
If VIX fails to break lower, then I'll
feel a little have a bit more conviction

4624
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:45,760
feel a little have a bit more conviction
 

4625
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,910
feel a little have a bit more conviction
about this. Seeing some sellers step in

4626
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:47,920

4957
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,910

So this is affordable indicators there,

4958
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:49,920
So this is affordable indicators there,
 

4959
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,510
So this is affordable indicators there,
right? That's who I would use if I was

4960
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:51,520
right? That's who I would use if I was
 

4961
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,830
right? That's who I would use if I was
you. Okay, they're still holding this

4962
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:53,840
you. Okay, they're still holding this
 

4963
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,910
you. Okay, they're still holding this
gray box. So gray to gray can be a

4964
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:55,920
gray box. So gray to gray can be a
 

4965
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:59,830
gray box. So gray to gray can be a
rotation. It can be a rotation.

4966
01:52:59,830 --> 01:52:59,840
rotation. It can be a rotation.
 

4967
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,589
rotation. It can be a rotation.
I'm waiting to see if VIX can start

4968
01:53:01,589 --> 01:53:01,599
I'm waiting to see if VIX can start
 

4969
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:02,870
I'm waiting to see if VIX can start
doing that sort of inverse head and

4970
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:02,880
doing that sort of inverse head and
 

4971
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,270
doing that sort of inverse head and
shoulders, which will help. So if we're

4972
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,280
shoulders, which will help. So if we're
 

4973
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,870
shoulders, which will help. So if we're
thinking about, you know, what I'd want

4974
01:53:06,870 --> 01:53:06,880
thinking about, you know, what I'd want
 

4975
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,870
thinking about, you know, what I'd want
to see for confluence, right? If VIX can

4976
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:08,880
to see for confluence, right? If VIX can
 

4977
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:11,750
to see for confluence, right? If VIX can
start breaking above this, right? If we

4978
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:11,760
start breaking above this, right? If we
 

4979
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,149
start breaking above this, right? If we
have wicked out previous day low into

4980
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:14,159
have wicked out previous day low into
 

4981
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,390
have wicked out previous day low into
the IB, if we're going to do this move

4982
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:16,400
the IB, if we're going to do this move
 

4983
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,709
the IB, if we're going to do this move
on VIX up into here, this will help our

4984
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:18,719
on VIX up into here, this will help our
 

4985
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:21,109
on VIX up into here, this will help our
short thesis on the market. So, I'm

4986
01:53:21,109 --> 01:53:21,119
short thesis on the market. So, I'm
 

4987
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:22,310
short thesis on the market. So, I'm
waiting to see if they're willing to do

4988
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:22,320
waiting to see if they're willing to do
 

4989
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:32,470
waiting to see if they're willing to do
that on VIX at the moment.

4990
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:32,480

 

4991
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,310

Yes, that's for copy trading. I mean,

4992
01:53:34,310 --> 01:53:34,320
Yes, that's for copy trading. I mean,
 

4993
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,750
Yes, that's for copy trading. I mean,
you can use it for there got all sorts

4994
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:35,760

4995
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:37,669
you can use it for there got all sorts
on there, but they have a very good uh

4996
01:53:37,669 --> 01:53:37,679
on there, but they have a very good uh
 

4997
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:40,310
on there, but they have a very good uh
trade copier on there. You can uh trade

4998
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,320
trade copier on there. You can uh trade
 

4999
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,870
trade copier on there. You can uh trade
all prop firms. You can set um targets

5000
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:42,880
all prop firms. You can set um targets
 

5001

01:53:46,629 --> 01:53:46,639
aggressive with some S some others. You
 

5005
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,870
aggressive with some S some others. You
can chart on uh NQ but trade on MNQ

5006
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:50,880
can chart on uh NQ but trade on MNQ
 

5007
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:51,990
can chart on uh NQ but trade on MNQ
without having to change your charts.

Here you go. Still looking for that

5010
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:53,119
Here you go. Still looking for that
 

5011
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:54,790
Here you go. Still looking for that
imbalance at I'm out of this. By the

5012
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:54,800
imbalance at I'm out of this. By the
 

5013
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,990
imbalance at I'm out of this. By the
way, folks, this is still looking for

5014
01:53:55,990 --> 01:53:56,000
way, folks, this is still looking for
 

5015
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,629
way, folks, this is still looking for
that imbalance at 806 and 800s. So your

5016
01:53:58,629 --> 01:53:58,639
that imbalance at 806 and 800s. So your
 

5017
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:00,310
that imbalance at 806 and 800s. So your
cover points are still into this next

5018
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:00,320
cover points are still into this next
 

5019
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,229
cover points are still into this next
gray box, right? And if you get lucky,

5020
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
gray box, right? And if you get lucky,
 

5021
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:03,510
gray box, right? And if you get lucky,
you'll get VW up here. That would be a

5022
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:03,520
you'll get VW up here. That would be a
 

5023
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,350
you'll get VW up here. That would be a
hell of a trade. All right, for you guys

5024
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:05,360
hell of a trade. All right, for you guys
 

5025
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,350
hell of a trade. All right, for you guys
that get this this short position. And

5026
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:07,360
that get this this short position. And
 

5027
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,990
that get this this short position. And
where's my short? Right. Something like

5028
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:10,000
where's my short? Right. Something like
 

5029
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,030
where's my short? Right. Something like
this here. Other side of the node. If

5030
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:13,040
this here. Other side of the node. If
 

5031
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:14,310
this here. Other side of the node. If
you get really lucky, you'll get this

5032
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:14,320
you get really lucky, you'll get this
 

5033
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,229
you get really lucky, you'll get this
move down into here. That would be an 82

5034
01:54:16,229 --> 01:54:16,239
move down into here. That would be an 82
 

5035
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:18,950
move down into here. That would be an 82
pointer. But I'd be covering lots into

5036
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:18,960
pointer. But I'd be covering lots into
 

5037
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:21,510
pointer. But I'd be covering lots into
here. Right in into this pocket here.

5038
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:21,520
here. Right in into this pocket here.
 

5039
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:22,950
here. Right in into this pocket here.
You should have already covered some. I

5040
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:22,960
You should have already covered some. I
 

5041
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,870
You should have already covered some. I
got knocked out on the runners. And if

5042
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:24,880
got knocked out on the runners. And if
 

5043
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,550
got knocked out on the runners. And if
you get lucky, you get into here. Maybe

5044
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:26,560
you get lucky, you get into here. Maybe
 

5045
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,669
you get lucky, you get into here. Maybe
even this. If you get very, very lucky.

5046
01:54:29,669 --> 01:54:29,679
even this. If you get very, very lucky.
 

5047
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:31,109
even this. If you get very, very lucky.
Move this here so you can see. But I

5048
01:54:31,109 --> 01:54:31,119
Move this here so you can see. But I
 

5049
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:33,510
Move this here so you can see. But I
would definitely be covering some 806s

5050
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:33,520
would definitely be covering some 806s
 

5051
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,750
would definitely be covering some 806s
down to 800s. Right. 806s. and then see

5052
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:35,760
down to 800s. Right. 806s. and then see
 

5053
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,270
down to 800s. Right. 806s. and then see

5061
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,669
into this low volume node. So, you
should be trying to take some partials

5062
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:43,679
should be trying to take some partials
 

5063

should be trying to take some partials
into this deep pullback flow zones. All

YouTube. Right, back to gray box. So, if
 

5115
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,350
YouTube. Right, back to gray box. So, if
you you need a rejection of this to

5116
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:55,360
you you need a rejection of this to
 

5117
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:56,870
you you need a rejection of this to
trade down into this shelf. If you do

01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:56,880
trade down into this shelf. If you do
 

5119
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,550
trade down into this shelf. If you do
not reject this gray box, this is the

5120
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:58,560
not reject this gray box, this is the
 

5121
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,149
not reject this gray box, this is the
same story as we had here. Gray box to

5122
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:00,159
same story as we had here. Gray box to
 

5123
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:02,950
same story as we had here. Gray box to
gray box. gray box towards gray box. You

5124
01:56:02,950 --> 01:56:02,960
gray box. gray box towards gray box. You
 

5125
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:05,430
gray box. gray box towards gray box. You
need to reject this and do this and then

5126
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:05,440
need to reject this and do this and then
 

5127
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,510
need to reject this and do this and then
this. Otherwise, we're going to go level

5128
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:07,520
this. Otherwise, we're going to go level
 

5129
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,950
this. Otherwise, we're going to go level
to level, right? Level to level. We

5130
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:08,960
to level, right? Level to level. We
 

5131
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,629
to level, right? Level to level. We
trade level to level, level to level,

5132
01:56:10,629 --> 01:56:10,639
trade level to level, level to level,
 

5133
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:16,629
trade level to level, level to level,
level to level, level to level.

5134
01:56:16,629 --> 01:56:16,639

 

5135
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:19,830

But your TP was in here. I think I said

5136
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:19,840
But your TP was in here. I think I said
 

5137
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,470
But your TP was in here. I think I said
sixes, sixes to 800s and then run us

5138
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:22,480
sixes, sixes to 800s and then run us
 

5139
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:25,109
sixes, sixes to 800s and then run us
down to here. So, you got sixes, you got

5140
01:56:25,109 --> 01:56:25,119
down to here. So, you got sixes, you got
 

5141
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:27,669
down to here. So, you got sixes, you got
under sixes, and gray box is starting to

5142
01:56:27,669 --> 01:56:27,679
under sixes, and gray box is starting to
 

5143
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:29,430
under sixes, and gray box is starting to
be reclaimed. If they reclaim this, I

5144
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:29,440
be reclaimed. If they reclaim this, I
 

5145
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:32,390
be reclaimed. If they reclaim this, I
would expect to squeeze back up to 60s.

5146
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:32,400
would expect to squeeze back up to 60s.
 

5147
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:36,470
would expect to squeeze back up to 60s.

01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,149

You would want ES to reject previous day

5152
01:56:44,149 --> 01:56:44,159
You would want ES to reject previous day
 

5153
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:46,629
You would want ES to reject previous day
high here. VIX failed to break out that

5154
01:56:46,629 --> 01:56:46,639
high here. VIX failed to break out that
 

5155
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:48,070

inverse head and shoulders we just

5156
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,080
inverse head and shoulders we just
 

5157
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,510
inverse head and shoulders we just
talked about. So, just wait to see if it

5158
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:49,520
talked about. So, just wait to see if it
 

5159
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,310
talked about. So, just wait to see if it
can still do it. We've got uh about 50

5160
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:52,320
can still do it. We've got uh about 50
 

5161
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:55,430
can still do it. We've got uh about 50
minutes left to trade here together.

5162
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,440
minutes left to trade here together.
 

5163
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,990

they have built this out a little bit
 

5169
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:02,550
they have built this out a little bit
better for us? Maybe I should have been

5170
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:02,560
better for us? Maybe I should have been
 

5171
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,149
better for us? Maybe I should have been
more aggressive on dips here. I didn't

5172
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:04,159
more aggressive on dips here. I didn't
 

5173
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:05,669
more aggressive on dips here. I didn't

5229
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,669
now right we're clearly the opposite of
a trending market we are boxed

5230
01:58:37,669 --> 01:58:37,679
a trending market we are boxed
 

5231
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,589
a trending market we are boxed
same box we've been in since November

5232
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599

Ballingers. We are anything but trending
 

5245
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:53,589
Ballingers. We are anything but trending
market, which is why I wanted to be very

5246
01:58:53,589 --> 01:58:53,599
market, which is why I wanted to be very
 

5247
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:56,629
market, which is why I wanted to be very
careful today. Um, if we reclaim this

5248
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:56,639
careful today. Um, if we reclaim this
 

5249
01:58:56,639 --> 01:58:58,790
careful today. Um, if we reclaim this
level,

5250
01:58:58,790 --> 01:58:58,800
level,
 

5251
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,790
level,
then means we haven't undercut. They can

5252
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:00,800
then means we haven't undercut. They can
 

5253
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,229
then means we haven't undercut. They can
still sell this and come down. If we

5254
01:59:02,229 --> 01:59:02,239
still sell this and come down. If we
 

5255
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:03,910
still sell this and come down. If we
reclaim this level, we can still

5256
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:03,920
reclaim this level, we can still
 

5257
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,070
reclaim this level, we can still
consider longs if they start expanding.

5258
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:06,080
consider longs if they start expanding.
 

5259
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,430
consider longs if they start expanding.
But they're going to make this very,

5260
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:07,440
But they're going to make this very,
 

5261
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:10,470
But they're going to make this very,
very tricky. um they don't know what

5262
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:10,480
very tricky. um they don't know what
 

5263
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,629
very tricky. um they don't know what
they want to do with it right now. But I

5264
01:59:12,629 --> 01:59:12,639
they want to do with it right now. But I
 

5265
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:15,189
they want to do with it right now. But I
tell you what, we can't do this from

5266
01:59:15,189 --> 01:59:15,199
tell you what, we can't do this from
 

5267
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:18,470
tell you what, we can't do this from
November 5th forever. Uh one way or

5268
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:18,480
November 5th forever. Uh one way or
 

5269
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,709
November 5th forever. Uh one way or
another, this is going to get nasty. And

5270
01:59:20,709 --> 01:59:20,719
another, this is going to get nasty. And
 

5271
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:23,270
another, this is going to get nasty. And
the longer we stay here, the 200 day,

5272
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:23,280
the longer we stay here, the 200 day,
 

5273
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:24,870
the longer we stay here, the 200 day,
you can see now it's time to really

5274
01:59:24,870 --> 01:59:24,880
you can see now it's time to really
 

5275
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,629
you can see now it's time to really
catch up. There might be an event where

5276
01:59:26,629 --> 01:59:26,639
catch up. There might be an event where
 

5277
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:28,310
catch up. There might be an event where
we can just scoop this and they do

5278
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,320
we can just scoop this and they do
 

5279
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,470
we can just scoop this and they do
something horrible. But we are not going

5280
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:30,480
something horrible. But we are not going
 

5281
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,830
something horrible. But we are not going
to do this forever, guys. At some point,

5282
01:59:33,830 --> 01:59:33,840
to do this forever, guys. At some point,
 

5283
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,589
to do this forever, guys. At some point,
someone is going to lose. I don't know

5284
01:59:35,589 --> 01:59:35,599
someone is going to lose. I don't know
 

5285
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:37,830
someone is going to lose. I don't know
which side yet. And anyone who tells you

5286
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:37,840
which side yet. And anyone who tells you
 

5287
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:39,589
which side yet. And anyone who tells you
it's going to be this side or the No, we

5288
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:39,599
it's going to be this side or the No, we
 

5289
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:42,149
it's going to be this side or the No, we
don't know which side yet. We don't.

5290
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159
don't know which side yet. We don't.
 

5291
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:43,830
don't know which side yet. We don't.
Bears had control coming into this

5292
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:43,840
Bears had control coming into this
 

5293
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,270
Bears had control coming into this
session. All they had to do was reject

5294
01:59:45,270 --> 01:59:45,280
session. All they had to do was reject
 

5295
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,350
session. All they had to do was reject
this and come for this undercut and look

5296
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:47,360
this and come for this undercut and look
 

5297
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:48,950
this and come for this undercut and look
for these stops. That's all bears had to

5298
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:48,960
for these stops. That's all bears had to
 

5299
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,109
for these stops. That's all bears had to
do. Did they do it? No, they failed. All

5300
01:59:51,109 --> 01:59:51,119
do. Did they do it? No, they failed. All
 

5301
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:52,629
do. Did they do it? No, they failed. All
right, so now we're back at this old

5302
01:59:52,629 --> 01:59:52,639
right, so now we're back at this old
 

5303
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:54,390
right, so now we're back at this old
point of control. It's not only an old

5304
01:59:54,390 --> 01:59:54,400
point of control. It's not only an old
 

5305
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,750
point of control. It's not only an old
point of control. If we look at the

5306
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:55,760
point of control. If we look at the
 

5307
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:58,550
point of control. If we look at the
volume for the last year, all right,

5308
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:58,560
volume for the last year, all right,
 

5309
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,709
volume for the last year, all right,
this is a year's worth of volume. We are

5310
02:00:00,709 --> 02:00:00,719
this is a year's worth of volume. We are
 

5311
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:04,070
this is a year's worth of volume. We are
in a huge huge node here. If we find

5312
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:04,080
in a huge huge node here. If we find
 

5313
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,310
in a huge huge node here. If we find
acceptance over this node and the bowls

5314
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:06,320
acceptance over this node and the bowls
 

5315
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,709
acceptance over this node and the bowls
start going, we can do big drives out.

5316
02:00:08,709 --> 02:00:08,719
start going, we can do big drives out.
 

5317
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:10,709
start going, we can do big drives out.
All right, we can do this for the rest

5318
02:00:10,709 --> 02:00:10,719
All right, we can do this for the rest
 

5319
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:13,270
All right, we can do this for the rest
of the year. It's asking for us to find

5320
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
of the year. It's asking for us to find
 

5321
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,589
of the year. It's asking for us to find
acceptance. We can get up into 28,000

5322
02:00:15,589 --> 02:00:15,599
acceptance. We can get up into 28,000
 

5323
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:18,070
acceptance. We can get up into 28,000
this year. All right, but it's got to

5324
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:18,080
this year. All right, but it's got to
 

5325
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:25,270
this year. All right, but it's got to
get outside of this.

5326
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:25,280

 

5327
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:28,629

So, I don't have uh a bias right now.

5328
02:00:28,629 --> 02:00:28,639
So, I don't have uh a bias right now.
 

5329
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:30,629
So, I don't have uh a bias right now.
I'm I'm willing to play both sides of

5330
02:00:30,629 --> 02:00:30,639
I'm I'm willing to play both sides of
 

5331
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:43,189
I'm I'm willing to play both sides of
the tape until we move outside.

5332
02:00:43,189 --> 02:00:43,199

 

5333
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:45,350

Volatile. Volatile. Yeah, volatile's

5334
02:00:45,350 --> 02:00:45,360
Volatile. Volatile. Yeah, volatile's
 

5335
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:57,030
Volatile. Volatile. Yeah, volatile's
definitely true, right? Definitely true.

5336
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:57,040

 

5337
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,629

All right. So, starting to reclaim. So,

5338
02:00:58,629 --> 02:00:58,639
All right. So, starting to reclaim. So,
 

5339
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:00,229
All right. So, starting to reclaim. So,
gray box to gray box. So, that pullback

5340
02:01:00,229 --> 02:01:00,239
gray box to gray box. So, that pullback
 

5341
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:01,669
gray box to gray box. So, that pullback
held. So, if we think about this from a

5342
02:01:01,669 --> 02:01:01,679
held. So, if we think about this from a
 

5343
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:02,870
held. So, if we think about this from a
fib, remember we talked about this

5344
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:02,880
fib, remember we talked about this
 

5345
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,830
fib, remember we talked about this
earlier. Where did we h right into the

5346
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:05,840
earlier. Where did we h right into the
 

5347
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,589
earlier. Where did we h right into the
618? They're starting to hold this. So,

5348
02:01:07,589 --> 02:01:07,599
618? They're starting to hold this. So,
 

5349
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:09,109
618? They're starting to hold this. So,
they're going to go gray box to gray

5350
02:01:09,109 --> 02:01:09,119
they're going to go gray box to gray
 

5351
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:10,629
they're going to go gray box to gray
box. And if they find acceptance over

5352
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
box. And if they find acceptance over
 

5353
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:13,109
box. And if they find acceptance over
this, then this will be considered a

5354
02:01:13,109 --> 02:01:13,119
this, then this will be considered a
 

5355
02:01:13,119 --> 02:01:16,709
this, then this will be considered a
huge bullish momentum to try and get up

5356
02:01:16,709 --> 02:01:16,719
huge bullish momentum to try and get up
 

5357
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:19,510
huge bullish momentum to try and get up
into here. If they fail this, fail back

5358
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:19,520
into here. If they fail this, fail back
 

5359
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:21,350
into here. If they fail this, fail back
under, we go between here, fail that

5360
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:21,360
under, we go between here, fail that
 

5361
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:24,390
under, we go between here, fail that
here, but I almost find it unlikely that

5362
02:01:24,390 --> 02:01:24,400
here, but I almost find it unlikely that
 

5363
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,830
here, but I almost find it unlikely that
we come down to this at this point

5364
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:25,840
we come down to this at this point
 

5365
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,189
we come down to this at this point
today.

5366
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:27,199
today.
 

5367
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:28,709
today.
Don't see why they would profit take on

5368
02:01:28,709 --> 02:01:28,719
Don't see why they would profit take on
 

5369
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:30,310
Don't see why they would profit take on
a Monday off the positioning this way,

5370
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:30,320
a Monday off the positioning this way,
 

5371
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:33,350
a Monday off the positioning this way,
but we will see. We will see. It looks

5372
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:33,360
but we will see. We will see. It looks
 

5373
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:37,109
but we will see. We will see. It looks
pretty bullish overall.

5374
02:01:37,109 --> 02:01:37,119

 

5375
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:38,149

TP1 hit here hit here hit here hit here

5376
02:01:38,149 --> 02:01:38,159

 

5377
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:39,430
hit here hit here hit here hit here hit
here hit here hit. That's your first

5378
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:39,440
here hit here hit. That's your first
 

5379
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:42,870
here hit here hit. That's your first
trade. Decent trade today that hit. Now

5380
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:42,880
trade. Decent trade today that hit. Now
 

5381
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,430
trade. Decent trade today that hit. Now
we just see it is possible rotation

5382
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:45,440
we just see it is possible rotation
 

5383
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:48,070
we just see it is possible rotation
between these gray boxes. We definitely

5384
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:48,080
between these gray boxes. We definitely
 

5385
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,750
between these gray boxes. We definitely
got a lot of stops at those highs if it

5386
02:01:49,750 --> 02:01:49,760
got a lot of stops at those highs if it
 

5387
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:59,109
got a lot of stops at those highs if it
really wants to go for them.

5388
02:01:59,109 --> 02:01:59,119

 

5389
02:01:59,119 --> 02:02:01,430

Do I use previous days high volume nodes

5390
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:01,440
Do I use previous days high volume nodes
 

5391
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:04,229
Do I use previous days high volume nodes
or use developing nodes as SNR? Both.

5392
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:04,239
or use developing nodes as SNR? Both.
 

5393
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:06,870
or use developing nodes as SNR? Both.
Both. And ideally, they match up well

5394
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:06,880
Both. And ideally, they match up well
 

5395
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:09,830
Both. And ideally, they match up well
together. Same with previous weeks. They

5396
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:09,840
together. Same with previous weeks. They
 

5397
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:13,750
together. Same with previous weeks. They
all matter.

5398
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:13,760

 

5399
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:14,950

But if you look at where we're trading

5400
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:14,960
But if you look at where we're trading
 

5401
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:20,229
But if you look at where we're trading
into like the previous week right now,

5402
02:02:20,229 --> 02:02:20,239

 

5403
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:22,229

guys,

5404
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:22,239
guys,
 

5405
02:02:22,239 --> 02:02:24,870
guys,
right, the This even from the open. This

5406
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:24,880
right, the This even from the open. This
 

5407
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,229
right, the This even from the open. This
is from the Sunday open. Look at the

5408
02:02:26,229 --> 02:02:26,239
is from the Sunday open. Look at the
 

5409
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:27,589
is from the Sunday open. Look at the
amount of liquidity we're building up

5410
02:02:27,589 --> 02:02:27,599
amount of liquidity we're building up
 

5411
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:29,750
amount of liquidity we're building up
here already. Right? This is huge. If we

5412
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:29,760
here already. Right? This is huge. If we
 

5413
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,229
here already. Right? This is huge. If we
leave this, this move here is highly

5414
02:02:32,229 --> 02:02:32,239
leave this, this move here is highly
 

5415
02:02:32,239 --> 02:02:34,470
leave this, this move here is highly
probable at some point this week. Right?

5416
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:34,480
probable at some point this week. Right?
 

5417
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:37,189
probable at some point this week. Right?
This was where we clearly broke out just

5418
02:02:37,189 --> 02:02:37,199
This was where we clearly broke out just
 

5419
02:02:37,199 --> 02:02:39,430
This was where we clearly broke out just
before New York open. Right? We've never

5420
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:39,440
before New York open. Right? We've never
 

5421
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,109
before New York open. Right? We've never
come back to retest any of this. This

5422
02:02:41,109 --> 02:02:41,119
come back to retest any of this. This
 

5423
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:43,189
come back to retest any of this. This
will happen. I would imagine this will

5424
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:43,199
will happen. I would imagine this will
 

5425
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:44,790
will happen. I would imagine this will
happen at some point this week, even if

5426
02:02:44,790 --> 02:02:44,800
happen at some point this week, even if
 

5427
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,870
happen at some point this week, even if
we're going to be bullish from there.

5428
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:46,880
we're going to be bullish from there.
 

5429
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:48,550
we're going to be bullish from there.
And we can use these nodes here. So,

5430
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:48,560
And we can use these nodes here. So,
 

5431
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,550
And we can use these nodes here. So,
we're here, here, here, and then thick

5432
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:50,560
we're here, here, here, and then thick
 

5433
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,709
we're here, here, here, and then thick
here. So if we leave this, that rotation

5434
02:02:52,709 --> 02:02:52,719
here. So if we leave this, that rotation
 

5435
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:54,390
here. So if we leave this, that rotation
is possible.

5436
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:54,400
is possible.
 

5437
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,470
is possible.
I'm looking at multiple time frames all

5438
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:56,480
I'm looking at multiple time frames all
 

5439
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:58,790
I'm looking at multiple time frames all
all the time trying to see where the

5440
02:02:58,790 --> 02:02:58,800
all the time trying to see where the
 

5441
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:03,430
all the time trying to see where the
edge is. Right now it feels bullish.

5442
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:03,440
edge is. Right now it feels bullish.
 

5443
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:06,390
edge is. Right now it feels bullish.
61 pullback of this bullish, but you

5444
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:06,400
61 pullback of this bullish, but you
 

5445
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,629
61 pullback of this bullish, but you
know, we've got a trap volume above head

5446
02:03:08,629 --> 02:03:08,639
know, we've got a trap volume above head
 

5447
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:11,830
know, we've got a trap volume above head
now for the first time today.

5448
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:11,840
now for the first time today.
 

5449
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,310
now for the first time today.
For the first time today

5450
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:14,320
For the first time today
 

5451
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,830
For the first time today
and we're inside initial balance. We're

5452
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:15,840
and we're inside initial balance. We're
 

5453
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:18,790
and we're inside initial balance. We're
in a rotational market on the day. We

5454
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:18,800
in a rotational market on the day. We
 

5455
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:19,990
in a rotational market on the day. We
are starting to find a bid above

5456
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:20,000
are starting to find a bid above
 

5457
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,830
are starting to find a bid above
previous day value area high. It's

5458
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:21,840
previous day value area high. It's
 

5459
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,910
previous day value area high. It's
possible that 920 is a level that we

5460
02:03:23,910 --> 02:03:23,920
possible that 920 is a level that we
 

5461
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:27,750
possible that 920 is a level that we
want to visit today. Um on on NT I have

5462
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:27,760
want to visit today. Um on on NT I have
 

5463
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:29,669
want to visit today. Um on on NT I have
that as a previous day value area high.

5464
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
that as a previous day value area high.
 

5465
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,430
that as a previous day value area high.
I don't know what some of you have but

5466
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:31,440
I don't know what some of you have but
 

5467
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,830
I don't know what some of you have but
that's what I've got. If I look at bring

5468
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:33,840
that's what I've got. If I look at bring
 

5469
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:37,270
that's what I've got. If I look at bring
this over right I have this as a big

5470
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:37,280
this over right I have this as a big
 

5471
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:41,030
this over right I have this as a big
level from previous day value high from

5472
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:41,040
level from previous day value high from
 

5473
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,589
level from previous day value high from
Friday. I don't have the same on Trading

5474
02:03:43,589 --> 02:03:43,599
Friday. I don't have the same on Trading
 

5475
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:45,910
Friday. I don't have the same on Trading
View. So there's a divergence or

5476
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:45,920
View. So there's a divergence or
 

5477
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:47,589
View. So there's a divergence or
discrepancy between Trading View and

5478
02:03:47,589 --> 02:03:47,599
discrepancy between Trading View and
 

5479
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:48,790
discrepancy between Trading View and
Ninja Trader. You can see at the moment

5480
02:03:48,790 --> 02:03:48,800
Ninja Trader. You can see at the moment
 

5481
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,229
Ninja Trader. You can see at the moment
we're just trading in the previous day

5482
02:03:50,229 --> 02:03:50,239
we're just trading in the previous day
 

5483
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:52,070
we're just trading in the previous day
value. No acceptance underneath, no

5484
02:03:52,070 --> 02:03:52,080
value. No acceptance underneath, no
 

5485
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:53,910
value. No acceptance underneath, no
acceptance over under previous week.

5486
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:53,920
acceptance over under previous week.
 

5487
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,750
acceptance over under previous week.
Trading inside previous day. If we find

5488
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:55,760
Trading inside previous day. If we find
 

5489
02:03:55,760 --> 02:04:00,470
Trading inside previous day. If we find
acceptance above 920, then uh 26,50s

5490
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:00,480
acceptance above 920, then uh 26,50s
 

5491
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:02,550
acceptance above 920, then uh 26,50s
is possible. And previous day high,

5492
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:02,560
is possible. And previous day high,
 

5493
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,950
is possible. And previous day high,
previous day opens up here as well. So

5494
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:04,960
previous day opens up here as well. So
 

5495
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:07,030
previous day opens up here as well. So
we just have to see folks. It's been a

5496
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:07,040
we just have to see folks. It's been a
 

5497
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,390
we just have to see folks. It's been a
big drive this morning though. I'll say

5498
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:08,400
big drive this morning though. I'll say
 

5499
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:15,430
big drive this morning though. I'll say
that much. Been a huge drive.

5500
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:15,440

 

5501
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:17,430

call it a box. Are you ever inclined to

5502
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:17,440
call it a box. Are you ever inclined to
 

5503
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,990
call it a box. Are you ever inclined to
trade this or do you solely interested

5504
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:20,000
trade this or do you solely interested
 

5505
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,510
trade this or do you solely interested
in continuation? Yeah, absolutely. I

5506
02:04:21,510 --> 02:04:21,520
in continuation? Yeah, absolutely. I
 

5507
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:24,550
in continuation? Yeah, absolutely. I
will tra I do trade it. Uh it's just not

5508
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:24,560
will tra I do trade it. Uh it's just not
 

5509
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,790
will tra I do trade it. Uh it's just not
my favorite setup, but I do trade it.

5510
02:04:26,790 --> 02:04:26,800
my favorite setup, but I do trade it.
 

5511
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:28,470
my favorite setup, but I do trade it.
Absolutely.

5512
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:28,480
Absolutely.
 

5513
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,070
Absolutely.
I don't trade it on swing positions

5514
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:30,080
I don't trade it on swing positions
 

5515
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,669
I don't trade it on swing positions
though. I will not trade the box on

5516
02:04:31,669 --> 02:04:31,679
though. I will not trade the box on
 

5517
02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:33,750
though. I will not trade the box on
swing positions. I would rather look for

5518
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
swing positions. I would rather look for
 

5519
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,510
swing positions. I would rather look for
a break and a retest on a swing

5520
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:35,520
a break and a retest on a swing
 

5521
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:42,470
a break and a retest on a swing
position.

5522
02:04:42,470 --> 02:04:42,480

 

5523
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,229

Alex, what's your win rate? You are

5524
02:04:44,229 --> 02:04:44,239
Alex, what's your win rate? You are
 

5525
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:45,910
Alex, what's your win rate? You are
break even, usually at worst. Can you

5526
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:45,920
break even, usually at worst. Can you
 

5527
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:47,750
break even, usually at worst. Can you
talk about that? You don't be humble.

5528
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:47,760
talk about that? You don't be humble.
 

5529
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,149
talk about that? You don't be humble.
You earn all you get. Um, I normally

5530
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:50,159
You earn all you get. Um, I normally
 

5531
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:52,709
You earn all you get. Um, I normally
shoot between like a 67 and 73% win

5532
02:04:52,709 --> 02:04:52,719
shoot between like a 67 and 73% win
 

5533
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:54,550
shoot between like a 67 and 73% win
rate. But like I've talked, I do say

5534
02:04:54,550 --> 02:04:54,560
rate. But like I've talked, I do say
 

5535
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:56,149
rate. But like I've talked, I do say
this a lot of time. I think that is

5536
02:04:56,149 --> 02:04:56,159
this a lot of time. I think that is
 

5537
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:59,270
this a lot of time. I think that is
probably skewed. Why? Because I am day

5538
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
probably skewed. Why? Because I am day
 

5539
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,589
probably skewed. Why? Because I am day
trading happy to move my stop break even

5540
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:01,599
trading happy to move my stop break even
 

5541
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:04,950
trading happy to move my stop break even
or break even plus one. So even those

5542
02:05:04,950 --> 02:05:04,960
or break even plus one. So even those
 

5543
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:07,750
or break even plus one. So even those
trades which have let's call it positive

5544
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:07,760
trades which have let's call it positive
 

5545
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:11,669
trades which have let's call it positive
delta in terms of win rate

5546
02:05:11,669 --> 02:05:11,679
delta in terms of win rate
 

5547
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:13,510
delta in terms of win rate
they're really flat trades aren't they

5548
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,520
they're really flat trades aren't they
 

5549
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,229
they're really flat trades aren't they
right? So I could do I could have a a

5550
02:05:16,229 --> 02:05:16,239
right? So I could do I could have a a
 

5551
02:05:16,239 --> 02:05:18,229
right? So I could do I could have a a
one tick positive one tick positive 100

5552
02:05:18,229 --> 02:05:18,239
one tick positive one tick positive 100
 

5553
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:20,070
one tick positive one tick positive 100
times and it would have 100% win rate

5554
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:20,080
times and it would have 100% win rate
 

5555
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:21,750
times and it would have 100% win rate
but the reality is it's a break even

5556
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:21,760
but the reality is it's a break even
 

5557
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,830
but the reality is it's a break even
trade. So sometimes I think those are a

5558
02:05:23,830 --> 02:05:23,840
trade. So sometimes I think those are a
 

5559
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,669
trade. So sometimes I think those are a
little bit skewed. I'll be honest.

5560
02:05:25,669 --> 02:05:25,679
little bit skewed. I'll be honest.
 

5561
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:27,589
little bit skewed. I'll be honest.
You'll see me on stream take a lot of

5562
02:05:27,589 --> 02:05:27,599
You'll see me on stream take a lot of
 

5563
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:31,109
You'll see me on stream take a lot of
break evens um before I get the move.

5564
02:05:31,109 --> 02:05:31,119
break evens um before I get the move.
 

5565
02:05:31,119 --> 02:05:32,070
break evens um before I get the move.
Sometimes I don't get the move.

5566
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:32,080
Sometimes I don't get the move.
 

5567
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:33,350
Sometimes I don't get the move.
Sometimes it goes without me like

5568
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:33,360
Sometimes it goes without me like
 

5569
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:35,990
Sometimes it goes without me like
Friday. All right, back to gray box. So

5570
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:36,000
Friday. All right, back to gray box. So
 

5571
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,990
Friday. All right, back to gray box. So
gray box to gray box if they reclaim

5572
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:38,000
gray box to gray box if they reclaim
 

5573
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,990
gray box to gray box if they reclaim
this. So this is 61 fib hold. They

5574
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:40,000
this. So this is 61 fib hold. They
 

5575
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,669
this. So this is 61 fib hold. They
reclaimed. We go back to gray box

5576
02:05:41,669 --> 02:05:41,679
reclaimed. We go back to gray box
 

5577
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:43,189
reclaimed. We go back to gray box
through this. If they get acceptance

5578
02:05:43,189 --> 02:05:43,199
through this. If they get acceptance
 

5579
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:44,950
through this. If they get acceptance
over 75s, they're going to come up here

5580
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:44,960
over 75s, they're going to come up here
 

5581
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,950
over 75s, they're going to come up here
for the 900s.

5582
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:46,960
for the 900s.
 

5583
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,870
for the 900s.
So this can be a big bullish play. This

5584
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:48,880
So this can be a big bullish play. This
 

5585
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,390
So this can be a big bullish play. This
can be a two-leg pullback. All right,

5586
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:50,400
can be a two-leg pullback. All right,
 

5587
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,830
can be a two-leg pullback. All right,
this is what we're looking like at the

5588
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:51,840
this is what we're looking like at the
 

5589
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,270
this is what we're looking like at the
moment. I would say sort of something

5590
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:53,280
moment. I would say sort of something
 

5591
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,270
moment. I would say sort of something
like this. All right, and then they have

5592
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:55,280
like this. All right, and then they have
 

5593
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,790
like this. All right, and then they have
to decide, are you going to reject this

5594
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:56,800
to decide, are you going to reject this
 

5595
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,790
to decide, are you going to reject this
down or they going to do this move here

5596
02:05:58,790 --> 02:05:58,800
down or they going to do this move here
 

5597
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:05,189
down or they going to do this move here
for the continuation?

5598
02:06:05,189 --> 02:06:05,199

 

5599
02:06:05,199 --> 02:06:06,709

Yeah, I hope that makes sense on the win

5600
02:06:06,709 --> 02:06:06,719
Yeah, I hope that makes sense on the win
 

5601
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:08,790
Yeah, I hope that makes sense on the win
rate. So, I'm just being honest with you

5602
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:08,800
rate. So, I'm just being honest with you
 

5603
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,070
rate. So, I'm just being honest with you
because I don't want you to think, oh,

5604
02:06:10,070 --> 02:06:10,080
because I don't want you to think, oh,
 

5605
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:13,990
because I don't want you to think, oh,
like 67% of the time I get a 100 or 200

5606
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:14,000
like 67% of the time I get a 100 or 200
 

5607
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,390
like 67% of the time I get a 100 or 200
point trade. That's just not the case.

5608
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:16,400
point trade. That's just not the case.
 

5609
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,270
point trade. That's just not the case.
Uh what it means to me is I don't lose

5610
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:19,280
Uh what it means to me is I don't lose
 

5611
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:21,430
Uh what it means to me is I don't lose
67% of the time. I kind of see it the

5612
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:21,440
67% of the time. I kind of see it the
 

5613
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,790
67% of the time. I kind of see it the
other way. I don't trade gold. I take

5614
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:22,800
other way. I don't trade gold. I take
 

5615
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,870
other way. I don't trade gold. I take
swim positions. I'm waiting to see if we

5616
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:24,880
swim positions. I'm waiting to see if we
 

5617
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,189
swim positions. I'm waiting to see if we
see failed followthrough at the moment.

5618
02:06:27,189 --> 02:06:27,199
see failed followthrough at the moment.
 

5619
02:06:27,199 --> 02:06:28,550
see failed followthrough at the moment.
I can show you what I'd like to see on

5620
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:28,560
I can show you what I'd like to see on
 

5621
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,950
I can show you what I'd like to see on
gold and silver if you're interested on

5622
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:30,960
gold and silver if you're interested on
 

5623
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:33,270
gold and silver if you're interested on
swing positions. Right? One I want to

5624
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:33,280
swing positions. Right? One I want to
 

5625
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:35,990
swing positions. Right? One I want to
see

5626
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:36,000
see
 

5627
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,629
see
is a pullback. Right? If I'm going to

5628
02:06:38,629 --> 02:06:38,639
is a pullback. Right? If I'm going to
 

5629
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:40,390
is a pullback. Right? If I'm going to
really think about the short, I want to

5630
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:40,400
really think about the short, I want to
 

5631
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:43,189
really think about the short, I want to
see a pullback somewhere into here. And

5632
02:06:43,189 --> 02:06:43,199
see a pullback somewhere into here. And
 

5633
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:45,990
see a pullback somewhere into here. And
I want to see buyers get stuck and then

5634
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,000
I want to see buyers get stuck and then
 

5635
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,109
I want to see buyers get stuck and then
I'm going to take an ETF short position.

5636
02:06:49,109 --> 02:06:49,119
I'm going to take an ETF short position.
 

5637
02:06:49,119 --> 02:06:50,709
I'm going to take an ETF short position.
If they get stuck, if we leave these

5638
02:06:50,709 --> 02:06:50,719
If they get stuck, if we leave these
 

5639
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:52,149
If they get stuck, if we leave these
buyers stuck, I'm going to take a

5640
02:06:52,149 --> 02:06:52,159
buyers stuck, I'm going to take a
 

5641
02:06:52,159 --> 02:06:53,830
buyers stuck, I'm going to take a
position down to here. I'm going to trim

5642
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:53,840
position down to here. I'm going to trim
 

5643
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,510
position down to here. I'm going to trim
a big piece of it. Then I'm just going

5644
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:55,520
a big piece of it. Then I'm just going
 

5645
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,270
a big piece of it. Then I'm just going
to see if the market wants to drift

5646
02:06:57,270 --> 02:06:57,280
to see if the market wants to drift
 

5647
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:00,149
to see if the market wants to drift
lower. Macro-wise, it can very well bid

5648
02:07:00,149 --> 02:07:00,159
lower. Macro-wise, it can very well bid
 

5649
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:02,310
lower. Macro-wise, it can very well bid
up, right? Macro environment, weak might

5650
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:02,320
up, right? Macro environment, weak might
 

5651
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,069
up, right? Macro environment, weak might
very well do this. By the moment, the

5652
02:07:04,069 --> 02:07:04,079
very well do this. By the moment, the
 

5653
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:05,589
very well do this. By the moment, the
dollar is getting stronger, which means

5654
02:07:05,589 --> 02:07:05,599
dollar is getting stronger, which means
 

5655
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:07,350
dollar is getting stronger, which means
we might rotate back out of this. A lot

5656
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:07,360
we might rotate back out of this. A lot
 

5657
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:08,950
we might rotate back out of this. A lot
of this depends on what the Asian

5658
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:08,960
of this depends on what the Asian
 

5659
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:11,030
of this depends on what the Asian
markets do. Understand the macro

5660
02:07:11,030 --> 02:07:11,040
markets do. Understand the macro
 

5661
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:14,390
markets do. Understand the macro
environment.

5662
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:14,400

 

5663
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:15,669

I'm not going to day trade gold and

5664
02:07:15,669 --> 02:07:15,679
I'm not going to day trade gold and
 

5665
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:17,669
I'm not going to day trade gold and
silver, but I will look for some swing

5666
02:07:17,669 --> 02:07:17,679
silver, but I will look for some swing
 

5667
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:27,990
silver, but I will look for some swing
positions if it makes sense to me.

5668
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,000

 

5669
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,830

What does the Ninja Footprint indicate

5670
02:07:29,830 --> 02:07:29,840
What does the Ninja Footprint indicate
 

5671
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:30,870
What does the Ninja Footprint indicate
cost? I can't remember. I think it's

5672
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:30,880
cost? I can't remember. I think it's
 

5673
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:33,350
cost? I can't remember. I think it's
like three or 400 bucks,

5674
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:33,360
like three or 400 bucks,
 

5675
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,910
like three or 400 bucks,
something like that.

5676
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:35,920
something like that.
 

5677
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:40,310
something like that.
Um

5678
02:07:40,310 --> 02:07:40,320

 

5679
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:42,229

I think I've got like a five or a 10%

5680
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:42,239
I think I've got like a five or a 10%
 

5681
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:45,750
I think I've got like a five or a 10%
discount code. It's tiny.

5682
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:45,760
discount code. It's tiny.
 

5683
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:48,550
discount code. It's tiny.
Uh it's from Twin Peak. So, let me Where

5684
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:48,560
Uh it's from Twin Peak. So, let me Where
 

5685
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,669
Uh it's from Twin Peak. So, let me Where
are you guys again?

5686
02:07:51,669 --> 02:07:51,679

5687
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:53,669
are you guys again?
That's it there. I just posted if you

5688
02:07:53,669 --> 02:07:53,679
That's it there. I just posted if you
 

5689
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:57,750
That's it there. I just posted if you
want that one.

5690
02:07:57,750 --> 02:07:57,760

 

5691
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:00,310

Do I find affordable indicateators is

5692
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:00,320
Do I find affordable indicateators is
 

5693
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:03,270
Do I find affordable indicateators is
responsive? Yes, very.

5694
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:03,280
responsive? Yes, very.
 

5695
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:05,030
responsive? Yes, very.
Well, the thing is if you're using trade

5696
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:05,040
Well, the thing is if you're using trade
 

5697
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:06,629
Well, the thing is if you're using trade
syncer or stuff like that, you're asking

5698
02:08:06,629 --> 02:08:06,639
syncer or stuff like that, you're asking
 

5699
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:08,950
syncer or stuff like that, you're asking
for lag because it has to go via a

5700
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:08,960
for lag because it has to go via a
 

5701
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,870
for lag because it has to go via a
web-based platform. I think that's

5702
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:10,880
web-based platform. I think that's
 

5703
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:15,910
web-based platform. I think that's
that's the problem.

5704
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:15,920

 

5705
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:18,149

Uh currency flipper. Yeah. So, the pro

5706
02:08:18,149 --> 02:08:18,159
Uh currency flipper. Yeah. So, the pro
 

5707
02:08:18,159 --> 02:08:20,550
Uh currency flipper. Yeah. So, the pro
is what I'm using here. The Pro is like

5708
02:08:20,550 --> 02:08:20,560
is what I'm using here. The Pro is like
 

5709
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:22,390
is what I'm using here. The Pro is like
the upgrade. So, with the Pro, you get

5710
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:22,400
the upgrade. So, with the Pro, you get
 

5711
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,950
the upgrade. So, with the Pro, you get
like uh GlobeEx, opening range,

5712
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:26,960
like uh GlobeEx, opening range,
 

5713
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,870
like uh GlobeEx, opening range,
um I'm trying to think what else is the

5714
02:08:28,870 --> 02:08:28,880
um I'm trying to think what else is the
 

5715
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,109
um I'm trying to think what else is the
difference. There's basically just a few

5716
02:08:31,109 --> 02:08:31,119
difference. There's basically just a few
 

5717
02:08:31,119 --> 02:08:33,189
difference. There's basically just a few
more levels in the Pro Indicator. Oh,

5718
02:08:33,189 --> 02:08:33,199
more levels in the Pro Indicator. Oh,
 

5719
02:08:33,199 --> 02:08:35,430
more levels in the Pro Indicator. Oh,
and the candle repaint as well. Candle

5720
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:35,440
and the candle repaint as well. Candle
 

5721
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,189
and the candle repaint as well. Candle
repaint, which you don't get in the one

5722
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:37,199
repaint, which you don't get in the one
 

5723
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:38,470
repaint, which you don't get in the one
that comes with the course, but you

5724
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:38,480
that comes with the course, but you
 

5725
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:39,669
that comes with the course, but you
don't have to upgrade. You can always

5726
02:08:39,669 --> 02:08:39,679
don't have to upgrade. You can always
 

5727
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:41,910
don't have to upgrade. You can always
upgrade upgrade later. But the one in

5728
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:41,920
upgrade upgrade later. But the one in
 

5729
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,910
upgrade upgrade later. But the one in
the course is still sufficient. It still

5730
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:43,920
the course is still sufficient. It still
 

5731
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:51,669
the course is still sufficient. It still
works very, very well.

5732
02:08:51,669 --> 02:08:51,679

 

5733
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:54,310

I prefer Me personally, Miles, I prefer

5734
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:54,320
I prefer Me personally, Miles, I prefer
 

5735
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:56,069
I prefer Me personally, Miles, I prefer
Delta for Footprint. I don't I don't

5736
02:08:56,069 --> 02:08:56,079
Delta for Footprint. I don't I don't
 

5737
02:08:56,079 --> 02:08:58,149
Delta for Footprint. I don't I don't
watch bid ask. Me personally, I prefer

5738
02:08:58,149 --> 02:08:58,159
watch bid ask. Me personally, I prefer
 

5739
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:01,510
watch bid ask. Me personally, I prefer
Delta. All I really ever care about if

5740
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,520
Delta. All I really ever care about if
 

5741
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,669
Delta. All I really ever care about if
I'm looking for a trap player is delta.

5742
02:09:03,669 --> 02:09:03,679
I'm looking for a trap player is delta.
 

5743
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:05,030
I'm looking for a trap player is delta.
All right. So, if this pullback now

5744
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:05,040
All right. So, if this pullback now
 

5745
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:06,870
All right. So, if this pullback now
holds this, we talk about this next

5746
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:06,880
holds this, we talk about this next
 

5747
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:09,589
holds this, we talk about this next
rotation. So, if the pullbacks now now

5748
02:09:09,589 --> 02:09:09,599
rotation. So, if the pullbacks now now
 

5749
02:09:09,599 --> 02:09:11,350
rotation. So, if the pullbacks now now
hold this, they're going to try and get

5750
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:11,360
hold this, they're going to try and get
 

5751
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,030
hold this, they're going to try and get
up to here, aren't they? If they fail

5752
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:13,040
up to here, aren't they? If they fail
 

5753
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:14,629
up to here, aren't they? If they fail
this, this is a look above to take the

5754
02:09:14,629 --> 02:09:14,639
this, this is a look above to take the
 

5755
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:17,189
this, this is a look above to take the
stops and this becomes possible. This is

5756
02:09:17,189 --> 02:09:17,199
stops and this becomes possible. This is
 

5757
02:09:17,199 --> 02:09:19,750
stops and this becomes possible. This is
why the shelves matter. But overall,

5758
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:19,760
why the shelves matter. But overall,
 

5759
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,910
why the shelves matter. But overall,
we're bullish. We talked about this,

5760
02:09:21,910 --> 02:09:21,920
we're bullish. We talked about this,
 

5761
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:24,390
we're bullish. We talked about this,
right? Held this starting to reclaim.

5762
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:24,400
right? Held this starting to reclaim.
 

5763
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,390
right? Held this starting to reclaim.
This can be a rotation. And if they get

5764
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:26,400
This can be a rotation. And if they get
 

5765
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,550
This can be a rotation. And if they get
through this, then we'll leave all these

5766
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:28,560
through this, then we'll leave all these
 

5767
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:31,030
through this, then we'll leave all these
sellers trapped. If they fail this, then

5768
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:31,040
sellers trapped. If they fail this, then
 

5769
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:39,589
sellers trapped. If they fail this, then
this can rotate back down to here.

5770
02:09:39,589 --> 02:09:39,599

 

5771
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:42,390

Is my preference lower in rate?

5772
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:42,400
Is my preference lower in rate?
 

5773
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:47,830
Is my preference lower in rate?
higher RR. Yeah, that's my for me for me

5774
02:09:47,830 --> 02:09:47,840
higher RR. Yeah, that's my for me for me
 

5775
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:49,910
higher RR. Yeah, that's my for me for me
basically yes is the answer to that

5776
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:49,920
basically yes is the answer to that
 

5777
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:52,790
basically yes is the answer to that
Dave. Even though I show a high win rate

5778
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:52,800
Dave. Even though I show a high win rate
 

5779
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:55,430
Dave. Even though I show a high win rate
um like I talk about

5780
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:55,440
um like I talk about
 

5781
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,510
um like I talk about
a lot of those are break evens but if

5782
02:09:57,510 --> 02:09:57,520
a lot of those are break evens but if
 

5783
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,030
a lot of those are break evens but if
you joined me on stream last week you

5784
02:09:59,030 --> 02:09:59,040
you joined me on stream last week you
 

5785
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:02,790
you joined me on stream last week you
would have seen we had multiple 100 250

5786
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:02,800
would have seen we had multiple 100 250
 

5787
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,669
would have seen we had multiple 100 250
point trades together. So but we will

5788
02:10:05,669 --> 02:10:05,679
point trades together. So but we will
 

5789
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:07,430
point trades together. So but we will
only get that when the market conditions

5790
02:10:07,430 --> 02:10:07,440
only get that when the market conditions
 

5791
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,950
only get that when the market conditions
are there for it. We won't get it all

5792
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:08,960
are there for it. We won't get it all
 

5793
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:11,109
are there for it. We won't get it all
the time. somewhat surprised we've

5794
02:10:11,109 --> 02:10:11,119
the time. somewhat surprised we've
 

5795
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:19,189
the time. somewhat surprised we've
ripped as hard as we have today.

5796
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:19,199

 

5797
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:22,149

Exactly Dean. If this then that. If if

5798
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:22,159
Exactly Dean. If this then that. If if
 

5799
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:23,910
Exactly Dean. If this then that. If if
this happens then we do this. If this

5800
02:10:23,910 --> 02:10:23,920
this happens then we do this. If this
 

5801
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,510
this happens then we do this. If this
happens then we do this. That's how the

5802
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:25,520
happens then we do this. That's how the
 

5803
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:28,310
happens then we do this. That's how the
market moves. Not we do this. No such

5804
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:28,320
market moves. Not we do this. No such
 

5805
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:29,830
market moves. Not we do this. No such
thing.

5806
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:29,840
thing.
 

5807
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:31,830
thing.
Right. So holding gray. So if they keep

5808
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:31,840
Right. So holding gray. So if they keep
 

5809
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,189
Right. So holding gray. So if they keep
holding this they are going to try and

5810
02:10:33,189 --> 02:10:33,199
holding this they are going to try and
 

5811
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:35,510
holding this they are going to try and
rotate in towards these 890s. I will

5812
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:35,520
rotate in towards these 890s. I will
 

5813
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:38,149
rotate in towards these 890s. I will
tell you uh the buyer still got stuck at

5814
02:10:38,149 --> 02:10:38,159
tell you uh the buyer still got stuck at
 

5815
02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:42,069
tell you uh the buyer still got stuck at
900s. 95s is key, but 900s is where we

5816
02:10:42,069 --> 02:10:42,079
900s. 95s is key, but 900s is where we
 

5817
02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:44,149
900s. 95s is key, but 900s is where we
have like some outlying delta. Let me

5818
02:10:44,149 --> 02:10:44,159
have like some outlying delta. Let me
 

5819
02:10:44,159 --> 02:10:47,669
have like some outlying delta. Let me
have a look up here on level two.

5820
02:10:47,669 --> 02:10:47,679
have a look up here on level two.
 

5821
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:50,870
have a look up here on level two.
Where's 900? Yeah. So, you can see if

5822
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:50,880
Where's 900? Yeah. So, you can see if
 

5823
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:54,069
Where's 900? Yeah. So, you can see if
you come up to let me pull this over.

5824
02:10:54,069 --> 02:10:54,079
you come up to let me pull this over.
 

5825
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:55,910
you come up to let me pull this over.
Can I pull this over to you guys? If we

5826
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:55,920
Can I pull this over to you guys? If we
 

5827
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:57,830
Can I pull this over to you guys? If we
pull this up to 900s, you can see this

5828
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:57,840
pull this up to 900s, you can see this
 

5829
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:01,030
pull this up to 900s, you can see this
here a 380 lot and a 2998 lot. All

5830
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:01,040
here a 380 lot and a 2998 lot. All
 

5831
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:02,709
here a 380 lot and a 2998 lot. All
right, those are buyers, market buyers

5832
02:11:02,709 --> 02:11:02,719
right, those are buyers, market buyers
 

5833
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:04,470
right, those are buyers, market buyers
who got stuck up there. That's the big

5834
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:04,480
who got stuck up there. That's the big
 

5835
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:06,470
who got stuck up there. That's the big
level. Sellers will not want it above

5836
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:06,480
level. Sellers will not want it above
 

5837
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,709
level. Sellers will not want it above
that. They will want to use their pain

5838
02:11:08,709 --> 02:11:08,719
that. They will want to use their pain
 

5839
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:12,390
that. They will want to use their pain
to move lower. So 900s is a big big

5840
02:11:12,390 --> 02:11:12,400
to move lower. So 900s is a big big
 

5841
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:20,709
to move lower. So 900s is a big big
level.

5842
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,719

 

5843
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:22,709

Does trading view value high value low

5844
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:22,719
Does trading view value high value low
 

5845
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:24,149
Does trading view value high value low
point control move slightly different if

5846
02:11:24,149 --> 02:11:24,159
point control move slightly different if
 

5847
02:11:24,159 --> 02:11:26,229
point control move slightly different if
you switch from 30 to 5? Yes, it does.

5848
02:11:26,229 --> 02:11:26,239
you switch from 30 to 5? Yes, it does.
 

5849
02:11:26,239 --> 02:11:27,669
you switch from 30 to 5? Yes, it does.
It does. You want to be on the lowest

5850
02:11:27,669 --> 02:11:27,679
It does. You want to be on the lowest
 

5851
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:29,669
It does. You want to be on the lowest
time frame chart possible. Uh which is

5852
02:11:29,669 --> 02:11:29,679
time frame chart possible. Uh which is
 

5853
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:31,510
time frame chart possible. Uh which is
why I do my daily levels based on a one

5854
02:11:31,510 --> 02:11:31,520
why I do my daily levels based on a one
 

5855
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:33,830
why I do my daily levels based on a one
minute chart. This is so after today I

5856
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:33,840
minute chart. This is so after today I
 

5857
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,910
minute chart. This is so after today I
mark them out based on this. Right. But

5858
02:11:35,910 --> 02:11:35,920
mark them out based on this. Right. But
 

5859
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:37,910
mark them out based on this. Right. But
if you're looking at uh like the

5860
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:37,920
if you're looking at uh like the
 

5861
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:39,990
if you're looking at uh like the
weeklies, yes, I do it on the hourly or

5862
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:40,000
weeklies, yes, I do it on the hourly or
 

5863
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,430
weeklies, yes, I do it on the hourly or
30 minutes. Sometimes it's probably a

5864
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:41,440
30 minutes. Sometimes it's probably a
 

5865
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:42,470
30 minutes. Sometimes it's probably a
little bit off, but it's there or

5866
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:42,480
little bit off, but it's there or
 

5867
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:44,870
little bit off, but it's there or
thereabouts.

5868
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:44,880
thereabouts.
 

5869
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:46,390
thereabouts.
The same as you, I take multiple break

5870
02:11:46,390 --> 02:11:46,400
The same as you, I take multiple break
 

5871
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:47,910
The same as you, I take multiple break
even trades, but then I get three or

5872
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:47,920
even trades, but then I get three or
 

5873
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:49,750
even trades, but then I get three or
four R and have no issue taking profits

5874
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:49,760
four R and have no issue taking profits
 

5875
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:51,189
four R and have no issue taking profits
one to one slightly more. There you go.

5876
02:11:51,189 --> 02:11:51,199
one to one slightly more. There you go.
 

5877
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:53,030
one to one slightly more. There you go.
Exactly. I think that's the best way to

5878
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:53,040
Exactly. I think that's the best way to
 

5879
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,550
Exactly. I think that's the best way to
do it. For me personally, that's how I

5880
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:54,560
do it. For me personally, that's how I
 

5881
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:56,229
do it. For me personally, that's how I
like to manage my trades. I don't want

5882
02:11:56,229 --> 02:11:56,239
like to manage my trades. I don't want
 

5883
02:11:56,239 --> 02:11:58,229
like to manage my trades. I don't want
to look for

5884
02:11:58,229 --> 02:11:58,239
to look for
 

5885
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:01,830
to look for
no these traders who look for 20 ticks

5886
02:12:01,830 --> 02:12:01,840
no these traders who look for 20 ticks
 

5887
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,910
no these traders who look for 20 ticks
or like three or five points. Like I

5888
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:03,920
or like three or five points. Like I
 

5889
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:06,870
or like three or five points. Like I
just I It's too stressful, man. It's too

5890
02:12:06,870 --> 02:12:06,880
just I It's too stressful, man. It's too
 

5891
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:16,149
just I It's too stressful, man. It's too
stressful.

5892
02:12:16,149 --> 02:12:16,159

 

5893
02:12:16,159 --> 02:12:18,950

How apt are you to trade back into a

5894
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:18,960
How apt are you to trade back into a
 

5895
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,390
How apt are you to trade back into a
fair value gap when it presents

5896
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:20,400
fair value gap when it presents
 

5897
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,069
fair value gap when it presents
immediately? I mean, I don't trade fair

5898
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:22,079
immediately? I mean, I don't trade fair
 

5899
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:26,390
immediately? I mean, I don't trade fair
value gaps, so

5900
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:26,400

 

5901
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:31,430

So that's not what I do.

5902
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:31,440

 

5903
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,030

Did I take the trade today? Yeah, the

5913
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,189
remember where it was now. I have to
look on my screen. One of these shorts.

02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:49,830

Waiting to see if there's another setup.

5918
02:12:49,830 --> 02:12:49,840
Waiting to see if there's another setup.
 

5919
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:51,270
Waiting to see if there's another setup.
Right, while this sets up, let me use

5929
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:07,189

So start holding this gray box. We just

5930
02:13:07,189 --> 02:13:07,199
So start holding this gray box. We just
 

5931
02:13:07,199 --> 02:13:08,310
So start holding this gray box. We just

02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:12,149
wanted to be long this gray box after
this buy signal, you're looking for this

5936
02:13:12,149 --> 02:13:12,159
this buy signal, you're looking for this
 

5937
02:13:12,159 --> 02:13:14,310
this buy signal, you're looking for this
move into here. Like I talked about 900

5938
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:14,320
move into here. Like I talked about 900
 

5939
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:16,550
move into here. Like I talked about 900
is a big big big level where the buyers

5940
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:16,560
is a big big big level where the buyers
 

5941
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:18,470
is a big big big level where the buyers
got stuck over 900. We can see a

5942
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:18,480
got stuck over 900. We can see a
 

5943
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,550
got stuck over 900. We can see a
squeeze. 920s will be your target over

5944
02:13:20,550 --> 02:13:20,560
squeeze. 920s will be your target over
 

5945
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:22,470
squeeze. 920s will be your target over
900. Here's the 900 lot. Right. So,

5946
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
900. Here's the 900 lot. Right. So,
 

5947
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:24,629
900. Here's the 900 lot. Right. So,
we're coming into 900. Now, this is

5948
02:13:24,629 --> 02:13:24,639
we're coming into 900. Now, this is
 

5949
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:26,390
we're coming into 900. Now, this is
where the buyer got stuck. We talked

5950
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:26,400
where the buyer got stuck. We talked
 

5951
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,310
where the buyer got stuck. We talked
about him being stuck. We talked about

5952
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:28,320
about him being stuck. We talked about
 

5953
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:31,109
about him being stuck. We talked about
this player up here being stuck right

5954
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:31,119
this player up here being stuck right
 

5955
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:32,950
this player up here being stuck right
here. This blue line. You see this blue

5956
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:32,960
here. This blue line. You see this blue
 

5957
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,229
here. This blue line. You see this blue
line? This is the player that's stuck.

5958
02:13:34,229 --> 02:13:34,239
line? This is the player that's stuck.
 

5959
02:13:34,239 --> 02:13:36,229
line? This is the player that's stuck.
If you get above him, we can think about

5960
02:13:36,229 --> 02:13:36,239
If you get above him, we can think about
 

5961
02:13:36,239 --> 02:13:38,709
If you get above him, we can think about
920 all the way up here. But 920 is a

5962
02:13:38,709 --> 02:13:38,719
920 all the way up here. But 920 is a
 

5963
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:41,030
920 all the way up here. But 920 is a
big level that shorts will not want this

5964
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:41,040
big level that shorts will not want this
 

5965
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:42,390
big level that shorts will not want this
market to trade through. All right, I

5966
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:42,400
market to trade through. All right, I
 

5967
02:13:42,400 --> 02:16:02,390
market to trade through. All right, I
will be right back. Let me use the bar.

5968
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400

 

5969
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:03,669

All right. So, you can see that player

5970
02:16:03,669 --> 02:16:03,679
All right. So, you can see that player
 

5971
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:05,990
All right. So, you can see that player
at 900 still holding the market up. So,

5972
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:06,000
at 900 still holding the market up. So,
 

5973
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,990
at 900 still holding the market up. So,
he got break even on that push up back

5974
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:08,000
he got break even on that push up back
 

5975
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,669
he got break even on that push up back
down to gray box. So, gray box to gray

5976
02:16:09,669 --> 02:16:09,679
down to gray box. So, gray box to gray
 

5977
02:16:09,679 --> 02:16:22,310
down to gray box. So, gray box to gray
box rotation again.

adamant on using it. It's just this gap,
 

6021
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:01,830
adamant on using it. It's just this gap,
right? It's between two candles.

6022
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:01,840
right? It's between two candles.
 

6023
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:04,790
right? It's between two candles.
It's not how I trade, but there is

6024
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:04,800
It's not how I trade, but there is
 

6025

actually an imbalance in this one. All
 

6027
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:07,429
actually an imbalance in this one. All
right. So, it's a three candle

6028

right. So, it's a three candle
 

6029
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:09,509
right. So, it's a three candle
structure. That's all an it's all a fair

02:18:09,509 --> 02:18:09,519
structure. That's all an it's all a fair
 

6031

value gap is. When do they work best?

6032
02:18:12,309 --> 02:18:12,319
value gap is. When do they work best?
 

6033
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:13,910
value gap is. When do they work best?
When you've seen a squeeze. You see this

engulfing candle, second candle. It's
 

6039
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,270
engulfing candle, second candle. It's
the imbalance left between the two.

6040
02:18:21,270 --> 02:18:21,280
the imbalance left between the two.
 

6041
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:22,950
the imbalance left between the two.
There was a genuine imbalance in this

6045
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:27,030
one. So, we're What does it mean is the
other way of putting it. If we've

6046
02:18:27,030 --> 02:18:27,040
other way of putting it. If we've
 

6047
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,750

day.

6122
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:17,520

 

6123
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:18,870

You're in short. Do I think you should

6124
02:20:18,870 --> 02:20:18,880
You're in short. Do I think you should
 

6125
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:20,790
You're in short. Do I think you should
hold this trade? Probably not. Well, I

6126
02:20:20,790 --> 02:20:20,800
hold this trade? Probably not. Well, I
 

6127
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:22,150
hold this trade? Probably not. Well, I
don't know where you're short from for a

6128
02:20:22,150 --> 02:20:22,160
don't know where you're short from for a
 

6129
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:29,429
don't know where you're short from for a
start.

6130
02:20:29,429 --> 02:20:29,439

 

6131
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:31,270

We're starting to build quite a big

6132
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:31,280
We're starting to build quite a big
 

6133
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,030
We're starting to build quite a big
P-shape here. I think about the profile.

6134
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,040
P-shape here. I think about the profile.
 

6135
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:38,630
P-shape here. I think about the profile.
Building a huge P-shape is very bullish.

6136
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:38,640
Building a huge P-shape is very bullish.
 

6137
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:40,870
Building a huge P-shape is very bullish.
Where do I think it wants to go? 920 and

6138
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:40,880
Where do I think it wants to go? 920 and
 

6139
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:43,030
Where do I think it wants to go? 920 and
then up into these if it can. If we

6140
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:43,040
then up into these if it can. If we
 

6141
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:44,710
then up into these if it can. If we
can't get above the 900s, it would be a

6142
02:20:44,710 --> 02:20:44,720
can't get above the 900s, it would be a
 

6143
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:47,349
can't get above the 900s, it would be a
fail break, but I wouldn't be shorting

6144
02:20:47,349 --> 02:20:47,359
fail break, but I wouldn't be shorting
 

6145
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:49,990
fail break, but I wouldn't be shorting
up into this. I'd be waiting to see if

6146
02:20:49,990 --> 02:20:50,000
up into this. I'd be waiting to see if
 

6147
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,469
up into this. I'd be waiting to see if
it fails and then leaves players

6148
02:20:52,469 --> 02:20:52,479
it fails and then leaves players
 

6149
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:54,230
it fails and then leaves players
trapped. At the moment, it's not leaving

6150
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:54,240
trapped. At the moment, it's not leaving
 

6151
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:56,150
trapped. At the moment, it's not leaving
players trapped, is it? The counter

6152
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:56,160
players trapped, is it? The counter
 

6153
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:57,590
players trapped, is it? The counter
trend leg we tal about. There's the

6154
02:20:57,590 --> 02:20:57,600
trend leg we tal about. There's the
 

6155
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:59,750
trend leg we tal about. There's the
counter trend leg. Held the pivot.

6156
02:20:59,750 --> 02:20:59,760
counter trend leg. Held the pivot.
 

6157

Remember that was a 61 fib from here to

6158
02:21:02,150 --> 02:21:02,160
Remember that was a 61 fib from here to
 

6159
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:04,230
Remember that was a 61 fib from here to
here, right? And they're buying this and

6160
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:04,240
here, right? And they're buying this and
 

6161
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:05,670
here, right? And they're buying this and
they're trying to do that inverted head

6162
02:21:05,670 --> 02:21:05,680
they're trying to do that inverted head
 

6163
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,030
they're trying to do that inverted head
and shoulders. Look for that squeeze

6164
02:21:07,030 --> 02:21:07,040
and shoulders. Look for that squeeze
 

6165
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:08,230
and shoulders. Look for that squeeze
out. If they're going to do a squeeze

6166
02:21:08,230 --> 02:21:08,240
out. If they're going to do a squeeze
 

6167
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:11,110
out. If they're going to do a squeeze
out, we can measure this

6168
02:21:11,110 --> 02:21:11,120
out, we can measure this
 

6169
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:12,630
out, we can measure this
to see where they could possibly go to

6170
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:12,640
to see where they could possibly go to
 

6171
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,630
to see where they could possibly go to
and if it lines up with 920 or one of

6172
02:21:14,630 --> 02:21:14,640
and if it lines up with 920 or one of
 

6173

Can we expect more downside? Um,

Can we expect more downside? Um,
 

6251
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:12,550
Can we expect more downside? Um,
it is possible, but uh let me just

6252
02:23:12,550 --> 02:23:12,560
it is possible, but uh let me just
 

6253
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:19,990
it is possible, but uh let me just
measure this on a daily.

6254
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:20,000

 

6255
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,230

All right, so we're not in uh let me let

6260
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:27,680
All right, so we're not in uh let me let
 

6261
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:30,230
All right, so we're not in uh let me let
me take you over here. One thing I'm

6262
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:30,240
me take you over here. One thing I'm
 

6263
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:32,150
me take you over here. One thing I'm
aware of just right now, obviously we're

6264
02:23:32,150 --> 02:23:32,160
aware of just right now, obviously we're
 

6265
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:34,230
aware of just right now, obviously we're
coming into this shelf, is this from

coming into this shelf, is this from
 

6267
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:35,990

last week's high week to the current low
 

6269
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,830
last week's high week to the current low
of day, right? We're trading right into

02:23:37,830 --> 02:23:37,840
of day, right? We're trading right into
 

6271
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:40,710
of day, right? We're trading right into
the 618. Is downside possible? It is. Is

6272
02:23:40,710 --> 02:23:40,720
the 618. Is downside possible? It is. Is
 

6273
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:43,030
the 618. Is downside possible? It is. Is
upside possible? It is. Why do I not

6274
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:43,040
upside possible? It is. Why do I not
 

6275
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:44,630
upside possible? It is. Why do I not
have a bias? Because we're boxed in. All

At the moment on the day, we're very

into a big level. I wouldn't want to be
 

6299
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:09,030
into a big level. I wouldn't want to be
a buyer up here. Um but it's got to get

Even if we're thinking about here on
 

6317
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:37,670
Even if we're thinking about here on
like a five minute,

6318
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:37,680

right? You're going to need to see
something like a drive up where you have

6322
02:24:42,870 --> 02:24:42,880
something like a drive up where you have
 

6323
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:45,590
something like a drive up where you have
uh market buyers, whether they be

breakout buyers or stops popped. And
 

6327
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,349
breakout buyers or stops popped. And
then you're going to need to see this

02:24:49,349 --> 02:24:49,359
then you're going to need to see this
 

6329
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:52,230
then you're going to need to see this
liquidity here left for that trade

6330
02:24:52,230 --> 02:24:52,240
liquidity here left for that trade
 

6331
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:54,550
liquidity here left for that trade
downside. Until that point, you're not

6343
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:04,630
into here.
But if you see a failed breakout and

6344
02:25:04,630 --> 02:25:04,640
But if you see a failed breakout and
 

6345
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:06,309
But if you see a failed breakout and
then we leave a shelf, we leave the

02:25:06,309 --> 02:25:06,319
then we leave a shelf, we leave the
 

6347
02:25:06,319 --> 02:25:08,070
then we leave a shelf, we leave the
shelf, then maybe you get this move,

6348
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:08,080
shelf, then maybe you get this move,
 

6349
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:09,349

we just tapped into that trap bar at 900

6366
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:24,000
we just tapped into that trap bar at 900
 

6367
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,910
we just tapped into that trap bar at 900
again. All right, so that big delta that

6368
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:25,920
again. All right, so that big delta that
 

6369
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:27,270
again. All right, so that big delta that
we've talked about, you can even see it

6370
02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:27,280
we've talked about, you can even see it
 

6371
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:29,510
we've talked about, you can even see it
on bookmap. We drove right into his

6372
02:25:29,510 --> 02:25:29,520
on bookmap. We drove right into his
 

6373
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:31,270
on bookmap. We drove right into his
level

6374
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:31,280
level
 

6375
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:33,990
level
uh right here into the 900 and we've

again. So if we come up here on the left
 

6381
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:40,230
again. So if we come up here on the left
hand side you can see 379 lot and a 377

lot with huge amount of transactions but
 

6385
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:46,230
lot with huge amount of transactions but

02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:09,750
delta break that old low. We're not
breaking this old low.

6590
02:32:09,750 --> 02:32:09,760
breaking this old low.
 

6591
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:11,349
breaking this old low.
It looks the same to me. There's a lower

6592
02:32:11,349 --> 02:32:11,359
It looks the same to me. There's a lower
 

6593
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:12,870
It looks the same to me. There's a lower
high. We haven't broken out. It's It's

6594
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:12,880
high. We haven't broken out. It's It's
 

6595
02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:14,870
high. We haven't broken out. It's It's
there or thereabouts. There's no huge

6596
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:14,880
there or thereabouts. There's no huge
 

6597
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:17,670
there or thereabouts. There's no huge
divergence yet in my mind on Delta.

6598
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:17,680
divergence yet in my mind on Delta.
 

6599
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:20,309
divergence yet in my mind on Delta.
Thanks for joining. Thanks for joining

6600
02:32:20,309 --> 02:32:20,319
Thanks for joining. Thanks for joining
 

6601
02:32:20,319 --> 02:32:26,469
Thanks for joining. Thanks for joining
all the new members. Fantastic.

6602
02:32:26,469 --> 02:32:26,479

 

6603
02:32:26,479 --> 02:32:29,429

And we drive back up towards uh this

6604
02:32:29,429 --> 02:32:29,439
And we drive back up towards uh this
 

6605
02:32:29,439 --> 02:32:31,190
And we drive back up towards uh this
next gray box again. And again, they're

6606
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:31,200
next gray box again. And again, they're
 

6607
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,790
next gray box again. And again, they're
going to try and get through the 900s.

6608
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:32,800
going to try and get through the 900s.
 

6609
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:34,950
going to try and get through the 900s.
That's where they need to get through.

6610
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:34,960
That's where they need to get through.
 

6611
02:32:34,960 --> 02:32:36,710
That's where they need to get through.
If they can't get through the 900s, they

6612
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:36,720
If they can't get through the 900s, they
 

6613
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:39,110
If they can't get through the 900s, they
will continue to be stuck up there. The

6614
02:32:39,110 --> 02:32:39,120
will continue to be stuck up there. The
 

6615
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:43,590
will continue to be stuck up there. The
uh buyers

6616
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:43,600

 

6617
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:46,469

is underneath previous day low. Kind of

6618
02:32:46,469 --> 02:32:46,479
is underneath previous day low. Kind of
 

6619
02:32:46,479 --> 02:32:48,550
is underneath previous day low. Kind of
messy at the moment. Do I trade every

6620
02:32:48,550 --> 02:32:48,560
messy at the moment. Do I trade every
 

6621
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:51,429
messy at the moment. Do I trade every
day? Yeah, I do. Monday to Friday, 9:15

6622
02:32:51,429 --> 02:32:51,439
day? Yeah, I do. Monday to Friday, 9:15
 

6623
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:59,750
day? Yeah, I do. Monday to Friday, 9:15
Eastern. all the way into lunch.

6624
02:32:59,750 --> 02:32:59,760

 

6625
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:06,150

Am I a male or female?

6626
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,160

 

6627
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:08,790

[\h__\h] incredible.

6628
02:33:08,790 --> 02:33:08,800
[\h__\h] incredible.
 

6629
02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:10,469
[\h__\h] incredible.
I don't think you should be trading if

6630
02:33:10,469 --> 02:33:10,479
I don't think you should be trading if
 

6631
02:33:10,479 --> 02:33:19,990
I don't think you should be trading if
you can't work that out.

6632
02:33:19,990 --> 02:33:20,000

 

6633
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,670

the indicator on the right side. Now,

6634
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:21,680
the indicator on the right side. Now,
 

6635
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:23,990
the indicator on the right side. Now,
it's it's a tool. It's not even if you

6636
02:33:23,990 --> 02:33:24,000
it's it's a tool. It's not even if you
 

6637
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:27,030
it's it's a tool. It's not even if you
come up to here, right in here, go into

6638
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:27,040
come up to here, right in here, go into
 

6639
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,950
come up to here, right in here, go into
projections, anchored volume profile.

6640
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:28,960
projections, anchored volume profile.
 

6641
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:30,950
projections, anchored volume profile.
It's a it's for free. It's a tool. It's

6642
02:33:30,950 --> 02:33:30,960
It's a it's for free. It's a tool. It's
 

6643
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:32,710
It's a it's for free. It's a tool. It's
not custom.

6644
02:33:32,710 --> 02:33:32,720
not custom.
 

6645
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:34,150
not custom.
So, anchored volume profile. It's a

6646
02:33:34,150 --> 02:33:34,160
So, anchored volume profile. It's a
 

6647
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:35,670
So, anchored volume profile. It's a
tool. It's not even an indicator. It's

6648
02:33:35,670 --> 02:33:35,680
tool. It's not even an indicator. It's
 

6649
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:39,030
tool. It's not even an indicator. It's
just it's a drawing tool.

6650
02:33:39,030 --> 02:33:39,040
just it's a drawing tool.
 

6651
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:57,910
just it's a drawing tool.
Yeah.

6652
02:33:57,910 --> 02:33:57,920

 

6653
02:33:57,920 --> 02:33:59,429

Oh, they were asking someone else,

6654
02:33:59,429 --> 02:33:59,439
Oh, they were asking someone else,
 

6655
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:01,429
Oh, they were asking someone else,
right? Yeah, it's still pretty weird to

6656
02:34:01,429 --> 02:34:01,439
right? Yeah, it's still pretty weird to
 

6657
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:05,429
right? Yeah, it's still pretty weird to
put in a chat.

6658
02:34:05,429 --> 02:34:05,439

 

6659
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:07,429

Did you go over the awards show last

6660
02:34:07,429 --> 02:34:07,439
Did you go over the awards show last
 

6661
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:08,950
Did you go over the awards show last
night? I haven't I haven't watched any

6662
02:34:08,950 --> 02:34:08,960
night? I haven't I haven't watched any
 

6663
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:33,190
night? I haven't I haven't watched any
of it, actually.

6664
02:34:33,190 --> 02:34:33,200

 

6665
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:35,030

back down again. This is the same level

6666
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:35,040
back down again. This is the same level
 

6667
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:36,790
back down again. This is the same level
I keep talking about the 60s. If they

6668
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:36,800
I keep talking about the 60s. If they
 

6669
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:38,630
I keep talking about the 60s. If they
don't absorb this, there's a flush down

6670
02:34:38,630 --> 02:34:38,640
don't absorb this, there's a flush down
 

6671
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:41,830
don't absorb this, there's a flush down
here into 40s and 30s again. So, it

6672
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:41,840
here into 40s and 30s again. So, it
 

6673
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:43,030
here into 40s and 30s again. So, it
really depends what they're trying to do

6674
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:43,040
really depends what they're trying to do
 

6675
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:46,309
really depends what they're trying to do
with this at the moment.

6676
02:34:46,309 --> 02:34:46,319
with this at the moment.
 

6677
02:34:46,319 --> 02:34:47,910
with this at the moment.
And this is like the p it can still be

6678
02:34:47,910 --> 02:34:47,920
And this is like the p it can still be
 

6679
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:49,349
And this is like the p it can still be
the pullback. The fact that we're not

6680
02:34:49,349 --> 02:34:49,359
the pullback. The fact that we're not
 

6681
02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:51,590
the pullback. The fact that we're not
breaking 900s is good for sellers, but

6682
02:34:51,590 --> 02:34:51,600
breaking 900s is good for sellers, but
 

6683
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:53,670
breaking 900s is good for sellers, but
the structural is better for buyers

6684
02:34:53,670 --> 02:34:53,680
the structural is better for buyers
 

6685
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:54,870
the structural is better for buyers
right now. The fact that we're not

6686
02:34:54,870 --> 02:34:54,880
right now. The fact that we're not
 

6687
02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:56,710
right now. The fact that we're not
breaking the 900s is good for sellers.

6688
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:56,720
breaking the 900s is good for sellers.
 

6689
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:58,710
breaking the 900s is good for sellers.
We're leaving buyers trapped up here,

6690
02:34:58,710 --> 02:34:58,720
We're leaving buyers trapped up here,
 

6691
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:01,349
We're leaving buyers trapped up here,
but it's uh when I look through here

6692
02:35:01,349 --> 02:35:01,359
but it's uh when I look through here
 

6693
02:35:01,359 --> 02:35:04,070
but it's uh when I look through here
right now,

6694
02:35:04,070 --> 02:35:04,080
right now,
 

6695
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:06,389
right now,
right, there is a shove down into here,

6696
02:35:06,389 --> 02:35:06,399
right, there is a shove down into here,
 

6697
02:35:06,399 --> 02:35:07,990
right, there is a shove down into here,
but we'd have to let go of absolutely

6698
02:35:07,990 --> 02:35:08,000
but we'd have to let go of absolutely
 

6699
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,389
but we'd have to let go of absolutely
everything.

6700
02:35:10,389 --> 02:35:10,399
everything.
 

6701
02:35:10,399 --> 02:35:11,750
everything.
That's your first lower high and failed

6702
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:11,760
That's your first lower high and failed
 

6703
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:13,270
That's your first lower high and failed
breakout, but they can still scoop this

6704
02:35:13,270 --> 02:35:13,280
breakout, but they can still scoop this
 

6705
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:15,030
breakout, but they can still scoop this
and go. So, like overall structure

6706
02:35:15,030 --> 02:35:15,040
and go. So, like overall structure
 

6707
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:17,429
and go. So, like overall structure
remains bullish on the day. Remember the

6708
02:35:17,429 --> 02:35:17,439
remains bullish on the day. Remember the
 

6709
02:35:17,439 --> 02:35:19,510
remains bullish on the day. Remember the
high of day was the 61 fib based on the

6710
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:19,520
high of day was the 61 fib based on the
 

6711
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:21,270
high of day was the 61 fib based on the
daily that we went over. Here we go. So,

6712
02:35:21,270 --> 02:35:21,280
daily that we went over. Here we go. So,
 

6713
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:22,469
daily that we went over. Here we go. So,
they're back into this previous week

6714
02:35:22,469 --> 02:35:22,479
they're back into this previous week
 

6715
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:24,469
they're back into this previous week
point of control again. Do they flush

6716
02:35:24,469 --> 02:35:24,479
point of control again. Do they flush
 

6717
02:35:24,479 --> 02:35:26,389
point of control again. Do they flush
this now down to 40s is the question or

6718
02:35:26,389 --> 02:35:26,399
this now down to 40s is the question or
 

6719
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:29,910
this now down to 40s is the question or
do they rescoop?

6720
02:35:29,910 --> 02:35:29,920

 

6721
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,190

They're still trying to protect this

6722
02:35:31,190 --> 02:35:31,200
They're still trying to protect this
 

6723
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:37,990
They're still trying to protect this
area. It's the same area

6724
02:35:37,990 --> 02:35:38,000

 

6725
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,550

down into the 40s possible here if they

6726
02:35:40,550 --> 02:35:40,560
down into the 40s possible here if they
 

6727
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:43,670
down into the 40s possible here if they
uh want to fill these imbalances.

6728
02:35:43,670 --> 02:35:43,680
uh want to fill these imbalances.
 

6729
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:52,150
uh want to fill these imbalances.
Possible.

6730
02:35:52,150 --> 02:35:52,160

 

6731
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:55,270

We could go gray to gray. Awkward inter

6732
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:55,280
We could go gray to gray. Awkward inter
 

6733
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:58,469
We could go gray to gray. Awkward inter
lunch. 15 minutes left.

6734
02:35:58,469 --> 02:35:58,479
lunch. 15 minutes left.
 

6735
02:35:58,479 --> 02:35:59,670
lunch. 15 minutes left.
Remember, I'm always looking at the

6736
02:35:59,670 --> 02:35:59,680
Remember, I'm always looking at the
 

6737
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:02,469
Remember, I'm always looking at the
higher time frames. If you go from uh

6738
02:36:02,469 --> 02:36:02,479
higher time frames. If you go from uh
 

6739
02:36:02,479 --> 02:36:04,790
higher time frames. If you go from uh
high of week last week to the low of the

6740
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:04,800
high of week last week to the low of the
 

6741
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:07,270
high of week last week to the low of the
GlobeEx low, you will see that we are

6742
02:36:07,270 --> 02:36:07,280
GlobeEx low, you will see that we are
 

6743
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:10,630
GlobeEx low, you will see that we are
already in uh quite an interesting area.

6744
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:10,640
already in uh quite an interesting area.
 

6745
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:18,870
already in uh quite an interesting area.
Right? If we do this

6746
02:36:18,870 --> 02:36:18,880

 

6747
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:20,790

right right into the 61, this is the

6748
02:36:20,790 --> 02:36:20,800
right right into the 61, this is the
 

6749
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:22,230
right right into the 61, this is the
golden pocket that they will want to

6750
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:22,240
golden pocket that they will want to
 

6751
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:24,710
golden pocket that they will want to
sell. So, it just depends. They start

6752
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:24,720
sell. So, it just depends. They start
 

6753
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:26,230
sell. So, it just depends. They start
here or do they let it through into the

6754
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:26,240
here or do they let it through into the
 

6755
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,150
here or do they let it through into the
26100s.

6756
02:36:28,150 --> 02:36:28,160
26100s.
 

6757
02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:30,230
26100s.
Big big question. But I don't know if

6758
02:36:30,230 --> 02:36:30,240
Big big question. But I don't know if
 

6759
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:31,670
Big big question. But I don't know if
they do this today, but I'd imagine in

6760
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:31,680
they do this today, but I'd imagine in
 

6761
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:33,510
they do this today, but I'd imagine in
the next few days something like this is

6762
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:33,520
the next few days something like this is
 

6763
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:35,670
the next few days something like this is
coming and then the question is, do they

6764
02:36:35,670 --> 02:36:35,680
coming and then the question is, do they
 

6765
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:38,230
coming and then the question is, do they
bid back up or is that just a huge stop

6766
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:38,240
bid back up or is that just a huge stop
 

6767
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:41,990
bid back up or is that just a huge stop
hunt and a collapse?

6768
02:36:41,990 --> 02:36:42,000
hunt and a collapse?
 

6769
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,830
hunt and a collapse?
Why don't I trade ES? Why should I trade

6770
02:36:43,830 --> 02:36:43,840
Why don't I trade ES? Why should I trade
 

6771
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:45,510
Why don't I trade ES? Why should I trade
ES? Everyone wants to say like, why

6772
02:36:45,510 --> 02:36:45,520
ES? Everyone wants to say like, why
 

6773
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:46,550
ES? Everyone wants to say like, why
don't you do this? Why don't you do

6774
02:36:46,550 --> 02:36:46,560
don't you do this? Why don't you do
 

6775
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:49,110
don't you do this? Why don't you do
this? You give me a reason why I should

6776
02:36:49,110 --> 02:36:49,120
this? You give me a reason why I should
 

6777
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:51,190
this? You give me a reason why I should
if the volatility is here really good.

6778
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:51,200
if the volatility is here really good.
 

6779
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:53,030
if the volatility is here really good.
And if I'm reading it really well, why

6780
02:36:53,030 --> 02:36:53,040
And if I'm reading it really well, why
 

6781
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:55,030
And if I'm reading it really well, why
should I look at another screen? That's

6782
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:55,040
should I look at another screen? That's
 

6783
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:58,309
should I look at another screen? That's
that's what I want to know. Why? I like

6784
02:36:58,309 --> 02:36:58,319
that's what I want to know. Why? I like
 

6785
02:36:58,319 --> 02:37:00,070
that's what I want to know. Why? I like
the personality of the asset I'm

6786
02:37:00,070 --> 02:37:00,080
the personality of the asset I'm
 

6787
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:01,670
the personality of the asset I'm
trading. Here you go. Into the 40s like

6788
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:01,680
trading. Here you go. Into the 40s like
 

6789
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:03,190
trading. Here you go. Into the 40s like
we just talked about. So into these

6790
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:03,200
we just talked about. So into these
 

6791
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:04,710
we just talked about. So into these
imbalances

6792
02:37:04,710 --> 02:37:04,720
imbalances
 

6793
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:06,790
imbalances
all the way down to 33s. And then this

6794
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:06,800
all the way down to 33s. And then this
 

6795
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:08,630
all the way down to 33s. And then this
gray box again can be present. We can

6796
02:37:08,630 --> 02:37:08,640
gray box again can be present. We can
 

6797
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:10,710
gray box again can be present. We can
move this up about a little bit into

6798
02:37:10,710 --> 02:37:10,720
move this up about a little bit into
 

6799
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:13,990
move this up about a little bit into
here. Gray box to gray box again. And if

6800
02:37:13,990 --> 02:37:14,000
here. Gray box to gray box again. And if
 

6801
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,590
here. Gray box to gray box again. And if
we get acceptance under all of this,

6802
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:15,600
we get acceptance under all of this,
 

6803
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:17,270
we get acceptance under all of this,
there's a bigger fade. All right. If we

6804
02:37:17,270 --> 02:37:17,280
there's a bigger fade. All right. If we
 

6805
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:19,670
there's a bigger fade. All right. If we
if they leave, if this is a fail

6806
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:19,680
if they leave, if this is a fail
 

6807
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:22,630
if they leave, if this is a fail
breakout, remember that's a 61 fib on

6808
02:37:22,630 --> 02:37:22,640
breakout, remember that's a 61 fib on
 

6809
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:24,710
breakout, remember that's a 61 fib on
the daily. That's a fail breakout. If

6810
02:37:24,710 --> 02:37:24,720
the daily. That's a fail breakout. If
 

6811
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:26,710
the daily. That's a fail breakout. If
they're stuck over 900s, if they let go

6812
02:37:26,710 --> 02:37:26,720
they're stuck over 900s, if they let go
 

6813
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:29,510
they're stuck over 900s, if they let go
of this, this is open, but they need to

6814
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:29,520
of this, this is open, but they need to
 

6815
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:31,670
of this, this is open, but they need to
trade underneath all of this. Otherwise,

6816
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:31,680
trade underneath all of this. Otherwise,
 

6817
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,469
trade underneath all of this. Otherwise,
they can range here all day long. Right?

6818
02:37:34,469 --> 02:37:34,479
they can range here all day long. Right?
 

6819
02:37:34,479 --> 02:37:37,349
they can range here all day long. Right?
We can see it's a big Pshape, right?

6820
02:37:37,349 --> 02:37:37,359
We can see it's a big Pshape, right?
 

6821
02:37:37,359 --> 02:37:45,510
We can see it's a big Pshape, right?
They can range here all day long

6822
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:45,520

 

6823
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:47,349

and the volatility and range is too big

6824
02:37:47,349 --> 02:37:47,359
and the volatility and range is too big
 

6825
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:51,190
and the volatility and range is too big
on ENQ for you maybe not for me. That's

6826
02:37:51,190 --> 02:37:51,200
on ENQ for you maybe not for me. That's
 

6827
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:53,830
on ENQ for you maybe not for me. That's
a personal choice, isn't it? And surely

6828
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:53,840
a personal choice, isn't it? And surely
 

6829
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:55,990
a personal choice, isn't it? And surely
if the volatility is big and the range

6830
02:37:55,990 --> 02:37:56,000
if the volatility is big and the range
 

6831
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,389
if the volatility is big and the range
is good, surely that equals opportunity.

6832
02:37:58,389 --> 02:37:58,399
is good, surely that equals opportunity.
 

6833
02:37:58,399 --> 02:38:00,309
is good, surely that equals opportunity.
So surely what you're saying is you need

6834
02:38:00,309 --> 02:38:00,319
So surely what you're saying is you need
 

6835
02:38:00,319 --> 02:38:07,990
So surely what you're saying is you need
to have good risk management.

6836
02:38:07,990 --> 02:38:08,000

 

6837
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,429

Now, if you've got good risk management

6838
02:38:09,429 --> 02:38:09,439
Now, if you've got good risk management
 

6839
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:11,510
Now, if you've got good risk management
and a good understanding of levels, ENQ

6840
02:38:11,510 --> 02:38:11,520
and a good understanding of levels, ENQ
 

6841
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:14,389
and a good understanding of levels, ENQ
is a great asset to day trade. Great

6842
02:38:14,389 --> 02:38:14,399
is a great asset to day trade. Great
 

6843
02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:17,110
is a great asset to day trade. Great
asset to day trade. I would say the

6844
02:38:17,110 --> 02:38:17,120
asset to day trade. I would say the
 

6845
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:20,309
asset to day trade. I would say the
spider is a better asset to swing trade.

6846
02:38:20,309 --> 02:38:20,319
spider is a better asset to swing trade.
 

6847
02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:25,349
spider is a better asset to swing trade.
You're going to get knocked out less.

6848
02:38:25,349 --> 02:38:25,359

 

6849
02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:26,550

You just got to understand the

6850
02:38:26,550 --> 02:38:26,560
You just got to understand the
 

6851
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:31,429
You just got to understand the
personality.

6852
02:38:31,429 --> 02:38:31,439

 

6853
02:38:31,439 --> 02:38:36,469

But you do what's right for you.

6854
02:38:36,469 --> 02:38:36,479

 

6855
02:38:36,479 --> 02:38:39,670

Okay,

6856
02:38:39,670 --> 02:38:39,680

 

6857
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:41,590

we bid this back up towards these 60s

6858
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:41,600
we bid this back up towards these 60s
 

6859
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,349
we bid this back up towards these 60s
again then. Here we go. There's the bid

6860
02:38:43,349 --> 02:38:43,359
again then. Here we go. There's the bid
 

6861
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:49,830
again then. Here we go. There's the bid
back up to 60. We got 10 minutes left.

6862
02:38:49,830 --> 02:38:49,840

 

6863
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:54,469

Uh, yes. Right here. There you go.

6864
02:38:54,469 --> 02:38:54,479
Uh, yes. Right here. There you go.
 

6865
02:38:54,479 --> 02:38:57,030
Uh, yes. Right here. There you go.
So, ticks per row. Two ticks per row. If

6866
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:57,040
So, ticks per row. Two ticks per row. If
 

6867
02:38:57,040 --> 02:38:58,469
So, ticks per row. Two ticks per row. If
you want it on number of rows, I would

6868
02:38:58,469 --> 02:38:58,479
you want it on number of rows, I would
 

6869
02:38:58,479 --> 02:39:00,550
you want it on number of rows, I would
set this to 1,000. And then I change

6870
02:39:00,550 --> 02:39:00,560
set this to 1,000. And then I change
 

6871
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:02,870
set this to 1,000. And then I change
this to width to 20% and placement on

6872
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:02,880
this to width to 20% and placement on
 

6873
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:05,270
this to width to 20% and placement on
the right. All right, that's it. Simple,

6874
02:39:05,270 --> 02:39:05,280
the right. All right, that's it. Simple,
 

6875
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:06,309
the right. All right, that's it. Simple,
simple, simple. All right, here's the

6876
02:39:06,309 --> 02:39:06,319
simple, simple. All right, here's the
 

6877
02:39:06,319 --> 02:39:09,110
simple, simple. All right, here's the
bid back to 60s and this same area

6878
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:09,120
bid back to 60s and this same area
 

6879
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:11,590
bid back to 60s and this same area
again. And if they don't resell this

6880
02:39:11,590 --> 02:39:11,600
again. And if they don't resell this
 

6881
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:12,790
again. And if they don't resell this
area, then we're going to go back to

6882
02:39:12,790 --> 02:39:12,800
area, then we're going to go back to
 

6883
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:14,230
area, then we're going to go back to
80s. And through 80s, we're going to try

6884
02:39:14,230 --> 02:39:14,240
80s. And through 80s, we're going to try
 

6885
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:20,710
80s. And through 80s, we're going to try
and revisit 900s and 920s.

6886
02:39:20,710 --> 02:39:20,720

 

6887
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:22,790

They're rolling fibs. Uh what's your

6888
02:39:22,790 --> 02:39:22,800
They're rolling fibs. Uh what's your
 

6889
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:25,590
They're rolling fibs. Uh what's your
name? Danib.

6890
02:39:25,590 --> 02:39:25,600
name? Danib.
 

6891
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:30,950
name? Danib.
Rolling fibs. They're EMA rolling fibs.

6892
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:30,960

 

6893
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:32,469

I call them my flow zones, but they're

6894
02:39:32,469 --> 02:39:32,479
I call them my flow zones, but they're
 

6895
02:39:32,479 --> 02:39:51,750
I call them my flow zones, but they're
rolling fibs.

6896

but you need to just rotate like a micro
 

6981
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:35,830

five. But you uh you can't pass it
 

6985
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:40,309
five. But you uh you can't pass it
quicker than 5 days. You can take as

6986
02:41:40,309 --> 02:41:40,319
quicker than 5 days. You can take as
 

6987

What are the most important key levels

6990
02:41:47,510 --> 02:41:47,520
What are the most important key levels
 

6991
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:50,550
What are the most important key levels
for me? uh untest untested areas of

6992
02:41:50,550 --> 02:41:50,560
for me? uh untest untested areas of
 

6993
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:53,429
for me? uh untest untested areas of
volume probably. So daily and weekly

6994
02:41:53,429 --> 02:41:53,439
volume probably. So daily and weekly
 

6995
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:55,030
volume probably. So daily and weekly
levels the higher the time frame the

6996
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:55,040
levels the higher the time frame the
 

6997
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:58,309
levels the higher the time frame the
more important it is. So highs and lows

6998
02:41:58,309 --> 02:41:58,319
more important it is. So highs and lows
 

6999
02:41:58,319 --> 02:42:01,349
more important it is. So highs and lows
and gap fill closures and uh and then

7000
02:42:01,349 --> 02:42:01,359
and gap fill closures and uh and then
 

7001
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:07,750
and gap fill closures and uh and then
big volume levels.

7002

Do I think big orders on bookmaps are
 

7027
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:45,110
Do I think big orders on bookmaps are
better to think about as magnets for

7028
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:45,120
better to think about as magnets for
 

7029
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:49,510
better to think about as magnets for
price as potential areas for bounces?

7030
02:42:49,510 --> 02:42:49,520
price as potential areas for bounces?
 

7031
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:51,429
price as potential areas for bounces?
It's a good question. Uh we can use them

7032
02:42:51,429 --> 02:42:51,439
It's a good question. Uh we can use them
 

7033
02:42:51,439 --> 02:42:53,110
It's a good question. Uh we can use them
as liquidity drives. Like they're just

02:42:53,110 --> 02:42:53,120
as liquidity drives. Like they're just
 

7035
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:55,030
as liquidity drives. Like they're just
resting liquidity. They don't always

7036
02:42:55,030 --> 02:42:55,040
resting liquidity. They don't always
 

7037
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:58,389
resting liquidity. They don't always
work that way. Uh I use them to see like

7038
02:42:58,389 --> 02:42:58,399
work that way. Uh I use them to see like
 

7039
02:42:58,399 --> 02:43:00,070
work that way. Uh I use them to see like
are they serious? Like this person is

price. I don't see these guys as like

7050
02:43:08,389 --> 02:43:08,399
price. I don't see these guys as like
 

7051
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:10,630
price. I don't see these guys as like
serious participants. But there was a

7052
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:10,640
serious participants. But there was a
 

7053
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:13,830
serious participants. But there was a
serious bid on the market today who has

7054
02:43:13,830 --> 02:43:13,840
serious bid on the market today who has
 

7055
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:15,830
serious bid on the market today who has
stepped in numerous times chasing price

7056
02:43:15,830 --> 02:43:15,840
stepped in numerous times chasing price
 

7057
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:17,750
stepped in numerous times chasing price
up. All right. So there have been some

7058
02:43:17,750 --> 02:43:17,760
up. All right. So there have been some
 

7059
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:20,070
up. All right. So there have been some
serious bids on the market today. But

7060
02:43:20,070 --> 02:43:20,080
serious bids on the market today. But
 

7061
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:21,910
serious bids on the market today. But
you can use them as magnets, but you

7062
02:43:21,910 --> 02:43:21,920
you can use them as magnets, but you
 

7063
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:22,950
you can use them as magnets, but you
can't guarantee we're going to get

7064
02:43:22,950 --> 02:43:22,960
can't guarantee we're going to get
 

7065
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:24,389
can't guarantee we're going to get
there. What you can use it is as

7066
02:43:24,389 --> 02:43:24,399
there. What you can use it is as
 

7067
02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:26,309
there. What you can use it is as
definite liquidity. It's absolute

7068
02:43:26,309 --> 02:43:26,319
definite liquidity. It's absolute
 

7069
02:43:26,319 --> 02:43:28,870
definite liquidity. It's absolute
liquidity. All right? So we can use

7070
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:28,880
liquidity. All right? So we can use
 

7071
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:31,110
liquidity. All right? So we can use
highs and lows as areas of estimate

7072
02:43:31,110 --> 02:43:31,120
highs and lows as areas of estimate
 

7073
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:33,030
highs and lows as areas of estimate
where liquidity might be. But on using

7074
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:33,040
where liquidity might be. But on using
 

7075
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:34,710
where liquidity might be. But on using
bookmap, you actually know where that

7076
02:43:34,710 --> 02:43:34,720
bookmap, you actually know where that
 

7077
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:37,270
bookmap, you actually know where that
liquidity is.

7078
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:37,280
liquidity is.
 

7079
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:40,389
liquidity is.

limited on time. Okay, so inverse head

7110
02:44:30,309 --> 02:44:30,319
limited on time. Okay, so inverse head
 

7111
02:44:30,319 --> 02:44:31,750
limited on time. Okay, so inverse head
and shoulders are going to come back for

02:44:31,750 --> 02:44:31,760
and shoulders are going to come back for
 

7113
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:33,990
and shoulders are going to come back for
this 900 again for another attempt to

7114
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:34,000
this 900 again for another attempt to
 

7115
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,670
this 900 again for another attempt to
get through the 900s. They get through

7116
02:44:35,670 --> 02:44:35,680
get through the 900s. They get through
 

7117
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:37,830
get through the 900s. They get through
900, you will get 920. Vick's new low of

7118
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:37,840
900, you will get 920. Vick's new low of
 

7119

7121
02:44:44,319 --> 02:44:45,750

Where in bookmap do I see the big

7122
02:44:45,750 --> 02:44:45,760
Where in bookmap do I see the big
 

7123
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:47,030
Where in bookmap do I see the big
orders? Resting orders are the

7124
02:44:47,030 --> 02:44:47,040
orders? Resting orders are the
 

7125
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:49,910
orders? Resting orders are the
horizontal lines and uh big orders which

7126
02:44:49,910 --> 02:44:49,920
horizontal lines and uh big orders which
 

7127
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:51,750
horizontal lines and uh big orders which
are filled on the on the book. Market

7128
02:44:51,750 --> 02:44:51,760
are filled on the on the book. Market
 

7129
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:59,030
are filled on the on the book. Market
orders are the bubbles.

7130
02:44:59,030 --> 02:44:59,040

 

7131
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:01,190

Nice, mate. Good work. How do you get

7132
02:45:01,190 --> 02:45:01,200
Nice, mate. Good work. How do you get
 

7133
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:02,630
Nice, mate. Good work. How do you get
volume profile to stick to the right

7134
02:45:02,630 --> 02:45:02,640
volume profile to stick to the right
 

7135
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:04,710
volume profile to stick to the right
hand side?

7136
02:45:04,710 --> 02:45:04,720
hand side?
 

7137
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:06,230
hand side?
We just went over it. You have to use

7138
02:45:06,230 --> 02:45:06,240
We just went over it. You have to use
 

7139
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:08,710
We just went over it. You have to use
anchored and you need to do placement to

7140
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:08,720
anchored and you need to do placement to
 

7141
02:45:08,720 --> 02:45:10,870
anchored and you need to do placement to
the right.

7142
02:45:10,870 --> 02:45:10,880
the right.
 

7143
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:12,550
the right.
Right, here's the squeeze. So, back up

7144
02:45:12,550 --> 02:45:12,560
Right, here's the squeeze. So, back up
 

7145
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:15,190
Right, here's the squeeze. So, back up
towards the sort of 900 level is where

7146
02:45:15,190 --> 02:45:15,200
towards the sort of 900 level is where
 

7147
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:17,429
towards the sort of 900 level is where
they are attempting to get to. All

7148
02:45:17,429 --> 02:45:17,439
they are attempting to get to. All
 

7149
02:45:17,439 --> 02:45:19,030
they are attempting to get to. All
right, we're in the range being built

7150
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:19,040
right, we're in the range being built
 

7151
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:20,790
right, we're in the range being built
out here. You can see this sort of area

7152
02:45:20,790 --> 02:45:20,800
out here. You can see this sort of area
 

7153
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:23,110
out here. You can see this sort of area
here. They're trying to get to 900s and

7154
02:45:23,110 --> 02:45:23,120
here. They're trying to get to 900s and
 

7155
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:26,070
here. They're trying to get to 900s and
then 920s for that break if they can do

7156
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:26,080
then 920s for that break if they can do
 

7157
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:28,150
then 920s for that break if they can do
it. But you are in a big old box here.

7158
02:45:28,150 --> 02:45:28,160
it. But you are in a big old box here.
 

7159
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:31,110
it. But you are in a big old box here.
100 point box right right here. This is

7160
02:45:31,110 --> 02:45:31,120
100 point box right right here. This is
 

7161
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:33,990
100 point box right right here. This is
where you are. This is your rotation.

7162
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:34,000
where you are. This is your rotation.
 

7163
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:38,070
where you are. This is your rotation.
You've gone box to box to box to box

7164
02:45:38,070 --> 02:45:38,080
You've gone box to box to box to box
 

7165
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:39,990
You've gone box to box to box to box
maybe to box. If they find acceptance,

7166
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:40,000
maybe to box. If they find acceptance,
 

7167
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,870
maybe to box. If they find acceptance,
it will have to be over 900 920. But on

7168
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:42,880
it will have to be over 900 920. But on
 

7169
02:45:42,880 --> 02:46:00,389
it will have to be over 900 920. But on
a daily, you're right into a 61 fib.

7170
02:46:00,389 --> 02:46:00,399

 

7171
02:46:00,399 --> 02:46:01,910

They're trying to lift it into these

7172
02:46:01,910 --> 02:46:01,920
They're trying to lift it into these
 

7173
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:04,870
They're trying to lift it into these
900s at the moment. So, some of you

7174
02:46:04,870 --> 02:46:04,880
900s at the moment. So, some of you
 

7175
02:46:04,880 --> 02:46:06,150
900s at the moment. So, some of you
saying you're long from down here. You

7176
02:46:06,150 --> 02:46:06,160
saying you're long from down here. You
 

7177
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:07,510
saying you're long from down here. You
look pretty good. So, I'd just be very

7178
02:46:07,510 --> 02:46:07,520
look pretty good. So, I'd just be very
 

7179
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:09,030
look pretty good. So, I'd just be very
careful as you come into here. If you

7180
02:46:09,030 --> 02:46:09,040
careful as you come into here. If you
 

7181
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:10,950
careful as you come into here. If you
get through 900 and you get through high

7182
02:46:10,950 --> 02:46:10,960
get through 900 and you get through high
 

7183
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:12,469
get through 900 and you get through high
of day, I would definitely be taking a

7184
02:46:12,469 --> 02:46:12,479
of day, I would definitely be taking a
 

7185
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:14,630
of day, I would definitely be taking a
partial and then you're looking for 920.

7186
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:14,640
partial and then you're looking for 920.
 

7187
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:16,230
partial and then you're looking for 920.
I would say that there is a chance to

7188
02:46:16,230 --> 02:46:16,240
I would say that there is a chance to
 

7189
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:17,910
I would say that there is a chance to
get up here. We did the measured move.

7190
02:46:17,910 --> 02:46:17,920
get up here. We did the measured move.
 

7191
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:20,389
get up here. We did the measured move.
Remember, there is a chance. Doesn't

7192
02:46:20,389 --> 02:46:20,399
Remember, there is a chance. Doesn't
 

7193
02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:21,830
Remember, there is a chance. Doesn't
have to do it. Doesn't have to do it

7194
02:46:21,830 --> 02:46:21,840
have to do it. Doesn't have to do it
 

7195
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:22,870
have to do it. Doesn't have to do it
today, but if they're going to complete

7196
02:46:22,870 --> 02:46:22,880
today, but if they're going to complete
 

7197
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:25,030
today, but if they're going to complete
the measured move, it lines up perfectly

7198
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:25,040
the measured move, it lines up perfectly
 

7199
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:27,910
the measured move, it lines up perfectly
with that previous day high into 26,020.

7200
02:46:27,910 --> 02:46:27,920
with that previous day high into 26,020.
 

7201
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:30,950
with that previous day high into 26,020.
It's possible. It's possible. Not

7202
02:46:30,950 --> 02:46:30,960
It's possible. It's possible. Not
 

7203
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:33,590
It's possible. It's possible. Not
probable. It's possible. They've built

7204
02:46:33,590 --> 02:46:33,600
probable. It's possible. They've built
 

7205
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:35,190
probable. It's possible. They've built
out a huge amount of liquidity here. If

7206
02:46:35,190 --> 02:46:35,200
out a huge amount of liquidity here. If
 

7207
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:37,190
out a huge amount of liquidity here. If
they get a break and a hold, it's

7208
02:46:37,190 --> 02:46:37,200
they get a break and a hold, it's
 

7209
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:38,790
they get a break and a hold, it's
possible. But you're getting very close

7210
02:46:38,790 --> 02:46:38,800
possible. But you're getting very close
 

7211
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:43,190
possible. But you're getting very close
to lunchtime now. 3 minutes to go.

7212
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:43,200
to lunchtime now. 3 minutes to go.
 

7213
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:44,550
to lunchtime now. 3 minutes to go.
So here they go. They're trying to get

7214
02:46:44,550 --> 02:46:44,560
So here they go. They're trying to get
 

7215
02:46:44,560 --> 02:46:46,389
So here they go. They're trying to get
through this sellside imbalance here.

7216
02:46:46,389 --> 02:46:46,399
through this sellside imbalance here.
 

7217
02:46:46,399 --> 02:46:49,830
through this sellside imbalance here.
Break of 90 should get you up to 900s.

7218
02:46:49,830 --> 02:46:49,840
Break of 90 should get you up to 900s.
 

7219
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:51,750
Break of 90 should get you up to 900s.
Here you go. So coming up to the 900s.

7220
02:46:51,750 --> 02:46:51,760
Here you go. So coming up to the 900s.
 

7221
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:53,429
Here you go. So coming up to the 900s.
Through the 900s, you're looking at

7222
02:46:53,429 --> 02:46:53,439
Through the 900s, you're looking at
 

7223
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:55,910
Through the 900s, you're looking at
920s. I would take a partial for the

7224
02:46:55,910 --> 02:46:55,920
920s. I would take a partial for the
 

7225
02:46:55,920 --> 02:46:57,910
920s. I would take a partial for the
break of high of day. You need to get

7226
02:46:57,910 --> 02:46:57,920
break of high of day. You need to get
 

7227
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:59,990
break of high of day. You need to get
through the 900s. And if you get through

7228
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,000
through the 900s. And if you get through
 

7229
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,070
through the 900s. And if you get through
that, then this is where you're going to

7230
02:47:02,070 --> 02:47:02,080
that, then this is where you're going to
 

7231
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:03,990
that, then this is where you're going to
try and go, right? So if those of you

7232
02:47:03,990 --> 02:47:04,000
try and go, right? So if those of you
 

7233
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:05,830
try and go, right? So if those of you
who bought dips here, the only other

7234
02:47:05,830 --> 02:47:05,840
who bought dips here, the only other
 

7235
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:08,150
who bought dips here, the only other
option now you would need a base above

7236
02:47:08,150 --> 02:47:08,160
option now you would need a base above
 

7237
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:10,630
option now you would need a base above
this to do this. All right. So those of

7238
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:10,640
this to do this. All right. So those of
 

7239
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:12,150
this to do this. All right. So those of
you who bought dips here, I would take a

7240
02:47:12,150 --> 02:47:12,160
you who bought dips here, I would take a
 

7241
02:47:12,160 --> 02:47:14,150
you who bought dips here, I would take a
partial here and hopefully you get this

7242
02:47:14,150 --> 02:47:14,160
partial here and hopefully you get this
 

7243
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:16,309
partial here and hopefully you get this
move. Just be very careful of a clear

7244
02:47:16,309 --> 02:47:16,319
move. Just be very careful of a clear
 

7245
02:47:16,319 --> 02:47:18,150
move. Just be very careful of a clear
out and a fail, which is why you're

7246
02:47:18,150 --> 02:47:18,160
out and a fail, which is why you're
 

7247
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:33,349
out and a fail, which is why you're
going to lock some in

7248
02:47:33,349 --> 02:47:33,359

 

7249
02:47:33,359 --> 02:47:35,030

what the blue and turquoise waves and

7250
02:47:35,030 --> 02:47:35,040
what the blue and turquoise waves and
 

7251
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:37,910
what the blue and turquoise waves and
the green one. This is my deep flow zone

7252
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:37,920
the green one. This is my deep flow zone
 

7253
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:39,750
the green one. This is my deep flow zone
pullback. These are rolling fibs. So the

7254
02:47:39,750 --> 02:47:39,760
pullback. These are rolling fibs. So the
 

7255
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:41,030
pullback. These are rolling fibs. So the
deep flow zone pullback. These are

7256
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,040
deep flow zone pullback. These are
 

7257
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:42,950
deep flow zone pullback. These are
people that play deep pullbacks. They

7258
02:47:42,950 --> 02:47:42,960
people that play deep pullbacks. They
 

7259
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:45,030
people that play deep pullbacks. They
will offer they will bid on this like

7260
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:45,040
will offer they will bid on this like
 

7261
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:46,870
will offer they will bid on this like
deeper pullback zone and people are

7262
02:47:46,870 --> 02:47:46,880
deeper pullback zone and people are
 

7263
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:48,630
deeper pullback zone and people are
playing momentum are playing the lower

7264
02:47:48,630 --> 02:47:48,640
playing momentum are playing the lower
 

7265
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:50,870
playing momentum are playing the lower
cloud. Okay. So you're watching these

7266
02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:50,880
cloud. Okay. So you're watching these
 

7267
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:52,790
cloud. Okay. So you're watching these
900s.

7268
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:52,800
900s.
 

7269
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:54,309
900s.
Nothing's changed. Remember the buyer

7270
02:47:54,309 --> 02:47:54,319
Nothing's changed. Remember the buyer
 

7271
02:47:54,319 --> 02:47:56,150
Nothing's changed. Remember the buyer
has been caught at 900. We can see him

7272
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:56,160
has been caught at 900. We can see him
 

7273
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:59,030
has been caught at 900. We can see him
on the tape there. 377 and 379. That's

7274
02:47:59,030 --> 02:47:59,040
on the tape there. 377 and 379. That's
 

7275
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:00,790
on the tape there. 377 and 379. That's
the size of the lots. So you've got

7276
02:48:00,790 --> 02:48:00,800
the size of the lots. So you've got
 

7277
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:03,830
the size of the lots. So you've got
almost 800 lots who have been caught at

7278
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:03,840
almost 800 lots who have been caught at
 

7279
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:06,950
almost 800 lots who have been caught at
900. If he gets left out, lifted out I

7280
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:06,960
900. If he gets left out, lifted out I
 

7281
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:08,550
900. If he gets left out, lifted out I
should say, then you might get a break

7282
02:48:08,550 --> 02:48:08,560
should say, then you might get a break
 

7283
02:48:08,560 --> 02:48:10,710
should say, then you might get a break
of high of day. And then you want to

7284
02:48:10,710 --> 02:48:10,720
of high of day. And then you want to
 

7285
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:14,230
of high of day. And then you want to
watch into sort of the 18 and 20 level.

7286
02:48:14,230 --> 02:48:14,240
watch into sort of the 18 and 20 level.
 

7287
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:15,830
watch into sort of the 18 and 20 level.
VIX new lower day. You look good. Those

7288
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:15,840
VIX new lower day. You look good. Those
 

7289
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:17,510
VIX new lower day. You look good. Those
of you who are long, just manage your

7290
02:48:17,510 --> 02:48:17,520
of you who are long, just manage your
 

7291
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:18,710
of you who are long, just manage your
position carefully. You're coming up

7292
02:48:18,710 --> 02:48:18,720
position carefully. You're coming up
 

7293
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:21,030
position carefully. You're coming up
into lunch in 2 minutes. Here we go.

7294
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:21,040
into lunch in 2 minutes. Here we go.
 

7295
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:22,309
into lunch in 2 minutes. Here we go.
They're going to try and get you up into

7296
02:48:22,309 --> 02:48:22,319
They're going to try and get you up into
 

7297
02:48:22,319 --> 02:48:29,190
They're going to try and get you up into
these 900s now.

7298
02:48:29,190 --> 02:48:29,200

 

7299
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:30,870

Here you go. There's the spike into 900.

7300
02:48:30,870 --> 02:48:30,880
Here you go. There's the spike into 900.
 

7301
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:32,710
Here you go. There's the spike into 900.
So, they've cleared him out. Make sure

7302
02:48:32,710 --> 02:48:32,720
So, they've cleared him out. Make sure
 

7303
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:34,550
So, they've cleared him out. Make sure
you're locking some in. ES new high of

7304
02:48:34,550 --> 02:48:34,560
you're locking some in. ES new high of
 

7305
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:36,309
you're locking some in. ES new high of
day here, right? Make sure you are

7306
02:48:36,309 --> 02:48:36,319
day here, right? Make sure you are
 

7307
02:48:36,319 --> 02:48:37,990
day here, right? Make sure you are
locking some in here. The only thing

7308
02:48:37,990 --> 02:48:38,000
locking some in here. The only thing
 

7309
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:43,269
locking some in here. The only thing
left now is 920 and then up here. Uh I

7310
02:48:43,269 --> 02:48:43,279
left now is 920 and then up here. Uh I
 

7311
02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:46,150
left now is 920 and then up here. Uh I
don't think we get above this 26,020. So

7312
02:48:46,150 --> 02:48:46,160
don't think we get above this 26,020. So
 

7313
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:49,030
don't think we get above this 26,020. So
920 and then there's 100 points uh if

7314
02:48:49,030 --> 02:48:49,040
920 and then there's 100 points uh if
 

7315
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:50,790
920 and then there's 100 points uh if
they can base, but this might be the

7316
02:48:50,790 --> 02:48:50,800
they can base, but this might be the
 

7317
02:48:50,800 --> 02:48:53,590
they can base, but this might be the
edge. Remember this is the 61% fib on

7318
02:48:53,590 --> 02:48:53,600
edge. Remember this is the 61% fib on
 

7319
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:55,750
edge. Remember this is the 61% fib on
the big daily. So you have only got this

7320
02:48:55,750 --> 02:48:55,760
the big daily. So you have only got this
 

7321
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:58,389
the big daily. So you have only got this
left. Otherwise, you should be out a

7322
02:48:58,389 --> 02:48:58,399
left. Otherwise, you should be out a
 

7323
02:48:58,399 --> 02:49:00,870
left. Otherwise, you should be out a
decent size of your position through the

7324
02:49:00,870 --> 02:49:00,880
decent size of your position through the
 

7325
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:03,830
decent size of your position through the
900s. See that spike through 900 and

7326
02:49:03,830 --> 02:49:03,840
900s. See that spike through 900 and
 

7327
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:05,190
900s. See that spike through 900 and
instantly back under it. You need it to

7328
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:05,200
instantly back under it. You need it to
 

7329
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:14,070
instantly back under it. You need it to
get back above 900 if you're holding.

7330
02:49:14,070 --> 02:49:14,080

 

7331
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:16,550

Closed at 900. Yeah, nice. I would say

7332
02:49:16,550 --> 02:49:16,560
Closed at 900. Yeah, nice. I would say
 

7333
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:17,910
Closed at 900. Yeah, nice. I would say
you can you can hold like a little

7334
02:49:17,910 --> 02:49:17,920
you can you can hold like a little
 

7335
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:20,230
you can you can hold like a little
runner in case you get going, but you

7336
02:49:20,230 --> 02:49:20,240
runner in case you get going, but you
 

7337
02:49:20,240 --> 02:49:22,070
runner in case you get going, but you
want to move your stop positively up.

7338
02:49:22,070 --> 02:49:22,080
want to move your stop positively up.
 

7339
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:23,670
want to move your stop positively up.
Like so if any of you bought the dips,

7340
02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:23,680
Like so if any of you bought the dips,
 

7341
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:25,429
Like so if any of you bought the dips,
you know, gray box to gray box again,

7342
02:49:25,429 --> 02:49:25,439
you know, gray box to gray box again,
 

7343
02:49:25,439 --> 02:49:27,190
you know, gray box to gray box again,
isn't it? So you you'd want this to hold

7344
02:49:27,190 --> 02:49:27,200
isn't it? So you you'd want this to hold
 

7345
02:49:27,200 --> 02:49:30,710
isn't it? So you you'd want this to hold
74 75s now, right? But you're into

7346
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:30,720
74 75s now, right? But you're into
 

7347
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:33,030
74 75s now, right? But you're into

Here you go. So here comes the 920

7420
02:50:59,269 --> 02:50:59,279
Here you go. So here comes the 920
 

7421
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:02,150
Here you go. So here comes the 920
coming up. So make sure it's right here.

So it's actually 18 is the actual exact

7424
02:51:04,230 --> 02:51:04,240
So it's actually 18 is the actual exact
 

7425
02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:05,590
So it's actually 18 is the actual exact
level. So you want to be taking a

7426
02:51:05,590 --> 02:51:05,600
level. So you want to be taking a
 

7427
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:08,469
level. So you want to be taking a
partial into this. So 920 was almost

7428
02:51:08,469 --> 02:51:08,479
partial into this. So 920 was almost
 

7429
02:51:08,479 --> 02:51:12,150
partial into this. So 920 was almost
there. Two ticks short. We hit 1950. And

very thin down here. This is a straight
 

7481
02:52:08,560 --> 02:52:11,030
very thin down here. This is a straight
leg up and then sideways. So, if they

7482
02:52:11,030 --> 02:52:11,040
leg up and then sideways. So, if they
 

7483
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:13,830

fail to continue and they lose this
 

7485
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:17,030
fail to continue and they lose this
consolidation, they will drop it. So,

7486
02:52:17,030 --> 02:52:17,040
consolidation, they will drop it. So,

Possible short. The only possible short
 

7557
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:45,990
Possible short. The only possible short
will be a fail break if they trap

7558
02:53:45,990 --> 02:53:46,000
will be a fail break if they trap
 

7559
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,190
will be a fail break if they trap
buyers. You're not seeing that right

7560
02:53:47,190 --> 02:53:47,200
buyers. You're not seeing that right
 

7561
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:48,790
buyers. You're not seeing that right
now. Remember, buyers are now in control

7562
02:53:48,790 --> 02:53:48,800
now. Remember, buyers are now in control
 

7563
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:51,429
now. Remember, buyers are now in control
from that 900. Remember the delta we

7564
02:53:51,429 --> 02:53:51,439
from that 900. Remember the delta we
 

7565
02:53:51,439 --> 02:53:54,150
from that 900. Remember the delta we
talked about a million times was 900 we

7566
02:53:54,150 --> 02:53:54,160
talked about a million times was 900 we
 

7567
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:55,910
talked about a million times was 900 we
talked about here. All right, buyers

7568
02:53:55,910 --> 02:53:55,920
talked about here. All right, buyers
 

7569
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:57,830
talked about here. All right, buyers
have been stuck above there or at there

7570
02:53:57,830 --> 02:53:57,840
have been stuck above there or at there
 

7571
02:53:57,840 --> 02:53:59,750
have been stuck above there or at there
all morning and it kept getting stuck,

7572
02:53:59,750 --> 02:53:59,760
all morning and it kept getting stuck,
 

7573
02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:01,030
all morning and it kept getting stuck,
kept getting stuck. Now you've gone

7574
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:01,040
kept getting stuck. Now you've gone
 

7575
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:02,550
kept getting stuck. Now you've gone
above them. So if we find acceptance

7576
02:54:02,550 --> 02:54:02,560
above them. So if we find acceptance
 

7577
02:54:02,560 --> 02:54:04,230
above them. So if we find acceptance
above it, what does that mean? Well, no

7578
02:54:04,230 --> 02:54:04,240
above it, what does that mean? Well, no
 

7579
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:05,990
above it, what does that mean? Well, no
buyer is stuck. So why would you want to

7580
02:54:05,990 --> 02:54:06,000
buyer is stuck. So why would you want to
 

7581
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:09,429
buyer is stuck. So why would you want to
be short if there's no buyer stuck,

7582
02:54:09,429 --> 02:54:09,439
be short if there's no buyer stuck,
 

7583
02:54:09,439 --> 02:54:11,670
be short if there's no buyer stuck,
right? Okay, if they're all in control,

7584
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:11,680
right? Okay, if they're all in control,
 

7585
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:15,190
right? Okay, if they're all in control,
then you don't want to be short, do you?

7586
02:54:15,190 --> 02:54:15,200
then you don't want to be short, do you?
 

7587
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:17,510
then you don't want to be short, do you?
Right. This whole premise that newer

7588
02:54:17,510 --> 02:54:17,520
Right. This whole premise that newer
 

7589
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:20,790
Right. This whole premise that newer
traders have or it's up too high.

7590
02:54:20,790 --> 02:54:20,800
traders have or it's up too high.
 

7591
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:22,309
traders have or it's up too high.
It doesn't matter. Or it's into a key

7592
02:54:22,309 --> 02:54:22,319
It doesn't matter. Or it's into a key
 

7593
02:54:22,319 --> 02:54:24,630
It doesn't matter. Or it's into a key
level, it doesn't matter. Like it's what

7594
02:54:24,630 --> 02:54:24,640
level, it doesn't matter. Like it's what
 

7595
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:26,870
level, it doesn't matter. Like it's what
happens after that, right? We mark out

7596
02:54:26,870 --> 02:54:26,880
happens after that, right? We mark out
 

7597
02:54:26,880 --> 02:54:29,030
happens after that, right? We mark out
the level. What happens next? What's the

7598
02:54:29,030 --> 02:54:29,040
the level. What happens next? What's the
 

7599
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:36,230
the level. What happens next? What's the
reaction at that level?

7600
02:54:36,230 --> 02:54:36,240

7697
02:58:10,160 --> 02:58:11,990
action today. What I would be looking
for for the next day, well, like we

7698
02:58:11,990 --> 02:58:12,000
for for the next day, well, like we
 

7699
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:12,950
for for the next day, well, like we
talked about, if you're going to

7700
02:58:12,950 --> 02:58:12,960
talked about, if you're going to
 

7701
02:58:12,960 --> 02:58:14,630
talked about, if you're going to
complete the measured move, those of you

7702
02:58:14,630 --> 02:58:14,640
complete the measured move, those of you
 

7703
02:58:14,640 --> 02:58:15,590
complete the measured move, those of you
who are long, if you're going to

7704
02:58:15,590 --> 02:58:15,600
who are long, if you're going to
 

7705
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:17,269
who are long, if you're going to
complete the measured move, you're going

7706
02:58:17,269 --> 02:58:17,279
complete the measured move, you're going
 

7707
02:58:17,279 --> 02:58:18,790
complete the measured move, you're going
to need to try and get it all the way up

7708
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:18,800
to need to try and get it all the way up
 

7709
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:20,790
to need to try and get it all the way up
to 26,000. I would have locked in most

7710
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:20,800
to 26,000. I would have locked in most
 

7711
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:22,550
to 26,000. I would have locked in most
of my profit already for that squeeze

7712
02:58:22,550 --> 02:58:22,560
of my profit already for that squeeze
 

7713
02:58:22,560 --> 02:58:25,429
of my profit already for that squeeze
into 20 like we talked about. Where, if

7714
02:58:25,429 --> 02:58:25,439
into 20 like we talked about. Where, if
 

7715
02:58:25,439 --> 02:58:27,510
into 20 like we talked about. Where, if
and where would I be short? Well, this

7716
02:58:27,510 --> 02:58:27,520
and where would I be short? Well, this
 

7717
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:30,070
and where would I be short? Well, this
is your range rotation.

7718
02:58:30,070 --> 02:58:30,080
is your range rotation.
 

7719
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:31,750
is your range rotation.
All right? And if we develop a huge

7720
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:31,760
All right? And if we develop a huge
 

7721
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:33,990
All right? And if we develop a huge
amount of volume here and we leave this

7722
02:58:33,990 --> 02:58:34,000
amount of volume here and we leave this
 

7723
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,469
amount of volume here and we leave this
volume, doesn't have to be today, this

7724
02:58:36,469 --> 02:58:36,479
volume, doesn't have to be today, this
 

7725
02:58:36,479 --> 02:58:39,110
volume, doesn't have to be today, this
might offer a short down into 700s and

7726
02:58:39,110 --> 02:58:39,120
might offer a short down into 700s and
 

7727
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:40,950
might offer a short down into 700s and
beyond, that'll be something I'll be

7728
02:58:40,950 --> 02:58:40,960
beyond, that'll be something I'll be
 

7729
02:58:40,960 --> 02:58:42,710
beyond, that'll be something I'll be
looking for for the next few days if we

7730
02:58:42,710 --> 02:58:42,720
looking for for the next few days if we
 

7731
02:58:42,720 --> 02:58:44,389
looking for for the next few days if we
leave volume. Otherwise, we're going to

7732
02:58:44,389 --> 02:58:44,399
leave volume. Otherwise, we're going to
 

7733
02:58:44,399 --> 02:58:46,469
leave volume. Otherwise, we're going to
keep lifting up into these key levels.

7734
02:58:46,469 --> 02:58:46,479
keep lifting up into these key levels.
 

7735
02:58:46,479 --> 02:58:47,910
keep lifting up into these key levels.
All right, we're just going to keep

7736
02:58:47,910 --> 02:58:47,920
All right, we're just going to keep
 

7737
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:49,429
All right, we're just going to keep
lifting and lifting and lifting and

7738
02:58:49,429 --> 02:58:49,439
lifting and lifting and lifting and
 

7739
02:58:49,439 --> 02:58:51,670
lifting and lifting and lifting and
lifting. At the moment, all we've done

7740
02:58:51,670 --> 02:58:51,680
lifting. At the moment, all we've done
 

7741
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:54,230

02:58:57,590 --> 02:58:57,600
typical ABCD kind of pattern. All right,

7751
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:07,670
this morning. The moment they reclaimed
that was extremely aggressive. Kind of

7752
02:59:07,670 --> 02:59:07,680
that was extremely aggressive. Kind of
 

7753
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:09,190
that was extremely aggressive. Kind of
hard to get involved in that. I would

02:59:09,190 --> 02:59:09,200
hard to get involved in that. I would
 

7755
02:59:09,200 --> 02:59:11,590
