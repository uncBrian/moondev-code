00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,590

All

2
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600

 

3
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,189

right, morning team. Happy Friday.

4
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
right, morning team. Happy Friday.
 

5
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,510
right, morning team. Happy Friday.
Happy Friday. We're back at it. Let's

6
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
Happy Friday. We're back at it. Let's
 

7
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,590
Happy Friday. We're back at it. Let's
close out this week strong. It's been a

8
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
close out this week strong. It's been a
 

9
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,309
close out this week strong. It's been a
uh a little bit of a messy week and uh

10
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
uh a little bit of a messy week and uh
 

11
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,990
uh a little bit of a messy week and uh
we're opening up right in the midpoint.

12
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
we're opening up right in the midpoint.
 

13
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,990
we're opening up right in the midpoint.
So, let's go over it. We're going to

14
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
So, let's go over it. We're going to
 

15
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,150
So, let's go over it. We're going to
look at the extremes so far of this

16
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
look at the extremes so far of this
 

17
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,950
look at the extremes so far of this
week, which would be Tuesday's high,

18
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
week, which would be Tuesday's high,
 

19
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,110
week, which would be Tuesday's high,
okay, and Wednesday's low. And you can

20
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
okay, and Wednesday's low. And you can
 

21
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,629
okay, and Wednesday's low. And you can
see right now we're opening up well

22
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
see right now we're opening up well
 

23
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,670
see right now we're opening up well
inside coming into this sort of 61 to

24
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
inside coming into this sort of 61 to
 

25
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,870
inside coming into this sort of 61 to
070 kind of fib of the range of the

26
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
070 kind of fib of the range of the
 

27
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,790
070 kind of fib of the range of the
current week. All right, that's what

28
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
current week. All right, that's what
 

29
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,990
current week. All right, that's what
we're seeing so far today. Uh we did

30
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
we're seeing so far today. Uh we did
 

31
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,670
we're seeing so far today. Uh we did
have a drive down yesterday. All right,

32
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
have a drive down yesterday. All right,
 

33
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,070
have a drive down yesterday. All right,
we uh open up low, drove lower, closed

34
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
we uh open up low, drove lower, closed
 

35
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,830
we uh open up low, drove lower, closed
back inside the range. You can see once

36
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
back inside the range. You can see once
 

37
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,909
back inside the range. You can see once
we got to this 50-day,

38
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
we got to this 50-day,
 

39
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,629
we got to this 50-day,
this red line, we found a bid. This is

40
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
this red line, we found a bid. This is
 

41
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,029
this red line, we found a bid. This is
also a low volume node. Uh, we can try

42
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
also a low volume node. Uh, we can try
 

43
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,029
also a low volume node. Uh, we can try
and get some VP on here. Why does it

44
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
and get some VP on here. Why does it
 

45
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,990
and get some VP on here. Why does it
keep forgetting it every time?

46
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000

 

47
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,150

See if we can get

48
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
See if we can get
 

49
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,270
See if we can get
maybe

50
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280

 

51
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,749

visible range. See if that will go on.

52
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
visible range. See if that will go on.
 

53
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,070
visible range. See if that will go on.
There we go. All right. finding a bid in

54
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
There we go. All right. finding a bid in
 

55
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,909
There we go. All right. finding a bid in
this like low volume node on this old

56
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
this like low volume node on this old
 

57
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,350
this like low volume node on this old
shelf and we're trading back upside now

58
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
shelf and we're trading back upside now
 

59
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,510
shelf and we're trading back upside now
into like this thickest area that we've

60
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
into like this thickest area that we've
 

61
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,909
into like this thickest area that we've
traded in for quite some time since uh

62
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
traded in for quite some time since uh
 

63
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,749
traded in for quite some time since uh
basically October. All right, we keep

64
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
basically October. All right, we keep
 

65
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,950
basically October. All right, we keep
getting stuck up towards these 900s. So,

66
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
getting stuck up towards these 900s. So,
 

67
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,790
getting stuck up towards these 900s. So,
the same thing applies. It's exactly the

68
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
the same thing applies. It's exactly the
 

69
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,950
the same thing applies. It's exactly the
same levels as yesterday. We can refine

70
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
same levels as yesterday. We can refine
 

71
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,469
same levels as yesterday. We can refine
stuff a little bit this morning. We have

72
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
stuff a little bit this morning. We have
 

73
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,309
stuff a little bit this morning. We have
caught a bit on the 20-day. We're

74
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
caught a bit on the 20-day. We're
 

75
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,270
caught a bit on the 20-day. We're
trading back upside. Um chips have had a

76
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
trading back upside. Um chips have had a
 

77
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,869
trading back upside. Um chips have had a
little bit more strength this morning of

78
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
little bit more strength this morning of
 

79
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,550
little bit more strength this morning of
some news. Um, we can go through all

80
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
some news. Um, we can go through all
 

81
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,710
some news. Um, we can go through all
that shortly. Right. Let's just make

82
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
that shortly. Right. Let's just make
 

83
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,230
that shortly. Right. Let's just make
sure you're set up here and can see

84
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
sure you're set up here and can see
 

85
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,695
sure you're set up here and can see
everything on the hourly.

86
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:04,705
everything on the hourly.
 

87
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,790
everything on the hourly.
[snorts] All right.

88
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
[snorts] All right.
 

89
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,670
[snorts] All right.
So, where are we at? Well, yesterday you

90
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
So, where are we at? Well, yesterday you
 

91
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,629
So, where are we at? Well, yesterday you
can see we came outside the previous

92
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
can see we came outside the previous
 

93
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,110
can see we came outside the previous
week point of control. We faded down in

94
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
week point of control. We faded down in
 

95
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,950
week point of control. We faded down in
the afternoon session eventually losing

96
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
the afternoon session eventually losing
 

97
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,629
the afternoon session eventually losing
that bid. We talked about in Discord

98
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
that bid. We talked about in Discord
 

99
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,430
that bid. We talked about in Discord
this fade of the 800s, right? Once they

100
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
this fade of the 800s, right? Once they
 

101
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,070
this fade of the 800s, right? Once they
lost the 800s, it was game over, right?

102
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
lost the 800s, it was game over, right?
 

103
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,230
lost the 800s, it was game over, right?
It meant all the bulls got caught who

104
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
It meant all the bulls got caught who
 

105
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,790
It meant all the bulls got caught who
were trading inside and we got that

106
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
were trading inside and we got that
 

107
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,510
were trading inside and we got that
flush down. Uh this same trigger point,

108
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
flush down. Uh this same trigger point,
 

109
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,190
flush down. Uh this same trigger point,
right? This flush down. Same trigger

110
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
right? This flush down. Same trigger
 

111
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,949
right? This flush down. Same trigger
point as we had here. Flush down. Same

112
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
point as we had here. Flush down. Same
 

113
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,550
point as we had here. Flush down. Same
trigger point. So the same levels are

114
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
trigger point. So the same levels are
 

115
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,110
trigger point. So the same levels are
playing out over and over and over again

116
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
playing out over and over and over again
 

117
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,029
playing out over and over and over again
for this move here. Same as this move

118
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
for this move here. Same as this move
 

119
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,389
for this move here. Same as this move
here. All right. This is your trigger

120
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
here. All right. This is your trigger
 

121
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,110
here. All right. This is your trigger
point up into these 800s

122
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
point up into these 800s
 

123
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,949
point up into these 800s
overnight. All right. Once we tagged

124
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
overnight. All right. Once we tagged
 

125
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,790
overnight. All right. Once we tagged
this previous week point of control, we

126
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
this previous week point of control, we
 

127
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,030
this previous week point of control, we
reclaimed current week value area low,

128
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
reclaimed current week value area low,
 

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,790
reclaimed current week value area low,
this little node, and we started

130
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
this little node, and we started
 

131
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,230
this little node, and we started
drifting upside. And now we're getting

132
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
drifting upside. And now we're getting
 

133
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,550
drifting upside. And now we're getting
stuck at the current week point of

134
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
stuck at the current week point of
 

135
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,310
stuck at the current week point of
control, right? Current developing

136
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
control, right? Current developing
 

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,910
control, right? Current developing
profile point of control and the

138
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
profile point of control and the
 

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,350
profile point of control and the
previous day point of control.

140
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
previous day point of control.
 

141
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,509
previous day point of control.
Everything overheads right now. So we

142
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
Everything overheads right now. So we
 

143
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,990
Everything overheads right now. So we
are stuck in a small rotation. If we

144
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
are stuck in a small rotation. If we
 

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,509
are stuck in a small rotation. If we
zoom into this, if we think about

146
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
zoom into this, if we think about
 

147
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,750
zoom into this, if we think about
yesterday's value area low right here,

148
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
yesterday's value area low right here,
 

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,750
yesterday's value area low right here,
we are back inside yesterday's value. So

150
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
we are back inside yesterday's value. So
 

151
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,590
we are back inside yesterday's value. So
if we think about this, this was most of

152
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
if we think about this, this was most of
 

153
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,430
if we think about this, this was most of
yesterday's. It means we're not finding

154
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
yesterday's. It means we're not finding
 

155
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,150
yesterday's. It means we're not finding
acceptance outside of yesterday's value.

156
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
acceptance outside of yesterday's value.
 

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,550
acceptance outside of yesterday's value.
We are still inside of this current

158
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
We are still inside of this current
 

159
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,790
We are still inside of this current
week's value. Okay, when we think about

160
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
week's value. Okay, when we think about
 

161
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,949
week's value. Okay, when we think about
this current week, we are not able to

162
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
this current week, we are not able to
 

163
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,030
this current week, we are not able to
trade outside for downside pressure,

164
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
trade outside for downside pressure,
 

165
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,790
trade outside for downside pressure,
right? We absorbed the bid there

166
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
right? We absorbed the bid there
 

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,350
right? We absorbed the bid there
yesterday. So, we're trading in a

168
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
yesterday. So, we're trading in a
 

169
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,670
yesterday. So, we're trading in a
rotation. It is as simple as that.

170
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
rotation. It is as simple as that.
 

171
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,750
rotation. It is as simple as that.
Mainly in this node here, same as

172
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
Mainly in this node here, same as
 

173
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,509
Mainly in this node here, same as
yesterday. We spent most the time in

174
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
yesterday. We spent most the time in
 

175
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,509
yesterday. We spent most the time in
this node before we faded away and we're

176
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
this node before we faded away and we're
 

177
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,350
this node before we faded away and we're
right back in that. No acceptance below

178
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
right back in that. No acceptance below
 

179
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,070
right back in that. No acceptance below
it. So, really, we're stuck between 800

180
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
it. So, really, we're stuck between 800
 

181
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,150
it. So, really, we're stuck between 800
and 900. All right. This is your kind of

182
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
and 900. All right. This is your kind of
 

183
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,190
and 900. All right. This is your kind of
key level. this 800 here. All right,

184
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
key level. this 800 here. All right,
 

185
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,990
key level. this 800 here. All right,
this low volume node is being protected.

186
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
this low volume node is being protected.
 

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,269
this low volume node is being protected.
Every time we come down there, we're

188
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
Every time we come down there, we're
 

189
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,030
Every time we come down there, we're
finding a bid. So all the time we're

190
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
finding a bid. So all the time we're
 

191
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,110
finding a bid. So all the time we're
holding 800, it's looking to rotate back

192
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
holding 800, it's looking to rotate back
 

193
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,110
holding 800, it's looking to rotate back
into what? This high volume node. All

194
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
into what? This high volume node. All
 

195
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,030
into what? This high volume node. All
right, so we're trading between these

196
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
right, so we're trading between these
 

197
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,110
right, so we're trading between these
building out liquidities. The same

198
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
building out liquidities. The same
 

199
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,870
building out liquidities. The same
levels as yesterday. Okay, if we find

200
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
levels as yesterday. Okay, if we find
 

201
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,509
levels as yesterday. Okay, if we find
acceptance through 900 and certainly

202
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
acceptance through 900 and certainly
 

203
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,470
acceptance through 900 and certainly
through the edge of this 925, then maybe

204
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
through the edge of this 925, then maybe
 

205
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,150
through the edge of this 925, then maybe
there's a drift higher. But just like

206
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
there's a drift higher. But just like
 

207
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,829
there's a drift higher. But just like
yesterday, you got to be very careful of

208
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
yesterday, you got to be very careful of
 

209
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,470
yesterday, you got to be very careful of
a failed breakout. If we come under the

210
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
a failed breakout. If we come under the
 

211
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,110
a failed breakout. If we come under the
800s and we start getting stuck, okay,

212
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
800s and we start getting stuck, okay,
 

213
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,269
800s and we start getting stuck, okay,
then maybe we lose the bid and we trade

214
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
then maybe we lose the bid and we trade
 

215
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,430
then maybe we lose the bid and we trade
back down into the first point would be

216
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
back down into the first point would be
 

217
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,710
back down into the first point would be
this node here, 55, 755s. And if we lose

218
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
this node here, 55, 755s. And if we lose
 

219
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,030
this node here, 55, 755s. And if we lose
that previous week point of control,

220
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
that previous week point of control,
 

221
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,949
that previous week point of control,
it's really gets interesting if we lose

222
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
it's really gets interesting if we lose
 

223
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,550
it's really gets interesting if we lose
previous week point of control. That's

224
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
previous week point of control. That's
 

225
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,230
previous week point of control. That's
when we then suddenly have room because

226
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
when we then suddenly have room because
 

227
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,230
when we then suddenly have room because
we're trading outside of current week's

228
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
we're trading outside of current week's
 

229
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,750
we're trading outside of current week's
value and we can look for some of these

230
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
value and we can look for some of these
 

231
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,630
value and we can look for some of these
nodes, 550s,

232
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
nodes, 550s,
 

233
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,269
nodes, 550s,
uh, 500s, and even lower. So, these are

234
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
uh, 500s, and even lower. So, these are
 

235
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,430
uh, 500s, and even lower. So, these are
the edges I want to play for. I don't

236
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
the edges I want to play for. I don't
 

237
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,269
the edges I want to play for. I don't
really want to participate in here. I'm

238
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
really want to participate in here. I'm
 

239
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,710
really want to participate in here. I'm
going to be honest with you. All right.

240
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
going to be honest with you. All right.
 

241
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,790
going to be honest with you. All right.
Market showing in here. Doesn't really

242
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
Market showing in here. Doesn't really
 

243
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,630
Market showing in here. Doesn't really
know what it wants to do. But chips are

244
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
know what it wants to do. But chips are
 

245
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,990
know what it wants to do. But chips are
a little stronger this morning. So, it

246
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
a little stronger this morning. So, it
 

247
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,310
a little stronger this morning. So, it
really depends if we're going to find a

248
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
really depends if we're going to find a
 

249
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,470
really depends if we're going to find a
sustained bid on those chips. Okay. So,

250
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
sustained bid on those chips. Okay. So,
 

251
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,990
sustained bid on those chips. Okay. So,
if we have a look at this 5minute chart,

252
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
if we have a look at this 5minute chart,
 

253
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,430
if we have a look at this 5minute chart,
you can see overnight, right? We closed

254
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
you can see overnight, right? We closed
 

255
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,150
you can see overnight, right? We closed
down here. We caught this bid, right?

256
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
down here. We caught this bid, right?
 

257
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,310
down here. We caught this bid, right?
20-day, 5day. Look at that mean

258
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
20-day, 5day. Look at that mean
 

259
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,150
20-day, 5day. Look at that mean
reversion complete. 20-day, 5day.

260
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
reversion complete. 20-day, 5day.
 

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,509
reversion complete. 20-day, 5day.
Remember this low was also uh the uh

262
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
Remember this low was also uh the uh
 

263
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,069
Remember this low was also uh the uh
50-day down here somewhere. All right.

264
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
50-day down here somewhere. All right.
 

265
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,310
50-day down here somewhere. All right.
So, we've caught the bid and we trade

266
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
So, we've caught the bid and we trade
 

267
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,630
So, we've caught the bid and we trade
back upside in Asia. Trade back upside

268
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
back upside in Asia. Trade back upside
 

269
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,190
back upside in Asia. Trade back upside
in London. Little dip back down to the

270
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
in London. Little dip back down to the
 

271
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,069
in London. Little dip back down to the
200. Find the bid on a 5m minute back up

272
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
200. Find the bid on a 5m minute back up
 

273
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,949
200. Find the bid on a 5m minute back up
to supply up here. Fail supply and

274
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
to supply up here. Fail supply and
 

275
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,110
to supply up here. Fail supply and
trading between these levels. 100 point

276
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
trading between these levels. 100 point
 

277
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,910
trading between these levels. 100 point
range like I talked about.

278
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
range like I talked about.
 

279
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,030
range like I talked about.
All right, let's have a look at some of

280
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
All right, let's have a look at some of
 

281
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,870
All right, let's have a look at some of
the broader markets, some of the mag

282
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
the broader markets, some of the mag
 

283
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,550
the broader markets, some of the mag
name, see what we've got going on.

284
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
name, see what we've got going on.
 

285
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,310
name, see what we've got going on.
Oh, did not mean to do that. Sorry,

286
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
Oh, did not mean to do that. Sorry,
 

287
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,310
Oh, did not mean to do that. Sorry,
folks. Right, let's just clean this up a

288
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
folks. Right, let's just clean this up a
 

289
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,790
folks. Right, let's just clean this up a
second.

290
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
second.
 

291
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,269
second.
Move to a five minute.

292
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279

 

293
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,150

Okay, so back inside previous day. We're

294
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
Okay, so back inside previous day. We're
 

295
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,470
Okay, so back inside previous day. We're
back inside previous day and we're back

296
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
back inside previous day and we're back
 

297
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,790
back inside previous day and we're back
inside

298
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
inside
 

299
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,790
inside
current week and previous week. You need

300
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
current week and previous week. You need
 

301
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,629
current week and previous week. You need
to be aware of that.

302
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639

 

303
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,710

Yes.

304
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
Yes.
 

305
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,350
Yes.
Same kind of story,

306
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
Same kind of story,
 

307
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,230
Same kind of story,
right? Afternoon flush

308
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
right? Afternoon flush
 

309
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,030
right? Afternoon flush
came at what, like 1 2:00, 2:00

310
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
came at what, like 1 2:00, 2:00
 

311
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,949
came at what, like 1 2:00, 2:00
afternoon flush, but we've instantly bid

312
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
afternoon flush, but we've instantly bid
 

313
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,670
afternoon flush, but we've instantly bid
that back up into yesterday's supply.

314
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
that back up into yesterday's supply.
 

315
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,949
that back up into yesterday's supply.
All right, so we're trading between

316
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
All right, so we're trading between
 

317
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,550
All right, so we're trading between
these two levels. All right, here's

318
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
these two levels. All right, here's
 

319
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,870
these two levels. All right, here's
potential demand. Here's potential

320
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
potential demand. Here's potential
 

321
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,269
potential demand. Here's potential
supply. All right, so we are just stuck

322
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
supply. All right, so we are just stuck
 

323
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,310
supply. All right, so we are just stuck
between these until we find acceptance

324
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
between these until we find acceptance
 

325
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,829
between these until we find acceptance
one way or the other. You need to be

326
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
one way or the other. You need to be
 

327
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,069
one way or the other. You need to be
careful of look aboves and look belows

328
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
careful of look aboves and look belows
 

329
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,629
careful of look aboves and look belows
here if they fail. So, I really don't

330
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
here if they fail. So, I really don't
 

331
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,230
here if they fail. So, I really don't
really want to participate in here to

332
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
really want to participate in here to
 

333
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,750
really want to participate in here to
start my day off. Let's have a look at

334
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
start my day off. Let's have a look at
 

335
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,310
start my day off. Let's have a look at
the spiders.

336
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
the spiders.
 

337
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,710
the spiders.
95 is that big level. It's probably been

338
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
95 is that big level. It's probably been
 

339
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,030
95 is that big level. It's probably been
big level for some time now in terms of

340
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
big level for some time now in terms of
 

341
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,430
big level for some time now in terms of
uh gamma exposure.

342
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
uh gamma exposure.
 

343
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,670
uh gamma exposure.
So, right here you can see stuck there

344
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
So, right here you can see stuck there
 

345
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,190
So, right here you can see stuck there
yesterday. It's the same trigger point

346
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
yesterday. It's the same trigger point
 

347
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,670
yesterday. It's the same trigger point
today. In fact, we've put a little alert

348
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
today. In fact, we've put a little alert
 

349
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,870
today. In fact, we've put a little alert
there at 95s

350
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
there at 95s
 

351
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,269
there at 95s
and I'd say probably 90 is the downside.

352
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
and I'd say probably 90 is the downside.
 

353
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,870
and I'd say probably 90 is the downside.
It's got a way to go to get down into

354
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
It's got a way to go to get down into
 

355
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:16,150
It's got a way to go to get down into
there. So 95s. Why is alert failed?

356
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160

 

357
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,790

Okay, we've got some problems, have we?

358
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
Okay, we've got some problems, have we?
 

359
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,910
Okay, we've got some problems, have we?
They added some more bugs in here for

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
They added some more bugs in here for

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,870
They added some more bugs in here for
Trading View. Fantastic. Right, so 95s

362
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
Trading View. Fantastic. Right, so 95s
 

363
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,230
Trading View. Fantastic. Right, so 95s
is the trigger. If we get above that,

364
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
is the trigger. If we get above that,
 

365
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,829
is the trigger. If we get above that,
let's either look above and fail or look

366
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
let's either look above and fail or look
 

367
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,470
let's either look above and fail or look
above and base. So look above and base.

368
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
above and base. So look above and base.
 

369
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,990
above and base. So look above and base.
Look above and fail and back inside

370
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
Look above and fail and back inside
 

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,470
Look above and fail and back inside
range. And I'll watch the 92s to see how

372
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
range. And I'll watch the 92s to see how
 

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,230
range. And I'll watch the 92s to see how
we act somewhere down here. See if we

374
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
we act somewhere down here. See if we
 

375
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,509
we act somewhere down here. See if we
find a bid down here. That would be

376
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
find a bid down here. That would be
 

377
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,910
find a bid down here. That would be
important. Q. Same kind of story. All

378
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
important. Q. Same kind of story. All
 

379
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,030
important. Q. Same kind of story. All
right. It's trying to get back above 26s

380
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
right. It's trying to get back above 26s
 

381
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,470
right. It's trying to get back above 26s
and 27s really to get going. If we lose

382
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
and 27s really to get going. If we lose
 

383
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,790
and 27s really to get going. If we lose
this bid at 20s, then it's night night

384
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
this bid at 20s, then it's night night
 

385
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,150
this bid at 20s, then it's night night
probably and we're going to go for full

386
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
probably and we're going to go for full
 

387
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,790
probably and we're going to go for full
rotation. Dixie still trying to get back

388
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
rotation. Dixie still trying to get back
 

389
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,990
rotation. Dixie still trying to get back
up to those hundreds. This is

390
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
up to those hundreds. This is
 

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,710
up to those hundreds. This is
interesting. All right. Now, breakout

392
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
interesting. All right. Now, breakout
 

393
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,470
interesting. All right. Now, breakout
trading back down into this support

394
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
trading back down into this support
 

395
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,310
trading back down into this support

Trading between these ranges. All right.

406
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
Trading between these ranges. All right.
 

407
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,910
Trading between these ranges. All right.
You can see between here and here. It

408
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
You can see between here and here. It
 

409
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,910
You can see between here and here. It
cannot get out of this. It's stuck in

410
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
cannot get out of this. It's stuck in
 

411
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,310
cannot get out of this. It's stuck in
here. If VIX stays stuck in this box, we

412
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
here. If VIX stays stuck in this box, we
 

413
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,750
here. If VIX stays stuck in this box, we
will also stay stuck in a box. Right.

414
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
will also stay stuck in a box. Right.
 

415
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,990
will also stay stuck in a box. Right.
Have a look at the mag.

416
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
Have a look at the mag.
 

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,910
Have a look at the mag.
Apple inside of yesterday's range, but

418
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
Apple inside of yesterday's range, but
 

419
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,710
Apple inside of yesterday's range, but
gapping down. So, between PDC and PDL.

420
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
gapping down. So, between PDC and PDL.
 

421
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,790
gapping down. So, between PDC and PDL.
So, not very strong there to start the

422
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
So, not very strong there to start the
 

423
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,829
So, not very strong there to start the
day on Apple. Amazon has found a bit of

424
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
day on Apple. Amazon has found a bit of
 

425
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,910
day on Apple. Amazon has found a bit of
a bid, a bit of a gap up, tagging into

426
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
a bid, a bit of a gap up, tagging into
 

427
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,069
a bid, a bit of a gap up, tagging into
previous days high, pre-market, flushing

428
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
previous days high, pre-market, flushing
 

429
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,590
previous days high, pre-market, flushing
back down. So, that's going to be the

430
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
back down. So, that's going to be the
 

431
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,509
back down. So, that's going to be the
trigger there on Amazon. Can it get back

432
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
trigger there on Amazon. Can it get back
 

433
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,230
trigger there on Amazon. Can it get back
through previous day high and start to

434
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
through previous day high and start to
 

435
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,910
through previous day high and start to
reclaim some of these key levels is

436
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
reclaim some of these key levels is
 

437
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,910
reclaim some of these key levels is
definitely starting to box out here. All

438
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
definitely starting to box out here. All
 

439
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,670
definitely starting to box out here. All
right, but you want to be careful if it

440
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
right, but you want to be careful if it
 

441
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,150
right, but you want to be careful if it
does a failed look. But if it can

442
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
does a failed look. But if it can
 

443
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,710
does a failed look. But if it can
sustain, then great. Many of these, I

444
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
sustain, then great. Many of these, I
 

445
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,069
sustain, then great. Many of these, I
would imagine, might uh be waiting for

446
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
would imagine, might uh be waiting for
 

447
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,069
would imagine, might uh be waiting for
earnings over the next week or two.

448
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
earnings over the next week or two.
 

449
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,590
earnings over the next week or two.
Remember, earnings have already started.

450
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
Remember, earnings have already started.
 

451
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,230
Remember, earnings have already started.
We've started to see some of the uh

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
We've started to see some of the uh
 

453
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,829
We've started to see some of the uh
financial sector names which haven't

financial sector names which haven't

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,030
financial sector names which haven't
been too good to be honest but uh uh

Taiwan Semiconductors was decent

458
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
Taiwan Semiconductors was decent
 

459
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,670
Taiwan Semiconductors was decent
yesterday. All right, Google gap up

460
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
yesterday. All right, Google gap up
 

461
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,670
yesterday. All right, Google gap up
previous day low left there. We did not

462
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
previous day low left there. We did not
 

463
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,509
previous day low left there. We did not
sweep. So, it's protected this low at

464
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
sweep. So, it's protected this low at
 

465
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,509
sweep. So, it's protected this low at
31. You want to be careful if that 31

466
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
31. You want to be careful if that 31
 

467
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,110
31. You want to be careful if that 31
breaks now because you got lots of buyer

468
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
breaks now because you got lots of buyer
 

469
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,269
breaks now because you got lots of buyer
stops there and kind of boxed in as

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
stops there and kind of boxed in as
 

471
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,189
stops there and kind of boxed in as
well. But we are gapping up, right? As

long as it holds a bid over 34, it's

474
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
long as it holds a bid over 34, it's
 

475
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,790
long as it holds a bid over 34, it's
going to try and get back up to those

476
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
going to try and get back up to those
 

477
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,189
going to try and get back up to those
highs of yesterday of 39. So watching

478
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
highs of yesterday of 39. So watching
 

479
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,269
highs of yesterday of 39. So watching
Google to hold a bid of 34 if it fails

480
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
Google to hold a bid of 34 if it fails
 

481
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:40,790
Google to hold a bid of 34 if it fails
that it's a leave alone buy side. Meta

482
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800

 

483
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,269

that's not pretty. It needs to hold a

484
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
that's not pretty. It needs to hold a
 

485
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,550
that's not pretty. It needs to hold a
bid over 19s to get going. Failing of

486
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
bid over 19s to get going. Failing of
 

487
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,150
bid over 19s to get going. Failing of
that bid will be mean that this is like

488
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
that bid will be mean that this is like
 

489
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,030
that bid will be mean that this is like
a two-leg building out liquidity versus

490
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
a two-leg building out liquidity versus
 

491
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,110
a two-leg building out liquidity versus
this and failure. So it's got to hold

492
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
this and failure. So it's got to hold
 

493
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,829
this and failure. So it's got to hold
19s and reclaim 26s really to get going.

494
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
19s and reclaim 26s really to get going.
 

495
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,310
19s and reclaim 26s really to get going.
If it fails 26 is on a push and then

496
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
If it fails 26 is on a push and then
 

497
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,150
If it fails 26 is on a push and then
loses 19s then we're going to make new

498
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
loses 19s then we're going to make new
 

499
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,110
loses 19s then we're going to make new
lows. So all to play for coming into

500
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
lows. So all to play for coming into
 

501
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,110
lows. So all to play for coming into

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,550

good. Nvidia, this is where it starts to

508
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
good. Nvidia, this is where it starts to
 

509
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,150
good. Nvidia, this is where it starts to
get interesting. All right, look at this

510
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
get interesting. All right, look at this
 

511
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,550
get interesting. All right, look at this
move yesterday. Right, this is all off

512
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560

Chip starting to look like they're maybe

516
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
Chip starting to look like they're maybe
 

517
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,629
Chip starting to look like they're maybe
stronger than imagined. Um, I think we

518
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
stronger than imagined. Um, I think we
 

519
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,350
stronger than imagined. Um, I think we
had some memory names this morning which

520
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
had some memory names this morning which
 

521
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,949
had some memory names this morning which
also looked pretty good. So, it probably

522
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
also looked pretty good. So, it probably
 

523
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,389
also looked pretty good. So, it probably
caught a bit of a bid off there. You're

524
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
caught a bit of a bid off there. You're
 

525
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,030
caught a bit of a bid off there. You're
looking for that 190 break on Nvidia.

526
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
looking for that 190 break on Nvidia.
 

527
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,629
looking for that 190 break on Nvidia.
190 break and then you'll be targeting

528
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
190 break and then you'll be targeting
 

529
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,030
190 break and then you'll be targeting
targeting 193s.

530
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
targeting 193s.
 

531
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,829
targeting 193s.
Just zoom this out a second.

532
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839

 

533
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,749

Yeah, 190 break to get to 193 194 and

534
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
Yeah, 190 break to get to 193 194 and
 

535
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,150
Yeah, 190 break to get to 193 194 and
then that 196 big big pivot. You can see

536
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
then that 196 big big pivot. You can see
 

537
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,389
then that 196 big big pivot. You can see
this day here 20th of November. Huge

538
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
this day here 20th of November. Huge
 

539
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,710
this day here 20th of November. Huge
pivot there. We're still boxed in in

Nvidia just like the rest of the market,

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
Nvidia just like the rest of the market,
 

543
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,870
Nvidia just like the rest of the market,
but it's uh stronger than the rest of

544
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
but it's uh stronger than the rest of
 

545
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,269
but it's uh stronger than the rest of
the mag or at least has been stronger

546
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
the mag or at least has been stronger
 

547
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,509
the mag or at least has been stronger
yesterday than the rest of the mag.

548
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
yesterday than the rest of the mag.

Tesla uh I think they it was a delay on

550
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
Tesla uh I think they it was a delay on
 

551
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,549
Tesla uh I think they it was a delay on
was it in Germany or some of the

552
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
was it in Germany or some of the
 

553
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,789
was it in Germany or some of the
European um lookins to some of their

554
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
European um lookins to some of their
 

555
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,909
European um lookins to some of their
automatic cars. So

556
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
automatic cars. So
 

557
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,510
automatic cars. So
I can't imagine that's necessarily

558
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,520
I can't imagine that's necessarily
 

559
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,029
I can't imagine that's necessarily
positive. Maybe just more sideways

560
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
positive. Maybe just more sideways
 

561
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,110
positive. Maybe just more sideways
action here while it makes its mind up.

562
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
action here while it makes its mind up.
 

563
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,829
action here while it makes its mind up.
And clearly one 440 big level and then

564
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
And clearly one 440 big level and then
 

565
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,870
And clearly one 440 big level and then
35s. All right, 40 and 35s. Do they hold

566
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
35s. All right, 40 and 35s. Do they hold
 

567
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,029
35s. All right, 40 and 35s. Do they hold
bids there? Can they get back above 50s

568
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
bids there? Can they get back above 50s
 

569
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,590
bids there? Can they get back above 50s
is going to be really really the level.

570
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
is going to be really really the level.
 

571
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,470
is going to be really really the level.
45s and 50s. Uh let's have a look at

572
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
45s and 50s. Uh let's have a look at
 

573
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,630
45s and 50s. Uh let's have a look at
some of the other chips. Oracle that

574
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
some of the other chips. Oracle that
 

575
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,070
some of the other chips. Oracle that
does not look good. So it's not catching

576
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
does not look good. So it's not catching
 

577
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,150
does not look good. So it's not catching
a bit. AMD should be okay. Yeah, AMD

578
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
a bit. AMD should be okay. Yeah, AMD
 

579
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,150
a bit. AMD should be okay. Yeah, AMD
looks good. That's a great start to the

580
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
looks good. That's a great start to the
 

581
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,870
looks good. That's a great start to the
day on AMD. So really question, can it

582
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
day on AMD. So really question, can it
 

583
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,430
day on AMD. So really question, can it
break above the 38s and get going on

584
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
break above the 38s and get going on
 

585
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,350
break above the 38s and get going on
AMD? Big question mark, but that's what

586
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
AMD? Big question mark, but that's what
 

587
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,390
AMD? Big question mark, but that's what
they'd be looking to do on an extension.

588
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
they'd be looking to do on an extension.
 

589
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,230
they'd be looking to do on an extension.
And let's have just a quick look at some

590
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
And let's have just a quick look at some
 

591
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,070
And let's have just a quick look at some
of these names down here. How long we

592
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
of these names down here. How long we
 

593
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,029
of these names down here. How long we
got? We've got time right boxed in

594
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
got? We've got time right boxed in
 

595
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,710
got? We've got time right boxed in
NQ

596
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
NQ
 

597
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,029
NQ
boxed in. That looks a little bit weak

598
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
boxed in. That looks a little bit weak
 

599
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,390
boxed in. That looks a little bit weak
there to be honest. NVTS,

600
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
there to be honest. NVTS,
 

601
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,909
there to be honest. NVTS,
same story. We're just not going

602
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
same story. We're just not going
 

603
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,789
same story. We're just not going
anywhere. RGTI, same story. These are

604
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
anywhere. RGTI, same story. These are
 

605
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,230
anywhere. RGTI, same story. These are
just messy charts. We're going to have

606
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
just messy charts. We're going to have
 

607
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,909
just messy charts. We're going to have
to wait for hopefully earnings get us

608
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
to wait for hopefully earnings get us
 

609
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,669
to wait for hopefully earnings get us
out of some of this.

610
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679

 

611
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,830

Yeah.

612
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
Yeah.
 

613
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,230
Yeah.
Okay. So, yeah. No, I would say coming

614
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
Okay. So, yeah. No, I would say coming
 

615
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,950
Okay. So, yeah. No, I would say coming
into the session, there's no uh setup

616
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960
into the session, there's no uh setup
 

617
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,950
into the session, there's no uh setup
here, which I'm extremely excited about.

618
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
here, which I'm extremely excited about.
 

619
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,350
here, which I'm extremely excited about.

this through now. There we go. Nice.
We have a little imbalance here into

776
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:23,039
We have a little imbalance here into
 

777
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,029
We have a little imbalance here into
87s. There's your imbalance. See if they

778
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
87s. There's your imbalance. See if they
 

779
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,390
87s. There's your imbalance. See if they
squeeze through this to previous day

780
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
squeeze through this to previous day
 

781
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,350
squeeze through this to previous day
point of control. So, they're trying to

782
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
point of control. So, they're trying to
 

783
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,230
point of control. So, they're trying to
get to the 900s like we talked about.

784
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240

 

785
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,789

Watch this New York open. Now, if they

786
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
Watch this New York open. Now, if they
 

787
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,070
Watch this New York open. Now, if they
hold a dip into New York open

788
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
hold a dip into New York open
 

789
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,070
hold a dip into New York open
or that extension into the 900s, they

790
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
or that extension into the 900s, they
 

791
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,350
or that extension into the 900s, they
lose New York open, you'll probably get

792
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
lose New York open, you'll probably get
 

793
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,270
lose New York open, you'll probably get
a rotation back down to 800 again. So,

794
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
a rotation back down to 800 again. So,
 

795
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,149
a rotation back down to 800 again. So,
here's the New York Open.

796
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,159
here's the New York Open.
 

797
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,990
here's the New York Open.
They're trying to dip the New York Open.

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
They're trying to dip the New York Open.
 

799
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,390
They're trying to dip the New York Open.
They're trying to get up to the 900s.

800
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400

 

801
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,270

There's a big big seller up there at 84.

817
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,350

because there was a massive seller up

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
because there was a massive seller up

interestingly. What's Nvidia doing at
 

903
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,630
interestingly. What's Nvidia doing at
the 89s? The 90 break is the big level.

904
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
the 89s? The 90 break is the big level.

913
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,110
through yet. Here's the push back
towards the New York Open. Like we said,

914
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
towards the New York Open. Like we said,
 

915
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,710
towards the New York Open. Like we said,
they need to get through here if they're

916
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
they need to get through here if they're
 

917
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,230
they need to get through here if they're
going to force the squeeze. They cannot

918
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
going to force the squeeze. They cannot
 

919
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:27,190
going to force the squeeze. They cannot
just come up to here and do nothing.

920
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200

 

921
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,510

Big big level here. This New York open.

922
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
Big big level here. This New York open.
 

923
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,870
Big big level here. This New York open.
They get through here, there's a chance

924
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
They get through here, there's a chance
 

925
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,630
They get through here, there's a chance
for a squeeze back up to the highs. The

926
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
for a squeeze back up to the highs. The
 

927
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,230
for a squeeze back up to the highs. The
sellers came in very very aggressively

928
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
sellers came in very very aggressively
 

929
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,630
sellers came in very very aggressively
at 85. So

930
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
at 85. So
 

931
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,070
at 85. So
right here, there were some big market

932
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080

But Google and Amazon just gone red. We

But Google and Amazon just gone red. We

But Google and Amazon just gone red. We

are just stuck. It might be that we have
 

1097
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:52,149

1099
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,830

Rick, I trade based on what's in front

1100

Rick, I trade based on what's in front
 

1101
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,149
Rick, I trade based on what's in front
of me. If there's a trade out the gate

1102
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
of me. If there's a trade out the gate
 

1103
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,149
of me. If there's a trade out the gate
and I can see participants stuck in a

and I can see participants stuck in a
 

1105
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,830
and I can see participants stuck in a
clear level to trade to, I will trade

1106
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
clear level to trade to, I will trade
 

1107
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,029
clear level to trade to, I will trade
it. If not, I don't. There's I It's not

1108
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
it. If not, I don't. There's I It's not
 

1109
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,789
it. If not, I don't. There's I It's not
for me. It's not a hard rule of like I

1110
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
for me. It's not a hard rule of like I
 

1111
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,310
for me. It's not a hard rule of like I
have to wait 15 minutes or I have to

1112
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
have to wait 15 minutes or I have to
 

1113
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,830
have to wait 15 minutes or I have to
wait 30 minutes. Back in the day I used

1114
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
wait 30 minutes. Back in the day I used
 

1115
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,190
wait 30 minutes. Back in the day I used
to have a rule like that. But I don't

1116
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
to have a rule like that. But I don't
 

1117
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,350
to have a rule like that. But I don't
need that rule now. I will trade the

1118
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
need that rule now. I will trade the
 

1119
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,870
need that rule now. I will trade the
liquidity in front of me. If there's a

1120
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
liquidity in front of me. If there's a
 

1121
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,350
liquidity in front of me. If there's a
clear clear sentiment move and I know

1122
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
clear clear sentiment move and I know
 

1123
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,190
clear clear sentiment move and I know
one side stuck, I'll trade it. If not,

1124
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,200
one side stuck, I'll trade it. If not,
 

1125
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,590
one side stuck, I'll trade it. If not,
like today I didn't trade it. So today I

1126
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
like today I didn't trade it. So today I
 

1127
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,310
like today I didn't trade it. So today I
waited for a dip down here looking for

1128
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,320
waited for a dip down here looking for
 

1129
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,909
waited for a dip down here looking for
that push and got stopped out.

1130
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919

 

1131
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,350

Right? You're coming back into where

1132
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
Right? You're coming back into where
 

1133
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,230
Right? You're coming back into where
these uh sellers got came in earlier

1134
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
these uh sellers got came in earlier
 

1135
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,630
these uh sellers got came in earlier
into 82 and above. All right? So, you

1136
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,640
into 82 and above. All right? So, you
 

1137
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,149
into 82 and above. All right? So, you
need to clear them and they will start

1138
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:36,159
need to clear them and they will start
 

1139
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,669
need to clear them and they will start
to stop out. Then, if they stop out,

1140
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:37,679
to stop out. Then, if they stop out,
 

1141
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,430
to stop out. Then, if they stop out,
they become market buyers and you've got

1142
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:39,440
they become market buyers and you've got
 

1143
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,789
they become market buyers and you've got
the chance to move higher. So, anyone

1144
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:40,799
the chance to move higher. So, anyone
 

1145
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,269
the chance to move higher. So, anyone
who's still holding this dip and 34s,

1146
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
who's still holding this dip and 34s,
 

1147
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,630
who's still holding this dip and 34s,
right? You're trying to get through

1148
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
right? You're trying to get through
 

1149
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,590
right? You're trying to get through
these 82s. 82s is a big level. If you

1150
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600
these 82s. 82s is a big level. If you
 

1151
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,190
these 82s. 82s is a big level. If you
can get through 82s, you can get up

1152
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
can get through 82s, you can get up
 

1153
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,269
can get through 82s, you can get up
here, right? That's where you're trying

1154
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:51,279
here, right? That's where you're trying
 

1155
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,269
here, right? That's where you're trying
to get.

1156
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
to get.

to get.
We keep getting stuck in this node. This

We keep getting stuck in this node. This
 

1159
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,230
We keep getting stuck in this node. This
is a big level from yesterday. It's the

is a big level from yesterday. It's the
 

1161
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,909
is a big level from yesterday. It's the
big level from the week. You can see it

1162
00:30:59,909 --> 00:30:59,919
big level from the week. You can see it
 

1163
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,470
big level from the week. You can see it
on this chart here to make it make sense

1164
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
on this chart here to make it make sense
 

1165
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,149
on this chart here to make it make sense
for you. Right? We keep getting stuck

1166
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
for you. Right? We keep getting stuck
 

1167
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,110
for you. Right? We keep getting stuck
here and here. Right? So, we're trying

1168
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,120
here and here. Right? So, we're trying
 

1169
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,149
here and here. Right? So, we're trying
to trade from here to here. The question

1170
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
to trade from here to here. The question
 

1171
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,149
to trade from here to here. The question
is, can we find acceptance over that? If

1172
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
is, can we find acceptance over that? If
 

1173
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,590
is, can we find acceptance over that? If
we keep getting stuck from here to here,

1174
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
we keep getting stuck from here to here,
 

1175
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,510
we keep getting stuck from here to here,
eventually it's possible that they come

1176
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:17,520
eventually it's possible that they come
 

1177
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:26,789
eventually it's possible that they come
for this rotation.

1178
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:26,799

 

1179
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,269

Not a very pretty market this morning.

1180
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
Not a very pretty market this morning.
 

1181
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,470
Not a very pretty market this morning.
We have moved uh 56 points so far in the

We have moved uh 56 points so far in the

We have moved uh 56 points so far in the

1185
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,710

Nvidia's doing the work. It's through

1186
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,720
Nvidia's doing the work. It's through
 

1187
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,190
Nvidia's doing the work. It's through
the 190s, but the rest of the market not

1188
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,200
the 190s, but the rest of the market not
 

1189
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:51,909
the 190s, but the rest of the market not
really willing to join in.

1190

1191
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,669

No bid on Apple, Amazon, and Google,

1192
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:57,679

 

1193
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,350

but maybe back down to these value area

1194
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
but maybe back down to these value area
 

1195
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,710
but maybe back down to these value area
lows again. If they can't do this move

1196
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720
lows again. If they can't do this move
 

1197
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,389
lows again. If they can't do this move
here and they keep getting stuck,

1198
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
here and they keep getting stuck,
 

1199
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,990
here and they keep getting stuck,
they'll come for the rotation again. If

1200
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
they'll come for the rotation again. If
 

1201
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,549
they'll come for the rotation again. If
we lose this, we've got targets down

1202
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:08,559
we lose this, we've got targets down
 

1203
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:28,310
we lose this, we've got targets down
below that they might want to wash to.

1204
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,320

 

1205
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,149

They come back down to value again.

1206
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:30,159
They come back down to value again.
 

1207
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,990
They come back down to value again.
Let's see if they hold this or if we're

1208
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's see if they hold this or if we're
 

1209
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,669
Let's see if they hold this or if we're
going to wash this out. Come and attack.

1210
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
going to wash this out. Come and attack.
 

1211

1213
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:56,789

Very possible they lose it.

1214
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:56,799

 

1215
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:07,350

into the 25s on the cues.

1216

1217
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,029

I've seen a lot of people either

1218
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,039
I've seen a lot of people either
 

1219
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,110
I've seen a lot of people either
skipping this and yesterday's PR getting

1220
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
skipping this and yesterday's PR getting
 

1221
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,630
skipping this and yesterday's PR getting
chopped up. Would you say it's advisable

1222
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
chopped up. Would you say it's advisable
 

1223
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,149
chopped up. Would you say it's advisable
to sit to sit this sort of range out to

1224
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
to sit to sit this sort of range out to
 

1225
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,590
to sit to sit this sort of range out to
leave the range alone? I mean, if you

1226
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:17,600
leave the range alone? I mean, if you
 

1227
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,070
leave the range alone? I mean, if you
don't like trading range, yes. Um, but

1228
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
don't like trading range, yes. Um, but
 

1229
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,990
don't like trading range, yes. Um, but
there were opportunities yesterday. We

1230
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,000
there were opportunities yesterday. We
 

1231
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,950
there were opportunities yesterday. We
had three green trades on on stream and

1232
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
had three green trades on on stream and
 

1233
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,789
had three green trades on on stream and
uh those in Discord if they took the

1234
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:26,799
uh those in Discord if they took the
 

1235
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,070
uh those in Discord if they took the
fade. I don't know if they did for the

1236
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
fade. I don't know if they did for the
 

1237
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,389
fade. I don't know if they did for the
800 that I called out. There was a nice

1238
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:30,399
800 that I called out. There was a nice
 

1239
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,909
800 that I called out. There was a nice
move there yesterday as well. It's about

1240
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:31,919
move there yesterday as well. It's about
 

1241
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,310
move there yesterday as well. It's about
patience and knowing what your trading

1242
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,320
patience and knowing what your trading
 

1243
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,830
patience and knowing what your trading
style is, right? If you're a range

1244
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
style is, right? If you're a range
 

1245
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,269
style is, right? If you're a range
trader, this should be your bread and

1246
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
trader, this should be your bread and
 

1247
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,029
trader, this should be your bread and
butter. [snorts] If you're not a range

1248
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
butter. [snorts] If you're not a range
 

1249
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,710
butter. [snorts] If you're not a range
trader, then maybe it's more of a leave

1250
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:40,720
trader, then maybe it's more of a leave
 

1251
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,870
trader, then maybe it's more of a leave
alone. Like, I'm very fussy with stuff

1252
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:42,880
alone. Like, I'm very fussy with stuff
 

1253
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,830
alone. Like, I'm very fussy with stuff
like this, as you well know. [snorts]

1254
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840

 

1255
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,070

Yeah, I can see that on CVD.

1256
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,080

 

1257
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,669

You know, we're not breaking lower. So,

1258
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679

 

1259
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,190

sometimes see that as the opposite way.

1260
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,200
sometimes see that as the opposite way.
 

1261
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,789
sometimes see that as the opposite way.
It means someone's trying to absorb. The

1262
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:02,799
It means someone's trying to absorb. The
 

1263
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,470
It means someone's trying to absorb. The
question is, are they able to keep

1264
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
question is, are they able to keep
 

1265
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,830
question is, are they able to keep
bidding and bidding and bidding and

1266
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:05,840
bidding and bidding and bidding and
 

1267
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,750
bidding and bidding and bidding and
bidding endlessly or not? Because if

1268
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
bidding endlessly or not? Because if
 

1269
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,270
bidding endlessly or not? Because if
not, they're going to get broken. But

1270
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,280
not, they're going to get broken. But
 

1271
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,629
not, they're going to get broken. But
I'm just not seeing much on the tape

1272
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
I'm just not seeing much on the tape
 

1273
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,950
I'm just not seeing much on the tape
here. Like, we're very, very, very slow

1274
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
here. Like, we're very, very, very slow
 

1275
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,190
here. Like, we're very, very, very slow
here this morning. Very slow.

1276
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,200
here this morning. Very slow.
 

1277
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,149
here this morning. Very slow.
We've moved 50 points, right? Back into

1278
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:20,159
We've moved 50 points, right? Back into
 

1279
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,470
We've moved 50 points, right? Back into
24-hour VW up. Back into previous week

1280
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480
24-hour VW up. Back into previous week
 

1281
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,829
24-hour VW up. Back into previous week
low. Back into previous day value low.

1282
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:25,839
low. Back into previous day value low.
 

1283
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,030
low. Back into previous day value low.
We're very slow.

1284
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040

 

1285
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,470

Let's get some volume on here now that

1286
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:32,480
Let's get some volume on here now that
 

1287
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:47,499
Let's get some volume on here now that
we've been here a minute.

1288
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:47,509

 

1289
00:34:47,509 --> 00:35:02,550

>> [sighs]

1290
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560

 

1291
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,150

>> VIX finding a bit of a bid here on

previous days low. That's not good for

1294
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:05,839
previous days low. That's not good for
 

1295
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,589
previous days low. That's not good for
the market.

1296
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:07,599
the market.
 

1297
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,270
the market.
We're [snorts] at that 24-hour VW up in

1298
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,280
We're [snorts] at that 24-hour VW up in
 

1299
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,870
We're [snorts] at that 24-hour VW up in
those value area lows. question is, do

1300
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
those value area lows. question is, do
 

1301
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,790
those value area lows. question is, do
they rebid this again or are they going

1302
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800
they rebid this again or are they going
 

1303
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,589
they rebid this again or are they going
to flush lower? I genuinely don't know

1304
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
to flush lower? I genuinely don't know
 

1305
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,670
to flush lower? I genuinely don't know
here, folks, because it's so slow. All I

1306
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,680
here, folks, because it's so slow. All I
 

1307
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,990
here, folks, because it's so slow. All I
know is there's a shelf here at 46 and

1308
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
know is there's a shelf here at 46 and
 

1309
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,750
know is there's a shelf here at 46 and
uh we're not able to get above. So,

1310
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
uh we're not able to get above. So,
 

1311
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,510
uh we're not able to get above. So,
through 50, maybe they squeeze back up

1312
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
through 50, maybe they squeeze back up
 

1313
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,030
through 50, maybe they squeeze back up
to 60s, but I mean, you're talking about

1314
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
to 60s, but I mean, you're talking about
 

1315
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,950
to 60s, but I mean, you're talking about
10 points. It's pointless, pointless.

1316
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:28,960
10 points. It's pointless, pointless.
 

1317
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,550
10 points. It's pointless, pointless.
All the time they keep rejecting 50s,

1318
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:30,560
All the time they keep rejecting 50s,
 

1319
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,910
All the time they keep rejecting 50s,
maybe there's a flush lower like they're

1320
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
maybe there's a flush lower like they're
 

1321
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,790
maybe there's a flush lower like they're
trying now.

1322
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:36,800

 

1323
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,630

And they've got bids down to 800 here

1324
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
And they've got bids down to 800 here
 

1325
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,550
And they've got bids down to 800 here
like we talked about. So, the 900 to 800

1326
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
like we talked about. So, the 900 to 800
 

1327
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,230
like we talked about. So, the 900 to 800
rotation. They didn't quite get to 900.

1328
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
rotation. They didn't quite get to 900.
 

1329
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,069
rotation. They didn't quite get to 900.
They're 10 points short, and they're

1330
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:44,079
They're 10 points short, and they're
 

1331
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,589
They're 10 points short, and they're
going to try and get down to the 800s

1332
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
going to try and get down to the 800s
 

1333
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,069
going to try and get down to the 800s
now. It's the same stuff we talked about

1334
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079
now. It's the same stuff we talked about
 

1335
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,109
now. It's the same stuff we talked about
pre-market. It's the same levels.

1336
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
pre-market. It's the same levels.
 

1337
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,270
pre-market. It's the same levels.
Nothing's changed. Very boring. [snorts]

1338
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,280
Nothing's changed. Very boring. [snorts]
 

1339
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,109
Nothing's changed. Very boring. [snorts]
Maybe there's nothing to be be done here

1340
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
Maybe there's nothing to be be done here
 

1341
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,390
Maybe there's nothing to be be done here
today. I don't know.

1342
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
today. I don't know.
 

1343
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,910
today. I don't know.
If we do this all day, I certainly won't

1344
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
If we do this all day, I certainly won't
 

1345
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,230
If we do this all day, I certainly won't
be trading it.

1346
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,240

 

1347
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,069

Is trading my only source of income?

1348
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:08,079
Is trading my only source of income?
 

1349
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,109
Is trading my only source of income?
Well, I mean, no. I'm a landlord

1350
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
Well, I mean, no. I'm a landlord
 

1351
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,430
Well, I mean, no. I'm a landlord
and I still make royalties off my music,

1352
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:15,440
and I still make royalties off my music,
 

1353
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,430
and I still make royalties off my music,
but it is my main source of income, I

1354
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,440
but it is my main source of income, I
 

1355
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,870
but it is my main source of income, I
would say, but not my only source.

1356
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:22,880
would say, but not my only source.
 

1357
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:39,190
would say, but not my only source.
Okay, down to the 800s.

1358
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,200

 

1359
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,990

Uh, I really like affordable indicators.

1360
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
Uh, I really like affordable indicators.
 

1361
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,990
Uh, I really like affordable indicators.
Never had a disconnection issue. I don't

1362
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000
Never had a disconnection issue. I don't
 

1363
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,510
Never had a disconnection issue. I don't
use anything web- based for that reason.

1364
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:45,520
use anything web- based for that reason.
 

1365
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,510
use anything web- based for that reason.
I've always always stated that [snorts]

I've always always stated that [snorts]
 

1367
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:57,990
I've always always stated that [snorts]
too risky.

1368
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,000

 

1369
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,470

I made music. Yes, I still make music

1370
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
I made music. Yes, I still make music
 

1371
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,510
I made music. Yes, I still make music
for people every now and again.

1372
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520

 

1373
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,069

Okay. Yes. Trying to find a bid. Q is a

1374
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
Okay. Yes. Trying to find a bid. Q is a
 

1375
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,230
Okay. Yes. Trying to find a bid. Q is a
bit weaker here as we come down into the

1376
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
bit weaker here as we come down into the
 

1377
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,150
bit weaker here as we come down into the
800s. Look at this. Tap back in towards

1378
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,160
800s. Look at this. Tap back in towards
 

1379
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,430
800s. Look at this. Tap back in towards
the 8 845 850 we just talked about. This

1380
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
the 8 845 850 we just talked about. This
 

1381
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,510
the 8 845 850 we just talked about. This
thing does not know what it wants to do.

1382
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,520
thing does not know what it wants to do.
 

1383
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,349
thing does not know what it wants to do.
It really does not know what it wants to

1384
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
It really does not know what it wants to
 

1385
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,470
It really does not know what it wants to
do. So, 10 points short of the 800

1386
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
do. So, 10 points short of the 800
 

1387
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,870
do. So, 10 points short of the 800
rotation back into this shelf at 850.

1388
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
rotation back into this shelf at 850.
 

1389
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,310
rotation back into this shelf at 850.
Are they going to try and find a squeeze

1390
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
Are they going to try and find a squeeze
 

1391
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,510
Are they going to try and find a squeeze

00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,640
also got news, not just Trump. You got a
 

1551
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,710
also got news, not just Trump. You got a
news piece dropping. Still rejecting

1552
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
news piece dropping. Still rejecting
 

1553
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,390
news piece dropping. Still rejecting
previous week value high, previous day

1554
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
previous week value high, previous day
 

1555
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,069
previous week value high, previous day
value low. So if they want to trade

1556
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,079
value low. So if they want to trade
 

1557
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,230
value low. So if they want to trade
outside of it, they want to do it now.

1558
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
outside of it, they want to do it now.
 

1559
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,430
outside of it, they want to do it now.
And they got to start getting below

1560
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440
And they got to start getting below
 

1561
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,069
And they got to start getting below
these 20s though. It's all sellside from

1562
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:16,079
these 20s though. It's all sellside from
 

1563
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,829
these 20s though. It's all sellside from
20s down to the current New York low of

1564
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
20s down to the current New York low of
 

1565
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:24,470
20s down to the current New York low of
day. There is a bid at 800.

1566
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:24,480

 

1567
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,069

Still just waiting. I don't feel

1568
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
Still just waiting. I don't feel
 

1569
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,950
Still just waiting. I don't feel
confident for a continuation short here

1570
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
confident for a continuation short here
 

1571
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,630
confident for a continuation short here
just because it's how it's moving. It's

1572
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
just because it's how it's moving. It's
 

1573
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,069
just because it's how it's moving. It's
a good chance they probably do it and

1574
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:32,079
a good chance they probably do it and
 

1575
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,190
a good chance they probably do it and
just slam it. I'm okay missing that. I

1576
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
just slam it. I'm okay missing that. I
 

1577
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:52,950
just slam it. I'm okay missing that. I
don't like how we're moving right now.

1578
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:52,960

 

1579
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,109

Yeah, it means momentum is downside

1580
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:55,119
Yeah, it means momentum is downside
 

1581
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,030
Yeah, it means momentum is downside
right now, but I'm waiting to have

1582
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,040
right now, but I'm waiting to have
 

1583
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,510
right now, but I'm waiting to have
confirmation of location.

1584
00:42:59,510 --> 00:42:59,520
confirmation of location.
 

1585
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,030
confirmation of location.
We're trying to move outside of value.

1586
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,040
We're trying to move outside of value.
 

1587
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,470
We're trying to move outside of value.
There is a chance that we move down

1588
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
There is a chance that we move down
 

1589
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,990
There is a chance that we move down
here,

1590
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
here,
 

1591
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,910
here,
but what I'm seeing within this at the

1592
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:05,920
but what I'm seeing within this at the
 

1593
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,589
but what I'm seeing within this at the
moment is not making me full of

1594
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
moment is not making me full of
 

1595
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,790
moment is not making me full of
confidence that we're going to snap

1596
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
confidence that we're going to snap
 

1597
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,270
confidence that we're going to snap
lower. Every move under 820 is being

1598
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,280
lower. Every move under 820 is being
 

1599
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,870
lower. Every move under 820 is being
absorbed, right? So, everything under

1600
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:12,880
absorbed, right? So, everything under
 

1601
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,109
absorbed, right? So, everything under
here is being absorbed. So, I'm just

1602
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
here is being absorbed. So, I'm just
 

1603
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,790
here is being absorbed. So, I'm just
aware of that. Maybe too aware of it,

1604
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:16,800
aware of that. Maybe too aware of it,
 

1605
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,390
aware of that. Maybe too aware of it,
but it's a Friday. I don't want to go

1606
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
but it's a Friday. I don't want to go
 

1607
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:44,550
but it's a Friday. I don't want to go
give him back my week.

1608
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:44,560

 

1609
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,150

If we lose this though, we can really

1610
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:46,160
If we lose this though, we can really
 

1611
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,349
If we lose this though, we can really
trade those 750s quickly.

1612
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:49,359
trade those 750s quickly.
 

1613
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,030
trade those 750s quickly.
Doesn't look good. Looks like we might

1614
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,040
Doesn't look good. Looks like we might
 

1615
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,430
Doesn't look good. Looks like we might
go 750s. Here's the 800 test again.

1616
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:54,440
go 750s. Here's the 800 test again.

1619
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,109

So 900 to 800 rotation complete

1620
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
So 900 to 800 rotation complete
 

1621
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,109
So 900 to 800 rotation complete

pretty much there [snorts] or
 

1623
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,150

1625
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,230
thereabouts. Um 750s is next level below
if they lose this just based on where

1626
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,240
if they lose this just based on where
 

1627
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,870
if they lose this just based on where
nodes are. You see this box down here?

00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
nodes are. You see this box down here?

It's basically the next level.

00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
It's basically the next level.

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,829
It's basically the next level.
Here's 800.

1632
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:17,839

 

1633
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,109

Someone keeps buying

1634

Someone keeps buying

Someone keeps buying

That 20 is a big level.

That 20 is a big level.

Everything below sellside.

It's starting to really look like it

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,150
It's starting to really look like it

Big seller coming there at 800.

Maybe that was a rotation. I missed it.

I just don't like how we're moving. We

tagged here. This first blue box. So if

1708
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:36,880
tagged here. This first blue box. So if
 

1709
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,309
tagged here. This first blue box. So if
you did take the short from here to here

1710
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:42,319

 

1711
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,870

to here and down here next if you get

1712
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
to here and down here next if you get
 

1713
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,470
to here and down here next if you get
there. Remember, we haven't had a bid

1714
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,480
there. Remember, we haven't had a bid
 

1715
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,790
there. Remember, we haven't had a bid
back up to resell. This is why I'm like

1716
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:48,800
back up to resell. This is why I'm like
 

1717
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,710
back up to resell. This is why I'm like
skeptical because this is like literally

1718
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,720
skeptical because this is like literally
 

1719
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,109
skeptical because this is like literally
being dripped down.

1720

1721
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,390

But it doesn't mean they can't keep

1722
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:56,400
But it doesn't mean they can't keep
 

1723
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:07,657
But it doesn't mean they can't keep
doing it. They absolutely can. [snorts]

Hardest thing is there's no pop to sell

down. The problem is so they need to

defend this now or around here. So I'm
 

2019
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,069
defend this now or around here. So I'm
waiting to see if buyers get caught

2020
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:32,079
waiting to see if buyers get caught
 

2021
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,349
waiting to see if buyers get caught
here. If not, then they'll probably get

2022
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:33,359
here. If not, then they'll probably get
 

2023
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,790
here. If not, then they'll probably get
a squeeze relief all the way up. So you

2024
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:34,800
a squeeze relief all the way up. So you
 

2025
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,710
a squeeze relief all the way up. So you
can see this 30s lift straight into 50s

2026
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
can see this 30s lift straight into 50s
 

2027
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,569
can see this 30s lift straight into 50s
like I just talked about. We have

2028
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:38,579
like I just talked about. We have
 

2029
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:43,349
like I just talked about. We have
[snorts] to see what happens now.

2030
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:43,359

 

2031
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,990

There's the 50s sell.

2032
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
There's the 50s sell.
 

2033
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,549
There's the 50s sell.
So your rotation now is 50s to 30s while

2034
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:48,559
So your rotation now is 50s to 30s while
 

2035
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,670
So your rotation now is 50s to 30s while
they make up their mind. All right.

2036
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:51,680
they make up their mind. All right.
 

2037
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,230
they make up their mind. All right.
So sellers just defended this selling

2038
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
So sellers just defended this selling
 

2039
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,910
So sellers just defended this selling
here back down to here. Want to see if

2040
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
here back down to here. Want to see if
 

2041
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,710
here back down to here. Want to see if
we cover some here. And if not, we can

2042
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:58,720
we cover some here. And if not, we can
 

2043
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,109
we cover some here. And if not, we can
get continuation underneath. And if we

2044
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:01,119
get continuation underneath. And if we
 

2045
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,670
get continuation underneath. And if we
get relief, we can go all the way back

2046
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:03,680
get relief, we can go all the way back
 

2047
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,349
get relief, we can go all the way back
up here because this is one straight

2048
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:05,359
up here because this is one straight
 

2049
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,190
up here because this is one straight
move that lacks any structure. All

2050
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
move that lacks any structure. All
 

2051
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,470
move that lacks any structure. All
right. So, you have to be careful if

2052
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480
right. So, you have to be careful if
 

2053
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,549
right. So, you have to be careful if
you're going to sell this. Now, it's not

2054
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:10,559
you're going to sell this. Now, it's not
 

2055
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,789
you're going to sell this. Now, it's not
an ideal position, but it is a location

2056
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:12,799
an ideal position, but it is a location
 

2057
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,910
an ideal position, but it is a location
to sell. Here we go. Nice. Trim some

2058
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:15,920
to sell. Here we go. Nice. Trim some
 

2059
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,670
to sell. Here we go. Nice. Trim some
here. And let's see if we can get down

2060
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:17,680
here. And let's see if we can get down
 

2061
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,430
here. And let's see if we can get down
to PDC.

2062
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:21,440

 

2063
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:28,069

I got a little piece. Tiny little piece.

2064
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079

 

2065
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,030

If they reclaim 50s, certainly if they

2066
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,040
If they reclaim 50s, certainly if they
 

2067
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,349
If they reclaim 50s, certainly if they
uh reclaim 54s, then a squeeze back up

2068
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:33,359
uh reclaim 54s, then a squeeze back up
 

2069
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:34,470
uh reclaim 54s, then a squeeze back up
is going to happen. So, I'm not going to

2070
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,480
is going to happen. So, I'm not going to
 

2071
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,190
is going to happen. So, I'm not going to
hold above that. They do a look look

2072
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,200
hold above that. They do a look look
 

2073
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,030
hold above that. They do a look look
above and fell. I'll cut it. Re-enter on

2074
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:39,040
above and fell. I'll cut it. Re-enter on
 

2075
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,349
above and fell. I'll cut it. Re-enter on
the way back down. [snorts]

2076
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:41,359
the way back down. [snorts]
 

2077
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,109
the way back down. [snorts]
I do want do not want to see this back

2078
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119
I do want do not want to see this back
 

2079
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,470
I do want do not want to see this back
above uh sort of 55. We go above 55s,

2080
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
above uh sort of 55. We go above 55s,
 

2081
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,510
above uh sort of 55. We go above 55s,
you're probably going to see squeeze

2082
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:47,520
you're probably going to see squeeze
 

2083
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,959
you're probably going to see squeeze
relief all the way up to the 800s again.

2084
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:49,969
relief all the way up to the 800s again.
 

2085
00:56:49,969 --> 00:56:56,390
relief all the way up to the 800s again.
[snorts]

2086
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:56,400

 

2087
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,309

Nice Josh. Great work. Yeah, it was a

2088
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:58,319
Nice Josh. Great work. Yeah, it was a
 

2089
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,030
Nice Josh. Great work. Yeah, it was a
big miss on my behalf there. [snorts]

2090
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,040
big miss on my behalf there. [snorts]
 

2091
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,470
big miss on my behalf there. [snorts]
Getting ready to cut the runner here.

2092
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,480
Getting ready to cut the runner here.
 

2093
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,390
Getting ready to cut the runner here.
So, covered some into the 30s like we

2094
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:04,400
So, covered some into the 30s like we
 

2095
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,829
So, covered some into the 30s like we
talked about for the rotation. If it

2096
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:05,839
talked about for the rotation. If it
 

2097
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,670
talked about for the rotation. If it
gets squeeze relief, this thing can go.

2098
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680
gets squeeze relief, this thing can go.
 

2099
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,950
gets squeeze relief, this thing can go.
So, I'm not going to hold on to it

2100
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960
So, I'm not going to hold on to it
 

2101
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,549
So, I'm not going to hold on to it
because we're very thin and if it wants

2102
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:10,559
because we're very thin and if it wants
 

2103
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,109
because we're very thin and if it wants
to pump straight up to 800 or 820, it

2104
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:13,119
to pump straight up to 800 or 820, it
 

2105
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,390
to pump straight up to 800 or 820, it
will.

2106
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:16,400

 

2107
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,309

Yes, reclaiming PDC.

2108
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:20,319

 

2109
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:25,750

Google catching a little bit of a bid.

2110
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:25,760

No matter what, I'm going to be in the

No matter what, I'm going to be in the

No matter what, I'm going to be in the
money here. Doesn't matter what happens

2114
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
money here. Doesn't matter what happens
 

2115
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,069
money here. Doesn't matter what happens
to be in the money. I'm happy to flip

2116
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079
to be in the money. I'm happy to flip
 

2117
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,349
to be in the money. I'm happy to flip
long. If we break above 50s in base, I

2118
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:33,359
long. If we break above 50s in base, I
 

2119
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,109
long. If we break above 50s in base, I
would even consider it. I would consider

2120
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:35,119
would even consider it. I would consider
 

2121
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,750
would even consider it. I would consider
it. My favorite trade, but I would

And we got imbalances all the way up to

And we got imbalances all the way up to

This is a question. If this is a look

2150
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:35,680
This is a question. If this is a look
 

2151
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,190
This is a question. If this is a look
above and fail, do they rebid this here

2152
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:37,200
above and fail, do they rebid this here
 

2153
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,870
above and fail, do they rebid this here
at 50s? If they rebid it, then I think

2154
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880
at 50s? If they rebid it, then I think
 

2155
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,270
at 50s? If they rebid it, then I think
we squeeze. If they don't rebid it, then

2156
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
we squeeze. If they don't rebid it, then
 

2157
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,549
we squeeze. If they don't rebid it, then
that was just a little look above and

2158
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:42,559
that was just a little look above and
 

2159
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,950
that was just a little look above and
fail. Run the stops and then come back

fail. Run the stops and then come back

fail. Run the stops and then come back
down.

We haven't closed the gap yet.

Nice. Okay, let's see. If they don't

00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880
Nice. Okay, let's see. If they don't
 

2169
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,069
Nice. Okay, let's see. If they don't
hold this little shelf, we're going to

hold this little shelf, we're going to

00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,430
hold this little shelf, we're going to
trade the next shelf below. Otherwise,

2172
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:17,440

this is a look above and a fail to close
 

2201
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,150
this is a look above and a fail to close

giving us both directions, that's

giving us both directions, that's
 

2207
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,710
giving us both directions, that's
because the market has the opportunity

the short and close the gap. But I also

know ES has already closed it.

2481
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:31,110
Come on. We should get it here. They
should flush this now. Take out all this

2482
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
should flush this now. Take out all this
 

2483
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,149

Very, very close to TP. I can't believe

2490
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:44,000
Very, very close to TP. I can't believe
 

2491
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,829
Very, very close to TP. I can't believe
it's teased so much. Come on. Woo. Thank

All right, let's see if we can get a
 

2497
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,950
All right, let's see if we can get a
runner to really start going here now.

2498
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:52,960
runner to really start going here now.
 

2499
01:08:52,960 --> 01:09:06,789
runner to really start going here now.
Nice work.

2500
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:06,799

 

2501
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,870

Nice [snorts] work. So TP hit there. And

2502
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
Nice [snorts] work. So TP hit there. And
 

2503
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,309
Nice [snorts] work. So TP hit there. And
we'll see if we can get down into this

2504
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:10,319
we'll see if we can get down into this
 

2505
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,550
we'll see if we can get down into this
next box. So gap now filled. This yellow

2506
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:12,560
next box. So gap now filled. This yellow
 

2507
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,990
next box. So gap now filled. This yellow
line. You can see why I had my limit

2508
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,000
line. You can see why I had my limit
 

2509
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,630
line. You can see why I had my limit
there. Gap now filled. Cash gap for

2510
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:16,640
there. Gap now filled. Cash gap for
 

2511
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,789
there. Gap now filled. Cash gap for
those wondering. Cash gap. And then

2512
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:18,799
those wondering. Cash gap. And then
 

2513
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,309
those wondering. Cash gap. And then
we're looking for previous week point of

2514
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:20,319
we're looking for previous week point of
 

2515
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:21,910
we're looking for previous week point of
control. And if we get really lucky down

2516
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920
control. And if we get really lucky down
 

2517
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,630
control. And if we get really lucky down
here. So I missed this whole move and I

2518
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:24,640
here. So I missed this whole move and I
 

2519
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,229
here. So I missed this whole move and I
had two I had to have two attempts at

2520
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:26,239
had two I had to have two attempts at
 

2521
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:29,269
had two I had to have two attempts at
that attempt one right took some out

2522
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:29,279
that attempt one right took some out
 

2523
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,030
that attempt one right took some out
here stopped out here just in case we

2524
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
here stopped out here just in case we
 

2525
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,470
here stopped out here just in case we
got relief but once we came back

2526
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:32,480
got relief but once we came back
 

2527
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,630
got relief but once we came back
downside in again TP1 TP2 I did cover a

2528
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,640
downside in again TP1 TP2 I did cover a
 

2529
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,630
downside in again TP1 TP2 I did cover a
little bit into 30 again in case and

2530
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:38,640
little bit into 30 again in case and
 

2531
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,189
little bit into 30 again in case and
then we'll see now we will just see can

2532
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:41,199
then we'll see now we will just see can
 

2533
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:43,669
then we'll see now we will just see can
we get going

2534
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
we get going
 

2535
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:55,830
we get going
be nice if we Good.

Uh, I don't know if it was at 37.

2546
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:10,800

 

2547
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,189

I think it was at it was above it was

I wanted this shelf being protected once
 

2555
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,630
I wanted this shelf being protected once
I left the desk. Right. This shelf here.

2569
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,390

640 to 570 is a level. Here we go,

2570
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
640 to 570 is a level. Here we go,
 

2571
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,790
640 to 570 is a level. Here we go,
folks. All right, next TP now hit.

folks. All right, next TP now hit.
Lovely. All right. And now it's just a

2574
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,040
Lovely. All right. And now it's just a
 

2575
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,229
Lovely. All right. And now it's just a
question. Can we get all the way down

2576
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:58,239
question. Can we get all the way down
 

2577
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,550
question. Can we get all the way down
into here? Which would be amazing if we

2578
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:00,560
into here? Which would be amazing if we
 

2579
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,110
into here? Which would be amazing if we
did. And if we did a measured move, it

2580
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:03,120
did. And if we did a measured move, it
 

2581
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,510
did. And if we did a measured move, it
would probably work out perfectly with

2582
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:05,520
would probably work out perfectly with
 

2583
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,110
would probably work out perfectly with
this leg. If we went leg to leg. There

2584
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:07,120
this leg. If we went leg to leg. There
 

2585
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,470
this leg. If we went leg to leg. There
you go. So, if we're going to get this

2586
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:08,480
you go. So, if we're going to get this
 

2587
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,709
you go. So, if we're going to get this
same leg again, we might well get this,

2588
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:10,719
same leg again, we might well get this,
 

2589
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,350
same leg again, we might well get this,
which would be really good, which would

2590
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:13,360
which would be really good, which would
 

2591
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,750
which would be really good, which would
be a great day considering I missed all

2592
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
be a great day considering I missed all
 

2593
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,830
be a great day considering I missed all
the top side move down. So, here we go.

2594
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:17,840
the top side move down. So, here we go.
 

2595
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,809
the top side move down. So, here we go.

Banks trade got a runner. Good call. I

was uneasy about that small pullback. I
 

2603
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,470

the way to do it, man. enter small and

01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
scale scale in. I didn't know if we do
 

2609
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,669
scale scale in. I didn't know if we do

talked about. Maybe we do a little look

There's no guarantee that they don't do

perfect every time. We all we can do is

2634
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,840
perfect every time. We all we can do is
 

2635
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,709
perfect every time. We all we can do is
position for the move.

2636
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:04,719
position for the move.
 

2637
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,390
position for the move.
So, it's just a question if can we get

2638
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,400
So, it's just a question if can we get
 

2639
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,830
So, it's just a question if can we get
down into here? Now, we know this is a

2640
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
down into here? Now, we know this is a
 

2641
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:31,350
down into here? Now, we know this is a
massive level here.

2642
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360

 

2643
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,390

I'd say shorts want to control 700 now.

2644
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:34,400
I'd say shorts want to control 700 now.
 

2645
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,950
I'd say shorts want to control 700 now.
They [snorts] want to control 700. This

2646
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:36,960
They [snorts] want to control 700. This
 

2647
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,510
They [snorts] want to control 700. This
level here, 713. So, we can make this as

2648
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:39,520
level here, 713. So, we can make this as
 

2649
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,229
level here, 713. So, we can make this as
like

2650
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
like
 

2651
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,990
like
let's do it as gray. So, I don't want to

2652
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:44,000
let's do it as gray. So, I don't want to
 

2653
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,229
let's do it as gray. So, I don't want to
give you guys too much uh sentiment

2654
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
give you guys too much uh sentiment
 

2655
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:50,229
give you guys too much uh sentiment
here, but we can move definitely 700 is

2656
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:50,239
here, but we can move definitely 700 is
 

2657
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,470
here, but we can move definitely 700 is
a little spike sort of here really is

2658
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:52,480
a little spike sort of here really is
 

2659
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,310
a little spike sort of here really is
more, but I'd be watching 700 whole

2660
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:54,320
more, but I'd be watching 700 whole
 

2661
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,110
more, but I'd be watching 700 whole
level for this here. And then if they

2662
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:57,120
level for this here. And then if they
 

2663
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,390
level for this here. And then if they
base if if you get a push and they do

2664
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
base if if you get a push and they do
 

2665
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,790
base if if you get a push and they do
this, I'd be very cautious about this

2666
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:02,800
this, I'd be very cautious about this
 

2667
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,189
this, I'd be very cautious about this
move to fill in this this low volume

2668
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199
move to fill in this this low volume
 

2669
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,110
move to fill in this this low volume
node. All right. So shorts will want to

2670
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,120
node. All right. So shorts will want to
 

2671
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,110
node. All right. So shorts will want to
defend this or defend this if they want

2672
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:09,120
defend this or defend this if they want
 

2673
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,870
defend this or defend this if they want
continuation early. If you get a base

2674
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:10,880
continuation early. If you get a base
 

2675
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,070
continuation early. If you get a base
over this, you want to be careful.

2676
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:12,080
over this, you want to be careful.
 

2677
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,090
over this, you want to be careful.
Obviously squeeze back out. [snorts]

2678
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:15,100
Obviously squeeze back out. [snorts]
 

2679
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,750
Obviously squeeze back out. [snorts]
[clears throat]

2680
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:15,760
[clears throat]
 

2681
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:23,110
[clears throat]
It's a shame. Let's just move that.

2682
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:23,120

 

2683
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,110

So testing towards this 700. 700 is

2684
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,120
So testing towards this 700. 700 is
 

2685
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,510
So testing towards this 700. 700 is
where a big seller came in. It's more

2686
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520
where a big seller came in. It's more
 

2687
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,270
where a big seller came in. It's more
likely where a buyer just stopped out at

2688
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:29,280
likely where a buyer just stopped out at
 

2689
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,870
likely where a buyer just stopped out at
700 on that flush down at 1019. So,

2690
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:32,880
700 on that flush down at 1019. So,
 

2691
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:38,470
700 on that flush down at 1019. So,
we're coming to test that delta there.

2692
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480

 

2693
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,310

I can show you right here. This right

2694
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
I can show you right here. This right
 

2695
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,709
I can show you right here. This right
here, right? We're coming to test this

2696
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
here, right? We're coming to test this
 

2697
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,189
here, right? We're coming to test this
guy. Hopefully, you guys can see that to

2698
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:45,199
guy. Hopefully, you guys can see that to
 

2699
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,430
guy. Hopefully, you guys can see that to
zoom out. Right here, we're coming to

2700
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:47,440
zoom out. Right here, we're coming to
 

2701
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,950
zoom out. Right here, we're coming to
test this guy here and it's imbalance.

2702
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:48,960
test this guy here and it's imbalance.
 

2703
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,310
test this guy here and it's imbalance.
And if we squeeze through this, we're

2704
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:50,320
And if we squeeze through this, we're
 

2705
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,870
And if we squeeze through this, we're
going to come and test this level here

2706
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:52,880
going to come and test this level here
 

2707
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,701
going to come and test this level here
where the buyers came in.

2708
01:13:55,701 --> 01:13:55,711
where the buyers came in.
 

2709
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:59,830
where the buyers came in.
[snorts]

2710
01:13:59,830 --> 01:13:59,840

 

2711
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,070

So that refresh seller at 700 still

2712
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:02,080
So that refresh seller at 700 still
 

2713
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,910
So that refresh seller at 700 still
present. [snorts]

2714
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:07,920

 

2715
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,790

Where do you have your runner stops? Uh

2716
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:10,800
Where do you have your runner stops? Uh
 

2717
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,950
Where do you have your runner stops? Uh
I've just left the the uh up here in

2718
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:14,960
I've just left the the uh up here in
 

2719
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,669
I've just left the the uh up here in
here where it was before. Just at here.

2720
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:17,679
here where it was before. Just at here.
 

2721
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,430
here where it was before. Just at here.
So, I've only got a little micro on now.

2722
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:19,440
So, I've only got a little micro on now.
 

2723
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,590
So, I've only got a little micro on now.
So, we either get down here or we don't.

2724
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
So, we either get down here or we don't.
 

2725
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,430
So, we either get down here or we don't.
And that's okay. [snorts]

2726
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:25,440

 

2727
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,830

I'm all out. I would have have to wait

2728
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:27,840
I'm all out. I would have have to wait
 

2729
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,070
I'm all out. I would have have to wait
for another popup. Yeah. And just

2730
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,080
for another popup. Yeah. And just
 

2731
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,590
for another popup. Yeah. And just
remember, we've hit a lot of low hanging

2732
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:31,600
remember, we've hit a lot of low hanging
 

2733
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,790
remember, we've hit a lot of low hanging
fruits. Look, we've closed the gap.

2734
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:32,800
fruits. Look, we've closed the gap.
 

2735
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,910
fruits. Look, we've closed the gap.
We've hit previous week point of

2736
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:33,920
We've hit previous week point of
 

2737
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,669
We've hit previous week point of
control. There's no reason to be long in

2738
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:35,679
control. There's no reason to be long in
 

2739
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,070
control. There's no reason to be long in
this. We are in trend down. I was

2740
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:38,080
this. We are in trend down. I was
 

2741
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,030
this. We are in trend down. I was
worried that here, right? I'll be This

2742
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
worried that here, right? I'll be This
 

2743
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,270
worried that here, right? I'll be This
is the reason I didn't enter this is in

2744
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:43,280
is the reason I didn't enter this is in
 

2745
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,189
is the reason I didn't enter this is in
here. I didn't see enough in the tape to

2746
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:45,199
here. I didn't see enough in the tape to
 

2747
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,110
here. I didn't see enough in the tape to
make me think we were going to flush.

2748
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,120
make me think we were going to flush.
 

2749
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,470
make me think we were going to flush.
And then we kept absorbing uh the 820s

2750
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:50,480
And then we kept absorbing uh the 820s
 

2751
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,990
And then we kept absorbing uh the 820s
over and over and over again. Everything

2752
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:52,000
over and over and over again. Everything
 

2753
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,550
over and over and over again. Everything
under under 820 kept getting absorbed. I

2754
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:54,560
under under 820 kept getting absorbed. I
 

2755
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,310
under under 820 kept getting absorbed. I
was like, I want to be careful for this

2756
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
was like, I want to be careful for this
 

2757
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,470
was like, I want to be careful for this
move here. But they just dripped it.

2758
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480
move here. But they just dripped it.
 

2759
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,310
move here. But they just dripped it.
It's not like we snapped. They literally

2760
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:00,320
It's not like we snapped. They literally
 

2761
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,229
It's not like we snapped. They literally
dripped it down.

2762
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239

 

2763
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,310

So that's why I didn't get short. I just

2764
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,320
So that's why I didn't get short. I just
 

2765
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,990
So that's why I didn't get short. I just
didn't see. It's actually a really good

2766
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:08,000
didn't see. It's actually a really good
 

2767
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,709
didn't see. It's actually a really good
setup, but I didn't see

2768
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:12,719
setup, but I didn't see
 

2769
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,630
setup, but I didn't see
inside the tape what I'd want to see

2770
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:14,640
inside the tape what I'd want to see
 

2771
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,709
inside the tape what I'd want to see
there. I didn't see it unfortunately

2772
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:16,719
there. I didn't see it unfortunately
 

2773
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:17,990
there. I didn't see it unfortunately
otherwise I would have got short there.

2774
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:18,000
otherwise I would have got short there.
 

2775
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,390
otherwise I would have got short there.
So I had to wait right so I missed all

2776
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
So I had to wait right so I missed all
 

2777
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,910
So I had to wait right so I missed all
of this and then we have to wait for

2778
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:21,920
of this and then we have to wait for
 

2779
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,709
of this and then we have to wait for
this

2780
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:24,719
this
 

2781
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,630
this
and if they start reclaiming here then

2782
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:26,640
and if they start reclaiming here then
 

2783
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,110
and if they start reclaiming here then
we have to consider whether this market

2784
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
we have to consider whether this market
 

2785
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,070
we have to consider whether this market
wants to move back for relief over 55s

2786
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
wants to move back for relief over 55s
 

2787
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,550
wants to move back for relief over 55s
and 60s. All right so big bounce here

2788
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:34,560
and 60s. All right so big bounce here
 

2789
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,390
and 60s. All right so big bounce here
like we talked about through the 700s we

2790
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
like we talked about through the 700s we
 

2791
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,310
like we talked about through the 700s we
come back into this node. This is value

2792
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:38,320
come back into this node. This is value
 

2793
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,669
come back into this node. This is value
area low on the day. These are these

2794
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:39,679
area low on the day. These are these
 

2795
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,950
area low on the day. These are these
sort of 37s, same level as earlier. If

2796
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:42,960
sort of 37s, same level as earlier. If
 

2797
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,630
sort of 37s, same level as earlier. If
we get through gray box, certainly if we

2798
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:44,640
we get through gray box, certainly if we
 

2799
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,470
we get through gray box, certainly if we
get through 55, there will be squeeze

2800
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,480
get through 55, there will be squeeze
 

2801
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,750
get through 55, there will be squeeze
relief in this market.

2802
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
relief in this market.
 

2803
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,350
relief in this market.
All right? Because you don't want to be

2804
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
All right? Because you don't want to be
 

2805
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,669
All right? Because you don't want to be
short low of day, right? So, think about

2806
01:15:53,669 --> 01:15:53,679
short low of day, right? So, think about
 

2807
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,990
short low of day, right? So, think about
anyone that got short low of day. Where

2808
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,000
anyone that got short low of day. Where
 

2809
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,229
anyone that got short low of day. Where
did all those shorts come in? 700 and

2810
01:15:58,229 --> 01:15:58,239
did all those shorts come in? 700 and
 

2811
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,709
did all those shorts come in? 700 and
690 was a big level of shorts. We're now

2812
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
690 was a big level of shorts. We're now
 

2813
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,390
690 was a big level of shorts. We're now
testing the shorts that came in at 10:00

2814
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400
testing the shorts that came in at 10:00
 

2815
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,630
testing the shorts that came in at 10:00
a.m., which is at the sort of 27, let's

2816
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:04,640
a.m., which is at the sort of 27, let's
 

2817
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,229
a.m., which is at the sort of 27, let's
just call it the 30 level that we had

2818
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:06,239
just call it the 30 level that we had
 

2819
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,229
just call it the 30 level that we had
before. And if we reclaim that, we're

2820
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:08,239
before. And if we reclaim that, we're
 

2821
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:09,510
before. And if we reclaim that, we're
going to go to point of control, which

2822
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:09,520
going to go to point of control, which
 

2823
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,669
going to go to point of control, which
is at 50. This is my PC that I'm looking

2824
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:11,679
is at 50. This is my PC that I'm looking
 

2825
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,430
is at 50. This is my PC that I'm looking
at. I know up here on Trading View, it's

2826
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:13,440
at. I know up here on Trading View, it's
 

2827
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,430
at. I know up here on Trading View, it's
up here, but for me, it's here. So, this

2828
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:15,440
up here, but for me, it's here. So, this
 

2829
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,830
up here, but for me, it's here. So, this
is sentiment. All right. Do we reade

2830
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:17,840
is sentiment. All right. Do we reade
 

2831
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,350
is sentiment. All right. Do we reade
that or is it relief? Both are

2832
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:21,360
that or is it relief? Both are
 

2833
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,870
that or is it relief? Both are
available. I want to make that clear

2834
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:22,880
available. I want to make that clear
 

2835
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,950
available. I want to make that clear
when I say that because both are

2836
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:24,960
when I say that because both are
 

2837
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,270
when I say that because both are
available. When we come into a level, we

2838
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:27,280
available. When we come into a level, we
 

2839
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,189
available. When we come into a level, we
need to see what the market wants to do.

2840
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
need to see what the market wants to do.
 

2841
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,270
need to see what the market wants to do.
Do aggressive buyers come in and get

2842
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
Do aggressive buyers come in and get
 

2843
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,950
Do aggressive buyers come in and get
absorbed? If so, we're going to play

2844
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:32,960
absorbed? If so, we're going to play
 

2845
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,430
absorbed? If so, we're going to play
short. Do aggressive sellers come in and

2846
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
short. Do aggressive sellers come in and
 

2847
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,270
short. Do aggressive sellers come in and
be absorbed? If so, we're probably going

2848
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
be absorbed? If so, we're probably going
 

2849
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,910
be absorbed? If so, we're probably going
to get long relief. [snorts]

2883
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,950
the short? Uh, you can look at the put
and call walls. I'd be focusing them on

2884
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:14,960
and call walls. I'd be focusing them on
 

2885
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,350
and call walls. I'd be focusing them on
the ETFs if you're going to do that.

2886
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,360

 

2887
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,110

How long do you need before to get

everyone's different. It dep I would say

2894
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:27,520
everyone's different. It dep I would say
 

2895
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,830
everyone's different. It dep I would say
on a lot lot of things. depends on how

2896
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
on a lot lot of things. depends on how
 

2897
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,390
on a lot lot of things. depends on how
you absorb information, how much time

2898
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,400
you absorb information, how much time
 

2899
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,950
you absorb information, how much time
you spend on the screens, how good your

2900
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:34,960
you spend on the screens, how good your
 

2901
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,470
you spend on the screens, how good your
mentor is, how disciplined you are. Um,

2902
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:38,480
mentor is, how disciplined you are. Um,
 

2903
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:42,390
mentor is, how disciplined you are. Um,
I had some terrible uh terrible habits

2904
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:42,400
I had some terrible uh terrible habits
 

2905
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,910
I had some terrible uh terrible habits
when I started trading because I had an

2906
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:43,920
when I started trading because I had an
 

2907
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,390
when I started trading because I had an
awful mentor. All right? So, I'd be

2908
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:46,400
awful mentor. All right? So, I'd be
 

2909
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,510
awful mentor. All right? So, I'd be
picking tops non-stop getting blown up.

2910
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:49,520
picking tops non-stop getting blown up.
 

2911
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,590
picking tops non-stop getting blown up.
All right? So, it's really about

2912
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:51,600
All right? So, it's really about
 

2913
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,830
All right? So, it's really about
changing that, making sure you start

2914
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:53,840
changing that, making sure you start
 

2915
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,430
changing that, making sure you start
with a decent mentor. It doesn't have to

2916
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:55,440
with a decent mentor. It doesn't have to
 

2917
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,149
with a decent mentor. It doesn't have to
be me. Just someone that can teach you

2918
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
be me. Just someone that can teach you
 

2919
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:02,470
be me. Just someone that can teach you
well and someone that teaches h how I

2920
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,480
well and someone that teaches h how I

well and someone that teaches h how I
always talk about in a pedagogy that

2922
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:04,400
always talk about in a pedagogy that
 

2923
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,830
always talk about in a pedagogy that
makes sense to you. If you're a visual

2924
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
makes sense to you. If you're a visual
 

2925
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,950
makes sense to you. If you're a visual
learner, you're going to need someone

2926
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:06,960
learner, you're going to need someone
 

2927
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,229
learner, you're going to need someone
that talks that way. If you need

2928
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:08,239
that talks that way. If you need
 

2929
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,430
that talks that way. If you need
storytelling, you're going to need

2930
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:09,440
storytelling, you're going to need
 

2931
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,590
storytelling, you're going to need
someone that talks that way. I can't

2932
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:11,600
someone that talks that way. I can't
 

2933
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,189
someone that talks that way. I can't
listen to someone just talking technical

2934
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
listen to someone just talking technical
 

2935
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,550
listen to someone just talking technical
when I'm a beginner. It doesn't make

2936
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:14,560
when I'm a beginner. It doesn't make
 

2937
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,990
when I'm a beginner. It doesn't make
sense to me. So, I have to paint the

2938
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000
sense to me. So, I have to paint the
 

2939
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,830
sense to me. So, I have to paint the
picture.

2940
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:19,840

 

2941
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,630

Can I use a EMA 200 to see if we go

2942
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,640
Can I use a EMA 200 to see if we go
 

2943
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,790
Can I use a EMA 200 to see if we go
further down? We're rejecting EMA 200 on

2944
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:24,800
further down? We're rejecting EMA 200 on
 

2945
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,189
further down? We're rejecting EMA 200 on
the 1 hour. Yeah, if that works for you,

2946
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199
the 1 hour. Yeah, if that works for you,
 

2947
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,110
the 1 hour. Yeah, if that works for you,
I I do use that. I use it on a fivem

2948
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,120
I I do use that. I use it on a fivem
 

2949
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,950
I I do use that. I use it on a fivem
minute. We broke the 5m minute 200 today

2950
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
minute. We broke the 5m minute 200 today
 

2951
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,189
minute. We broke the 5m minute 200 today
and then started flushing. [snorts]

2952
01:18:33,189 --> 01:18:33,199
and then started flushing. [snorts]
 

2953
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,550
and then started flushing. [snorts]
We're right back down at um the daily

2954
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:36,560
We're right back down at um the daily
 

2955
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,229
We're right back down at um the daily
mean right now. One of the things I'm

2956
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:38,239
mean right now. One of the things I'm
 

2957
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:42,550
mean right now. One of the things I'm
very aware of at the moment

2958
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:42,560

 

2959
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,229

is this. Okay, look at the contraction

2960
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:46,239
is this. Okay, look at the contraction
 

2961
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,950
is this. Okay, look at the contraction
of the Ballinger bands. Right, next week

2962
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:48,960
of the Ballinger bands. Right, next week
 

2963
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,189
of the Ballinger bands. Right, next week
they're going to be like here.

2964
01:18:53,189 --> 01:18:53,199

 

2965
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:57,270

and here and all the EMAs tight

2966
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
and here and all the EMAs tight
 

2967
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,669
and here and all the EMAs tight
at some point that it we can't do this

2968
01:18:59,669 --> 01:18:59,679
at some point that it we can't do this
 

2969
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,270
at some point that it we can't do this
forever guys. I want you to understand

2970
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
forever guys. I want you to understand
 

2971
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,390
forever guys. I want you to understand
these are going to get tighter and

2972
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:02,400
these are going to get tighter and
 

2973
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,070
these are going to get tighter and
tighter. This is where squeezes happen.

2974
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,080
tighter. This is where squeezes happen.
 

2975
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,510
tighter. This is where squeezes happen.
All right? When we get contraction of

2976
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:05,520
All right? When we get contraction of
 

2977
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:12,550
All right? When we get contraction of
Ballinger bands like here

2978
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:12,560

 

2979
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:20,470

and then we explode out like here

2980
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:20,480

 

2981
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,470

and then we explode out. All right, we

2982
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480
and then we explode out. All right, we
 

2983
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,110
and then we explode out. All right, we
cannot keep contracting these Ballinger

2984
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,120
cannot keep contracting these Ballinger
 

2985
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,910
cannot keep contracting these Ballinger
bands on the daily.

2986
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:27,920
bands on the daily.
 

2987
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,950
bands on the daily.
At some point it's going to get painful.

2988
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
At some point it's going to get painful.
 

2989
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,149
At some point it's going to get painful.
This cannot last forever. It will not

2990
01:19:36,149 --> 01:19:36,159
This cannot last forever. It will not
 

2991
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,630
This cannot last forever. It will not
last forever.

2992
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
last forever.
 

2993
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,310
last forever.
We're back into this low volume node on

2994
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,320
We're back into this low volume node on
 

2995
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,110
We're back into this low volume node on
the daily again now as well.

2996
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,120
the daily again now as well.
 

2997
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:51,030
the daily again now as well.
This gray box.

2998
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:51,040

 

2999
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,630

Okay. So, rejecting. It's a good

3000
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:52,640
Okay. So, rejecting. It's a good
 

3001
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,870
Okay. So, rejecting. It's a good
rejecting of rejection of 30. So,

3002
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:54,880
rejecting of rejection of 30. So,
 

3003
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:08,149
rejecting of rejection of 30. So,
hopefully we can still move lower.

3004
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:08,159

 

3005
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,070

Thanks, Spear Fishing. Appreciate that.

3006
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:10,080
Thanks, Spear Fishing. Appreciate that.
 

3007
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,590
Thanks, Spear Fishing. Appreciate that.

kitty. I'm barely profitable at two
 

3015
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,990
kitty. I'm barely profitable at two
years. Most of the work was mental and

3016
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:20,000
years. Most of the work was mental and
 

3017
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,990
years. Most of the work was mental and
discipline.

3018
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:22,000
discipline.
 

3019
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,430
discipline.
So, Shiz, the question would be, were

3020
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
So, Shiz, the question would be, were
 

3021
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,510
So, Shiz, the question would be, were
you taught bad habits? Were you taught a

3022
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520
you taught bad habits? Were you taught a
 

3023
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,189
you taught bad habits? Were you taught a
tool? Have you had to learn on your own?

3024
01:20:29,189 --> 01:20:29,199
tool? Have you had to learn on your own?
 

3025
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,030
tool? Have you had to learn on your own?
Like there's lots of things that can

3026
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
Like there's lots of things that can
 

3027
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,350
Like there's lots of things that can
slow down um your ability to become

3028
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:35,360
slow down um your ability to become
 

3029
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,530
slow down um your ability to become
profitable.

3030
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:38,540

 

3031
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:43,669

[cough]

3032
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679

 

3033
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,590

I bought the 20our course. It's working

3034
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:45,600
I bought the 20our course. It's working
 

3035
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,189
I bought the 20our course. It's working
for me. I just need to put in the reps.

3036
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,199
for me. I just need to put in the reps.
 

3037
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,430
for me. I just need to put in the reps.
That's it. Just put in the reps, man.

3038
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:49,440
That's it. Just put in the reps, man.
 

3039
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,030
That's it. Just put in the reps, man.
Here we go. Let's see if we can get a

3040
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,040
Here we go. Let's see if we can get a
 

3041
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,470
Here we go. Let's see if we can get a
break below here now for some

3042
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
break below here now for some
 

3043
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,229
break below here now for some
continuation. Ideally, we get a break

3044
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,239
continuation. Ideally, we get a break
 

3045
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,310
continuation. Ideally, we get a break
below and we hit this TP down here. Be

3046
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:56,320
below and we hit this TP down here. Be
 

3047
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,470
below and we hit this TP down here. Be
really nice. Lots I will say lots of

3048
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:58,480
really nice. Lots I will say lots of
 

3049
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,910
really nice. Lots I will say lots of
sellers came in at previous week point

3050
01:20:59,910 --> 01:20:59,920
sellers came in at previous week point
 

3051
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,910
sellers came in at previous week point
of control like very very very heavy

3052
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:01,920
of control like very very very heavy
 

3053
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,630
of control like very very very heavy
selling came in there. So really we do

3054
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:04,640
selling came in there. So really we do
 

3055
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,229
selling came in there. So really we do
need this to stay heavy now um under the

3056
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:08,239
need this to stay heavy now um under the
 

3057
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,149
need this to stay heavy now um under the
say sort of 86s. Where did this guy

3058
01:21:10,149 --> 01:21:10,159
say sort of 86s. Where did this guy
 

3059
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:14,229
say sort of 86s. Where did this guy
start with his 100 lot? 259

3060
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:14,239
start with his 100 lot? 259
 

3061
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,750
start with his 100 lot? 259
124.

3062
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:15,760
124.
 

3063
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,070
124.
Yeah, we want we want breaks below now.

3064
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,080
Yeah, we want we want breaks below now.
 

3065
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,070
Yeah, we want we want breaks below now.
We look good for it. Here we go. New

3066
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,080
We look good for it. Here we go. New
 

3067
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,910
We look good for it. Here we go. New
lower day.

3068
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:21,920
lower day.
 

3069
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,590
lower day.
Let's see if we can get down into this

3070
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:23,600
Let's see if we can get down into this
 

3071
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,830
Let's see if we can get down into this
next block.

3072
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:25,840
next block.
 

3073
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,070
next block.
I want this to stay heavy versus I'd say

3074
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:28,080
I want this to stay heavy versus I'd say
 

3075
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,950
I want this to stay heavy versus I'd say
sort of 90s and 700s now. Really good.

3076
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
sort of 90s and 700s now. Really good.
 

3077
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,229
sort of 90s and 700s now. Really good.
Come on, let's come down. Let's pay the

3078
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:34,239
Come on, let's come down. Let's pay the
 

3079
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:40,390
Come on, let's come down. Let's pay the
team.

3080
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,400

 

3081
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,149

Did I take any trades? Yes, we're short

3082
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:42,159
Did I take any trades? Yes, we're short
 

3083
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:44,310
Did I take any trades? Yes, we're short
from here.

3084
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:44,320
from here.
 

3085
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,630
from here.
I've had three goes today. So I think I

3086
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:46,640
I've had three goes today. So I think I
 

3087
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,189
I've had three goes today. So I think I
was long

3088
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:49,199
was long
 

3089
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:52,310
was long
this dip this morning for here

3090
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:52,320

3092
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:54,560
and then
 

3093
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,390
and then
I was short here covered stopped out.

3094
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
I was short here covered stopped out.
 

3095
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,030
I was short here covered stopped out.

3096
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,040

3100
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,440
cover and then waiting to see if we get
 

3101
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,590
cover and then waiting to see if we get
lucky and get down into there.

3102
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:11,600

 

3103
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,270

Initial balance now set folks. Purple

3104
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:13,280

3105
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,750

line on your screen, right? to just be

3106
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
line on your screen, right? to just be
 

3107
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,550
line on your screen, right? to just be
aware of that.

3108
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:18,560
aware of that.
 

3109
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,550
aware of that.
I would like to catch the bottom. Do you

3110
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,560
I would like to catch the bottom. Do you
 

3111
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,149
I would like to catch the bottom. Do you
think it's going to fill up at a bottom?

3112
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:24,159
think it's going to fill up at a bottom?
 

3113
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:26,629
think it's going to fill up at a bottom?
What do you mean fill up?

3114
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
What do you mean fill up?
 

3115
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,629
What do you mean fill up?
Um, why do you want to catch a bottom?

3116
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:30,639
Um, why do you want to catch a bottom?
 

3117
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,430
Um, why do you want to catch a bottom?
If we're breaking away, why do you want

3118
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:33,440
If we're breaking away, why do you want
 

3119
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,790
If we're breaking away, why do you want
to catch a bottom? It's very risky.

3120
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:36,800
to catch a bottom? It's very risky.
 

3121
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,350
to catch a bottom? It's very risky.
We're in a weak market right now.

3122
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:41,360

 

3123
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,550

Be cautious about trying to do that.

3124
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:44,560
Be cautious about trying to do that.
 

3125
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,310
Be cautious about trying to do that.
Metal selling off. Yeah, I mean they're

3126
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,320

3129
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,350
just releasing some of that squeeze.
I mean, silver's still trading at 87s. I

3130
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
I mean, silver's still trading at 87s. I
 

3131
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,149
I mean, silver's still trading at 87s. I
mean, it is absolutely insane.

3132
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
mean, it is absolutely insane.
 

3133
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,350
mean, it is absolutely insane.
They're just releasing some of that

3134
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:55,360
They're just releasing some of that
 

3135
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,750
They're just releasing some of that
squeeze. That's all it is.

3136
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
squeeze. That's all it is.
 

3137
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,350
squeeze. That's all it is.

Alex is the best. I'm out of this short.
 

3139
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:06,550

3140
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:06,560

3144
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:10,880
just Nvidia, it's the whole market, man.
 

3145

The whole market. The rotation is taking

3146
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:12,960
The whole market. The rotation is taking
 

3147
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,590
The whole market. The rotation is taking
place in this market. Look at RTY,

3148
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:15,600
place in this market. Look at RTY,
 

3149
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,709
place in this market. Look at RTY,
right? 0.03% up on the day, right? We

3150
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:18,719
right? 0.03% up on the day, right? We
 

3151
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,310
right? 0.03% up on the day, right? We
are seeing broadening of the market.

3152
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
are seeing broadening of the market.
 

3153
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,550
are seeing broadening of the market.
You've got to remember for as long as I

3154
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:22,560
You've got to remember for as long as I
 

3155
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,470
You've got to remember for as long as I
can remember, the market was narrowing.

3156
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:24,480
can remember, the market was narrowing.
 

3157
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,830
can remember, the market was narrowing.
What do I mean by that? The MAG was up.

3158
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:27,840
What do I mean by that? The MAG was up.
 

3159
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,910
What do I mean by that? The MAG was up.
The MAG 7 were up and everything else

3160
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
The MAG 7 were up and everything else
 

3161
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,709
The MAG 7 were up and everything else
for two years has been doing bugger. All

3162
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:32,719
for two years has been doing bugger. All
 

3163
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:34,629
for two years has been doing bugger. All
right? Been doing absolutely nothing.

3164
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:34,639
right? Been doing absolutely nothing.
 

3165
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,950
right? Been doing absolutely nothing.
So, we're having a rotation out of tech

3166
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:36,960
So, we're having a rotation out of tech
 

3167
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,669
So, we're having a rotation out of tech
at the moment, into the mids, into the

3168
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:39,679
at the moment, into the mids, into the
 

3169
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,390
at the moment, into the mids, into the
small caps, back into healthare, maybe

3170
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:42,400
small caps, back into healthare, maybe
 

3171
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,629
small caps, back into healthare, maybe
into finances if they can start posting

3172
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639
into finances if they can start posting
 

3173
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:45,990
into finances if they can start posting
good earnings, which they didn't do

3174
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
good earnings, which they didn't do
 

3175
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,229
good earnings, which they didn't do
yesterday. So, we're seeing a broadening

3176
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:48,239
yesterday. So, we're seeing a broadening
 

3177
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:49,750
yesterday. So, we're seeing a broadening
of the market. Rather than it being

3178
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:49,760
of the market. Rather than it being
 

3179
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,270
of the market. Rather than it being
concentrated in seven names, we're

3180
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
concentrated in seven names, we're
 

3181
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,510
concentrated in seven names, we're
starting to move it into 500 plus names,

3182
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:53,520
starting to move it into 500 plus names,
 

3183
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,870
starting to move it into 500 plus names,
which is good for the market, but it

3184
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:54,880
which is good for the market, but it
 

3185
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,030
which is good for the market, but it
means you're seeing profit taking. What

3186
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,040
means you're seeing profit taking. What
 

3187
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,310
means you're seeing profit taking. What
would the catalyst be? There's two

3188
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
would the catalyst be? There's two
 

3189
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,470
would the catalyst be? There's two
options here. either the tech earnings

3190
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:00,480
options here. either the tech earnings
 

3191
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,030
options here. either the tech earnings
are not what what was anticipated in

3192
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,040
are not what what was anticipated in
 

3193
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,270
are not what what was anticipated in
they sell off and if we sell those tech

3194
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
they sell off and if we sell those tech
 

3195
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,510
they sell off and if we sell those tech
earnings off then I expect a big sell in

3196
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:07,520
earnings off then I expect a big sell in
 

3197
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,750
earnings off then I expect a big sell in
this market overall because they're

3198
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:09,760
this market overall because they're
 

3199
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,030
this market overall because they're
still worth 60% of the cues or if the

3200
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:13,040
still worth 60% of the cues or if the
 

3201
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,430
still worth 60% of the cues or if the
earnings are good if it's like hey we've

3202
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:15,440
earnings are good if it's like hey we've
 

3203
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,510
earnings are good if it's like hey we've
got more room with this AI bubble we've

3204
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
got more room with this AI bubble we've
 

3205
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,270
got more room with this AI bubble we've
got more room in the chip space we've

3206
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:19,280
got more room in the chip space we've
 

3207
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,350
got more room in the chip space we've
got more room in the energy providers

3208
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
got more room in the energy providers
 

3209
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,310
got more room in the energy providers
for that nuke etc etc we've got more

3210
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:24,320
for that nuke etc etc we've got more
 

3211
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,870
for that nuke etc etc we've got more
room in the data centers to go then

3212
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:26,880
room in the data centers to go then
 

3213
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,910
room in the data centers to go then
maybe we rebid it up.

3214
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:29,920
maybe we rebid it up.
 

3215
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,910
maybe we rebid it up.
Both are possible. Look at the daily

3216
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:31,920
Both are possible. Look at the daily
 

3217
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,910
Both are possible. Look at the daily
like we just talked about, right? It's

VIX breaking through 16s now. 1620s or
 

3245
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,470
VIX breaking through 16s now. 1620s or
16. Let me just check this pivot I have

3246
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:26,480
16. Let me just check this pivot I have
 

3247
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,950
16. Let me just check this pivot I have
marked out. 16 we call it 25 to 30 is

3248
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:30,960
marked out. 16 we call it 25 to 30 is
 

3249
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,110
marked out. 16 we call it 25 to 30 is
the pivot break on the bits. If we break

3250
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:33,120
the pivot break on the bits. If we break
 

3251
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,870
the pivot break on the bits. If we break
through [clears throat] that then market

3252
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:34,880
through [clears throat] that then market
 

3253
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,990
through [clears throat] that then market
might get very very very heavy.

3254
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:40,000

 

3255
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,830

Yeah, metals are selling off together

3256
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:41,840
Yeah, metals are selling off together
 

3257
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,030
Yeah, metals are selling off together
but silver's silver's in 6% down. Gold's

3258
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,040
but silver's silver's in 6% down. Gold's
 

3259
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,950
but silver's silver's in 6% down. Gold's
just 1.77% down. You know it's to be

3260
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:48,960
just 1.77% down. You know it's to be
 

3261
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,110
just 1.77% down. You know it's to be
expected folks. It was a giant squeeze,

3262
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
expected folks. It was a giant squeeze,
 

3263
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,950
expected folks. It was a giant squeeze,
right? It's a giant squeeze up. It

3264
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:52,960
right? It's a giant squeeze up. It
 

3265
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,510
right? It's a giant squeeze up. It
doesn't mean it's the end. Remember,

3266
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,520
doesn't mean it's the end. Remember,
 

3267
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,629
doesn't mean it's the end. Remember,
gold did this move maybe two months ago.

3268
01:25:58,629 --> 01:25:58,639
gold did this move maybe two months ago.
 

3269
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:00,790
gold did this move maybe two months ago.
We did a big squeeze and then we pulled

3270
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:00,800
We did a big squeeze and then we pulled
 

3271
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,189
We did a big squeeze and then we pulled
back for what a good few weeks and then

3272
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:03,199
back for what a good few weeks and then
 

3273
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,030
back for what a good few weeks and then
started to grind back higher and explode

3274
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,040
started to grind back higher and explode
 

3275
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,430
started to grind back higher and explode
back out in.

3276
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:07,440
back out in.
 

3277
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,830
back out in.
It's not necessarily done.

3278
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:11,840

 

3279
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,669

It's definitely It was definitely past

3280
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
It's definitely It was definitely past
 

3281
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,750
It's definitely It was definitely past
two standard deviation. Silver was

3282
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:15,760
two standard deviation. Silver was
 

3283
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,870
two standard deviation. Silver was
probably past four by now.

3284
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:18,880
probably past four by now.
 

3285
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,189
probably past four by now.
Have a look if you want.

3286
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:21,199
Have a look if you want.
 

3287
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:31,110
Have a look if you want.
Have a look if you want.

3288
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:31,120

 

3289
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,950

No, it wasn't. It was just at two.

3290
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:32,960
No, it wasn't. It was just at two.
 

3291
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,310
No, it wasn't. It was just at two.
That's impressive. All right, so back

3292
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320
That's impressive. All right, so back
 

3293
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,910
That's impressive. All right, so back
down to 5day.

3294
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:37,920

 

3295
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,830

Silver can afford to drift right back

3296
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:39,840
Silver can afford to drift right back
 

3297
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,070
Silver can afford to drift right back
down into this pocket and then rebid if

3298
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,080
down into this pocket and then rebid if
 

3299
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,390
down into this pocket and then rebid if
it wants. Right, mean is all the way

3300
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:44,400
it wants. Right, mean is all the way
 

3301
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,910
it wants. Right, mean is all the way
down here. Look, look how big these

3302
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:45,920
down here. Look, look how big these
 

3303
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,310
down here. Look, look how big these
Ballinger bands are. It's hugging 5day

3304
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:48,320
Ballinger bands are. It's hugging 5day
 

3305
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,070
Ballinger bands are. It's hugging 5day
top Ballinger. That is a healthy trend.

3306
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,080
top Ballinger. That is a healthy trend.
 

3307
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,590
top Ballinger. That is a healthy trend.
All it's doing is pulling back to 5day.

3308
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:51,600
All it's doing is pulling back to 5day.
 

3309
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,830
All it's doing is pulling back to 5day.
It's not taking out any big levels yet.

3310
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
It's not taking out any big levels yet.
 

3311
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,189
It's not taking out any big levels yet.
It's just a pullback until it proves

3312
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:55,199
It's just a pullback until it proves
 

3313
01:26:55,199 --> 01:27:02,149
It's just a pullback until it proves
otherwise on silver.

3314
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159

 

3315
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:03,830

Okay, looking good here. See if we can

3316
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:03,840
Okay, looking good here. See if we can
 

3317
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,229
Okay, looking good here. See if we can
keep drifting lower

3318
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:06,239
keep drifting lower
 

3319
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,030
keep drifting lower
into here. Ideally,

3320
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,040
into here. Ideally,
 

3321
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,110
into here. Ideally,
you can move your stop down and protect

3322
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:11,120
you can move your stop down and protect
 

3323
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,950
you can move your stop down and protect
675. Now, if you want, just keep

3324
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
675. Now, if you want, just keep
 

3325
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,350
675. Now, if you want, just keep
managing this position.

3326
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:17,360

 

3327
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,430

Almost at 100 points. Another 10 10

3328
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:19,440
Almost at 100 points. Another 10 10
 

3329
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,629
Almost at 100 points. Another 10 10
points here would be a 100 point trade.

3330
01:27:22,629 --> 01:27:22,639
points here would be a 100 point trade.
 

3331
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,070
points here would be a 100 point trade.
Yeah, move your runners. Yeah, I would

3332
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:24,080
Yeah, move your runners. Yeah, I would
 

3333
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,910
Yeah, move your runners. Yeah, I would
say like you you'd want to protect sort

3334
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:25,920
say like you you'd want to protect sort
 

3335
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,270
say like you you'd want to protect sort
of this previous week point of control

3336
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,280
of this previous week point of control
 

3337
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,550
of this previous week point of control
now. You don't really want it coming

3338
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:28,560
now. You don't really want it coming
 

3339
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,790
now. You don't really want it coming
back over that, right? So you can we can

3340
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:30,800
back over that, right? So you can we can
 

3341
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,189
back over that, right? So you can we can
protect here and see if we can get down

3342
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:33,199
protect here and see if we can get down
 

3343
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:43,189
protect here and see if we can get down
into this.

3344
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199

 

3345
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,110

Really strong selling here, guys. We

3346
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:45,120
Really strong selling here, guys. We
 

3347
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,790
Really strong selling here, guys. We
could get 600s quick here.

3348
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:48,800
could get 600s quick here.
 

3349
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,709
could get 600s quick here.
They're bidding at 600 at the moment. So

3350
01:27:50,709 --> 01:27:50,719
They're bidding at 600 at the moment. So
 

3351
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:52,070
They're bidding at 600 at the moment. So
hopefully we come down into that and

3352
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,080
hopefully we come down into that and
 

3353
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:57,830
hopefully we come down into that and
fill these guys.

3354
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:57,840

 

3355
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,750

Here's a 100 pointer off the pullback.

3356
01:27:59,750 --> 01:27:59,760
Here's a 100 pointer off the pullback.
 

3357
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,669
Here's a 100 pointer off the pullback.
So if you missed that first move, we got

3358
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:01,679
So if you missed that first move, we got
 

3359
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,350
So if you missed that first move, we got
the second move. We got our 100 pointer.

3360
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:03,360
the second move. We got our 100 pointer.
 

3361
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,390
the second move. We got our 100 pointer.
All right. So from 30s to 30s is 100

3362
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:06,400
All right. So from 30s to 30s is 100
 

3363
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:11,270
All right. So from 30s to 30s is 100
pointer for you.

3364
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280

 

3365
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,830

But they are bidding now. 620 600 and

3366
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:13,840
But they are bidding now. 620 600 and
 

3367
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,790
But they are bidding now. 620 600 and
then 575. I can see them all. 575 is

3368
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:16,800
then 575. I can see them all. 575 is
 

3369
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,149
then 575. I can see them all. 575 is
where we would want to go. Previous day

3370
01:28:18,149 --> 01:28:18,159
where we would want to go. Previous day
 

3371
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,709
where we would want to go. Previous day
open is 590. Previous day low is 560.

3372
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:20,719
open is 590. Previous day low is 560.
 

3373
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,870
open is 590. Previous day low is 560.
Previous week value area low is around

3374
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:22,880
Previous week value area low is around
 

3375
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,430
Previous week value area low is around
that 575. So ideally we come down there.

3376
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,440
that 575. So ideally we come down there.
 

3377
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,030
that 575. So ideally we come down there.
It might be that we need relief before

3378
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,040
It might be that we need relief before
 

3379
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,270
It might be that we need relief before
we do it. It very very well might be

3380
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,280
we do it. It very very well might be
 

3381
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,189
we do it. It very very well might be
that this market does not come down here

3382
01:28:31,189 --> 01:28:31,199
that this market does not come down here
 

3383
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:32,709
that this market does not come down here
in one go. It might be that it squeezes

3384
01:28:32,709 --> 01:28:32,719
in one go. It might be that it squeezes
 

3385
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:34,550
in one go. It might be that it squeezes
up before it does it. So just manage

3386
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:34,560
up before it does it. So just manage
 

3387
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,709
up before it does it. So just manage
your position. If you if you're not

3388
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:36,719
your position. If you if you're not
 

3389
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,790
your position. If you if you're not
willing to give back all the way to 76,

3390
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:38,800
willing to give back all the way to 76,
 

3391
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,750
willing to give back all the way to 76,
then you know make sure it rejects

3392
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:41,760
then you know make sure it rejects
 

3393
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,310
then you know make sure it rejects
the [clears throat] IB for example.

3394
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:44,320
the [clears throat] IB for example.
 

3395
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,430
the [clears throat] IB for example.

going to trade outside of previous week
 

3503
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,470
going to trade outside of previous week
value low, then we're going to respect

3504

value low, then we're going to respect
 

3505
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,669

3509
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:57,430
right? Just call it 500. Right? So, if
the market gets weak, 500. If you get

3510
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:57,440
the market gets weak, 500. If you get
 

3511
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,110
the market gets weak, 500. If you get
very lucky, you'll get your 420. But

01:32:59,110 --> 01:32:59,120
very lucky, you'll get your 420. But
 

3513
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:02,149
very lucky, you'll get your 420. But
that's asking an awful lot. That's uh we

3514
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:02,159
that's asking an awful lot. That's uh we
 

3515

I'm ideally trying to get like a little
 

3553
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,550
I'm ideally trying to get like a little
bit more, but I know there's a good

3554
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:52,560
bit more, but I know there's a good
 

3555
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,550
bit more, but I know there's a good
chance we will stop around here. So, I

3556
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:54,560
chance we will stop around here. So, I
 

3557
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,070
chance we will stop around here. So, I
might actually manage my stop and pull

3558
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:56,080
might actually manage my stop and pull
 

3559
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,310
might actually manage my stop and pull
it down to 630s to protect here. In

3560
01:33:58,310 --> 01:33:58,320
it down to 630s to protect here. In
 

3561
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,915
it down to 630s to protect here. In
fact, I will do that.

3562
01:34:00,915 --> 01:34:00,925
fact, I will do that.
 

3563
01:34:00,925 --> 01:34:02,709
fact, I will do that.
[snorts] All right. So, stop here now.

3564
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:02,719
[snorts] All right. So, stop here now.
 

3565
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,229
[snorts] All right. So, stop here now.
630. Technically, you could put your

3566
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:04,239
630. Technically, you could put your
 

3567
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:05,910
630. Technically, you could put your
stop the other side of this shelf, but I

3568
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:05,920
stop the other side of this shelf, but I
 

3569
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,189
stop the other side of this shelf, but I
just don't want to give too much back.

3570

It's a really nice trade. So, I'm going
 

3573
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,470
It's a really nice trade. So, I'm going
to lock in my runner for 100 points no

3574
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:10,480

Did I have a macro to take on lower move

No, not not not specifically other than

No, not not not specifically other than

01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,830
No, not not not specifically other than

01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:11,840
the rotation. It was more just technical

01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:14,080
break that we just broke. All right,

01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,470
break that we just broke. All right,
under 600 we came finding a bid. Like I

3620
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480
under 600 we came finding a bid. Like I
 

3621
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,510
under 600 we came finding a bid. Like I
said, I'm not going to let this come

3622
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:17,520
said, I'm not going to let this come
 

3623
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,350
said, I'm not going to let this come
back above 30 here. If it doesn't make

3624
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,360
back above 30 here. If it doesn't make
 

3625
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,480
back above 30 here. If it doesn't make
this, it doesn't make it. It's okay.

3626
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:21,490
this, it doesn't make it. It's okay.
 

3627
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:22,310
this, it doesn't make it. It's okay.

[snorts]
 

3629
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,149
[snorts]
But we, like we just talked about, we

3630
01:35:24,149 --> 01:35:24,159
But we, like we just talked about, we
 

3631
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:26,149
But we, like we just talked about, we
are going to find a bid anywhere from

3632
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:26,159
are going to find a bid anywhere from
 

3633
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:30,229
are going to find a bid anywhere from
now where we are now down into 570. All

3634
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:30,239
now where we are now down into 570. All
 

3635
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,950
now where we are now down into 570. All
right? So, we might find a bid early. In

3636
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:32,960
right? So, we might find a bid early. In
 

3637
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,709
right? So, we might find a bid early. In
fact, if we look at what I just showed

3638
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
fact, if we look at what I just showed
 

3639
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,310
fact, if we look at what I just showed
you,

3640
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:36,320
you,
 

3641
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,750
you,
look at where we've just found a bid.

3642
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
look at where we've just found a bid.
 

3643
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,350
look at where we've just found a bid.
This is the importance of understanding

3644
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:39,360
This is the importance of understanding
 

3645
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,510
This is the importance of understanding
volume. This shelf, look at this little

3646
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:41,520
volume. This shelf, look at this little
 

3647
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,510
volume. This shelf, look at this little
shelf here that spikes out. Okay? This

3648
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:43,520
shelf here that spikes out. Okay? This
 

3649
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,709
shelf here that spikes out. Okay? This
shelf here, look at where we've just

3650
01:35:44,709 --> 01:35:44,719
shelf here, look at where we've just
 

3651
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,709
shelf here, look at where we've just
found a bid. right on this node. If I

3652
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:46,719
found a bid. right on this node. If I
 

3653
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:48,790
found a bid. right on this node. If I
paint this node for you, right on this

3654
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800
paint this node for you, right on this
 

3655
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,510
paint this node for you, right on this
little node, we've just found a bid,

3656
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
little node, we've just found a bid,
 

3657
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,430
little node, we've just found a bid,
right? It doesn't mean that we bounce

3658
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:53,440
right? It doesn't mean that we bounce
 

3659
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,350
right? It doesn't mean that we bounce
from there and and go all the way up. It

3660
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:55,360
from there and and go all the way up. It
 

3661
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,270
from there and and go all the way up. It
just means that this was a cover point.

3662
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:57,280
just means that this was a cover point.
 

3663
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,790
just means that this was a cover point.
Everyone else will be looking for this.

3664
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:58,800
Everyone else will be looking for this.
 

3665
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,110
Everyone else will be looking for this.
If they do want to find relief, right,

3666
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:01,120
If they do want to find relief, right,
 

3667
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,390
If they do want to find relief, right,
then they're going to need to trade

3668
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:02,400
then they're going to need to trade
 

3669
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,070
then they're going to need to trade
through the 640. So, there's possible

3670
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:04,080
through the 640. So, there's possible
 

3671
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,310
through the 640. So, there's possible
relief if they want to to 640 through

3672
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,320
relief if they want to to 640 through
 

3673
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,510
relief if they want to to 640 through
640 back to value through there back to

3674
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:09,520
640 back to value through there back to
 

3675
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,830
640 back to value through there back to
720s again. All right. So, just

3676
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
720s again. All right. So, just
 

3677
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,750
720s again. All right. So, just
pullbacks can happen here. We've been

3678
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:13,760
pullbacks can happen here. We've been
 

3679
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,950
pullbacks can happen here. We've been
strong move lower. We haven't really had

3680
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:16,960
strong move lower. We haven't really had
 

3681
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:20,431
strong move lower. We haven't really had
many pullbacks. If we zoom out.

3682
01:36:20,431 --> 01:36:20,441
many pullbacks. If we zoom out.
 

3683
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:21,830
many pullbacks. If we zoom out.
[snorts] All right. We haven't really

3684
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
[snorts] All right. We haven't really
 

3685
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,229
[snorts] All right. We haven't really
had much of a pullback, have we? So, we

3686
01:36:24,229 --> 01:36:24,239
had much of a pullback, have we? So, we
 

3687
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,550
had much of a pullback, have we? So, we
got stuck in this gray box, which is

3688
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:26,560
got stuck in this gray box, which is
 

3689
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,510
got stuck in this gray box, which is
current week and previous day. We failed

3690
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:29,520
current week and previous day. We failed
 

3691
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,830
current week and previous day. We failed
underneath. Alex was an idiot and missed

3692
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:31,840
underneath. Alex was an idiot and missed
 

3693
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,470
underneath. Alex was an idiot and missed
this cell. It's okay. We missed it. We

3694
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:34,480
this cell. It's okay. We missed it. We
 

3695
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,350
this cell. It's okay. We missed it. We
join in. We fade it. All right. There

3696
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:37,360
join in. We fade it. All right. There
 

3697
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,030
join in. We fade it. All right. There
hasn't been much of a pullback. These

3698
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:39,040
hasn't been much of a pullback. These
 

3699
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,790
hasn't been much of a pullback. These
are not big pullbacks. this market wants

01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:40,800
are not big pullbacks. this market wants
 

3701
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,350
are not big pullbacks. this market wants
to come back up here and test it, it can

3702
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:43,360
to come back up here and test it, it can
 

3703
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,950
to come back up here and test it, it can
do that. It's absolutely fine to do

3704
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:44,960
do that. It's absolutely fine to do
 

3705
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,350
do that. It's absolutely fine to do
that. I'm not going to sit through that

3706
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:47,360
that. I'm not going to sit through that
 

3707
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,109
that. I'm not going to sit through that
though. If they want to refade it, they

3708
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:49,119
though. If they want to refade it, they
 

3709
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,870
though. If they want to refade it, they
will. If they want to reclaim, they

3710
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:50,880
will. If they want to reclaim, they
 

3711
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,390
will. If they want to reclaim, they
will. If they want to go back into

3712
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
will. If they want to go back into
 

3713
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,870
will. If they want to go back into
balance, they will. Anything is

3714
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:54,880
balance, they will. Anything is
 

3715
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,550
balance, they will. Anything is
possible. I need you guys to understand

3716
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:56,560
possible. I need you guys to understand
 

3717
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,229
possible. I need you guys to understand
that when you have mentors saying this

3718
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:58,239
that when you have mentors saying this
 

3719
01:36:58,239 --> 01:36:59,990
that when you have mentors saying this
is absolutely what the market has to do,

3720
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,000
is absolutely what the market has to do,
 

3721
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,390
is absolutely what the market has to do,
yada yada yada yada, they are straight

3722
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,400
yada yada yada yada, they are straight
 

3723
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,430
yada yada yada yada, they are straight
lying to you. Market will do whatever it

3724
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:05,440
lying to you. Market will do whatever it
 

3725
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:10,310
lying to you. Market will do whatever it
wants to do.

3726
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,320

 

3727
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,870

typical micro size on a trade. How much

3728
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
typical micro size on a trade. How much
 

3729
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,470
typical micro size on a trade. How much
do you scale out there? All depends on

3730
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:14,480
do you scale out there? All depends on
 

3731
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,229
do you scale out there? All depends on
the size of the account I'm I'm trading,

3732
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:16,239
the size of the account I'm I'm trading,
 

3733
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:17,830
the size of the account I'm I'm trading,
right? So, if you're starting off on a

3734
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:17,840
right? So, if you're starting off on a
 

3735
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,709
right? So, if you're starting off on a
50k account, start with my starter would

3736
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
50k account, start with my starter would
 

3737
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:22,790
50k account, start with my starter would
be like one, two, three micros adding

3738
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800
be like one, two, three micros adding
 

3739
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,270
be like one, two, three micros adding
into it as it starts to like confirm up

3740
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:25,280
into it as it starts to like confirm up
 

3741
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,750
into it as it starts to like confirm up
for me. Willing to add like decent size

3742
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:27,760
for me. Willing to add like decent size
 

3743
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,709
for me. Willing to add like decent size
all the way into it. And uh I mean I

3744
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:30,719
all the way into it. And uh I mean I
 

3745
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,070
all the way into it. And uh I mean I
really haven't got enough size on this

3746
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
really haven't got enough size on this
 

3747
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:35,270
really haven't got enough size on this
one here, but it's okay. But you know,

3748
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:35,280
one here, but it's okay. But you know,
 

3749
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,270
one here, but it's okay. But you know,
one one if you get one micro to do a

3750
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:37,280
one one if you get one micro to do a
 

3751
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,750
one one if you get one micro to do a
runner of 150 points and you lock in

3752
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:39,760
runner of 150 points and you lock in
 

3753
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,750
runner of 150 points and you lock in
five at 100 points, that's a decent day

3754
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:41,760
five at 100 points, that's a decent day
 

3755
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,390
five at 100 points, that's a decent day
still. [snorts]

3756
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,400
still. [snorts]
 

3757
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,310
still. [snorts]
I'd rather do that and trade to my

3758
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
I'd rather do that and trade to my
 

3759
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:50,149
I'd rather do that and trade to my
levels than have a mini on and look for

3760
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:50,159
levels than have a mini on and look for
 

3761
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:52,070
levels than have a mini on and look for
eight ticks or whatever people do. I

3762
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:52,080
eight ticks or whatever people do. I
 

3763
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,229
eight ticks or whatever people do. I
just think that's mental. That makes no

3764
01:37:54,229 --> 01:37:54,239
just think that's mental. That makes no
 

3765
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:59,510
just think that's mental. That makes no
sense to me. But each to their own.

3766
01:37:59,510 --> 01:37:59,520

 

3767
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,870

Who is they when you talk about they?

3768
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:02,880
Who is they when you talk about they?
 

3769
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,310
Who is they when you talk about they?
They are market makers. They are funds.

3770
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:06,320
They are market makers. They are funds.
 

3771
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:09,270
They are market makers. They are funds.
Right? If we we just view the market as

3772
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:09,280
Right? If we we just view the market as
 

3773
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,430
Right? If we we just view the market as
one single entity. It's the best way to

3774
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:11,440
one single entity. It's the best way to
 

3775
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,510
one single entity. It's the best way to
view the market. It's not actually a

3776
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:13,520
view the market. It's not actually a
 

3777
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,189
view the market. It's not actually a
single entity. But if you view the

3778
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:15,199
single entity. But if you view the
 

3779
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:17,910
single entity. But if you view the
market that way, you make it much easier

3780
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:17,920
market that way, you make it much easier
 

3781
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:24,070
market that way, you make it much easier
for yourself. That's just Woff theory.

3782
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:24,080

 

3783
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:27,350

What about 300k account? Um what's the

3784
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:27,360
What about 300k account? Um what's the
 

3785
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:32,229
What about 300k account? Um what's the
what's the draw down on a 300k?

3786
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239

 

3787
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,590

How much draw down are you allowed? Like

3788
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:33,600
How much draw down are you allowed? Like
 

3789
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,390
How much draw down are you allowed? Like
six sixk or something.

3790
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:38,400

 

3791
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,229

You could pro you could probably put

3792
01:38:40,229 --> 01:38:40,239
You could pro you could probably put
 

3793
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:43,510
You could pro you could probably put
three minis on if it's if it's six to 9k

3794
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:43,520
three minis on if it's if it's six to 9k
 

3795
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,109
three minis on if it's if it's six to 9k
draw. You could you could get three

3796
01:38:45,109 --> 01:38:45,119
draw. You could you could get three
 

3797
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:54,550
draw. You could you could get three
minis on and scale up

3798
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:54,560

 

3799
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,310

depending on the ATR. One to three

3800
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:56,320
depending on the ATR. One to three
 

3801
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:03,590
depending on the ATR. One to three
minutes I'd say. [snorts]

3802
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:03,600

 

3803
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,830

Okay, if you look at look at the VIX, it

3804
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:05,840
Okay, if you look at look at the VIX, it
 

3805
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,830
Okay, if you look at look at the VIX, it
tried to get through that 1630. We

3806
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:07,840
tried to get through that 1630. We
 

3807
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,270
tried to get through that 1630. We
talked about it all morning. If we poke

3808
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
talked about it all morning. If we poke
 

3809
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,510
talked about it all morning. If we poke
through 16, we'll go 1630. It's tried to

3810
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:11,520
through 16, we'll go 1630. It's tried to
 

3811
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,790
through 16, we'll go 1630. It's tried to
get through it. It's just had a false

3812
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:12,800
get through it. It's just had a false
 

3813
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,470
get through it. It's just had a false
break.

3814
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:14,480
break.
 

3815
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,629
break.
It's just had a false break. So, it

3816
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:16,639
It's just had a false break. So, it
 

3817
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:20,709
It's just had a false break. So, it
needs to hold a bid now down to 1612s,

3818
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:20,719
needs to hold a bid now down to 1612s,
 

3819
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:23,109
needs to hold a bid now down to 1612s,
maybe even 16s. If it holds a bid there

3820
01:39:23,109 --> 01:39:23,119
maybe even 16s. If it holds a bid there
 

3821
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:24,709
maybe even 16s. If it holds a bid there
and it wants to go previous day high

3822
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:24,719
and it wants to go previous day high
 

3823
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,790
and it wants to go previous day high
into 1650, then the market will stay

3824
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:26,800
into 1650, then the market will stay
 

3825
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,189
into 1650, then the market will stay
weak. If this is a look above and fail

3826
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:29,199
weak. If this is a look above and fail
 

3827
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,350
weak. If this is a look above and fail
on the VIX, then we're going to see

3828
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:31,360
on the VIX, then we're going to see
 

3829
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,990
on the VIX, then we're going to see
relief in this market. So, we have to

3830
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:34,000
relief in this market. So, we have to
 

3831
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,750
relief in this market. So, we have to
see how we go here. But CVD still very,

3832
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:37,760
see how we go here. But CVD still very,
 

3833
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,750
see how we go here. But CVD still very,
very heavy in line with the market.

3834
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:41,760
very heavy in line with the market.
 

3835
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,109
very heavy in line with the market.
We are starting to build a bit of a

3836
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:43,119
We are starting to build a bit of a
 

3837
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,950
We are starting to build a bit of a
shelf here. If we start breaking above

3838
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:44,960
shelf here. If we start breaking above
 

3839
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,790
shelf here. If we start breaking above
17s, then you can imagine a pop up to

3840
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:46,800
17s, then you can imagine a pop up to
 

3841
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,510
17s, then you can imagine a pop up to
these soon. Starting to see that move.

3842
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:49,520
these soon. Starting to see that move.
 

3843
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,950
these soon. Starting to see that move.
So, just be careful here. Manage your

3844
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:50,960
So, just be careful here. Manage your
 

3845
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,149
So, just be careful here. Manage your
position. It might be that I end up

3846
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:52,159
position. It might be that I end up
 

3847
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:54,470
position. It might be that I end up
taking this off here. might it might

3848
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:54,480
taking this off here. might it might
 

3849
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,990
taking this off here. might it might
need a two leg if they're going to go

3850
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:56,000
need a two leg if they're going to go
 

3851
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,830
need a two leg if they're going to go
for that previous day low. It might need

3852
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:57,840
for that previous day low. It might need
 

3853
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,990
for that previous day low. It might need
the two leg to reade. I don't really

3854
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:00,000
the two leg to reade. I don't really
 

3855
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,870
the two leg to reade. I don't really
want to give back 70 points, right? So,

3856
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:02,880
want to give back 70 points, right? So,
 

3857
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,870
want to give back 70 points, right? So,
I might well cut this here if I'm honest

3858
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:04,880
I might well cut this here if I'm honest
 

3859
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,950
I might well cut this here if I'm honest
because I don't want to get caught in a

3860
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:06,960
because I don't want to get caught in a
 

3861
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:12,790

3863
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,270

Where's this node? 30s. 30s is still the

Where's this node? 30s. 30s is still the
 

3865
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,270
Where's this node? 30s. 30s is still the
level for me.

3866

level for me.
 

3867
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,030
level for me.
Through 30s I cut. I'm not going to hold

3868
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:19,040
Through 30s I cut. I'm not going to hold
 

3869
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:36,550
Through 30s I cut. I'm not going to hold
through 30s.

like a lot. All I'm looking at is what
 

3903
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,510

01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:11,520
is the momentum? Oh,
 

3905
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,229
is the momentum? Oh,
right. What is the momentum? We move

right. What is the momentum? We move
 

3907

That's all they are. And then initial

01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:33,520
That's all they are. And then initial
 

3925
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,270
That's all they are. And then initial
balance, opening range, you see the

balance, opening range, you see the
 

3927

opening range trade away from that today
 

3929
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:40,070
opening range trade away from that today
was a fail. All right. So once we left

3930
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:40,080
was a fail. All right. So once we left
 

3931
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,390
was a fail. All right. So once we left
15 minute, this box here, opening range,

01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400
15 minute, this box here, opening range,

01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:45,270
15 minute, this box here, opening range,
fail and initial balance so far failing.

These are all in one indicator though.

01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:46,880
These are all in one indicator though.

These are all in the flow zone pro,

3941
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,910

Am I still in the trade? Uh, yes. But

3942
01:41:59,910 --> 01:41:59,920
Am I still in the trade? Uh, yes. But
 

3943
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,350
Am I still in the trade? Uh, yes. But
I'm about to cut it because we keep

01:42:01,350 --> 01:42:01,360
I'm about to cut it because we keep
 

3945
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,550
I'm about to cut it because we keep
approaching these 30s

3946
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:04,560
approaching these 30s
 

3947
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,350
approaching these 30s
and we're holding dips now into a a blue

3948
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:07,360
and we're holding dips now into a a blue
 

3949

and we're holding dips now into a a blue
level I have on Ninja Trader. So,

3950
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:11,840
level I have on Ninja Trader. So,
 

3951
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,270
level I have on Ninja Trader. So,
I've given this a little bit of room to

3952
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:13,280
I've given this a little bit of room to
 

3953
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,950
I've given this a little bit of room to
35. I probably got to cut this here cuz

3954
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:14,960
35. I probably got to cut this here cuz
 

3955
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,270
35. I probably got to cut this here cuz
we're about to start squeezing. In fact,

3956
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
we're about to start squeezing. In fact,
 

3957
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,709
we're about to start squeezing. In fact,
I'm going to just take this off here and

3958
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
I'm going to just take this off here and
 

3959
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,430
I'm going to just take this off here and
not even worry about it. That's me done.

3960
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:21,440
not even worry about it. That's me done.
 

3961
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,189
not even worry about it. That's me done.
Don't want to sit through this. It might

3962
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
Don't want to sit through this. It might
 

3963
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,870
Don't want to sit through this. It might
be that we reflush. We haven't taken out

3964
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:24,880
be that we reflush. We haven't taken out
 

3965
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,709
be that we reflush. We haven't taken out
the previous day low, but uh that's good

3966
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:26,719
the previous day low, but uh that's good
 

3967
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:28,790
the previous day low, but uh that's good
enough for me. 100 points on the runner.

3968
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:28,800
enough for me. 100 points on the runner.
 

3969
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,390
enough for me. 100 points on the runner.
Maybe could have locked in an extra 40

3970
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:30,400
Maybe could have locked in an extra 40
 

3971
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,550
Maybe could have locked in an extra 40
points, but it's fine. So, there we go.

3972
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:32,560
points, but it's fine. So, there we go.
 

3973
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,149
points, but it's fine. So, there we go.
I don't want to get caught in whatever

3974
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:34,159
I don't want to get caught in whatever
 

3975
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,790
I don't want to get caught in whatever
comes now because there's a chance for

01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:36,800
comes now because there's a chance for
 

3977
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,189
comes now because there's a chance for
this if it really wants to to come and

3978
01:42:39,189 --> 01:42:39,199
this if it really wants to to come and
 

3979
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,470
this if it really wants to to come and
repric up into here.

3980
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:42,480
repric up into here.
 

3981
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,390
repric up into here.
Could have taken more off here, I guess.

3982
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:44,400
Could have taken more off here, I guess.
 

3983
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,109
Could have taken more off here, I guess.
But, uh, if you're going to be a nasty

3984
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:47,119
But, uh, if you're going to be a nasty
 

3985
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,109
But, uh, if you're going to be a nasty
bugger and do it, you can still hold for

3986
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:49,119
bugger and do it, you can still hold for
 

3987
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:52,310
bugger and do it, you can still hold for
this.

3988
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:52,320

 

3989
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,109

Trend's still good.

4011
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,390

I'm a bit blinded by this big move down.

Took my profits, but help my itchy
finger here. What's the next key level

4016
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:29,679

4017
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,950
finger here. What's the next key level
it might move up from? I mean,

4018
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:32,960
it might move up from? I mean,
 

4019
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,270
it might move up from? I mean,
we're into a a node now, Joe, but like

4020
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:35,280
we're into a a node now, Joe, but like
 

4021
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,790
we're into a a node now, Joe, but like
it's very possible it comes to previous

4022
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:36,800
it's very possible it comes to previous
 

4023
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,790
it's very possible it comes to previous
week or a low. It's very possible we

4024
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:38,800
week or a low. It's very possible we
 

4025
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,310
week or a low. It's very possible we
come down here. We have previous week

4026
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:40,320
come down here. We have previous week
 

4027
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,270
come down here. We have previous week
low. I don't know where it stops. Um, we

4028
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:43,280
low. I don't know where it stops. Um, we
 

4029
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,629
low. I don't know where it stops. Um, we
haven't broken the weekly low.

4030
01:43:46,629 --> 01:43:46,639
haven't broken the weekly low.
 

4031
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,709
haven't broken the weekly low.
We're still just sideways. I know we're

4032
01:43:48,709 --> 01:43:48,719
We're still just sideways. I know we're
 

4033
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,629
We're still just sideways. I know we're
in a cell, but this is just like

4034
01:43:50,629 --> 01:43:50,639
in a cell, but this is just like
 

4035
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:55,910
in a cell, but this is just like
yesterday. If we look at a daily,

4036
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:55,920

 

4037
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,270

right, we're just doing the same thing

4038
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:57,280
right, we're just doing the same thing
 

4039
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,790
right, we're just doing the same thing
as yesterday. Nothing's actually

4040
01:43:58,790 --> 01:43:58,800
as yesterday. Nothing's actually
 

4041
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,870
as yesterday. Nothing's actually
changed.

4042
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:00,880
changed.
 

4043
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:06,390
changed.
We're still wedged in.

4044
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:06,400

 

4045
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,229

Wedged in.

4046
01:44:08,229 --> 01:44:08,239
Wedged in.
 

4047
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:09,990
Wedged in.
Most of the volume's taking place in

here,
 

4051
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,590
here,
right? It's not like we're seeing this

4052
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:13,600
right? It's not like we're seeing this
 

4053
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,470
right? It's not like we're seeing this
or seeing this. So, we are building so

4054
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:16,480
or seeing this. So, we are building so
 

4055
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:24,550
or seeing this. So, we are building so
much liquidity here. It's insane.

4056
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:24,560

 

4057
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,870

I will say this is often what tops start

4058
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:26,880
I will say this is often what tops start
 

4059
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,870
I will say this is often what tops start
to look like. If we have a look,

4060
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:30,880
to look like. If we have a look,
 

4061
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,590
to look like. If we have a look,
you over here.

you over here.
 

4063

you over here.
If we look at how we often like to top,

4064
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:39,119
If we look at how we often like to top,
 

4065
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:44,629
If we look at how we often like to top,
they don't happen overnight.

doing.
 

4133
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,870
doing.
And the other thing is we haven't tested

4134
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:38,880
And the other thing is we haven't tested
 

4135
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:43,510
And the other thing is we haven't tested

Right? Here's the 200 day just sat here

4140
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:49,920
Right? Here's the 200 day just sat here
 

4141
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,430
Right? Here's the 200 day just sat here
waiting to be tested on this pivot.

4142
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:53,440
waiting to be tested on this pivot.

200 weeks probably down here somewhere,

4144
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:55,600
200 weeks probably down here somewhere,
 

4145
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,430
200 weeks probably down here somewhere,
right? We need to test that. It's a

4146
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:57,440
right? We need to test that. It's a
 

4147
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,030
right? We need to test that. It's a
healthy market when we test it and

4148
01:46:59,030 --> 01:46:59,040
healthy market when we test it and
 

4149
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,950
healthy market when we test it and
absorb it. Trade under, we trade over,

4150
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:00,960
absorb it. Trade under, we trade over,
 

4151
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,669
absorb it. Trade under, we trade over,
we absorb, we go. We need we actually

4152
01:47:03,669 --> 01:47:03,679
we absorb, we go. We need we actually
 

4153
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:05,510
we absorb, we go. We need we actually
need a back test of this. It would be

4154
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:05,520
need a back test of this. It would be
 

4155
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,750
need a back test of this. It would be
healthy for the market to do it. So,

4156
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:09,760
healthy for the market to do it. So,
 

4157
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:23,430
healthy for the market to do it. So,
it's not unusual is all I'm saying.

Just scout that bounce. Yeah, we're all

4166
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,400
Just scout that bounce. Yeah, we're all
 

4167
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,830
Just scout that bounce. Yeah, we're all
all the way back now, aren't we? This is

4168
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:31,840
all the way back now, aren't we? This is
 

4169
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,030
all the way back now, aren't we? This is
what I talked about where I don't want

4170
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:33,040
what I talked about where I don't want
 

4171
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,390
what I talked about where I don't want
to hold from 30s. Once we reclaim 30s,

4172
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:36,400
to hold from 30s. Once we reclaim 30s,
 

4173
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,870
to hold from 30s. Once we reclaim 30s,
it's we can start getting the squeeze.

4174
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:38,880
it's we can start getting the squeeze.
 

4175
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,109
it's we can start getting the squeeze.
Is it 30s

4176
01:47:41,109 --> 01:47:41,119
Is it 30s
 

4177
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:42,790
Is it 30s
somewhere around here? Yeah, 30s. This

4178
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:42,800
somewhere around here? Yeah, 30s. This
 

4179
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,390
somewhere around here? Yeah, 30s. This
shelf here, we've come right back to the

4180
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:44,400
shelf here, we've come right back to the
 

4181
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,070
shelf here, we've come right back to the
initial balance. My purple line, a bit

4182
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:46,080
initial balance. My purple line, a bit
 

4183
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,070
initial balance. My purple line, a bit
of a shelf here. So like I said, they

4184
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:48,080
of a shelf here. So like I said, they
 

4185
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:53,030
of a shelf here. So like I said, they
might need to do something like this

4186
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:53,040
might need to do something like this
 

4187
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,590
might need to do something like this
to offer relief to trap balls to resell.

4188
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:55,600
to offer relief to trap balls to resell.
 

4189
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,590
to offer relief to trap balls to resell.
If they come back inside this though, I

4190
01:47:57,590 --> 01:47:57,600
If they come back inside this though, I
 

4191
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,629
If they come back inside this though, I
would start being careful. All right, if

4192
01:48:00,629 --> 01:48:00,639
would start being careful. All right, if
 

4193
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,310
would start being careful. All right, if
we are going to start holding this, I

4194
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:02,320
we are going to start holding this, I
 

4195
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,830
we are going to start holding this, I
would start to be careful about thinking

4196
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:03,840
would start to be careful about thinking
 

4197
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,149
would start to be careful about thinking
about any more downside. You can see the

4198
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
about any more downside. You can see the
 

4199
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:07,910
about any more downside. You can see the
importance of this initial balance and

4200
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:07,920
importance of this initial balance and
 

4201
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,109
importance of this initial balance and
this node. Um, just catching up with

4202
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:11,119
this node. Um, just catching up with
 

4203
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:15,510
this node. Um, just catching up with
what you guys are saying here.

4204
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:15,520

 

4205
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,830

Yeah, volume volume nodes can be targets

4206
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:17,840
Yeah, volume volume nodes can be targets
 

4207
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,470
Yeah, volume volume nodes can be targets
for TPS for sure. Sure. If you think

4208
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:20,480
for TPS for sure. Sure. If you think
 

4209
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,070
for TPS for sure. Sure. If you think
about what volume is, it's just a place

4210
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:22,080
about what volume is, it's just a place
 

4211
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,750
about what volume is, it's just a place
where lots of people participated. So,

4212
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:23,760
where lots of people participated. So,
 

4213
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,590
where lots of people participated. So,
we respect that. Low volume nodes we can

4214
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:25,600
we respect that. Low volume nodes we can
 

4215
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,830
we respect that. Low volume nodes we can
use as like support and resistance, but

4216
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:27,840
use as like support and resistance, but
 

4217
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,830
use as like support and resistance, but
we can trade through them very very fast

4218
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:29,840
we can trade through them very very fast
 

4219
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,189
we can trade through them very very fast
if no one wants to turn up there. So,

4220
01:48:31,189 --> 01:48:31,199
if no one wants to turn up there. So,
 

4221
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,669
if no one wants to turn up there. So,
I'd use them as like false breakout

4222
01:48:33,669 --> 01:48:33,679
I'd use them as like false breakout
 

4223
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:36,470
I'd use them as like false breakout
parts of a low volume node and high

4224
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:36,480
parts of a low volume node and high
 

4225
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,950
parts of a low volume node and high
volume nodes as like proper support and

4226
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:38,960
volume nodes as like proper support and
 

4227
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,830
volume nodes as like proper support and
resistance.

4228
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:41,840
resistance.
 

4229
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,430
resistance.

4323
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,830
How do I choose anchor points for VWAP?
Uh 9:30 open and like a news print or a

4324
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:45,840
Uh 9:30 open and like a news print or a
 

4325
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,910
Uh 9:30 open and like a news print or a
big peak high or a big peak low is where

4326
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:47,920
big peak high or a big peak low is where
 

4327
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,750
big peak high or a big peak low is where
I would choose them.

4328
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:51,760

 

4329
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,390

Single prints from 675 to 725 could be

4330
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:54,400
Single prints from 675 to 725 could be
 

4331
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:58,870
Single prints from 675 to 725 could be
filled. Let's have a look.

4332
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:58,880

 

4333
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:01,910

Yeah, up here. Yeah,

4334
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:01,920
Yeah, up here. Yeah,
 

4335
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,990
Yeah, up here. Yeah,
definitely move down to one minute. See

4336
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:04,000
definitely move down to one minute. See
 

4337
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,830
definitely move down to one minute. See
if we see more. Yeah, I agree.

4338
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:07,840
if we see more. Yeah, I agree.
 

4339
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,350
if we see more. Yeah, I agree.
if they want to. But we know this is

4340
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:09,360
if they want to. But we know this is
 

4341
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,629
if they want to. But we know this is
strong, right? This is where strong

4342
01:51:10,629 --> 01:51:10,639
strong, right? This is where strong
 

4343
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,470
strong, right? This is where strong
selling came in. This is where we broke

4344
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:12,480
selling came in. This is where we broke
 

4345
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,830
selling came in. This is where we broke
down from. Remember, we took it from

4346
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:13,840
down from. Remember, we took it from
 

4347
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,470
down from. Remember, we took it from
7:30.

4348
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:16,480
7:30.
 

4349
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,950
7:30.
We took it from here and this was the

4350
01:51:18,950 --> 01:51:18,960
We took it from here and this was the
 

4351
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,030
We took it from here and this was the
follow through. Buyers definitely got

4352
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:21,040
follow through. Buyers definitely got
 

4353
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:22,790
follow through. Buyers definitely got
caught here. But yeah, if we get relief,

4354
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:22,800
caught here. But yeah, if we get relief,
 

4355
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,470
caught here. But yeah, if we get relief,
we've got all these imbalances to fill

4356
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:24,480
we've got all these imbalances to fill
 

4357
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:33,430
we've got all these imbalances to fill
if they really want to.

4358
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:33,440

 

4359
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,790

Wondering if there's a benefit over

4360
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:34,800
Wondering if there's a benefit over
 

4361
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:37,510
Wondering if there's a benefit over
Ninja Trader over Trading V. Uh well the

ATM strategy for a start, copying for a

01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:40,159
ATM strategy for a start, copying for a
 

4365
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:42,229
ATM strategy for a start, copying for a

4366
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:42,239
start, not being web- based. I think all
 

4367
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:50,390
start, not being web- based. I think all
those things for me.

4368
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:50,400

 

4369
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,990

Monday's a holiday. Yeah, it's Martin

4372
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,400

 

4373
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,910

I don't think we'll get a V-shaped

4374
01:51:57,910 --> 01:51:57,920
I don't think we'll get a V-shaped
 

4375
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,910
I don't think we'll get a V-shaped
recovery. I think we might trade into

4376
01:51:59,910 --> 01:51:59,920
recovery. I think we might trade into
 

4377
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:01,189
recovery. I think we might trade into
range, but I don't think we'll go all

4378
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:01,199
range, but I don't think we'll go all
 

4379
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:02,629
range, but I don't think we'll go all
the way back up today, but who knows? It

4380
01:52:02,629 --> 01:52:02,639
the way back up today, but who knows? It
 

4381
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:09,350
the way back up today, but who knows? It
is a Friday.

4382
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:09,360

 

4383
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,709

What is indicator order flow? What do

4384
01:52:12,709 --> 01:52:12,719
What is indicator order flow? What do
 

4385
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:14,390
What is indicator order flow? What do

you mean
for this? I'm going to do a video on it

4388
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:17,199
for this? I'm going to do a video on it
 

4389
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:18,310
for this? I'm going to do a video on it
tomorrow. It's just the footprint

4390
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:18,320
tomorrow. It's just the footprint
 

4391
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,390

4393
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:28,070

4394
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:28,080

 

4395
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,750

previous day low. Yeah, I know. It It

4396
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:29,760
previous day low. Yeah, I know. It It
 

4397
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,189
previous day low. Yeah, I know. It It
missed it, didn't it? But like I said,

4398
01:52:31,189 --> 01:52:31,199
missed it, didn't it? But like I said,
 

4399
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:33,589
missed it, didn't it? But like I said,
it did take it on the ETFs, right? So

4400
01:52:33,589 --> 01:52:33,599
it did take it on the ETFs, right? So
 

4401
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:36,709
it did take it on the ETFs, right? So
cash cash took it. So if you go to like

4402
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:36,719
cash cash took it. So if you go to like
 

4403
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:42,470
cash cash took it. So if you go to like
QQQ,

4404
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:42,480

 

4405
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,149

right, we took it right here. So we

4406
01:52:44,149 --> 01:52:44,159
right, we took it right here. So we
 

4407
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:45,750
right, we took it right here. So we
drifted underneath. We already took it.

4408
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:45,760
drifted underneath. We already took it.
 

4409
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:50,390
drifted underneath. We already took it.
If you go to the spiders,

4410
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:50,400

 

4411
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,310

we took it, right? So it's only the

4412
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:52,320
we took it, right? So it's only the
 

4413
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,070
we took it, right? So it's only the
futures that didn't take it. So it's

4414
01:52:54,070 --> 01:52:54,080
futures that didn't take it. So it's
 

4415
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,149
futures that didn't take it. So it's
worth being, you know, being aware of

4416
01:52:56,149 --> 01:52:56,159
worth being, you know, being aware of
 

4417
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:58,629
worth being, you know, being aware of
that. Sometimes cash players got got the

4418
01:52:58,629 --> 01:52:58,639
that. Sometimes cash players got got the
 

4419
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:07,430
that. Sometimes cash players got got the
move that they wanted. [snorts]

4420
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:07,440

Right, back to previous week PC now. So,

4432
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:21,840
Right, back to previous week PC now. So,
 

4433
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,910
Right, back to previous week PC now. So,
if they're going to fade it, they really

4434
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:23,920
if they're going to fade it, they really
 

4435
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,910
if they're going to fade it, they really
should think about doing it anywhere

4436
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:25,920
should think about doing it anywhere
 

4437
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,430
should think about doing it anywhere
from like sort of where we are now,

4438
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:27,440
from like sort of where we are now,
 

4439
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,109
from like sort of where we are now,
maybe even up to VWOP. They let the

4440
01:53:29,109 --> 01:53:29,119
maybe even up to VWOP. They let the
 

4441
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:31,430
maybe even up to VWOP. They let the
relief happen to VWAP. I would start to

4442
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:31,440
relief happen to VWAP. I would start to
 

4443
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,669
relief happen to VWAP. I would start to
be concerned for this uh for all you

4444
01:53:33,669 --> 01:53:33,679
be concerned for this uh for all you
 

4445
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:36,470
be concerned for this uh for all you
shorts. All right. All right. If we

4446
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:36,480
shorts. All right. All right. If we
 

4447
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:39,430
shorts. All right. All right. If we
start to bid above this or do this. All

4448
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:39,440
start to bid above this or do this. All
 

4449
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,709
start to bid above this or do this. All
right. I wouldn't be thinking about

4450
01:53:40,709 --> 01:53:40,719
right. I wouldn't be thinking about
 

4451
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:41,750
right. I wouldn't be thinking about
short for the rest of the day. Even

4452
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:41,760
short for the rest of the day. Even
 

4453
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,350
short for the rest of the day. Even
though there's got this target here, if

4454
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:43,360
though there's got this target here, if
 

4455
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,750
though there's got this target here, if
they start to hold volume and create

4456
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:45,760
they start to hold volume and create
 

4457
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,510
they start to hold volume and create
volume in here, they will leave these

4458
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:47,520
volume in here, they will leave these
 

4459
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,189
volume in here, they will leave these
guys trapped. All right. Shorts at the

4460
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:49,199
guys trapped. All right. Shorts at the
 

4461
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:50,950
guys trapped. All right. Shorts at the
low of day have trapped. And there were

4462
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:50,960
low of day have trapped. And there were
 

4463
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,950
low of day have trapped. And there were
shorts at lower day trapped. Okay, we

4464
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:52,960
shorts at lower day trapped. Okay, we
 

4465
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,270
shorts at lower day trapped. Okay, we
had big guys come in at low of day. You

4466
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:55,280
had big guys come in at low of day. You
 

4467
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,510
had big guys come in at low of day. You
can see all this delta under 620 was

4468
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:57,520
can see all this delta under 620 was
 

4469
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,669
can see all this delta under 620 was
sellside. They are caught. All right. So

4470
01:53:59,669 --> 01:53:59,679
sellside. They are caught. All right. So
 

4471
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:02,229
sellside. They are caught. All right. So
if they start to hold bids on pullbacks,

4472
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
if they start to hold bids on pullbacks,
 

4473
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:04,229
if they start to hold bids on pullbacks,
I would kind of leave the shorts alone.

4474
01:54:04,229 --> 01:54:04,239
I would kind of leave the shorts alone.
 

4475
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:05,750
I would kind of leave the shorts alone.
All right? If we start to hold inside of

4476
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:05,760
All right? If we start to hold inside of
 

4477
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,109
All right? If we start to hold inside of
the initial balance, if we start to

4478
01:54:07,109 --> 01:54:07,119
the initial balance, if we start to
 

4479
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:10,713
the initial balance, if we start to
reclaim areas, you want to be careful.

4480
01:54:10,713 --> 01:54:10,723
reclaim areas, you want to be careful.
 

4481
01:54:10,723 --> 01:54:18,709
reclaim areas, you want to be careful.

to do. That's how you have it anchored

4510
01:55:05,910 --> 01:55:05,920
to do. That's how you have it anchored
 

4511
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,629
to do. That's how you have it anchored
to the 9:30 to 4:00. Like it does it by

4512
01:55:08,629 --> 01:55:08,639
to the 9:30 to 4:00. Like it does it by
 

4513
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:11,750
to the 9:30 to 4:00. Like it does it by
itself once you do that.

4514
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:11,760
itself once you do that.
 

4515
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,629
itself once you do that.
I'm sure I put it in that video.

4516
01:55:14,629 --> 01:55:14,639
I'm sure I put it in that video.
 

4517
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:32,070
I'm sure I put it in that video.
Maybe I didn't. Sure I did.

01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:34,870

So they are trying now to absorb initial

01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:34,880
So they are trying now to absorb initial
 

4521
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:38,070
So they are trying now to absorb initial
balance here. ES has just rejected New

4522
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:38,080
balance here. ES has just rejected New
 

4523
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:41,350

York VWOP and PDC.

It's a interesting level. This it is

4526
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:43,440
It's a interesting level. This it is
 

4527
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,669
It's a interesting level. This it is
definitely an interesting level. Shorts

4528
01:55:45,669 --> 01:55:45,679
definitely an interesting level. Shorts
 

4529
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:47,270
definitely an interesting level. Shorts
will need to come in soon if they are

4530
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:47,280
will need to come in soon if they are
 

4531
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,629
will need to come in soon if they are
going to look to send this back

4532
01:55:48,629 --> 01:55:48,639
going to look to send this back
 

4533
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:50,629
going to look to send this back
downside. Buyers will want to defend

4534
01:55:50,629 --> 01:55:50,639
downside. Buyers will want to defend
 

4535
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:52,229
downside. Buyers will want to defend
this level. This is where the battle is

4536
01:55:52,229 --> 01:55:52,239
this level. This is where the battle is
 

4537
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:54,390
this level. This is where the battle is
going to start for sentiment for the

4538
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:54,400
going to start for sentiment for the
 

4539
01:55:54,400 --> 01:56:14,870
going to start for sentiment for the
next hour or so, I'd say.

4540
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:14,880

 

4541
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,709

So if they lose this shelf of 5960s,

4542
01:56:18,709 --> 01:56:18,719
So if they lose this shelf of 5960s,
 

4543
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:21,430
So if they lose this shelf of 5960s,
possibly get a retest of 633s again. All

4544
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:21,440
possibly get a retest of 633s again. All
 

4545
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:24,149
possibly get a retest of 633s again. All
right. So if sellers come in here, they

4546
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:24,159
right. So if sellers come in here, they
 

4547
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:26,070
right. So if sellers come in here, they
will need to send it under this shelf to

4548
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:26,080
will need to send it under this shelf to
 

4549
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,830
will need to send it under this shelf to
here. If buyers keep absorbing, they

4550
01:56:27,830 --> 01:56:27,840
here. If buyers keep absorbing, they
 

4551
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,510
here. If buyers keep absorbing, they
will try and trade back inside of value.

4552
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:29,520
will try and trade back inside of value.
 

4553
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,270
will try and trade back inside of value.
So sellers are looking to do this. They

4554
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:31,280
So sellers are looking to do this. They
 

4555
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,189
So sellers are looking to do this. They
will cover some here and then maybe

4556
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:33,199
will cover some here and then maybe
 

4557
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:35,270
will cover some here and then maybe
they'll get one of these. Buyers,

4558
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:35,280
they'll get one of these. Buyers,
 

4559
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,950
they'll get one of these. Buyers,
because we've had like two legs, buyers

4560

because we've had like two legs, buyers
 

4561

4657
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,189

All right. So, any of you took that

4658
02:01:51,189 --> 02:01:51,199
All right. So, any of you took that
 

4659
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:53,270
All right. So, any of you took that
long, the reclaim of IB and initial

4660
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:53,280
long, the reclaim of IB and initial
 

4661
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:54,310
long, the reclaim of IB and initial
balance, you'd want to be paying

4662
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:54,320
balance, you'd want to be paying
 

4663
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:55,990
balance, you'd want to be paying
yourself some into this low volume node

4664
02:01:55,990 --> 02:01:56,000
yourself some into this low volume node
 

4665
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,470
yourself some into this low volume node
and see if you can get through 700s and

4666
02:01:58,470 --> 02:01:58,480
and see if you can get through 700s and
 

4667
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:01,030
and see if you can get through 700s and
720s. Now, if any of you took the long

4668
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:01,040
720s. Now, if any of you took the long
 

4669
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:03,750
720s. Now, if any of you took the long
from here for the reclaim,

4670
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:03,760
from here for the reclaim,
 

4671
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,750
from here for the reclaim,
you're in leg two here. So, you want to

4672
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:05,760
you're in leg two here. So, you want to
 

4673
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:07,750
you're in leg two here. So, you want to
be careful in case they resell it. You

4674
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:07,760
be careful in case they resell it. You
 

4675
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:10,229
be careful in case they resell it. You
never know, you might get lucky, but you

4676
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:10,239
never know, you might get lucky, but you
 

4677
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:12,550
never know, you might get lucky, but you
want to position yourself so that you're

4678
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:12,560
want to position yourself so that you're
 

4679
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:15,109

02:02:15,109 --> 02:02:15,119
trimming into this. You want to be
 

4681
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:17,030
trimming into this. You want to be
locking some profits in into the key

4682
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:17,040
locking some profits in into the key
 

4683
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:18,470
locking some profits in into the key
levels. You do not want to be

4684
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:18,480
levels. You do not want to be
 

4685
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:28,709
levels. You do not want to be
overstaying. You're welcome.

4686
02:02:28,709 --> 02:02:28,719

 

4687

[snorts]

4690
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:43,440

 

4691
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:46,709

Let's see if they re reclaim this now in

4692
02:02:46,709 --> 02:02:46,719
Let's see if they re reclaim this now in
 

4693
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:48,229
Let's see if they re reclaim this now in
control.

4694
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:48,239
control.
 

4695
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:49,830
control.
If they hold the next dip in that then

4696
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:49,840
If they hold the next dip in that then
 

4697
02:02:49,840 --> 02:03:00,950
If they hold the next dip in that then
they get offer more relief probably.

4698
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:00,960

 

4699
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,709

back towards these 700s.

4700
02:03:04,709 --> 02:03:04,719
back towards these 700s.
 

4701
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:08,629
back towards these 700s.
Trying to buy this at the moment.

4709
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,790
buying this here. The buy the buy was
the initial balance reclaim. This can be

4710
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:14,800
the initial balance reclaim. This can be
 

4711
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:18,550
the initial balance reclaim. This can be
a second leg which is then sold into

4712
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:18,560
a second leg which is then sold into
 

4713
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,310
a second leg which is then sold into
waiting to see. We've just failed

4714
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:20,320
waiting to see. We've just failed
 

4715
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:24,550
waiting to see. We've just failed
previous day close.

4716
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:24,560

 

4717
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,470

And do we start washing down here or do

4718
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:26,480
And do we start washing down here or do
 

4719
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:29,669
And do we start washing down here or do
they bid at these 85s?

4720
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
they bid at these 85s?
 

4721
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,430
they bid at these 85s?
These kind of levels here become key

4722
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:31,440
These kind of levels here become key
 

4723
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,030
These kind of levels here become key
now. All right. So buyers will want to

4724
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:33,040
now. All right. So buyers will want to
 

4725
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:35,350
now. All right. So buyers will want to
hold the bid here

4726
02:03:35,350 --> 02:03:35,360
hold the bid here
 

4727
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,270
hold the bid here
and complete this move. Sellers will

4728
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:37,280
and complete this move. Sellers will
 

4729
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:39,589
and complete this move. Sellers will
want to get a close under here and

4730
02:03:39,589 --> 02:03:39,599
want to get a close under here and
 

4731
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:41,189
want to get a close under here and
finish this target. But they have to

4732
02:03:41,189 --> 02:03:41,199
finish this target. But they have to
 

4733
02:03:41,199 --> 02:03:43,109
finish this target. But they have to
respect this now because we've now built

4734
02:03:43,109 --> 02:03:43,119
respect this now because we've now built
 

4735
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:58,470
respect this now because we've now built
liquidity through the session.

4736
02:03:58,470 --> 02:03:58,480

as you who said the daily. If we look at
 

4741
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,870
as you who said the daily. If we look at
this

4742
02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:04,880
this
 

4743
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,149
this
right here,

4744
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:08,159

 

4745
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:11,350

current week value area low and 20-day

4746
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:11,360
current week value area low and 20-day
 

4747

4750
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:15,520
you know, we can we can just get stuck
 

4751
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:17,350
you know, we can we can just get stuck
here because we have everything very

4752
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:17,360
here because we have everything very
 

4753
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:19,510

very very tight here. Where's the 50-day
 

4755
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:22,310
very very tight here. Where's the 50-day

4757
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,070

as well. Like at the low of day, it's

4758
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:24,080
as well. Like at the low of day, it's
 

4759
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:26,070
as well. Like at the low of day, it's
just everything is tight at the moment

4760
02:04:26,070 --> 02:04:26,080
just everything is tight at the moment
 

4761
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:28,470
just everything is tight at the moment
in this market while it has to make its

4762
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:28,480
in this market while it has to make its
 

4763
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:29,910
in this market while it has to make its
decision. All right, we're starting to

4764
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:29,920
decision. All right, we're starting to
 

4765
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,030
decision. All right, we're starting to
lose these levels. So, watching here. If

4766
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:33,040
lose these levels. So, watching here. If
 

4767
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,470
lose these levels. So, watching here. If
they start losing this in initial

4768
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:34,480
they start losing this in initial
 

4769
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,550
they start losing this in initial
balance, I'm going to look to size in

4770
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:36,560
balance, I'm going to look to size in
 

4771
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:43,910
balance, I'm going to look to size in
for a uh move back lower.

4772
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:43,920

 

4773
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:45,350

Not before that. They're going to have

4774
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:45,360
Not before that. They're going to have
 

4775
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:48,229
Not before that. They're going to have
to prove to me that they're done with

4776
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:48,239
to prove to me that they're done with
 

4777
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:50,629
to prove to me that they're done with
this. I'm not not seeing a prove yet,

4778
02:04:50,629 --> 02:04:50,639
this. I'm not not seeing a prove yet,
 

4779
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:54,149
this. I'm not not seeing a prove yet,
but it's it's a level I'm interested in.

4780
02:04:54,149 --> 02:04:54,159
but it's it's a level I'm interested in.
 

4781
02:04:54,159 --> 02:04:55,910
but it's it's a level I'm interested in.
Remember, the main trend is down. We've

4782
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:55,920
Remember, the main trend is down. We've
 

4783
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:58,629
Remember, the main trend is down. We've
just done two legs back up.

4784
02:04:58,629 --> 02:04:58,639
just done two legs back up.
 

4785
02:04:58,639 --> 02:05:00,629
just done two legs back up.
We came right into PDC. I would almost

4786
02:05:00,629 --> 02:05:00,639
We came right into PDC. I would almost
 

4787
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:03,430
We came right into PDC. I would almost
rather it traded into here and failed.

4788
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:03,440
rather it traded into here and failed.

4793
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:10,870
I will be willing to short if we get

At least you got your money out of them,

At least you got your money out of them,

At least you got your money out of them,

the one hours. Yeah,

02:05:48,159 --> 02:05:49,430
the one hours. Yeah,
it's just because we're in a giant

4810
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:49,440
it's just because we're in a giant
 

4811
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,189
it's just because we're in a giant
balance. That's all it is. We're in a

4812
02:05:51,189 --> 02:05:51,199
balance. That's all it is. We're in a
 

4813
02:05:51,199 --> 02:05:53,350
balance. That's all it is. We're in a
giant balance. [sighs] So, previous week

02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,360
giant balance. [sighs] So, previous week

point control buys are trying to absorb

02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,470
point control buys are trying to absorb
it. They want to complete this move

4818
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:56,480
it. They want to complete this move
 

4819
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,310
it. They want to complete this move
here. I'm not going to buy this.

4820
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:00,320
here. I'm not going to buy this.
 

4821
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:02,070
here. I'm not going to buy this.
I'm going to wait to see if we come back

4822
02:06:02,070 --> 02:06:02,080
I'm going to wait to see if we come back
 

4823
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:04,709
I'm going to wait to see if we come back
under this for the day or if we get

4824
02:06:04,709 --> 02:06:04,719
under this for the day or if we get
 

4825
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:08,550
under this for the day or if we get
stuck here. If we reclaim, then I might

4826
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:08,560
stuck here. If we reclaim, then I might
 

4827
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:10,470
stuck here. If we reclaim, then I might
not take the long. The long opportunity

4828
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:10,480
not take the long. The long opportunity
 

4829
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,310
not take the long. The long opportunity
is probably where I stopped out there

4830
02:06:12,310 --> 02:06:12,320
is probably where I stopped out there
 

4831
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:15,589
is probably where I stopped out there
and then add there and trim. I'd rather

4832
02:06:15,589 --> 02:06:15,599
and then add there and trim. I'd rather
 

4833
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:17,510
and then add there and trim. I'd rather
stay short on this for a protrend short

02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:17,520
stay short on this for a protrend short

stay short on this for a protrend short

not. If it's a low volume day, I'll see

4910
02:08:59,750 --> 02:08:59,760
not. If it's a low volume day, I'll see
 

4911
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:02,470
not. If it's a low volume day, I'll see
what the setup looks like on the Sunday

02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:02,480
what the setup looks like on the Sunday

be had on Monday, I'll trade it. But
 

4917
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:09,669
be had on Monday, I'll trade it. But
volume's likely to be lower.

02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
volume's likely to be lower.
 

4919

we've reclaimed initial balance. You can

lost the bid so far. And um we can
 

5029
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:24,870

You've got this shelf

something to risk off but it's counter
 

5141
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:03,990
something to risk off but it's counter
trend. So, you need to be locking in

5142
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:04,000
trend. So, you need to be locking in
 

5143
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,589

02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:10,709
buyers come in here and they're done
with it and the protrend takes back

02:16:10,709 --> 02:16:10,719
with it and the protrend takes back
 

5151
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:13,030
with it and the protrend takes back
over, this can happen very very quickly.

over, this can happen very very quickly.
 

5153
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,790

Okay, let it go, Alex. All right, back

5420
02:24:13,349 --> 02:24:13,359
Okay, let it go, Alex. All right, back
 

5421
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:16,710
Okay, let it go, Alex. All right, back
to 25s. Right. Do they rebid 25s or is

5422
02:24:16,710 --> 02:24:16,720

5423
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:18,309
to 25s. Right. Do they rebid 25s or is
this looking above and fail? We hit New

5424
02:24:18,309 --> 02:24:18,319
this looking above and fail? We hit New
 

5425
02:24:18,319 --> 02:24:20,230

York VW up. We haven't hit 24hour. We

5426
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:20,240
York VW up. We haven't hit 24hour. We
 

5427
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,150
York VW up. We haven't hit 24hour. We
came in low volume node. These are the

5428
02:24:22,150 --> 02:24:22,160
came in low volume node. These are the
 

5429
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:24,070
came in low volume node. These are the
levels of interest. Now, do these buyers

5430
02:24:24,070 --> 02:24:24,080
levels of interest. Now, do these buyers
 

5431
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:25,750
levels of interest. Now, do these buyers
up here get trapped? We saw aggressive

5432
02:24:25,750 --> 02:24:25,760

buying up here. Do they get trapped? And
 

5435
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:29,429
buying up here. Do they get trapped? And
do we start to flush or do they need to

5436
02:24:29,429 --> 02:24:29,439
do we start to flush or do they need to
 

5437
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:31,110
do we start to flush or do they need to
get to 50s? Are they looking for a

5438
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:31,120
get to 50s? Are they looking for a
 

5439
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:33,349
get to 50s? Are they looking for a
rotation to 50s? ES looks so flipping

5440
02:24:33,349 --> 02:24:33,359
rotation to 50s? ES looks so flipping
 

5441
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:36,309
rotation to 50s? ES looks so flipping
strong right now. VIX is trying to find

02:24:36,309 --> 02:24:36,319
strong right now. VIX is trying to find
 

5443
02:24:36,319 --> 02:24:44,735

a bit of a bid. It is trying.

5444
02:24:44,735 --> 02:24:44,745

 

5445
02:24:44,745 --> 02:24:52,630

[snorts]

5446
02:24:52,630 --> 02:24:52,640

 

5447
02:24:52,640 --> 02:25:13,030

Just grind back up since that lower day.

5448
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:13,040

 

5449
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:15,190

I don't mind. Look, I don't mind asking

5450
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:15,200
I don't mind. Look, I don't mind asking
 

5451
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:17,110
I don't mind. Look, I don't mind asking
questions. It's when it's the same

5452
02:25:17,110 --> 02:25:17,120
questions. It's when it's the same
 

5453
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:18,469
questions. It's when it's the same
question on repeat, which means

5454
02:25:18,469 --> 02:25:18,479
question on repeat, which means
 

5455
02:25:18,479 --> 02:25:19,750
question on repeat, which means
someone's just going from stream to

5456
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:19,760
someone's just going from stream to
 

5457
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:22,389
someone's just going from stream to
stream to stream to stream and then has,

5458
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:22,399
stream to stream to stream and then has,
 

5459
02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:24,710

you know, I've been live now for what,

5460
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:24,720
you know, I've been live now for what,
 

5461
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:26,870
you know, I've been live now for what,
two hours and then says I'm being vague.

5462
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:26,880
two hours and then says I'm being vague.
 

5463
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:29,750
two hours and then says I'm being vague.
It's like it's just [\h__\h] that like that

5464
02:25:29,750 --> 02:25:29,760
It's like it's just [\h__\h] that like that
 

5465
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:32,389
It's like it's just [\h__\h] that like that
that annoys me. [\h__\h] off into one of the

5466
02:25:32,389 --> 02:25:32,399
that annoys me. [\h__\h] off into one of the
 

5467
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:33,750
that annoys me. [\h__\h] off into one of the
other channels then which teach you

5468
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:33,760
other channels then which teach you
 

5469
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:35,750
other channels then which teach you
nothing. I'd much rather you went there

5470
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:35,760
nothing. I'd much rather you went there
 

5471
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:43,030
nothing. I'd much rather you went there
with that attitude.

5472
02:25:43,030 --> 02:25:43,040

 

5473
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:45,349

Nice. Yeah, you got the Tyson trade. I'm

5474
02:25:45,349 --> 02:25:45,359
Nice. Yeah, you got the Tyson trade. I'm
 

5475
02:25:45,359 --> 02:25:47,590
Nice. Yeah, you got the Tyson trade. I'm
assuming, dude, you just you took the IB

5476
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:47,600
assuming, dude, you just you took the IB
 

5477
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:50,630
assuming, dude, you just you took the IB
to VW up the Tyson trade.

5478
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:50,640
to VW up the Tyson trade.
 

5479
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:52,070
to VW up the Tyson trade.
You're bread and butter, man. You're

5480
02:25:52,070 --> 02:25:52,080
You're bread and butter, man. You're
 

5481
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:54,790
You're bread and butter, man. You're
absolute killer with that stuff.

5482
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:54,800
absolute killer with that stuff.
 

5483
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:57,270
absolute killer with that stuff.
Okay, watching these 20s and 25s. See if

5484
02:25:57,270 --> 02:25:57,280
Okay, watching these 20s and 25s. See if
 

5485
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:58,790
Okay, watching these 20s and 25s. See if
they pull the bid here and we start to

5486
02:25:58,790 --> 02:25:58,800
they pull the bid here and we start to
 

5487
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:01,110
they pull the bid here and we start to
flush. Just being very, very careful.

5488
02:26:01,110 --> 02:26:01,120
flush. Just being very, very careful.
 

5489
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,870
flush. Just being very, very careful.
Not in yet. I'm waiting to see how we

5490
02:26:02,870 --> 02:26:02,880
Not in yet. I'm waiting to see how we
 

5491
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,790
Not in yet. I'm waiting to see how we
act here. Definitely caught some buyers

5492
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:04,800
act here. Definitely caught some buyers
 

5493
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:06,309
act here. Definitely caught some buyers
at the highs. I'm very aware that the

5494
02:26:06,309 --> 02:26:06,319
at the highs. I'm very aware that the
 

5495
02:26:06,319 --> 02:26:08,550
at the highs. I'm very aware that the
rotation to 50 hasn't been hit, but like

5496
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:08,560
rotation to 50 hasn't been hit, but like
 

5497
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,750
rotation to 50 hasn't been hit, but like
we said, 25s was the big level. Question

5498
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:11,760
we said, 25s was the big level. Question
 

5499
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:13,190
we said, 25s was the big level. Question
is, are we going to start to fade off

5500
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:13,200
is, are we going to start to fade off
 

5501
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,790
is, are we going to start to fade off
the New York VW up? Are we going to lose

5502
02:26:14,790 --> 02:26:14,800
the New York VW up? Are we going to lose
 

5503
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:17,429
the New York VW up? Are we going to lose
these 15s and come down to 90s and then

5504
02:26:17,429 --> 02:26:17,439
these 15s and come down to 90s and then
 

5505
02:26:17,439 --> 02:26:19,110
these 15s and come down to 90s and then
see some like downside follow through?

5506
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:19,120
see some like downside follow through?
 

5507
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:21,510
see some like downside follow through?
That's the question for me right now.

5508
02:26:21,510 --> 02:26:21,520
That's the question for me right now.
 

5509
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:25,910
That's the question for me right now.
Here we come into the imbalance.

5510
02:26:25,910 --> 02:26:25,920
Here we come into the imbalance.
 

5511
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:36,389
Here we come into the imbalance.
They're bidding 15s.

5512
02:26:36,389 --> 02:26:36,399

 

5513
02:26:36,399 --> 02:26:38,870

Point of control now shifted above us

5514
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:38,880
Point of control now shifted above us
 

5515
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:41,910
Point of control now shifted above us
into 30s or 27s. I want to see it start

5516
02:26:41,910 --> 02:26:41,920
into 30s or 27s. I want to see it start
 

5517
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:43,030
into 30s or 27s. I want to see it start
flushing now. If we're going to get

5518
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:43,040
flushing now. If we're going to get
 

5519
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:44,550
flushing now. If we're going to get
heavy, I want to see it start doing it

5520
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:44,560
heavy, I want to see it start doing it
 

5521
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:47,830
heavy, I want to see it start doing it
now. Otherwise, they're going to go 50s.

5522
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:47,840
now. Otherwise, they're going to go 50s.
 

5523
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:49,349
now. Otherwise, they're going to go 50s.
We're running out of time into lunch.

5524
02:26:49,349 --> 02:26:49,359
We're running out of time into lunch.
 

5525
02:26:49,359 --> 02:26:50,630
We're running out of time into lunch.
So, if we're going to start rejecting

5526
02:26:50,630 --> 02:26:50,640
So, if we're going to start rejecting
 

5527
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:52,230
So, if we're going to start rejecting
this node, we want to start doing it

5528
02:26:52,230 --> 02:26:52,240
this node, we want to start doing it
 

5529
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:54,630
this node, we want to start doing it
now.

5530
02:26:54,630 --> 02:26:54,640
now.
 

5531
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:56,469
now.
And then the fun and games really start

5532
02:26:56,469 --> 02:26:56,479
And then the fun and games really start
 

5533
02:26:56,479 --> 02:26:59,030
And then the fun and games really start
happening underneath here. So, for me,

5534
02:26:59,030 --> 02:26:59,040
happening underneath here. So, for me,
 

5535
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:02,070
happening underneath here. So, for me,
PC's just flipped on ninja to here. So,

5536
02:27:02,070 --> 02:27:02,080
PC's just flipped on ninja to here. So,
 

5537
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:04,150
PC's just flipped on ninja to here. So,
if we do something like this, it would

5538
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:04,160
if we do something like this, it would
 

5539
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:05,990
if we do something like this, it would
be fun. But if we do something like

5540
02:27:05,990 --> 02:27:06,000
be fun. But if we do something like
 

5541
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,790
be fun. But if we do something like
this, it would be really fun. What I be

5542
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:08,800
this, it would be really fun. What I be
 

5543
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:10,630
this, it would be really fun. What I be
want to be very aware of is if they want

5544
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:10,640
want to be very aware of is if they want
 

5545
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:12,950
want to be very aware of is if they want
to complete this move here, which is

5546
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:12,960
to complete this move here, which is
 

5547
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,469
to complete this move here, which is
very very possible. So I'm trying to be

5548
02:27:14,469 --> 02:27:14,479
very very possible. So I'm trying to be
 

5549
02:27:14,479 --> 02:27:16,150
very very possible. So I'm trying to be
patient for them to come here first,

5550
02:27:16,150 --> 02:27:16,160
patient for them to come here first,
 

5551
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:18,870
patient for them to come here first,
come under, reject, maybe even here for

5552
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:18,880
come under, reject, maybe even here for
 

5553
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:21,910
come under, reject, maybe even here for
a bigger ad. Until then, I want to be uh

5554
02:27:21,910 --> 02:27:21,920
a bigger ad. Until then, I want to be uh
 

5555
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:47,590
a bigger ad. Until then, I want to be uh
very very patient.

5556
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:47,600

 

5557
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:57,190

Yes, still showing strength there.

5558
02:27:57,190 --> 02:27:57,200

 

5559
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:59,030

50 still possible. They're still holding

5560
02:27:59,030 --> 02:27:59,040
50 still possible. They're still holding
 

5561
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:01,110
50 still possible. They're still holding
flow zones. They're still grinding back.

5562
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:01,120
flow zones. They're still grinding back.
 

5563
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:03,429
flow zones. They're still grinding back.
50s and VWAP still possible if they want

5564
02:28:03,429 --> 02:28:03,439
50s and VWAP still possible if they want
 

5565
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:05,190
50s and VWAP still possible if they want
to do it.

5566
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:05,200
to do it.
 

5567
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,910
to do it.
Cannot rule that move out. Need to be

5568
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:07,920
Cannot rule that move out. Need to be
 

5569
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,190
Cannot rule that move out. Need to be
patient. If we're going to play

5570

What is the edge of this node?

5576
02:28:17,429 --> 02:28:17,439
What is the edge of this node?
 

5577
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:25,270
What is the edge of this node?
It's so far away.

5578
02:28:25,270 --> 02:28:25,280

5589
02:28:54,319 --> 02:28:56,070
what's going on,
it's a game changer, isn't it? Like,

5590
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:56,080
it's a game changer, isn't it? Like,
 

5591
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:57,750
it's a game changer, isn't it? Like,
when you see buyers buying the highs or

5592
02:28:57,750 --> 02:28:57,760
when you see buyers buying the highs or
 

5593
02:28:57,760 --> 02:28:59,190
when you see buyers buying the highs or
sellers selling the lows, you can see

5594
02:28:59,190 --> 02:28:59,200
sellers selling the lows, you can see
 

5595
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:10,550
sellers selling the lows, you can see
who's trapped very, very quickly.

5596
02:29:10,550 --> 02:29:10,560

 

5597
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:13,429

thing is ES is starting to print over

5598

And you got to think like if they don't

5602
02:29:20,469 --> 02:29:20,479
And you got to think like if they don't
 

5603
02:29:20,479 --> 02:29:22,230
And you got to think like if they don't
sell it soon, we're going to be at New

5604
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:22,240
sell it soon, we're going to be at New

what's this 13s
100 lot 200 about 300 300 of them stuck

5636
02:30:44,790 --> 02:30:44,800
100 lot 200 about 300 300 of them stuck
 

5637
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:47,910
100 lot 200 about 300 300 of them stuck
between 20 and and the 10ens

5638
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:47,920
between 20 and and the 10ens
 

5639
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:49,830
between 20 and and the 10ens
and if they remain stuck we can squeeze.

5640
02:30:49,830 --> 02:30:49,840
and if they remain stuck we can squeeze.
 

5641
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,750
and if they remain stuck we can squeeze.
If they if they become in the money then

5642
02:30:51,750 --> 02:30:51,760
If they if they become in the money then
 

5643
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:53,270
If they if they become in the money then
I think we get a bigger flush. So

5644
02:30:53,270 --> 02:30:53,280
I think we get a bigger flush. So
 

5645
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:55,670
I think we get a bigger flush. So
between 20s and tens basically between

going to be at 50s real

5660
02:31:22,870 --> 02:31:22,880

 

5661
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:24,309

We're going to go and test where he came

5662
02:31:24,309 --> 02:31:24,319
We're going to go and test where he came
 

5663
02:31:24,319 --> 02:31:26,870
We're going to go and test where he came
in. This is where he came in. Couple

5664
02:31:26,870 --> 02:31:26,880
in. This is where he came in. Couple
 

5665
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:29,030

more points down. Let's see if he gets

5666
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:29,040
more points down. Let's see if he gets
 

5667
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:30,870
more points down. Let's see if he gets
out and rebids or if he just adds some

5668
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:30,880
out and rebids or if he just adds some
 

5669
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:34,950
out and rebids or if he just adds some
size and tries to force

5670
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:34,960

 

5671
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:36,950

moment. They're rebidding it. Someone's

5672
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:36,960
moment. They're rebidding it. Someone's
 

5673
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:38,790
moment. They're rebidding it. Someone's
just come on the book at 25 again and

5674
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:38,800
just come on the book at 25 again and
 

5675
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:59,910
just come on the book at 25 again and
he's adding at 15s to absorb

5676
02:31:59,910 --> 02:31:59,920

 

5677
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:03,110

is now considered fair value on the day.

5678
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,120
is now considered fair value on the day.
 

5679
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:04,870
is now considered fair value on the day.
This is the level we've traded the most

5680
02:32:04,870 --> 02:32:04,880
This is the level we've traded the most
 

5681
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:06,550
This is the level we've traded the most
at all session. Now, that's how long

5682
02:32:06,550 --> 02:32:06,560
at all session. Now, that's how long
 

5683
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,469
at all session. Now, that's how long
we've been stuck here at this at this

5684
02:32:08,469 --> 02:32:08,479
we've been stuck here at this at this
 

5685
02:32:08,479 --> 02:32:11,270
we've been stuck here at this at this
level

5686
02:32:11,270 --> 02:32:11,280
level
 

5687
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:13,590
level
from 10:00 a.m. And again, now coming

5688
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:13,600
from 10:00 a.m. And again, now coming
 

5689
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:17,190
from 10:00 a.m. And again, now coming
into lunch, same level.

5690
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:17,200
into lunch, same level.
 

5691
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:19,110
into lunch, same level.
So, all that move and we're just going

5692
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:19,120
So, all that move and we're just going
 

5693
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:21,349
So, all that move and we're just going
to stop at the VWAP into lunch. Are we

5694
02:32:21,349 --> 02:32:21,359
to stop at the VWAP into lunch. Are we
 

5695
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:24,630
to stop at the VWAP into lunch. Are we
just a load of nonsense today basically?

5696
02:32:24,630 --> 02:32:24,640
just a load of nonsense today basically?
 

5697
02:32:24,640 --> 02:32:26,070
just a load of nonsense today basically?
So, we're just going to pause at the

5698
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:26,080
So, we're just going to pause at the
 

5699
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:42,150
So, we're just going to pause at the
same point.

5700
02:32:42,150 --> 02:32:42,160

 

5701
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:47,429

going to test him again.

5702
02:32:47,429 --> 02:32:47,439

 

5703
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:49,830

Still holding that 25. Remember 25 down

5704
02:32:49,830 --> 02:32:49,840
Still holding that 25. Remember 25 down
 

5705
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:52,469
Still holding that 25. Remember 25 down
to 15. We have a 300 lot seller who's

5706
02:32:52,469 --> 02:32:52,479
to 15. We have a 300 lot seller who's
 

5707
02:32:52,479 --> 02:32:55,030
to 15. We have a 300 lot seller who's
currently stuck there. We come under

5708
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:55,040
currently stuck there. We come under
 

5709
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,389
currently stuck there. We come under
that then we're going to see weakness.

5710
02:32:56,389 --> 02:32:56,399
that then we're going to see weakness.
 

5711
02:32:56,399 --> 02:32:59,110
that then we're going to see weakness.
At the moment he is still stuck. 25 to

5712
02:32:59,110 --> 02:32:59,120
At the moment he is still stuck. 25 to
 

5713
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:04,389
At the moment he is still stuck. 25 to
15. He remains stuck.

5714
02:33:04,389 --> 02:33:04,399

 

5715
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:06,070

If he gets stuck and we start breaking

5716
02:33:06,070 --> 02:33:06,080
If he gets stuck and we start breaking
 

5717
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:09,190
If he gets stuck and we start breaking
here, we will go 50s.

5718
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:09,200
here, we will go 50s.
 

5719
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:13,270
here, we will go 50s.
If he starts forcing the his uh stop out

5720
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:13,280
If he starts forcing the his uh stop out
 

5721
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:15,670
If he starts forcing the his uh stop out
at 35 and above, we'll probably go 50s

5722
02:33:15,670 --> 02:33:15,680
at 35 and above, we'll probably go 50s
 

5723
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:26,950
at 35 and above, we'll probably go 50s
real quick if he does.

5724
02:33:26,950 --> 02:33:26,960

 

5725
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:28,790

So, we stop, I'd imagine, is here. And

5726
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:28,800
So, we stop, I'd imagine, is here. And
 

5727
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:36,550
So, we stop, I'd imagine, is here. And
then we're going to go 50s.

5728
02:33:36,550 --> 02:33:36,560

 

5729
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:39,190

Look above there.

5730
02:33:39,190 --> 02:33:39,200
Look above there.
 

5731
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:40,870
Look above there.
They're trying to rebuild it again. Now

5732
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:40,880
They're trying to rebuild it again. Now
 

5733
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:42,950
They're trying to rebuild it again. Now
they want to get up to 50s as clear as

5734
02:33:42,950 --> 02:33:42,960
they want to get up to 50s as clear as
 

5735
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:45,429
they want to get up to 50s as clear as
day. ES is wants to get up to that New

5736
02:33:45,429 --> 02:33:45,439

5737
02:33:45,439 --> 02:33:47,349

5738
02:33:47,349 --> 02:33:47,359
York open. I cannot believe the strength
 

5739
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:51,349
York open. I cannot believe the strength
of ES. That's insane.

5740
02:33:51,349 --> 02:33:51,359

 

5741
02:33:51,359 --> 02:34:09,910

ES is basically like up here right now.

5742
02:34:09,910 --> 02:34:09,920

 

5743
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:14,950

Um, it's called City Cyd

5744
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:14,960

 

5745
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:17,190

Footprint.

5746
02:34:17,190 --> 02:34:17,200
Footprint.
 

5747
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:19,270
Footprint.
It's a third party app that you have to

5748
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:19,280
It's a third party app that you have to
 

5749
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:22,790
It's a third party app that you have to
pay for.

5750
02:34:22,790 --> 02:34:22,800

 

5751
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:23,990

So, they're trying to get up to these

5752
02:34:23,990 --> 02:34:24,000
So, they're trying to get up to these
 

5753
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,590
So, they're trying to get up to these
50s.

5754
02:34:25,590 --> 02:34:25,600
50s.
 

5755
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:27,830
50s.
Here they go for the push to 50s.

5756
02:34:27,830 --> 02:34:27,840
Here they go for the push to 50s.
 

5757
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:44,469
Here they go for the push to 50s.
Attempting to get to that 50s and VWAP.

5758
02:34:44,469 --> 02:34:44,479

 

5759
02:34:44,479 --> 02:34:46,469

Relentless bid on this. What happens

5760
02:34:46,469 --> 02:34:46,479
Relentless bid on this. What happens
 

5761
02:34:46,479 --> 02:34:56,309
Relentless bid on this. What happens
when they pull it? That's the question.

5762
02:34:56,309 --> 02:34:56,319

 

5763
02:34:56,319 --> 02:35:12,309

Still no backside. Still just grinding.

5764
02:35:12,309 --> 02:35:12,319

 

5765
02:35:12,319 --> 02:35:14,150

They're adding at 60s now. So they're

5766
02:35:14,150 --> 02:35:14,160
They're adding at 60s now. So they're
 

5767
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:15,830
They're adding at 60s now. So they're
adding higher now as well. They're

5768
02:35:15,830 --> 02:35:15,840
adding higher now as well. They're
 

5769
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:18,710
adding higher now as well. They're
trying to get filled even higher now.

5770
02:35:18,710 --> 02:35:18,720
trying to get filled even higher now.
 

5771
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:23,670
trying to get filled even higher now.
So 45, 47, 50, 52, 55, and 60 is where

5772
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:23,680
So 45, 47, 50, 52, 55, and 60 is where
 

5773
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:27,110
So 45, 47, 50, 52, 55, and 60 is where
they're adding.

5774
02:35:27,110 --> 02:35:27,120

 

5775
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:28,469

ES is going to go for that New York

5776
02:35:28,469 --> 02:35:28,479
ES is going to go for that New York
 

5777
02:35:28,479 --> 02:35:29,910
ES is going to go for that New York
open. I'm telling you, the strength in

5778
02:35:29,910 --> 02:35:29,920
open. I'm telling you, the strength in
 

5779
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:35,349
open. I'm telling you, the strength in
that thing.

5780
02:35:35,349 --> 02:35:35,359

 

5781
02:35:35,359 --> 02:35:36,870

So Tyson, I don't know if you've got any

5782
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:36,880
So Tyson, I don't know if you've got any
 

5783
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:38,790
So Tyson, I don't know if you've got any
left for your IB trade, but you might

5784
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:38,800
left for your IB trade, but you might
 

5785
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:40,790
left for your IB trade, but you might
get your 24-hour view up as your second

5786
02:35:40,790 --> 02:35:40,800
get your 24-hour view up as your second
 

5787
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:44,389
get your 24-hour view up as your second
tag.

5788
02:35:44,389 --> 02:35:44,399

 

5789
02:35:44,399 --> 02:36:19,349

Maybe.

5790
02:36:19,349 --> 02:36:19,359

 

5791
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:28,469

still absorbing.

5792
02:36:28,469 --> 02:36:28,479

 

5793
02:36:28,479 --> 02:36:30,150

Still the same target. They want to get

5794
02:36:30,150 --> 02:36:30,160
Still the same target. They want to get
 

5795
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:32,950
Still the same target. They want to get
to 50s. Just question if they if they

5796
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:32,960
to 50s. Just question if they if they
 

5797
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:35,910
to 50s. Just question if they if they
pull this bid. We've gone up non-stop

5798
02:36:35,910 --> 02:36:35,920
pull this bid. We've gone up non-stop
 

5799
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:38,389
pull this bid. We've gone up non-stop
grind. It can be like a nasty flush, but

5800
02:36:38,389 --> 02:36:38,399
grind. It can be like a nasty flush, but
 

5801
02:36:38,399 --> 02:36:40,469
grind. It can be like a nasty flush, but
I think 50s is definitely the target

5802
02:36:40,469 --> 02:36:40,479
I think 50s is definitely the target
 

5803
02:36:40,479 --> 02:36:43,110
I think 50s is definitely the target
here.

5804
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:43,120
here.
 

5805
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:56,710
here.
All the way to the other side of value.

5806
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:56,720

 

5807
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:58,469

Here it goes. There's 50s tagged and

5808
02:36:58,469 --> 02:36:58,479
Here it goes. There's 50s tagged and
 

5809
02:36:58,479 --> 02:37:01,190
Here it goes. There's 50s tagged and
VWOP tagged. And now you have to see, do

5810
02:37:01,190 --> 02:37:01,200
VWOP tagged. And now you have to see, do
 

5811
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:02,469
VWOP tagged. And now you have to see, do
they really want to run these stops at

5812
02:37:02,469 --> 02:37:02,479
they really want to run these stops at
 

5813
02:37:02,479 --> 02:37:04,469
they really want to run these stops at
65? But this is your target. So if you

5814
02:37:04,469 --> 02:37:04,479
65? But this is your target. So if you
 

5815
02:37:04,479 --> 02:37:06,550
65? But this is your target. So if you
were long from IB, that's your target.

5816
02:37:06,550 --> 02:37:06,560
were long from IB, that's your target.
 

5817
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:09,750
were long from IB, that's your target.

into value area high on the session. If

5828
02:37:26,389 --> 02:37:26,399
into value area high on the session. If
 

5829
02:37:26,399 --> 02:37:28,309
into value area high on the session. If
we find acceptance above value area high

5830
02:37:28,309 --> 02:37:28,319
we find acceptance above value area high
 

5831
02:37:28,319 --> 02:37:30,630
we find acceptance above value area high
on the session, we have some stops here

5832
02:37:30,630 --> 02:37:30,640
on the session, we have some stops here
 

5833
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:32,790
on the session, we have some stops here
to run. But

to run. But
 

5835
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:36,550
to run. But
um You cannot rule out this move. You

5836
02:37:36,550 --> 02:37:36,560
um You cannot rule out this move. You
 

5837
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:39,349
um You cannot rule out this move. You
just can't cuz we're so thin on where we

5838
02:37:39,349 --> 02:37:39,359
just can't cuz we're so thin on where we
 

5839
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:42,710
just can't cuz we're so thin on where we
lack structure, but you would imagine

5840
02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:42,720
lack structure, but you would imagine
 

5841
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:44,550
lack structure, but you would imagine
they'd want to send it down here at some

5842
02:37:44,550 --> 02:37:44,560
they'd want to send it down here at some
 

5843
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:46,150
they'd want to send it down here at some
point.

point.
 

5845
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:47,830

All right. So, buyers will want to
 

5945
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:35,349
All right. So, buyers will want to
absorb this kind of node here. The

5946
02:40:35,349 --> 02:40:35,359
absorb this kind of node here. The
 

5947
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:37,270
absorb this kind of node here. The
weakness will come. All right. Once we

5948
02:40:37,270 --> 02:40:37,280
weakness will come. All right. Once we
 

5949
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:39,590
weakness will come. All right. Once we
start losing this, I'm interested if we

5950
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:39,600
start losing this, I'm interested if we
 

5951
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:42,630
start losing this, I'm interested if we
start losing this for a rotation here

5952
02:40:42,630 --> 02:40:42,640
start losing this for a rotation here
 

5953
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:44,469
start losing this for a rotation here
and here and then run us back down to

5954
02:40:44,469 --> 02:40:44,479
and here and then run us back down to
 

5955
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:45,830
and here and then run us back down to
here. If we get lucky, if we keep

5956
02:40:45,830 --> 02:40:45,840
here. If we get lucky, if we keep
 

5957
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:47,110
here. If we get lucky, if we keep
holding bids, there's just really

5958
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:47,120
holding bids, there's just really
 

5959
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:48,550
holding bids, there's just really
nothing else to do with this. We can't

5960
02:40:48,550 --> 02:40:48,560
nothing else to do with this. We can't
 

5961
02:40:48,560 --> 02:40:50,389
nothing else to do with this. We can't
force our way into a market. I'm

5962
02:40:50,389 --> 02:40:50,399
force our way into a market. I'm
 

5963
02:40:50,399 --> 02:40:53,910
force our way into a market. I'm
certainly not going to bid up here.

5964
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:53,920
certainly not going to bid up here.
 

5965
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:57,110
certainly not going to bid up here.
Should I bid initial balance? Possibly.

5966
02:40:57,110 --> 02:40:57,120
Should I bid initial balance? Possibly.
 

5967
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:02,389
