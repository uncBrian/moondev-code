25
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,950
here. But first day that we should get

31
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,510
we get some moves. Um, as always, we're
going to start on the daily and work our

32
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
going to start on the daily and work our
 

33
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,350
going to start on the daily and work our
way down. All right, you can see very

34
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
way down. All right, you can see very
 

35
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,070
way down. All right, you can see very
clearly on our open today, we're trading

36
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
clearly on our open today, we're trading
 

37
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,309
clearly on our open today, we're trading
inside Friday's bar. If we think about

38
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
inside Friday's bar. If we think about
 

39
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,029
inside Friday's bar. If we think about
last week's uh levels, this was previous

40
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
last week's uh levels, this was previous
 

41
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,550
last week's uh levels, this was previous
week. So, we're trading right probably

42
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
week. So, we're trading right probably
 

43
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,230
week. So, we're trading right probably
in the midpoint of the previous week if

44
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
in the midpoint of the previous week if
 

45
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,230
in the midpoint of the previous week if
we measure that out from the high to the

46
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
we measure that out from the high to the
 

47
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,469
we measure that out from the high to the
low. Yeah, they go right into the 50% of

48
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
low. Yeah, they go right into the 50% of
 

49
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,309
low. Yeah, they go right into the 50% of
the previous week. All right. And we're

50
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
the previous week. All right. And we're
 

51
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,629
the previous week. All right. And we're
trading inside the previous day and

52
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
trading inside the previous day and
 

53
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,670
trading inside the previous day and
we're coming up to a low volume node on

54
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
we're coming up to a low volume node on
 

55
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,670
we're coming up to a low volume node on
the yearly profile. This dates back all

56
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
the yearly profile. This dates back all
 

57
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,189
the yearly profile. This dates back all
of 2025 and 2026. So, a little node here

58
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
of 2025 and 2026. So, a little node here
 

59
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,830
of 2025 and 2026. So, a little node here
as an underover. Now you will notice in

60
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
as an underover. Now you will notice in
 

61
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,990
as an underover. Now you will notice in
this node we have a cluster of of SMAS.

62
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
this node we have a cluster of of SMAS.
 

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,230
this node we have a cluster of of SMAS.
We talked about this in weekly in the uh

64
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
We talked about this in weekly in the uh
 

65
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,670
We talked about this in weekly in the uh
yeah weekly newsletter which you should

66
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
yeah weekly newsletter which you should
 

67
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,830
yeah weekly newsletter which you should
have got Saturday morning. Right? So in

68
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
have got Saturday morning. Right? So in
 

69
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,150
have got Saturday morning. Right? So in
here we have the 5day, we have the

70
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
here we have the 5day, we have the
 

71
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,950
here we have the 5day, we have the
20-day and we have the 50-day. All

72
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
20-day and we have the 50-day. All
 

73
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,270
20-day and we have the 50-day. All
right. And these are pivotal for

74
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
right. And these are pivotal for
 

75
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,029
right. And these are pivotal for
position traders. Right? This is how we

76
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
position traders. Right? This is how we
 

77
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,790
position traders. Right? This is how we
know sentiment where we are what we're

78
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
know sentiment where we are what we're
 

79
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,390
know sentiment where we are what we're
looking to do. And when they're tightly

80
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
looking to do. And when they're tightly
 

81
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,309
looking to do. And when they're tightly
coiled like this, well, we don't really

82
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
coiled like this, well, we don't really
 

83
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,550
coiled like this, well, we don't really
have a play. What we're looking at here

84
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
have a play. What we're looking at here
 

85
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,990
have a play. What we're looking at here
is probably coiling, coiling, coiling,

86
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
is probably coiling, coiling, coiling,
 

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,990
is probably coiling, coiling, coiling,
coiling, coiling, and then these

88
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
coiling, coiling, and then these
 

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,110
coiling, coiling, and then these
starting to contract and then we're

90
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
starting to contract and then we're
 

91
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,110
starting to contract and then we're
going to see expansion one way or the

92
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
going to see expansion one way or the
 

93
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,390
going to see expansion one way or the
other. All right, when we get tight

94
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
other. All right, when we get tight
 

95
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,749
other. All right, when we get tight
coils like this, right? Because when

96
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
coils like this, right? Because when
 

97
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,350
coils like this, right? Because when
we're in trending markets, we will hug

98
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
we're in trending markets, we will hug
 

99
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,510
we're in trending markets, we will hug
the five and we will break above or we

100
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
the five and we will break above or we
 

101
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,749
the five and we will break above or we
will hug the five and we'll break below.

102
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
will hug the five and we'll break below.
 

103
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,110
will hug the five and we'll break below.
All right, but right now everything's

104
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
All right, but right now everything's
 

105
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,589
All right, but right now everything's
coiled. And I have a feeling we might be

106
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
coiled. And I have a feeling we might be
 

107
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,749
coiled. And I have a feeling we might be
like this for a while this year. You

108
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
like this for a while this year. You
 

109
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,710
like this for a while this year. You
might see some volatility in these big

110
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
might see some volatility in these big
 

111
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,870
might see some volatility in these big
range rotations because if we are

112
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
range rotations because if we are
 

113
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,110
range rotations because if we are
actually going to put on a top, tops

114
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
actually going to put on a top, tops
 

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,710
actually going to put on a top, tops
take a decent amount of time to form.

116
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
take a decent amount of time to form.
 

117
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,710
take a decent amount of time to form.
They don't happen overnight. We might

118
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
They don't happen overnight. We might
 

119
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,309
They don't happen overnight. We might
still have some of this carry trade

120
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
still have some of this carry trade
 

121
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,909
still have some of this carry trade
unwind happen. Everyone's looking for it

122
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
unwind happen. Everyone's looking for it
 

123
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,670
unwind happen. Everyone's looking for it
in a day. It can take weeks or months to

124
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
in a day. It can take weeks or months to
 

125
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,589
in a day. It can take weeks or months to
happen. And we have obviously what's

126
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
happen. And we have obviously what's
 

127
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,550
happen. And we have obviously what's
going on in Venezuela on top of that.

128
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
going on in Venezuela on top of that.
 

129
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,110
going on in Venezuela on top of that.
So, lots of volatility. Uh tech is

130
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
So, lots of volatility. Uh tech is
 

131
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,790
So, lots of volatility. Uh tech is
gapping up this morning. You will notice

132
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
gapping up this morning. You will notice
 

133
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,390
gapping up this morning. You will notice
most the chip names are gapping up. They

134
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
most the chip names are gapping up. They
 

135
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,950
most the chip names are gapping up. They
have conferences after the close today.

136
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
have conferences after the close today.
 

137
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,550
have conferences after the close today.
All right. So, possibly some front

138
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
All right. So, possibly some front
 

139
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,710
All right. So, possibly some front
running, some positioning from the funds

140
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
running, some positioning from the funds
 

141
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,309
running, some positioning from the funds
into that. Maybe we get a sell the news

142
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
into that. Maybe we get a sell the news
 

143
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,749
into that. Maybe we get a sell the news
tomorrow depending what the conferences

144
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
tomorrow depending what the conferences
 

145
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,830
tomorrow depending what the conferences
are. All right. So, let's just move down

146
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
are. All right. So, let's just move down
 

147
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,790
are. All right. So, let's just move down
out of the daily look at the hourlys now

148
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
out of the daily look at the hourlys now
 

149
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,550
out of the daily look at the hourlys now
and go from there. We can look at the

150
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
and go from there. We can look at the
 

151
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,550
and go from there. We can look at the
value areas. All right. So, here we go.

152
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
value areas. All right. So, here we go.
 

153
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,430
value areas. All right. So, here we go.
This is what's going to become

154
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
This is what's going to become
 

155
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,029
This is what's going to become
important.

156
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
important.
 

157
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,350
important.
Last week's value is right here and we

158
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
Last week's value is right here and we
 

159
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,230
Last week's value is right here and we
have a shelf here and then a big shelf

160
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
have a shelf here and then a big shelf
 

161
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,630
have a shelf here and then a big shelf
here. All right, that's previous week's

162
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
here. All right, that's previous week's
 

163
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,430
here. All right, that's previous week's
value. previous day's value is down

164
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
value. previous day's value is down
 

165
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,509
value. previous day's value is down
here. All right. So, you'll notice at

166
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
here. All right. So, you'll notice at
 

167
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,589
here. All right. So, you'll notice at
the moment we are gapping up because we

168
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
the moment we are gapping up because we
 

169
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,230
the moment we are gapping up because we
closed down here somewhere. Yeah, down

170
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
closed down here somewhere. Yeah, down
 

171
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,910
closed down here somewhere. Yeah, down
here. That was the close and we're

172
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
here. That was the close and we're
 

173
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,990
here. That was the close and we're
gapping up and we're back inside of

174
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
gapping up and we're back inside of
 

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,470
gapping up and we're back inside of
previous day and previous week. So, what

176
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
previous day and previous week. So, what
 

177
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,389
previous day and previous week. So, what
we're looking at this morning is are we

178
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
we're looking at this morning is are we
 

179
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,110
we're looking at this morning is are we
going to hold above Friday's value? All

180
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
going to hold above Friday's value? All
 

181
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,630
going to hold above Friday's value? All
right. Are we going to hold above

182
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
right. Are we going to hold above
 

183
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,030
right. Are we going to hold above
Friday's value? If we are right, ideally

184
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
Friday's value? If we are right, ideally
 

185
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,030
Friday's value? If we are right, ideally
we want a pull back in to hold previous

186
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
we want a pull back in to hold previous
 

187
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,870
we want a pull back in to hold previous
day value area high, previous week value

188
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
day value area high, previous week value
 

189
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,710
day value area high, previous week value
area low, and we're going to look for a

190
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
area low, and we're going to look for a
 

191
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,190
area low, and we're going to look for a
blastoff from there. What we have to be

192
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
blastoff from there. What we have to be
 

193
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,790
blastoff from there. What we have to be
cautious of is these levels which we've

194
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
cautious of is these levels which we've
 

195
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,990
cautious of is these levels which we've
got marked out. I'm going to remove some

196
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
got marked out. I'm going to remove some
 

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,350
got marked out. I'm going to remove some
of these drawings. All right, you can

198
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
of these drawings. All right, you can
 

199
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,949
of these drawings. All right, you can
see this node here. We're starting to

200
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
see this node here. We're starting to
 

201
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,550
see this node here. We're starting to
get over it. All right, if we hold this

202
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
get over it. All right, if we hold this
 

203
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,150
get over it. All right, if we hold this
node, there's one place we're going to

204
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
node, there's one place we're going to
 

205
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,630
node, there's one place we're going to
go. It is all the way back into PC. All

206
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
go. It is all the way back into PC. All
 

207
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,710
go. It is all the way back into PC. All
right, so really from sort of 680 to

208
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
right, so really from sort of 680 to
 

209
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,269
right, so really from sort of 680 to
let's call it 740. to about 60 points

210
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
let's call it 740. to about 60 points
 

211
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,750
let's call it 740. to about 60 points
here is probably where the market wants

212
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
here is probably where the market wants
 

213
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,829
here is probably where the market wants
to go and test. Right? And the question

214
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
to go and test. Right? And the question
 

215
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,150
to go and test. Right? And the question
is if we get up there, is that an area

216
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
is if we get up there, is that an area
 

217
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,389
is if we get up there, is that an area
that we're going to fade or are we going

218
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
that we're going to fade or are we going
 

219
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,630
that we're going to fade or are we going
to find acceptance? So the early plays

220
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
to find acceptance? So the early plays
 

221
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,670
to find acceptance? So the early plays
are do dips hold into previous day value

222
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
are do dips hold into previous day value
 

223
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,070
are do dips hold into previous day value
area high previous week? Do 600s hold

224
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
area high previous week? Do 600s hold
 

225
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,150
area high previous week? Do 600s hold
instead if it's a very shallow dip and

226
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
instead if it's a very shallow dip and
 

227
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,550
instead if it's a very shallow dip and
are we then driving up into this area

228
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
are we then driving up into this area
 

229
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,150
are we then driving up into this area
here? But once we get there, do shorts

230
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
here? But once we get there, do shorts
 

231
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,230
here? But once we get there, do shorts
come back in and take control and rotate

232
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
come back in and take control and rotate
 

233
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,630
come back in and take control and rotate
us back down for a retest or maybe even

234
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
us back down for a retest or maybe even
 

235
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,430
us back down for a retest or maybe even
lower or are we going to go sideways?

236
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
lower or are we going to go sideways?
 

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,310
lower or are we going to go sideways?
All right, an area of value, right,

238
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
All right, an area of value, right,
 

239
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,710
All right, an area of value, right,
which we've done before. And if we do go

240
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
which we've done before. And if we do go
 

241
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,949
which we've done before. And if we do go
sideways, are we then eventually going

242
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
sideways, are we then eventually going
 

243
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,269
sideways, are we then eventually going
to look for acceptance back up here to

244
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
to look for acceptance back up here to
 

245
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,829
to look for acceptance back up here to
retest previous week? So everything is

246
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
retest previous week? So everything is
 

247
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,710
retest previous week? So everything is
possible right now because we're trading

248
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
possible right now because we're trading
 

249
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,470
possible right now because we're trading
back inside previous week, back inside

250
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
back inside previous week, back inside
 

251
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,069
back inside previous week, back inside
previous day. All right, we're trading

252
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
previous day. All right, we're trading
 

253
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,990
previous day. All right, we're trading
back inside these two profiles. So,

254
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
back inside these two profiles. So,
 

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,069
back inside these two profiles. So,
we must be careful of rotation. But so

256
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
we must be careful of rotation. But so
 

257
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,910
we must be careful of rotation. But so
far, I would say this down here looks

258
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
far, I would say this down here looks
 

259
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,750
far, I would say this down here looks
like potential excess. Uh those who

260
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
like potential excess. Uh those who
 

261
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,190
like potential excess. Uh those who
traded with me in Discord on Friday

262
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
traded with me in Discord on Friday
 

263
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,590
traded with me in Discord on Friday
would know we got long down here off

264
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
would know we got long down here off
 

265
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,030
would know we got long down here off
this. I think it was the naked point of

266
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
this. I think it was the naked point of
 

267
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,630
this. I think it was the naked point of
control. We took this long while it was

268
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
control. We took this long while it was
 

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,630
control. We took this long while it was
here, wasn't it? For about 100 points

270
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
here, wasn't it? For about 100 points
 

271
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,310
here, wasn't it? For about 100 points
together on Discord on Friday, which is

272
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
together on Discord on Friday, which is
 

273
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,470
together on Discord on Friday, which is
a nice trade. All right, moving into the

274
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
a nice trade. All right, moving into the
 

275
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,590
a nice trade. All right, moving into the
five minutes. You can see what's

276
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
five minutes. You can see what's
 

277
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,670

Asia sideways, London expansion. We're
 

291
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,430
Asia sideways, London expansion. We're
still driving higher at the moment. Lots

still driving higher at the moment. Lots
 

293
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,269
still driving higher at the moment. Lots
of stops here. If we do get stuck,

294
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
of stops here. If we do get stuck,

stops here to come and pop. Can't rule
that move out either. So, knowing those

302
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
that move out either. So, knowing those
 

303
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,790
that move out either. So, knowing those
edges is going to be key today. Are we

304
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
edges is going to be key today. Are we
 

305
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,230
edges is going to be key today. Are we
going to hold these dips? Are we going

306
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
going to hold these dips? Are we going
 

307
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,630
going to hold these dips? Are we going
to get stuck and rotate? Are we going to

308
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
to get stuck and rotate? Are we going to
 

309
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,550
to get stuck and rotate? Are we going to
drive up to here and five acceptance? or

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
drive up to here and five acceptance? or
 

311
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,670
drive up to here and five acceptance? or
we going to come up here and there's an

312
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
we going to come up here and there's an
 

313
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,190
we going to come up here and there's an
instant short back down. If we find

314
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
instant short back down. If we find
 

315
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,550
instant short back down. If we find
acceptance, are we going to go back to

316
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
acceptance, are we going to go back to
 

317
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,150
acceptance, are we going to go back to
the other side? Is there a short back

318
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
the other side? Is there a short back
 

319
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,750
the other side? Is there a short back
there? Is there a look above and fail?

320
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
there? Is there a look above and fail?
 

321
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,750
there? Is there a look above and fail?
Or is there acceptance for a new price

322
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
Or is there acceptance for a new price
 

323
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,509
Or is there acceptance for a new price
higher? All right, we have to be careful

324
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
higher? All right, we have to be careful
 

325
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,910
higher? All right, we have to be careful
today. Monday morning, first major like

326
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
today. Monday morning, first major like
 

327
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,310
today. Monday morning, first major like
trading day of the year really. So, head

328
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
trading day of the year really. So, head
 

329
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,910
trading day of the year really. So, head
on swivel is what I would say. Head on

330
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
on swivel is what I would say. Head on
 

331
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,110
on swivel is what I would say. Head on
swivel. All right, let's have a look at

332
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
swivel. All right, let's have a look at
 

333
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,509
swivel. All right, let's have a look at
some of uh the broader markets and

334
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
some of uh the broader markets and
 

335
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,790
some of uh the broader markets and
what's going on. I'm going to make this

336
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
what's going on. I'm going to make this
 

337
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,389
what's going on. I'm going to make this
gray now because this was that little

338
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
gray now because this was that little
 

339
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,470
gray now because this was that little
edge and we're now over it. I did

340
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
edge and we're now over it. I did
 

341
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,990
edge and we're now over it. I did
actually play a little short here, but

342
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
actually play a little short here, but
 

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,269
actually play a little short here, but
uh stopped out uh in profit, but I was

344
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
uh stopped out uh in profit, but I was
 

345
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,870
uh stopped out uh in profit, but I was
looking for that rotation back down.

346
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
looking for that rotation back down.
 

347
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,363
looking for that rotation back down.
Right, let's get into it. ES

348
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:49,373
Right, let's get into it. ES
 

349
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:50,630
Right, let's get into it. ES
[clears throat]

350
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,640
[clears throat]
 

351
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,750
[clears throat]
exactly the same kind of thing.

352
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
exactly the same kind of thing.
 

353
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,190
exactly the same kind of thing.
Remember, we've had relative strength on

354
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
Remember, we've had relative strength on
 

355
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,870
Remember, we've had relative strength on
the ES,

356
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
the ES,
 

357
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,230
the ES,
right? So, if we're going to start

358
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
right? So, if we're going to start
 

359
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,910
right? So, if we're going to start
finding acceptance, I'd say this pivot

360
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
finding acceptance, I'd say this pivot
 

361
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,550
finding acceptance, I'd say this pivot
up here is very, very key. All right, n

362
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
up here is very, very key. All right, n
 

363
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,710
up here is very, very key. All right, n
let's just call it 940s, right?

364
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
let's just call it 940s, right?
 

365
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,949
let's just call it 940s, right?
Acceptance above 940s might allow that

366
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
Acceptance above 940s might allow that
 

367
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,949
Acceptance above 940s might allow that
drive up. We can think about this as a

368
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
drive up. We can think about this as a
 

369
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,949
drive up. We can think about this as a
swing point.

370
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
swing point.
 

371
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,910
swing point.
Yeah, it's also the 61 into 46. So,

372
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
Yeah, it's also the 61 into 46. So,
 

373
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,949
Yeah, it's also the 61 into 46. So,
we're going to have to be careful with

374
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
we're going to have to be careful with
 

375
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,790
we're going to have to be careful with
that on the ES, right? Do we find

376
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
that on the ES, right? Do we find
 

377
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,470
that on the ES, right? Do we find
acceptance for the drive or is it just a

378
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
acceptance for the drive or is it just a
 

379
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,069
acceptance for the drive or is it just a
push which gets sold into? Remember the

380
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
push which gets sold into? Remember the
 

381
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,069
push which gets sold into? Remember the
last couple of weeks, released last

382
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
last couple of weeks, released last
 

383
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,470
last couple of weeks, released last
week, every single push was sold into.

384
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
week, every single push was sold into.
 

385
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,310
week, every single push was sold into.
They were dumping inventory. Is that

386
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
They were dumping inventory. Is that
 

387
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,069
They were dumping inventory. Is that
still going to be the case is the

388
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
still going to be the case is the
 

389
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,790
still going to be the case is the
question. We look at the spy,

390
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
question. We look at the spy,
 

391
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,110
question. We look at the spy,
we can think about the gamma levels, all

392
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
we can think about the gamma levels, all
 

393
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,790
we can think about the gamma levels, all
right, it was quite clear. We talked

394
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
right, it was quite clear. We talked
 

395
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,790
right, it was quite clear. We talked
about it in Discord last week, right?

396
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
about it in Discord last week, right?
 

397
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,910
about it in Discord last week, right?
680, right? 680 held. It was a pivot. It

398
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
680, right? 680 held. It was a pivot. It
 

399
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,829
680, right? 680 held. It was a pivot. It
was a gamma level right here. All right,

400
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
was a gamma level right here. All right,
 

401
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,110
was a gamma level right here. All right,
little flutter under and we're back

402
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
little flutter under and we're back
 

403
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,509
little flutter under and we're back
above. Right, so I'd be watching the 85s

404
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
above. Right, so I'd be watching the 85s
 

405
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,430
above. Right, so I'd be watching the 85s
now. Do they find acceptance over 85s

406
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
now. Do they find acceptance over 85s
 

407
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,269
now. Do they find acceptance over 85s
and then it'll be the same levels 88,

408
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
and then it'll be the same levels 88,
 

409
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,509
and then it'll be the same levels 88,
90, and then 700s. All right, so if

410
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
90, and then 700s. All right, so if
 

411
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,350
90, and then 700s. All right, so if
they're going to go upside, that's what

412
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
they're going to go upside, that's what
 

413
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,710
they're going to go upside, that's what
they're looking for. If they have failed

414
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
they're looking for. If they have failed
 

415
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,310
they're looking for. If they have failed
follow through versus this, you'll be

416
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
follow through versus this, you'll be
 

417
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,990
follow through versus this, you'll be
looking for them to break that and come

418
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
looking for them to break that and come
 

419
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,710
looking for them to break that and come
all the way back down.

420
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
all the way back down.
 

421
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,350
all the way back down.
Let's have a look at the VIX, which is

422
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
Let's have a look at the VIX, which is
 

423
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,110
Let's have a look at the VIX, which is
starting to grind higher. So if we just

424
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
starting to grind higher. So if we just
 

425
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,790
starting to grind higher. So if we just
have a look at the daily here, right,

426
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
have a look at the daily here, right,
 

427
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,590
have a look at the daily here, right,
we're coming into a pivot where we can

428
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
we're coming into a pivot where we can
 

429
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,150
we're coming into a pivot where we can
see like we've been creating this sort

430
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
see like we've been creating this sort
 

431
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,150
see like we've been creating this sort
of flag higher. This area here is going

432
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
of flag higher. This area here is going
 

433
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,389
of flag higher. This area here is going
to be key. Do we find acceptance in here

434
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
to be key. Do we find acceptance in here
 

435
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,470
to be key. Do we find acceptance in here
for a drive to 16? Are we going to do

436
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
for a drive to 16? Are we going to do
 

437
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,629
for a drive to 16? Are we going to do
one of these in here for a while? Or is

438
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
one of these in here for a while? Or is
 

439
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,389
one of these in here for a while? Or is
this like a push and a fail and we come

440
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
this like a push and a fail and we come
 

441
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,389
this like a push and a fail and we come
right back down or are we going to

442
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
right back down or are we going to
 

443
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,389
right back down or are we going to
reclaim 16 and come back up to the top

444
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
reclaim 16 and come back up to the top
 

445
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,310
reclaim 16 and come back up to the top
side and run all these out? Right?

446
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
side and run all these out? Right?
 

447
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,230
side and run all these out? Right?
You're going to see lots of if buts and

448
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
You're going to see lots of if buts and
 

449
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,310
You're going to see lots of if buts and
may. That's what we're looking at today.

450
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
may. That's what we're looking at today.
 

451
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,350
may. That's what we're looking at today.
if buts and may while we set the

452
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
if buts and may while we set the
 

453
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,430
if buts and may while we set the
temperature and the tone for this week

454
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
temperature and the tone for this week
 

455
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,230
temperature and the tone for this week
and this year. All right, let's have a

456
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
and this year. All right, let's have a
 

457
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,350
and this year. All right, let's have a
look at tech because tech's moving.

458
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
look at tech because tech's moving.
 

459
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,590
look at tech because tech's moving.
All right, uh

460
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
All right, uh
 

461
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,110
All right, uh
Apple.

462
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
Apple.
 

463
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,269
Apple.
All right, actually flat here. So,

464
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
All right, actually flat here. So,
 

465
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,509
All right, actually flat here. So,
inside Friday's range, uh you'll be

466
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
inside Friday's range, uh you'll be
 

467
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,350
inside Friday's range, uh you'll be
looking for a pivot break over 71 here.

468
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
looking for a pivot break over 71 here.
 

469
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,670
looking for a pivot break over 71 here.
If they get over 71, I'd be watching for

470
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
If they get over 71, I'd be watching for
 

471
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,189
If they get over 71, I'd be watching for
a move into 72 and 7250s and 260s.

472
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
a move into 72 and 7250s and 260s.
 

473
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,790
a move into 72 and 7250s and 260s.
Amazon,

474
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
Amazon,
 

475
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,310
Amazon,
there's a nice gap up. All right,

476
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
there's a nice gap up. All right,
 

477
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,870
there's a nice gap up. All right,
leaving Friday's

478
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:02,880
leaving Friday's
 

479
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,790
leaving Friday's
volume. All right, so if they hold dips,

480
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
volume. All right, so if they hold dips,
 

481
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,389
volume. All right, so if they hold dips,
which they have been this morning,

482
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
which they have been this morning,
 

483
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,509
which they have been this morning,
they'll be looking to take out this

484
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
they'll be looking to take out this
 

485
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,670
they'll be looking to take out this
pivot here into 28 and try and get back

486
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
pivot here into 28 and try and get back
 

487
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,470
pivot here into 28 and try and get back
up here into 30 on Amazon. So decent gap

488
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
up here into 30 on Amazon. So decent gap
 

489
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,310
up here into 30 on Amazon. So decent gap
up on Amazon, leaving Friday trapped.

490
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
up on Amazon, leaving Friday trapped.
 

491
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,310
up on Amazon, leaving Friday trapped.
You want to be careful if they get back

492
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
You want to be careful if they get back
 

493
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,230
You want to be careful if they get back
under here, right? And if you're trading

494
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
under here, right? And if you're trading
 

495
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,189
under here, right? And if you're trading
Amazon, Google, same kind of thing. All

496
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
Amazon, Google, same kind of thing. All
 

497
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,629
Amazon, Google, same kind of thing. All
right. Yeah, Google was actually pretty

498
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
right. Yeah, Google was actually pretty
 

499
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,790
right. Yeah, Google was actually pretty
decent last week on Friday. That was a

500
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
decent last week on Friday. That was a
 

501
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,269
decent last week on Friday. That was a
decent close right into VWAP. question

502
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
decent close right into VWAP. question
 

503
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,829
decent close right into VWAP. question
is, can it hold any dip into sort of 15

504
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
is, can it hold any dip into sort of 15
 

505
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,470
is, can it hold any dip into sort of 15
and 14?

506
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
and 14?
 

507
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,710
and 14?
Meta

508
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
Meta
 

509
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,189
Meta
not as good. All right, opening pretty

510
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
not as good. All right, opening pretty
 

511
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,670
not as good. All right, opening pretty
much flat. There's your peak. All right,

512
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
much flat. There's your peak. All right,
 

513
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,590
much flat. There's your peak. All right,
so there's the two drive. We're back

514
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
so there's the two drive. We're back
 

515
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,189
so there's the two drive. We're back
inside that on Meta. So just building

516
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
inside that on Meta. So just building
 

517
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,350
inside that on Meta. So just building
out volume there on Meta. You'll see

518
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
out volume there on Meta. You'll see
 

519
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,509
out volume there on Meta. You'll see
it's the chips that are the ones going

520
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
it's the chips that are the ones going
 

521
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,030
it's the chips that are the ones going
Microsoft. All right, that's a little

522
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
Microsoft. All right, that's a little
 

523
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,269
Microsoft. All right, that's a little
bit better. Okay, so next pivot up here

524
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
bit better. Okay, so next pivot up here
 

525
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,189
bit better. Okay, so next pivot up here
on Microsoft. So if Softy can hold any

526
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
on Microsoft. So if Softy can hold any
 

527
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,269
on Microsoft. So if Softy can hold any
of these dips, right, can it get back

528
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
of these dips, right, can it get back
 

529
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,670
of these dips, right, can it get back
into 47s? But a bit of a gap up there on

530
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
into 47s? But a bit of a gap up there on
 

531
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,829
into 47s? But a bit of a gap up there on
softy. Uh yeah, about a dollar and a

532
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
softy. Uh yeah, about a dollar and a
 

533
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,910
softy. Uh yeah, about a dollar and a
half. This is where we get going. All

534
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
half. This is where we get going. All
 

535
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,590
half. This is where we get going. All
right, here's where we get going.

536
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
right, here's where we get going.
 

537
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,949
right, here's where we get going.
Remember these have catalysts coming

538
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
Remember these have catalysts coming
 

539
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,550
Remember these have catalysts coming
tonight. So some front running into

540
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
tonight. So some front running into
 

541
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,949
tonight. So some front running into
here. Decent gap up. All right, decent

542
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
here. Decent gap up. All right, decent
 

543
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,310
here. Decent gap up. All right, decent
gap up here. $4 gap up. Question is, can

544
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
gap up here. $4 gap up. Question is, can
 

545
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,550
gap up here. $4 gap up. Question is, can
it get back above 92s? If we zoom out on

546
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
it get back above 92s? If we zoom out on
 

547
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,030
it get back above 92s? If we zoom out on
this, we can see the importance of some

548
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
this, we can see the importance of some
 

549
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,470
this, we can see the importance of some
of these levels. All right, if we start

550
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
of these levels. All right, if we start
 

551
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,629
of these levels. All right, if we start
breaking out from here, can we get back

552
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
breaking out from here, can we get back
 

553
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,030
breaking out from here, can we get back
up to 98 and 200s is the question. All

554
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
up to 98 and 200s is the question. All
 

555
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,389
up to 98 and 200s is the question. All
right. Is this now

556
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
right. Is this now
 

557
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,550
right. Is this now
this play here? All right. Are they able

558
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
this play here? All right. Are they able
 

559
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,710
this play here? All right. Are they able
to do it into this catalyst tonight? I

560
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
to do it into this catalyst tonight? I
 

561
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,710
to do it into this catalyst tonight? I
don't know. But uh that's what it's

562
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
don't know. But uh that's what it's
 

563
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,110
don't know. But uh that's what it's
looking like it's trying to do. Tesla,

564
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
looking like it's trying to do. Tesla,
 

565
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,470
looking like it's trying to do. Tesla,
same thing. Gapping up.

566
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
same thing. Gapping up.
 

567
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,150
same thing. Gapping up.
There's Friday's volume. All right. Can

568
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
There's Friday's volume. All right. Can
 

569
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,829
There's Friday's volume. All right. Can
it hold above? Can it find acceptance?

570
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
it hold above? Can it find acceptance?
 

571
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,430
it hold above? Can it find acceptance?
If it doesn't, we come back down. Same

572
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
If it doesn't, we come back down. Same
 

573
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,670
If it doesn't, we come back down. Same
story as all of them. Uh as a equally

574
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
story as all of them. Uh as a equally
 

575
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,910
story as all of them. Uh as a equally
weighted mag [sighs]

576
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
weighted mag [sighs]
 

577
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,150
weighted mag [sighs]
gap up. All right. because the chips are

578
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
gap up. All right. because the chips are
 

579
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,310
gap up. All right. because the chips are
moving as an equally equally weighted

580
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
moving as an equally equally weighted
 

581
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,470
moving as an equally equally weighted
mag. But into that VWAP, um we can look

582
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
mag. But into that VWAP, um we can look
 

583
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,790
mag. But into that VWAP, um we can look
at a couple other names, broader sectors

584
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
at a couple other names, broader sectors
 

585
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,310
at a couple other names, broader sectors
like Oracle. All these chip names are

586
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
like Oracle. All these chip names are
 

587
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,269
like Oracle. All these chip names are
going to get going. There you go.

588
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
going to get going. There you go.
 

589
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,790
going to get going. There you go.
Oracle's going, AMD is going. Um I'm

590
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
Oracle's going, AMD is going. Um I'm
 

591
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,670
Oracle's going, AMD is going. Um I'm
sure INTC is going,

592
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
sure INTC is going,
 

593
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,509
sure INTC is going,
ITC is going. So you can see the chip

594
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
ITC is going. So you can see the chip
 

595
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,590
ITC is going. So you can see the chip
names finding bids here this morning. If

596
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
names finding bids here this morning. If
 

597
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,590
names finding bids here this morning. If
we look at some of sort of the more beta

598
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
we look at some of sort of the more beta
 

599
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,430
we look at some of sort of the more beta
names, what are they doing? Big gap up

600
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
names, what are they doing? Big gap up
 

601
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,310
names, what are they doing? Big gap up
there on

602
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
there on
 

603
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,430
there on
decent gap up there on Q. Decent gap up

604
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
decent gap up there on Q. Decent gap up
 

605
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,189
decent gap up there on Q. Decent gap up
there on MBTS. These are all the AI

606
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
there on MBTS. These are all the AI
 

607
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,069
there on MBTS. These are all the AI
related names. AGTI

608
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
related names. AGTI
 

609
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,150
related names. AGTI
might have some room to go before it

610
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
might have some room to go before it
 

611
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,629
might have some room to go before it
gets resold into maybe a little pivot up

612
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
gets resold into maybe a little pivot up
 

613
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,350
gets resold into maybe a little pivot up
here. So, yeah, some uh some strength

614
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
here. So, yeah, some uh some strength
 

615
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,949
here. So, yeah, some uh some strength
coming in tech there this morning, which

it's worth being aware of the tech we're

620
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
it's worth being aware of the tech we're
 

621
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,670
it's worth being aware of the tech we're

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
seeing in the strength we're seeing in
 

623
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,749
seeing in the strength we're seeing in
tech this morning. Can they sustain the

624
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
tech this morning. Can they sustain the
 

625
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,350
tech this morning. Can they sustain the
bid? All right, that's the bigger

626
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
bid? All right, that's the bigger
 

627
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,350

631
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,990

633
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,470

trying to get up to this previous week

634
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
trying to get up to this previous week
 

635
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,389

want to control. What I will do is mark

636
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399

637
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,350

638
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
out this whole area just so it's a
 

639
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,870
out this whole area just so it's a
little bit easier. Let's make sure this

640
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
little bit easier. Let's make sure this
 

641
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,670

That's the area where they're trying to
drive into.

648
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
drive into.
 

649
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,150

oil or oil related names. Uh that is all
 

655
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,510
oil or oil related names. Uh that is all
moving obviously. So if you're looking

656
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
moving obviously. So if you're looking
 

657
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,789
moving obviously. So if you're looking
at I don't know OXL and all those big

658
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
at I don't know OXL and all those big
 

659
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,390
at I don't know OXL and all those big
big oil company names, they are all

660
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
big oil company names, they are all
 

661
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,309
big oil company names, they are all
moving this morning. They're all up five

662
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
moving this morning. They're all up five
 

663
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,150
moving this morning. They're all up five
plus percent. All right. So there's

664
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
plus percent. All right. So there's
 

665
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,669
plus percent. All right. So there's
probably a decent trade in there for the

666
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
probably a decent trade in there for the
 

667
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,789
probably a decent trade in there for the

770
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
need to use code flow zone there. And
 

771
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,310
need to use code flow zone there. And
uh, how long we got left here? Not very

772
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
uh, how long we got left here? Not very
 

773
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,150
uh, how long we got left here? Not very
long. 50 seconds, folks. So, nice and

774
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
long. 50 seconds, folks. So, nice and
 

775
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,669
long. 50 seconds, folks. So, nice and
calm this morning. Let's see if they

776
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
calm this morning. Let's see if they
 

777
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,230
calm this morning. Let's see if they
drive up into this sort of previous week

778
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
drive up into this sort of previous week
 

779
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,870
drive up into this sort of previous week
point of control area. See if there's a

780
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
point of control area. See if there's a
 

781
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,950
point of control area. See if there's a
short position here that we have up into

782
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
short position here that we have up into
 

783
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:07,270
short position here that we have up into
that or if they find acceptance.

784
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280

 

785
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,870

Oh, did you Chris? Did you get a better

awful headache.
So, the uh lights from the um

800
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
So, the uh lights from the um
 

801
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,870
So, the uh lights from the um
I don't know what you call them, 4K

802
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
I don't know what you call them, 4K
 

803
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,710
I don't know what you call them, 4K
lights, whatever on my face so that you

804
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
lights, whatever on my face so that you
 

805
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,110
lights, whatever on my face so that you
can see on stream are rather bright.

806
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
can see on stream are rather bright.
 

807
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,350
can see on stream are rather bright.
Okay, here we go. Here's the open. Just

808
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
Okay, here we go. Here's the open. Just
 

809
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,710
Okay, here we go. Here's the open. Just
let this settle down for a minute. So,

810
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
let this settle down for a minute. So,
 

811
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,710
let this settle down for a minute. So,
all of the mag gapping up here. Biggest

812
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
all of the mag gapping up here. Biggest
 

813
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,390
all of the mag gapping up here. Biggest
uh gap up in Tesla there this morning

814
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
uh gap up in Tesla there this morning
 

815
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,230
uh gap up in Tesla there this morning
and probably going to drive out into

816
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
and probably going to drive out into
 

817
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,909
and probably going to drive out into
that previous week point control like we

818
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
that previous week point control like we
 

819
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,110
that previous week point control like we
talked about. That's the first target

820
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
talked about. That's the first target
 

821
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,029
talked about. That's the first target
and if they get back up there previous

822
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
and if they get back up there previous
 

823
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,789
and if they get back up there previous
week value area high. So this is the

824
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
week value area high. So this is the
 

825
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,070
week value area high. So this is the
drive into towards those 700s. See if

826
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
drive into towards those 700s. See if
 

827
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,390
drive into towards those 700s. See if
they can keep going here.

828
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
they can keep going here.
 

829
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,909
they can keep going here.
There is some liquidity resting up

830
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
There is some liquidity resting up
 

831
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,750
There is some liquidity resting up
there. Is there anything above yet? Not

832
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
there. Is there anything above yet? Not
 

833
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,630
there. Is there anything above yet? Not
yet. Not yet. So an old imbalance up

834
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
yet. Not yet. So an old imbalance up
 

835
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,029
yet. Not yet. So an old imbalance up
there.

836
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039

 

837
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,630

Let's see if they get up there and if

838
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
Let's see if they get up there and if
 

839
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,990
Let's see if they get up there and if
they find acceptance and then we can

840
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
they find acceptance and then we can
 

841
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,470
they find acceptance and then we can
think about what next. The other trade

842
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
think about what next. The other trade
 

843
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,950
think about what next. The other trade
will be back under 600. All right. If

844
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
will be back under 600. All right. If
 

845
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,110
will be back under 600. All right. If
they fail 600, there'll be a rotation

846
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
they fail 600, there'll be a rotation
 

847
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,230
they fail 600, there'll be a rotation
from 600 to sort of 550s.

848
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
from 600 to sort of 550s.
 

849
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,630
from 600 to sort of 550s.
550s to 530s. So, if we can drive up

850
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
550s to 530s. So, if we can drive up
 

851
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,549
550s to 530s. So, if we can drive up
here and get stuffed, I'll join in for

852
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
here and get stuffed, I'll join in for
 

853
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,070
here and get stuffed, I'll join in for
the short, the rotation back down to

854
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
the short, the rotation back down to
 

855
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,909
the short, the rotation back down to
sixes.

856
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
sixes.
 

857
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,070
sixes.
If we drive up here and find acceptance,

858
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
If we drive up here and find acceptance,
 

859
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,590
If we drive up here and find acceptance,
well, I think about the move up into

860
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
well, I think about the move up into
 

861
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,510
well, I think about the move up into
previous week area high. I guess it's

862
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
previous week area high. I guess it's
 

863
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,070
previous week area high. I guess it's
not ideal, but I'd consider it much

864
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
not ideal, but I'd consider it much
 

865
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,909
not ideal, but I'd consider it much
rather play short side for the move back

866
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
rather play short side for the move back
 

867
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,350
rather play short side for the move back
down to sixes here,

868
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
down to sixes here,
 

869
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,710
down to sixes here,
which is what we're starting to see back

870
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
which is what we're starting to see back
 

871
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,470
which is what we're starting to see back
to that New York open. Some flush coming

872
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
to that New York open. Some flush coming
 

873
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,830
to that New York open. Some flush coming
in here. They find a bid here at this

874
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
in here. They find a bid here at this
 

875
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,549
in here. They find a bid here at this
New York open is the question. That blue

876
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
New York open is the question. That blue
 

877
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,110
New York open is the question. That blue
line on your screen

878
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
line on your screen
 

879
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,750
line on your screen
rather this gets a little bit higher be

880
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
rather this gets a little bit higher be
 

881
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:12,230
rather this gets a little bit higher be
more ideal to start the day.

882
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240

 

883
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,669

We're back to these sixes like we talked

884
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
We're back to these sixes like we talked
 

885
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,590
We're back to these sixes like we talked
about this gray box. The sixes over

886
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
about this gray box. The sixes over
 

887
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,430
about this gray box. The sixes over
under here.

888
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,440
under here.
 

889
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,789
under here.
If they soak here, they're going to want

890
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
If they soak here, they're going to want
 

891
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,630
If they soak here, they're going to want
to go back to that old point of control.

892
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
to go back to that old point of control.
 

893
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,470
to go back to that old point of control.
If they fail sixes, there's a rotation

894
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
If they fail sixes, there's a rotation
 

895
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,630
If they fail sixes, there's a rotation
back down to value. If they lose value,

896
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
back down to value. If they lose value,
 

897
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,950
back down to value. If they lose value,
next gray box and old point of control

898
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
next gray box and old point of control
 

899
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,630
next gray box and old point of control
from previous days. So, just I'm willing

900
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
from previous days. So, just I'm willing
 

901
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,789
from previous days. So, just I'm willing
to play both sides here while we figure

902
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
to play both sides here while we figure
 

903
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,070
to play both sides here while we figure
out what we're doing. But just waiting

904
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
out what we're doing. But just waiting
 

905
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,830
out what we're doing. But just waiting
to see if we can come to a key level

906
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
to see if we can come to a key level
 

907
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,630
to see if we can come to a key level
first. I don't want to front run it.

908
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
first. I don't want to front run it.
 

909
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,230
first. I don't want to front run it.
Yes, still finding a drive. It's a good

910
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
Yes, still finding a drive. It's a good
 

911
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,909
Yes, still finding a drive. It's a good
drive out on ES. Check the bigs here.

912
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
drive out on ES. Check the bigs here.
 

913
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,630
drive out on ES. Check the bigs here.
Are we gapping down? Running lower. No,

914
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
Are we gapping down? Running lower. No,
 

915
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,789
Are we gapping down? Running lower. No,
not yet.

916
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:48,799
not yet.
 

917
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,430
not yet.
So, VIX is hovering just under 15s right

918
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
So, VIX is hovering just under 15s right
 

919
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,630
So, VIX is hovering just under 15s right
now. So, let's see if they find a bid.

920
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
now. So, let's see if they find a bid.
 

921
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,149
now. So, let's see if they find a bid.
Back to the sixes here. This is the

922
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
Back to the sixes here. This is the
 

923
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,510
Back to the sixes here. This is the
level we just talked about. If they

924
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
level we just talked about. If they
 

925
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,510
level we just talked about. If they
start losing this, there's probably a

926
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
start losing this, there's probably a
 

927
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,230
start losing this, there's probably a
move down into this block here. These

928
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
move down into this block here. These
 

929
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,909
move down into this block here. These
value areas. If they bid up here, then

930
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:03,919
value areas. If they bid up here, then
 

931
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,029
value areas. If they bid up here, then
they're going to try and get back to

932
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039
they're going to try and get back to
 

933
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,789
they're going to try and get back to
that point of control. So, this 600,

934
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
that point of control. So, this 600,
 

935
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,909
that point of control. So, this 600,
same level that we talked about in

936
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
same level that we talked about in
 

937
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,110
same level that we talked about in
Discord. Folks, watching this to see how

938
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
Discord. Folks, watching this to see how
 

939
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,630
Discord. Folks, watching this to see how
we act here. Do bids come in? Do they

940
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:12,640
we act here. Do bids come in? Do they
 

941
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,070
we act here. Do bids come in? Do they
trap shorts?

942
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080

 

943
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,590

very thin this market this morning. By

944
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
very thin this market this morning. By
 

945
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,029
very thin this market this morning. By
the way, folks, haven't seen the volume

946
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
the way, folks, haven't seen the volume
 

947
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,750
the way, folks, haven't seen the volume
come in yet.

948
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
come in yet.
 

949
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,149

So, if we lose these sixes, I'd say the

950
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
So, if we lose these sixes, I'd say the
 

951
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,710
So, if we lose these sixes, I'd say the
big move here is 603 is where big

952
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,720
big move here is 603 is where big
 

953
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,390
big move here is 603 is where big
sellers came in here. It's a huge seller

954
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
sellers came in here. It's a huge seller
 

955
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,149
sellers came in here. It's a huge seller
that came in at 603. So, all the time

956
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
that came in at 603. So, all the time
 

957
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,470
that came in at 603. So, all the time
he's comfortable, there's potential to

958
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480
he's comfortable, there's potential to
 

959
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,590
he's comfortable, there's potential to
lose sixes and trade down the 550s. If

960
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
lose sixes and trade down the 550s. If
 

961
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,110
lose sixes and trade down the 550s. If
he gets knocked out, then the rotation

962
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
he gets knocked out, then the rotation
 

963
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,549
he gets knocked out, then the rotation
back higher is likely to happen.

964
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
back higher is likely to happen.
 

965
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,110
back higher is likely to happen.
Stacking some bids here between 87 62s

Stacking some bids here between 87 62s
 

967
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,669
Stacking some bids here between 87 62s
right now. Here comes the move back into

968
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
right now. Here comes the move back into
 

969
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,909
right now. Here comes the move back into
603. Driving through 603. Filling this

975
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,710

Reclaiming sixes. So good hold of this

976
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
Reclaiming sixes. So good hold of this
 

977
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,230
Reclaiming sixes. So good hold of this
gray box here so far. So I'm watching

00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
gray box here so far. So I'm watching
 

979
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,190
gray box here so far. So I'm watching
this New York open now.

980
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
this New York open now.
 

981
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,270
this New York open now.
Willing to play both sides. So either

982
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,280
Willing to play both sides. So either
 

983
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,950
Willing to play both sides. So either
shorts will protect this or we're going

984
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
shorts will protect this or we're going
 

985
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,470
shorts will protect this or we're going
to see a squeeze up into previous week

986
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
to see a squeeze up into previous week
 

987
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,390
to see a squeeze up into previous week
point control. So what I'm looking at

988
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
point control. So what I'm looking at
 

989
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,990
point control. So what I'm looking at
couple of ideas here. Something like

990
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
couple of ideas here. Something like
 

991
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,549
couple of ideas here. Something like
this for a short trigger. Maybe this.

992
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
this for a short trigger. Maybe this.
 

993
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,230
this for a short trigger. Maybe this.
And if we fail this, that's the next

994
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
And if we fail this, that's the next
 

995
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,669
And if we fail this, that's the next
short trigger. If they hold this, that's

996
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
short trigger. If they hold this, that's
 

997
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,990
short trigger. If they hold this, that's
the long trigger. So, willing to play

998
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
the long trigger. So, willing to play
 

999
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,990
the long trigger. So, willing to play
both sides here so far. Stuck at VW up,

1000
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
both sides here so far. Stuck at VW up,
 

1001
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,430
both sides here so far. Stuck at VW up,
stuck at that New York open. They can't

1002
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
stuck at that New York open. They can't
 

1003
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,750
stuck at that New York open. They can't
get back over it.

1004
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
get back over it.
 

1005
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,510
get back over it.
Apple's losing a bid here as is

Microsoft. All right. So, you've seen

1008
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
Microsoft. All right. So, you've seen
 

1009
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,190
Microsoft. All right. So, you've seen
some weakness in a couple names. Tesa

1010
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
some weakness in a couple names. Tesa
 

1011
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,710
some weakness in a couple names. Tesa
still going upside. Nvidia still going

1012
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
still going upside. Nvidia still going
 

1013
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,029
still going upside. Nvidia still going
upside. They're trying to hold these

1014
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
upside. They're trying to hold these
 

1015
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:40,230

1017
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,990

There's definitely a chance to move that

1018
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
There's definitely a chance to move that
 

1019
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,510
There's definitely a chance to move that
back down to 560 550 here

1020
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
back down to 560 550 here
 

1021
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,149
back down to 560 550 here
if they lose this with power, but at the

if they lose this with power, but at the
 

1023
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,630
if they lose this with power, but at the
moment it's being absorbed. It is very

1024
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,640
moment it's being absorbed. It is very
 

1025
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,269
moment it's being absorbed. It is very
whippy down here on light volume

1026
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
whippy down here on light volume
 

1027
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,710
whippy down here on light volume
and they decide their positioning.

1028
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
and they decide their positioning.
 

1029
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,590
and they decide their positioning.
Relative weakness here definitely in the

1030
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600
Relative weakness here definitely in the
 

1031
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,190
Relative weakness here definitely in the

cues
 

1033
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,590
cues
in the last couple minutes. Having a

1034
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
in the last couple minutes. Having a
 

1035
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,390
in the last couple minutes. Having a
look at the spiders.

1036
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400

 

1037
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,310

You can see there's bids down at 560

1038
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
You can see there's bids down at 560
 

1039
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,390
You can see there's bids down at 560
which is previous day value area high

1040
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:14,400
which is previous day value area high
 

1041
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,710
which is previous day value area high
kind of level. I'm wondering if we flush

1042
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
kind of level. I'm wondering if we flush
 

1043
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,230
kind of level. I'm wondering if we flush
down to that and pick them up down

1044
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
down to that and pick them up down
 

1045
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,310
down to that and pick them up down
there.

1046
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
there.
 

1047
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,110
there.
Here's the test. We might get it here.

1048
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
Here's the test. We might get it here.
 

1049
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,149
Here's the test. We might get it here.
Here we go. Is there follow through now?

1050
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
Here we go. Is there follow through now?
 

1051
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,669
Here we go. Is there follow through now?
Still finding some passive buys here.

Still finding some passive buys here.
Can we get down to 560s is my question.

1054
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
Can we get down to 560s is my question.
 

1055
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,430
Can we get down to 560s is my question.
We wash now. Nice scalping a little out

1056
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
We wash now. Nice scalping a little out
 

1057

on this flush in case we don't make it

1058
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
on this flush in case we don't make it
 

1059
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,190
on this flush in case we don't make it
all the way. It's 80s. Beautiful.

1060
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
all the way. It's 80s. Beautiful.
 

1061

all the way. It's 80s. Beautiful.
Cathering some more. Can we get follow

1062
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
Cathering some more. Can we get follow
 

1063
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,990
Cathering some more. Can we get follow
through to 60s? Stop moved in now. Let's

1064
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
through to 60s? Stop moved in now. Let's
 

1065
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,750
through to 60s? Stop moved in now. Let's
just see. We're under 600s. Don't want

1066
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
just see. We're under 600s. Don't want
 

1067
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,310
just see. We're under 600s. Don't want
to see this trade back off 603. Paid

1068
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320
to see this trade back off 603. Paid
 

1069
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,630
to see this trade back off 603. Paid
myself either way here.

1070
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
myself either way here.
 

1071
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,190
myself either way here.
Very whippy.

1072
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200

 

1073
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,750

Back to the sixes. Down to tiny size

1074
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:55,760
Back to the sixes. Down to tiny size
 

1075
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:08,789
Back to the sixes. Down to tiny size
now. Let's see if we can move lower.

1076
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799

 

1077
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,669

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,350
go, folks. Make sure you're paying
yourself in this move. Here's previous

1100
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
yourself in this move. Here's previous
 

1101
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,750
yourself in this move. Here's previous
day value area high. All right. So, the

1102
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
day value area high. All right. So, the
 

1103
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,590
day value area high. All right. So, the
bids might come in here. We don't know.

1104
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
bids might come in here. We don't know.
 

1105
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,710
bids might come in here. We don't know.
All right. If they're going to bid

1106
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
All right. If they're going to bid
 

1107
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,990
All right. If they're going to bid
against this, then they're going to look

1108
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,000
against this, then they're going to look
 

1109
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,830
against this, then they're going to look
for the rotation back up. All right.

1110
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
for the rotation back up. All right.
 

1111
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,750
for the rotation back up. All right.
This is a huge area. Value area high

1112
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:49,760
This is a huge area. Value area high
 

1113
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,269
This is a huge area. Value area high
previous day, value area low previous

1114
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
previous day, value area low previous
 

1115
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,830
previous day, value area low previous
week. And they might well bid up off

1116
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:53,840
week. And they might well bid up off
 

1117
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,669
week. And they might well bid up off
this if they want to hold the rotation.

1118
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
this if they want to hold the rotation.
 

1119
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,029
this if they want to hold the rotation.
If they fail this, then we're going to

1120
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:57,039
If they fail this, then we're going to
 

1121
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,830
If they fail this, then we're going to
look for this move and this move here.

1122
00:26:59,830 --> 00:26:59,840
look for this move and this move here.
 

1123
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,470

I mean, it's not the biggest move, but
 

1129
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,510
I mean, it's not the biggest move, but

1138
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
first. If we could have got that uh
 

1139
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,950
first. If we could have got that uh
point of control would have been really

1140
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960
point of control would have been really
 

1141
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,909

1253
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,909

all right, we can drive lower and lower

look and potentially will rotate all of

we find acceptance for this or do we do
 

1479
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,190
we find acceptance for this or do we do
this again? Don't really want to play

1480
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
this again? Don't really want to play
 

1481
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,869
this again? Don't really want to play
the short again. In my mind, now we've

1482
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
the short again. In my mind, now we've
 

1483
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,389
the short again. In my mind, now we've
had the chance to break down. If I'm

1484
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
had the chance to break down. If I'm
 

1485
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,589
had the chance to break down. If I'm
going to play the short again, it's

00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
going to play the short again, it's
 

1487
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,149
going to play the short again, it's
going to need to be something like this.

1488

going to need to be something like this.
 

1489
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,629

excess in this little area here to do
 

1493

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,270
above this and the New York open now and
then we should go hive day if we can do

1538
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
then we should go hive day if we can do
 

1539
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,030
then we should go hive day if we can do
that. And if we can go through hive day,

1540
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
that. And if we can go through hive day,
 

1541
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,750
that. And if we can go through hive day,
my expectation is to come into 700s now.

1542
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
my expectation is to come into 700s now.
 

1543
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,910
my expectation is to come into 700s now.
Really nice way to start the week and

1544
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
Really nice way to start the week and
 

1545
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,755
Really nice way to start the week and
the w and the year.

1546
00:36:06,755 --> 00:36:06,765
the w and the year.
 

1547
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:11,030
the w and the year.
[cough and clears throat]

1548
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040

 

1549
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,710

Oh,

1550
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720

 

1551
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,069

do I think we trade up to previous week

1552
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
do I think we trade up to previous week
 

1553
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,349
do I think we trade up to previous week
point of control and then dump? I think

1554
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
point of control and then dump? I think
 

1555
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,670
point of control and then dump? I think
we trade up to it. I can't tell you if

1556
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:21,680
we trade up to it. I can't tell you if
 

1557
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,190
we trade up to it. I can't tell you if
we're going to dump there until I see

1558
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
we're going to dump there until I see
 

1559
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,109
we're going to dump there until I see
how we act when we get there, mate. It's

1560
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:25,119
how we act when we get there, mate. It's
 

1561
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,630
how we act when we get there, mate. It's
possible that like if I was a seller,

1562
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,640
possible that like if I was a seller,
 

1563
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,230
possible that like if I was a seller,
I'd be selling into that move, but it's

1564
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,240
I'd be selling into that move, but it's
 

1565
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,670
I'd be selling into that move, but it's
very possible we squeeze all the way up

1566
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
very possible we squeeze all the way up
 

1567
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,670
very possible we squeeze all the way up
to previous week's value. If we find

1568
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
to previous week's value. If we find
 

1569
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,109
to previous week's value. If we find
acceptance there, we will get all the

1570
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
acceptance there, we will get all the
 

1571
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,990
acceptance there, we will get all the
way up to the top side. Okay, so here we

1572
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
way up to the top side. Okay, so here we
 

1573
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,069
way up to the top side. Okay, so here we
just traded into those 30s, right? Look

1574
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,079
just traded into those 30s, right? Look
 

1575
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,990
just traded into those 30s, right? Look
at this level at the top. These 30s,

1576
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
at this level at the top. These 30s,
 

1577
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,150
at this level at the top. These 30s,
like I said, 23 to 30s is going to be

1578
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,160
like I said, 23 to 30s is going to be
 

1579
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,829
like I said, 23 to 30s is going to be
key. This is where we're trading at the

1580
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
key. This is where we're trading at the
 

1581
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,349
key. This is where we're trading at the
moment. There's a big node here that

1582
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:45,359
moment. There's a big node here that
 

1583
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,750
moment. There's a big node here that
we've developed this morning. So, peel

1584
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:47,760
we've developed this morning. So, peel
 

1585
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,190
we've developed this morning. So, peel
some off here. And then I'm waiting now

1586
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
some off here. And then I'm waiting now
 

1587
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,950
some off here. And then I'm waiting now
on the runner. Can we get back above the

1588
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
on the runner. Can we get back above the
 

1589
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,750
on the runner. Can we get back above the
New York open, squeeze out current day

1590
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
New York open, squeeze out current day
 

1591
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,349
New York open, squeeze out current day
high and get up to previous week point

1592
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
high and get up to previous week point
 

1593
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,310
high and get up to previous week point
control above us. Already paying myself

1594
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,320
control above us. Already paying myself
 

1595
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:07,670
control above us. Already paying myself
either way.

1596
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,680

 

1597
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,670

[snorts]

1598
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:09,680
[snorts]
 

1599
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,109
[snorts]
All right, let's get some volume on here

1600
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
All right, let's get some volume on here
 

1601
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,630
All right, let's get some volume on here
for the day now that we've been open a

1602
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:12,640
for the day now that we've been open a
 

1603
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,950
for the day now that we've been open a
little while. No, it's the wrong one.

1604
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:14,960
little while. No, it's the wrong one.
 

1605
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,349
little while. No, it's the wrong one.
It's not what I want.

1606
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359

 

1607
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,790

All right, there we go. So, here you can

1608
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
All right, there we go. So, here you can
 

1609
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,870
All right, there we go. So, here you can
see the node I was looking at. 23 to 30,

1610
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
see the node I was looking at. 23 to 30,
 

1611
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,750
see the node I was looking at. 23 to 30,
right? 23 to 30. You'd want buyers need

1612
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:29,760
right? 23 to 30. You'd want buyers need
 

1613
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,510
right? 23 to 30. You'd want buyers need
to protect these 600s, right? Basically

1614
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520
to protect these 600s, right? Basically
 

1615
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,670
to protect these 600s, right? Basically
96s. Buyers would want to protect this.

1616
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
96s. Buyers would want to protect this.
 

1617
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,069
96s. Buyers would want to protect this.
If we're going to see that continuation,

1618
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:36,079
If we're going to see that continuation,
 

1619
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,150
If we're going to see that continuation,
we're going to need to see this move

1620
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,160
we're going to need to see this move
 

1621
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,870
we're going to need to see this move
here or this move here, right? We don't

1622
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:40,880
here or this move here, right? We don't
 

1623
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,069
here or this move here, right? We don't
want it back under here now on our

1624
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
want it back under here now on our
 

1625
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,510
want it back under here now on our
runners. If we come under here, we're

1626
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
runners. If we come under here, we're
 

1627
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,030
runners. If we come under here, we're
going to expect rotate back down to

1628
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,040
going to expect rotate back down to
 

1629
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,870
going to expect rotate back down to
there again, which is going to be ugly.

1630
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:46,880
there again, which is going to be ugly.
 

1631
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,190
there again, which is going to be ugly.
But remember, we are an inside bar on

1632
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
But remember, we are an inside bar on
 

1633
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,950
But remember, we are an inside bar on
the daily. We're inside on the weekly so

1634
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960
the daily. We're inside on the weekly so
 

1635
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,630
the daily. We're inside on the weekly so
far. We're inside value on the weekly.

1636
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:54,640
far. We're inside value on the weekly.
 

1637
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,109
far. We're inside value on the weekly.
Um, but we are above value on the on the

1638
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
Um, but we are above value on the on the
 

1639
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,630
Um, but we are above value on the on the
daily now, which is good. So, we're

1640
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:58,640
daily now, which is good. So, we're
 

1641
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,950
daily now, which is good. So, we're
trying to auction higher prices on daily

1642
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
trying to auction higher prices on daily
 

1643
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:13,990
trying to auction higher prices on daily
versus Friday.

1644
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000

 

1645
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,950

back to these sixes again.

1646
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960

 

1647
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,349

Yeah, Nvidia giving that move back. This

1648
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:21,359
Yeah, Nvidia giving that move back. This
 

1649
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,630
Yeah, Nvidia giving that move back. This
is the thing. There might be profit.

1650
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:22,640
is the thing. There might be profit.
 

1651
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,550
is the thing. There might be profit.
Like we said beginning of the stream,

1652
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
Like we said beginning of the stream,
 

1653
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,310
Like we said beginning of the stream,
every drive up we've seen profit taken

1654
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
every drive up we've seen profit taken
 

1655
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,069
every drive up we've seen profit taken
so far. Just depends if today's

1656
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
so far. Just depends if today's
 

1657
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,589
so far. Just depends if today's
different.

1658
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
different.
 

1659
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:36,069
different.
It's absolutely been a thing.

1660
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079

 

1661
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,069

If we start trading on the 90s, I'll cut

1662
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
If we start trading on the 90s, I'll cut
 

1663
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,310
If we start trading on the 90s, I'll cut
the runner and that's fine. Paid myself.

1664
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,320
the runner and that's fine. Paid myself.
 

1665
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,870
the runner and that's fine. Paid myself.
Like I said,

1666
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:44,880

 

1667
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,870

we're just inside this uh what is

1668
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
we're just inside this uh what is
 

1669
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,550
we're just inside this uh what is
developing as a D-shaped profile this

1670
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,560
developing as a D-shaped profile this
 

1671
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,390
developing as a D-shaped profile this
morning.

1672
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:54,400

 

1673
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,790

Like I said, if buts, and maybe type

1674
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:56,800
Like I said, if buts, and maybe type
 

1675
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,390
Like I said, if buts, and maybe type
trade, see money, take money type

1676
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,400
trade, see money, take money type
 

1677
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,109
trade, see money, take money type
environment right now.

1678
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,119
environment right now.
 

1679
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,270
environment right now.
We lose these 90s, we'll flush 80s, I'll

1680
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:03,280
We lose these 90s, we'll flush 80s, I'll
 

1681
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,270
We lose these 90s, we'll flush 80s, I'll
be out. Loses 90s, I'm out. There we go.

1682
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280

00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
I'm out. Yeah.
 

1685
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,310
I'm out. Yeah.
So, locked in. Could always reload,

1686
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,320
So, locked in. Could always reload,
 

1687
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,030
So, locked in. Could always reload,
but I don't want to play short here

1688
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,040

1691

us trade outside of this. Right. If

us trade outside of this. Right. If
 

1693
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,150

we're really going to get weak,

I'm not thinking about a short now. I

I'm not thinking about a short now. I
 

1729
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,030
I'm not thinking about a short now. I
think we're in a rotational market. So

1730
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,040
think we're in a rotational market. So
 

1731
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,109
think we're in a rotational market. So
until I see weakness under key levels,

1732

until I see weakness under key levels,
 

1733

until I see weakness under key levels,
I'm not thinking about a short. It

I'm not thinking about a short. It
 

1735
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,550
I'm not thinking about a short. It
doesn't mean I'm having another go long

1736
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
doesn't mean I'm having another go long
 

1737
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,030
doesn't mean I'm having another go long
here. We're [clears throat] just waiting

Market seems very thin on the book. It's

Market seems very thin on the book. It's
amazing how thin we are. Start of a new

amazing how thin we are. Start of a new
 

1749
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:56,923

1757
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,550

Being out this liquidity down into 75

1758
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
Being out this liquidity down into 75
 

1759

Being out this liquidity down into 75
and 60 again now.

1760
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,280
and 60 again now.
 

1761
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,829
and 60 again now.
So strong selling today has come in sub

1762
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:13,839
So strong selling today has come in sub
 

1763
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,510
So strong selling today has come in sub
80 and then 66s and then the lows. All

1764
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
80 and then 66s and then the lows. All
 

1765
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,589
80 and then 66s and then the lows. All
right. So that's where the aggressive

1766
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
right. So that's where the aggressive
 

1767
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,109
right. So that's where the aggressive
sellers have been and they haven't got

1768
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:21,119
sellers have been and they haven't got
 

1769
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,710
sellers have been and they haven't got
their way yet. All right. So I'd say

1770
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:24,720
their way yet. All right. So I'd say
 

1771
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,990
their way yet. All right. So I'd say
right where we are now, there was some

1772
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,000
right where we are now, there was some
 

1773
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,270
right where we are now, there was some
aggressive selling and then there was

1774
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,280
aggressive selling and then there was
 

1775
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,470
aggressive selling and then there was
more at sort of 78 down to 70 and then

1776
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,480
more at sort of 78 down to 70 and then
 

1777
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,390
more at sort of 78 down to 70 and then
more more at the lows. So those sellers

1778
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,400
more more at the lows. So those sellers
 

1779
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,670
more more at the lows. So those sellers
need to be back in the money if we're

1780
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
need to be back in the money if we're
 

1781

need to be back in the money if we're
going to see followrough underneath

we're still looking at the same thing.
 

1845
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,150
we're still looking at the same thing.
All right, short still. Remember, cells,

1846
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
All right, short still. Remember, cells,
 

1847
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,470
All right, short still. Remember, cells,
like I told you, have come in aggressive

1848
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
like I told you, have come in aggressive
 

1849
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,870
like I told you, have come in aggressive
here and here and not get their way. If

1850
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
here and here and not get their way. If
 

1851
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,030
here and here and not get their way. If
we start doing this, we will squeeze.

1852
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,040
we start doing this, we will squeeze.
 

1853
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,309
we start doing this, we will squeeze.
They will all get caught. And that's

1854
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
They will all get caught. And that's
 

1855
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,589
They will all get caught. And that's
where all the strong selling is down

1856
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
where all the strong selling is down
 

1857
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,950
where all the strong selling is down
here. If you ask me how, I know, I can

1858
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:32,960
here. If you ask me how, I know, I can
 

1859
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,589
here. If you ask me how, I know, I can
see it on footprint. All right. right

1860
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:35,599
see it on footprint. All right. right
 

1861
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,109
see it on footprint. All right. right
here

1862
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
here
 

1863
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,069
here
again in the same level.

1864
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:40,079
again in the same level.
 

1865
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,670
again in the same level.
These guys, oh my god, are you going to

1866
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:41,680
These guys, oh my god, are you going to
 

1867
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,670
These guys, oh my god, are you going to
help me out here? These guys, these

1868
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
help me out here? These guys, these
 

1869
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,670
help me out here? These guys, these
guys, these guys, these guys, these

1870
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:45,680
guys, these guys, these guys, these
 

1871
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,750
guys, these guys, these guys, these
guys, these guys, these guys are all out

guys, these guys, these guys are all out
 

1873
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,589
guys, these guys, these guys are all out
the money. So, if we hold and pivot,

1874
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
the money. So, if we hold and pivot,
 

1875
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,349
the money. So, if we hold and pivot,
they're going to get squeezed out. Big

1876
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:51,359
they're going to get squeezed out. Big
 

1877
00:43:51,359 --> 00:44:01,990
they're going to get squeezed out. Big
if, but uh it has potential to do it.

1878
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000

 

1879
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,390

So, if we hold these sort of sixes, same

1880
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
So, if we hold these sort of sixes, same
 

1881
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,309
So, if we hold these sort of sixes, same
thing we were talking about earlier,

1882
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319
thing we were talking about earlier,
 

1883
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,750
thing we were talking about earlier,
maybe got the chance to do it.

1884
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:09,760
maybe got the chance to do it.
 

1885
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,750
maybe got the chance to do it.

day. All right, you can see this big old
 

1947
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,990

D-shape. Well, it's not even that big to

1948
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
D-shape. Well, it's not even that big to
 

1949
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,349
D-shape. Well, it's not even that big to
be honest. This is what we're building

1950
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359
be honest. This is what we're building
 

1951
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,950
be honest. This is what we're building
out. We're not finding acceptance above.

1952
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
out. We're not finding acceptance above.
 

1953
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,870
out. We're not finding acceptance above.
We're not finding acceptance below,

We're not finding acceptance below,
 

1955
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,750
We're not finding acceptance below,
right? We are rotating. I still think

1956
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:39,760
right? We are rotating. I still think
 

1957
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,270
right? We are rotating. I still think
we're going to do this at the moment,

1958
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,280
we're going to do this at the moment,
 

1959
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,990
we're going to do this at the moment,
but uh

1960
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,000
but uh
 

1961
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,990
but uh
let's see see what this news has to say

1962
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,000
let's see see what this news has to say
 

1963
00:45:46,000 --> 00:46:05,750
let's see see what this news has to say
about that move. A

1964
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:05,760

 

1965
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,150

That's value area high. The 620 630 is

1966
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
That's value area high. The 620 630 is
 

1967
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:17,190
That's value area high. The 620 630 is
that node we talked about.

1968
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200

 

1969
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,670

So we've only had uh 134 points today.

1970
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:21,680
So we've only had uh 134 points today.
 

1971
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,309
So we've only had uh 134 points today.
That's the size of the move so far.

1972
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319

 

1973
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,990

How long we got left? Five more minutes.

1974
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,000
How long we got left? Five more minutes.
 

1975
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,670
How long we got left? Five more minutes.
What's this hourly candle looking like?

1976
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,680
What's this hourly candle looking like?
 

1977
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,670
What's this hourly candle looking like?
Pretty ugly.

1978
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:33,680
Pretty ugly.
 

1979
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,750
Pretty ugly.
Big wick top side right now.

1980
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:37,760
Big wick top side right now.
 

1981
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,829
Big wick top side right now.
Just missed our level. If we think about

1982
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:39,839
Just missed our level. If we think about
 

1983
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,030
Just missed our level. If we think about
what we talked about this morning on the

1984
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
what we talked about this morning on the
 

1985
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,069
what we talked about this morning on the
hourly, it's important to zoom out.

1986
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:44,079
hourly, it's important to zoom out.
 

1987
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,550
hourly, it's important to zoom out.
Right. This level here, we said big node

1988
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
Right. This level here, we said big node
 

1989
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,190
Right. This level here, we said big node
previous week. We just missed it.

1990
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
previous week. We just missed it.
 

1991
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,270
previous week. We just missed it.
We just missed it here. So, it got

1992
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
We just missed it here. So, it got
 

1993
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,630
We just missed it here. So, it got
stuffed into this. So sellers are

1994
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
stuffed into this. So sellers are
 

1995
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,109
stuffed into this. So sellers are
hanging out up here. All right. And

1996
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
hanging out up here. All right. And
 

1997
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,270
hanging out up here. All right. And
we've bid so far off this. All right. So

1998
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,280
we've bid so far off this. All right. So
 

1999
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,630
we've bid so far off this. All right. So
there is the move. That's all we've

2000
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640
there is the move. That's all we've
 

2001
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,710
there is the move. That's all we've
done. Drive up into this failed. Didn't

2002
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:02,720
done. Drive up into this failed. Didn't
 

2003
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,150
done. Drive up into this failed. Didn't
quite make it. All right. I would have

2004
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:04,160
quite make it. All right. I would have
 

2005
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,309
quite make it. All right. I would have
liked to snap short up here. If we done

2006
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:06,319
liked to snap short up here. If we done
 

2007
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,270
liked to snap short up here. If we done
something like that, it would been

2008
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:07,280
something like that, it would been
 

2009
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,190
something like that, it would been
really good.

2010
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
really good.
 

2011
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,750
really good.
But instead, we're in a rotation now

2012
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
But instead, we're in a rotation now
 

2013
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,710
But instead, we're in a rotation now
while we develop some volume while it

2014
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:14,720
while we develop some volume while it
 

2015
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,550
while we develop some volume while it
decides who it wants to trap and where

2016
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:16,560
decides who it wants to trap and where
 

2017
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,550
decides who it wants to trap and where
it wants to go. And you got to be

2018
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,560
it wants to go. And you got to be
 

2019
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:26,950
it wants to go. And you got to be
willing to look both ways right now.

2020
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:26,960

 

2021
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,630

Can I mark out the imbalance I saw in

2022
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
Can I mark out the imbalance I saw in
 

2023
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,550
Can I mark out the imbalance I saw in
the 90s? Well, it's it it's gone now.

2024
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:30,560
the 90s? Well, it's it it's gone now.
 

2025
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,349
the 90s? Well, it's it it's gone now.
It's right here. You see this

2026
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
It's right here. You see this
 

2027
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,910
It's right here. You see this
this side imbalance?

2028
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920

 

2029
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,470

It's off footprint. It's not off a fair

2030
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:40,480
It's off footprint. It's not off a fair
 

2031
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,990
It's off footprint. It's not off a fair
value gap or something. I guess you

2032
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:42,000
value gap or something. I guess you
 

2033
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,670
value gap or something. I guess you
could say it was here on a fair value

2034
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:43,680
could say it was here on a fair value
 

2035
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,790
could say it was here on a fair value
gap, right?

2036
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:46,800
gap, right?
 

2037
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,550
gap, right?
The actual imbalance is uh I'm getting

2038
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:48,560
The actual imbalance is uh I'm getting
 

2039
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,510
The actual imbalance is uh I'm getting
off the print right there.

2040
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520

 

2041
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,430

Okay, back down to this value area

2042
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
Okay, back down to this value area
 

2043
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,510
Okay, back down to this value area
again.

2044
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:57,520
again.
 

2045
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,589
again.
Again, everything under 70s has been

2046
00:47:59,589 --> 00:47:59,599
Again, everything under 70s has been
 

2047
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,430
Again, everything under 70s has been
sellers getting stuck. It's been passive

2048
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,440
sellers getting stuck. It's been passive
 

2049
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,309
sellers getting stuck. It's been passive
buying from 70s down to low of day so

2050
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
buying from 70s down to low of day so
 

2051
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,630
buying from 70s down to low of day so
far. So, it's been bids just sat there

2052
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:06,640
far. So, it's been bids just sat there
 

2053
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,710
far. So, it's been bids just sat there
absorbing the tape so far. And it's been

2054
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:08,720
absorbing the tape so far. And it's been
 

2055
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,109
absorbing the tape so far. And it's been
aggressive sellers being absorbed. So,

2056
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:11,119
aggressive sellers being absorbed. So,
 

2057
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,349
aggressive sellers being absorbed. So,
we are having buyers down there trying

2058
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:13,359
we are having buyers down there trying
 

2059
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:19,430
we are having buyers down there trying
to have a bit of a party.

2060
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,440

 

2061
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,030

And you'll see it on the CVD. If you

2062
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
And you'll see it on the CVD. If you
 

2063
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,710
And you'll see it on the CVD. If you
look at CBD right now, we've been trying

2064
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
look at CBD right now, we've been trying
 

2065
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,470
look at CBD right now, we've been trying
to make lower lows and we're not moving

2066
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:24,480
to make lower lows and we're not moving
 

2067
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,829
to make lower lows and we're not moving
lower in price. So, we've got price

2068
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:25,839
lower in price. So, we've got price
 

2069
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,069
lower in price. So, we've got price
divergence in CBD. We've got aggressive

2070
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:28,079
divergence in CBD. We've got aggressive
 

2071
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,069
divergence in CBD. We've got aggressive
sellers trying to move price lower.

2072
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
sellers trying to move price lower.
 

2073
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,990
sellers trying to move price lower.
There's a new lower low on CBD there.

2074
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
There's a new lower low on CBD there.
 

2075
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,230
There's a new lower low on CBD there.
And we are not moving lower in this

2076
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,240
And we are not moving lower in this
 

2077
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,069
And we are not moving lower in this
market. So, there's without a doubt

2078
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:36,079
market. So, there's without a doubt
 

2079
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,950
market. So, there's without a doubt
passive buyers down here at 70 down to

2080
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:38,960
passive buyers down here at 70 down to
 

2081
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,030
passive buyers down here at 70 down to
40s. We can see it on CBD. You can see

2082
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
40s. We can see it on CBD. You can see
 

2083
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,943
40s. We can see it on CBD. You can see
it on the book.

2084
00:48:43,943 --> 00:48:43,953
it on the book.
 

2085
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:44,950
it on the book.

feels like it wants to move back up

2176
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:50,079
feels like it wants to move back up
 

2177
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,309
feels like it wants to move back up

can we get through 20s and 30s.
 

2237
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,870
can we get through 20s and 30s.
It's the same thing, folks. I've given

2238
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:28,880
It's the same thing, folks. I've given
 

2239
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,349
It's the same thing, folks. I've given
you the same levels.

2240
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:31,359
you the same levels.
 

2241
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,109
you the same levels.
Same thing over and over and over again.

00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
Same thing over and over and over again.
 

2243
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,549
Same thing over and over and over again.
Can we get through if we get through 20s

2244
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
Can we get through if we get through 20s
 

2245
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,510
Can we get through if we get through 20s
and 30s, we should lift to 43, which is

2246
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:37,520
and 30s, we should lift to 43, which is
 

2247
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,950
and 30s, we should lift to 43, which is
New York open. If we get through that, I

2248
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:38,960
New York open. If we get through that, I
 

2249
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,950
New York open. If we get through that, I
think we go high of day and previous

2250
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:40,960
think we go high of day and previous
 

2251
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,870
think we go high of day and previous
week control up here. So, we're still

2252
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:42,880
week control up here. So, we're still
 

2253
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,990
week control up here. So, we're still
looking at the same thing, but we've got

2254
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:44,000
looking at the same thing, but we've got
 

2255
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,630
looking at the same thing, but we've got
to get through all this first. So,

2256
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:46,640
to get through all this first. So,
 

2257
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,470
to get through all this first. So,
passive selling is taking place here.

2258
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480
passive selling is taking place here.

Passive buying is taking place here. And
this is the rotation.

2262
00:52:59,910 --> 00:52:59,920

 

2263
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,309

Back to PC. They should they got a bid

buyers are going to take control and

2268
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:05,599
buyers are going to take control and
 

2269
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,670
buyers are going to take control and
have a go. They've just washed out a

They should go and aim up here. They
 

2277
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,710
They should go and aim up here. They
just need someone a bit more aggressive

2278
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,720
just need someone a bit more aggressive
 

2279
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,470

2283
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,270

They're still trying to find acceptance

2802
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:37,920
They're still trying to find acceptance
 

2803
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,549
They're still trying to find acceptance
above this New York open and search for

2804
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:40,559
above this New York open and search for
 

2805
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,549
above this New York open and search for
the high of day. That's what they are

2806
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:42,559
the high of day. That's what they are
 

2807
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,270
the high of day. That's what they are
attempting to do here. Uh once we get

2808
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:45,280
attempting to do here. Uh once we get
 

2809
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,870
attempting to do here. Uh once we get
through high of day, like I said, if we

2810
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
through high of day, like I said, if we
 

2811
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,309
through high of day, like I said, if we
run these stops, we should come into

2812
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
run these stops, we should come into
 

2813
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,589
run these stops, we should come into
this block up here. That's what they're

2814
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:49,599
this block up here. That's what they're
 

2815
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:50,870
this block up here. That's what they're
attempting to do here. So, any of you

2816
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:50,880
attempting to do here. So, any of you
 

2817
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,750
attempting to do here. So, any of you
who are still long,

2818
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
who are still long,
 

2819
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,270
who are still long,
you might be getting it here. They're

2820
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:55,280
you might be getting it here. They're
 

2821
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,589
you might be getting it here. They're
trying to build up to go. Just every

2822
01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:57,599
trying to build up to go. Just every
 

2823
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,910
trying to build up to go. Just every
push up here into 55 speed. So it's so

2824
01:05:59,910 --> 01:05:59,920
push up here into 55 speed. So it's so
 

2825
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,910
push up here into 55 speed. So it's so
thin on the book. It's insane.

2826
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:03,920
thin on the book. It's insane.
 

2827
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,309
thin on the book. It's insane.
Where is Mr. Volume? Is he going to come

2828
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
Where is Mr. Volume? Is he going to come
 

2829
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,549
Where is Mr. Volume? Is he going to come
back today? Back to value high again

2830
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
back today? Back to value high again
 

2831
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:09,990
back today? Back to value high again
here. This is not a good look here,

2832
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
here. This is not a good look here,
 

2833
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,349
here. This is not a good look here,
folks. Because you've just pushed and

2834
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:11,359
folks. Because you've just pushed and
 

2835
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:19,430
folks. Because you've just pushed and
failed.

2836
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:19,440

 

2837
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,430

Trying to find a bid as well.

2838
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:23,440
Trying to find a bid as well.
 

2839
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,190
Trying to find a bid as well.
Not able to get up to that high of day

2840
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,200
Not able to get up to that high of day
 

2841
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,789
Not able to get up to that high of day
yet. And now you're back to value area

2842
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:26,799
yet. And now you're back to value area
 

2843
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,150
yet. And now you're back to value area
high. If you lose value area high,

2844
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,160
high. If you lose value area high,
 

2845
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,029
high. If you lose value area high,
you're going to go VPO.

2846
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:31,039
you're going to go VPO.
 

2847
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,710
you're going to go VPO.
They're still bidding value area high.

2848
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
They're still bidding value area high.
 

2849
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:37,190
They're still bidding value area high.
These rotations are tiny.

2850
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,200

 

2851
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,510

Back to the New York Open.

2852
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:39,520
Back to the New York Open.
 

2853
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,069
Back to the New York Open.
Shelf again. Same shelf.

2854
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,079
Shelf again. Same shelf.
 

2855
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:43,589
Shelf again. Same shelf.
Back on that last push again. They're

2856
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:43,599
Back on that last push again. They're
 

2857
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,870
Back on that last push again. They're
having another go. It's now It's now or

2858
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:46,880
having another go. It's now It's now or
 

2859
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,710
having another go. It's now It's now or
never for the Bulls. I say if they can't

2860
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:48,720
never for the Bulls. I say if they can't
 

2861
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,109
never for the Bulls. I say if they can't
get back through

2862
01:06:51,109 --> 01:06:51,119
get back through
 

2863
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,589
get back through
50, then they're in trouble. If they get

2864
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:53,599
50, then they're in trouble. If they get
 

2865
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:54,710
50, then they're in trouble. If they get
back through 50, you're going to run

2866
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
back through 50, you're going to run
 

2867
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,390
back through 50, you're going to run
higher there. I think it's the last

2868
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:56,400
higher there. I think it's the last
 

2869
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,630
higher there. I think it's the last
attempt that they've got. They just held

2870
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
attempt that they've got. They just held
 

2871
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,510
attempt that they've got. They just held
Bpo another time after a failed look.

2872
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,520
Bpo another time after a failed look.
 

2873
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,029
Bpo another time after a failed look.
Look all this liquidity above. They

2874
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:03,039
Look all this liquidity above. They
 

2875
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,750
Look all this liquidity above. They
should come for it.

2876
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:05,760
should come for it.
 

2877
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,589
should come for it.
They should really be gagging to get up

2878
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:07,599
They should really be gagging to get up
 

2879
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,950
They should really be gagging to get up
into 80s now. Here they go. Wakey wakey,

2880
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:10,960
into 80s now. Here they go. Wakey wakey,
 

2881
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,069
into 80s now. Here they go. Wakey wakey,
Mr. Bulls, where are you? Let's go into

2882
01:07:14,069 --> 01:07:14,079
Mr. Bulls, where are you? Let's go into
 

2883
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,750
Mr. Bulls, where are you? Let's go into
80s. And if you run 80s, you should go

2884
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:15,760
80s. And if you run 80s, you should go
 

2885
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,750
80s. And if you run 80s, you should go
700. You should run the stops there to

2886
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
700. You should run the stops there to
 

2887
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,870
700. You should run the stops there to
get into this uh level up here. So once

2888
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:20,880
get into this uh level up here. So once
 

2889
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,470
get into this uh level up here. So once
you get through here, you should there

2890
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:22,480
you get through here, you should there
 

2891
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,910
you get through here, you should there
should be enough stops to get you into

2892
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:23,920
should be enough stops to get you into
 

2893
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,230
should be enough stops to get you into
that. So if you're long from these any

2894
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:26,240
that. So if you're long from these any
 

2895
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,470
that. So if you're long from these any
of these, you should be trimming,

2896
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:28,480
of these, you should be trimming,
 

2897
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,789
of these, you should be trimming,
trimming, trimming, and then holding on

2898
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:30,799
trimming, trimming, and then holding on
 

2899
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:33,109
trimming, trimming, and then holding on
just in case they want to come all the

2900
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:33,119
just in case they want to come all the
 

2901
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,710
just in case they want to come all the
way up here, which would be really nice

2902
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
way up here, which would be really nice
 

2903
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,150
way up here, which would be really nice
for you guys,

2904
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:38,160

 

2905
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,990

right? I'm not in a position, so I want

2906
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:40,000
right? I'm not in a position, so I want
 

2907
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,029
right? I'm not in a position, so I want
to be uh transparent about that, but if

2908
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039

2909
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,109

for you guys. You don't want it to come

2912
01:07:47,349 --> 01:07:47,359
for you guys. You don't want it to come
 

2913
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:48,950
for you guys. You don't want it to come
back under value, though. If you start

2914
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:48,960
back under value, though. If you start
 

2915
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,549
back under value, though. If you start
losing

2916
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559

2917
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,789

2949
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:26,950

bubbles start to step in here rather
than just nothing on the bullet. There's

2956

2957
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,749
than just nothing on the bullet. There's
no passive participation here. So you

2958
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:33,759
no passive participation here. So you
 

2959

no passive participation here. So you
need a big aggressive player to come in

2967
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,669

be that hard to take a 28 lot out.

2968
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:47,679
be that hard to take a 28 lot out.
 

2969
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,510
be that hard to take a 28 lot out.
That's how

2970
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520
That's how
 

2971
01:08:49,520 --> 01:09:06,149
That's how
lacking volume we are.

01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:35,759

 

2995
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,430

Yeah, I would agree, mate. I would

2996
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:37,440
Yeah, I would agree, mate. I would
 

2997
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,829
Yeah, I would agree, mate. I would
agree. It is making heavy weather. It

2998
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
agree. It is making heavy weather. It
 

2999
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,510
agree. It is making heavy weather. It
is.

3000
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
is.
 

3001
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,030
is.
We're not seeing anyone step

3002
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,040
We're not seeing anyone step
 

3003
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,910
We're not seeing anyone step
aggressively on the tape. Someone keeps

3004
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
aggressively on the tape. Someone keeps
 

3005
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,349
aggressively on the tape. Someone keeps
reloading selling at 60s.

3006
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:49,359
reloading selling at 60s.
 

3007
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,430
reloading selling at 60s.
So, we had some decent size buying up

3008
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:51,440
So, we had some decent size buying up
 

3009
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,669
So, we had some decent size buying up
there on that last shove. Just over a

3010
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:53,679
there on that last shove. Just over a
 

3011
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,790
there on that last shove. Just over a
100 lot from sort of 57 to 60s. So, it's

3012
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,800
100 lot from sort of 57 to 60s. So, it's
 

3013
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,229
100 lot from sort of 57 to 60s. So, it's
like a bit of an outlier delta there.

3014
01:09:58,229 --> 01:09:58,239
like a bit of an outlier delta there.
 

3015
01:09:58,239 --> 01:09:59,430
like a bit of an outlier delta there.
Once we get through that, there you go.

3016
01:09:59,430 --> 01:09:59,440
Once we get through that, there you go.
 

3017
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,750
Once we get through that, there you go.
Through 60s. Now, we should lift to 70s.

3018
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:01,760
Through 60s. Now, we should lift to 70s.
 

3019
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,910
Through 60s. Now, we should lift to 70s.
We don't want to see him resell this.

3020
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:05,920

 

3021
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,149

We need to reclaim 60s, push 70s here

3022
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:08,159
We need to reclaim 60s, push 70s here
 

3023
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,590
We need to reclaim 60s, push 70s here
now because you've got some outlying

3024
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:09,600
now because you've got some outlying
 

3025
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,750
now because you've got some outlying
aggressive buying coming in here. You

3026
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:11,760
aggressive buying coming in here. You
 

3027
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,110
aggressive buying coming in here. You
don't want them to get stuck versus

3028
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:13,120
don't want them to get stuck versus
 

3029
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,910
don't want them to get stuck versus
passive selling. You just want one clean

3030
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:15,920
passive selling. You just want one clean
 

3031
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,149
passive selling. You just want one clean
snap that you can exit your position

3032
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:18,159
snap that you can exit your position
 

3033
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,950
snap that you can exit your position
long on [clears throat] or at least trim

3034
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:20,960
long on [clears throat] or at least trim
 

3035
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,229
long on [clears throat] or at least trim
it. Feels like it's coming,

3036
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:24,239
it. Feels like it's coming,
 

3037
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,270
it. Feels like it's coming,
but it's felt that way for I'd say 15

3038
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:27,280
but it's felt that way for I'd say 15
 

3039
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,550
but it's felt that way for I'd say 15
minutes. They've been building to do

3040
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:28,560
minutes. They've been building to do
 

3041
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,390
minutes. They've been building to do
this. So you can see them stacking 67

3042
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:30,400
this. So you can see them stacking 67
 

3043
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,189
this. So you can see them stacking 67
and 70s right now. We should just lift

3044
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:33,199
and 70s right now. We should just lift
 

3045
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,750
and 70s right now. We should just lift
and get through there. Here we go. That

3046
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
and get through there. Here we go. That
 

3047
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,510
and get through there. Here we go. That
I don't like. There was a big buyer came

3048
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:37,520
I don't like. There was a big buyer came
 

3049
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,750
I don't like. There was a big buyer came
in there and got stuck. There is a

3050
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:39,760
in there and got stuck. There is a
 

3051
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,470
in there and got stuck. There is a
seller around 62. Reloading. Let me pull

3052
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:42,480
seller around 62. Reloading. Let me pull
 

3053
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,310
seller around 62. Reloading. Let me pull
this down.

3054
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,320
this down.
 

3055
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,390
this down.
Where are you?

3056
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400

 

3057
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,669

There he is. Yeah, I don't like that.

3058
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:51,679
There he is. Yeah, I don't like that.
 

3059
01:10:51,679 --> 01:11:11,189
There he is. Yeah, I don't like that.
They had the chance there.

3060
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:11,199

 

3061
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,430

Uh, I don't think that's I don't think

3062
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:13,440
Uh, I don't think that's I don't think
 

3063
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,709
Uh, I don't think that's I don't think
that's true. I don't think all of this

3064
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:14,719
that's true. I don't think all of this
 

3065
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,350
that's true. I don't think all of this
is due to Venezuela. I think if you just

3066
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:17,360
is due to Venezuela. I think if you just
 

3067
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,550
is due to Venezuela. I think if you just
look if you just zoom out on the daily,

3068
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:20,560
look if you just zoom out on the daily,
 

3069
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:31,350
look if you just zoom out on the daily,
then you'll see this is what we expect.

3070
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:31,360

 

3071
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,750

So, back down to this shelf. Now you can

3072
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
So, back down to this shelf. Now you can
 

3073
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,590
So, back down to this shelf. Now you can
see the edge of these gray shelves where

3074
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:35,600
see the edge of these gray shelves where
 

3075

Oh, got you. My bad. Ray, Ray, yeah,
 

3541

Oh, got you. My bad. Ray, Ray, yeah,
initial balance. Thank you. Thank you.

3542
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,080
initial balance. Thank you. Thank you.
 

3543
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,270
initial balance. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, Tyson. IB now set.

3544
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:55,280
Thank you. Thank you, Tyson. IB now set.
 

3545
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,270
Thank you. Thank you, Tyson. IB now set.
So, high of day, IB. Purple on your

3546
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:57,280
So, high of day, IB. Purple on your
 

3547
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,990
So, high of day, IB. Purple on your
screen. Initial balance. So, what can we

3548
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:00,000
screen. Initial balance. So, what can we
 

3549
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,350
screen. Initial balance. So, what can we
think about here? If we're going to get

3550
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:01,360
think about here? If we're going to get
 

3551
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,629
think about here? If we're going to get
a trend day, we're going to have to find

3552
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
a trend day, we're going to have to find
 

3553
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,310
a trend day, we're going to have to find
acceptance above initial balance and

3554
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
acceptance above initial balance and
 

3555
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,149
acceptance above initial balance and
probably above this gray box. If we're

3556
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:06,159
probably above this gray box. If we're
 

3557
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,830
probably above this gray box. If we're
going to get an IB rotation day, it's

3558
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
going to get an IB rotation day, it's
 

3559
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,310
going to get an IB rotation day, it's
very possible we do something like this

3560
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320
very possible we do something like this
 

3561
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,910
very possible we do something like this
and come back down. All right, so be

3562
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
and come back down. All right, so be
 

3563
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,390
and come back down. All right, so be
aware of fail breakouts today. All

3564
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:14,400
aware of fail breakouts today. All
 

3565
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,870
aware of fail breakouts today. All
right, if we can get through this huge

3566
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
right, if we can get through this huge
 

3567
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,950
right, if we can get through this huge
chunk here, we do have this looming all

3568
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:18,960
chunk here, we do have this looming all
 

3569
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,030
chunk here, we do have this looming all
the way up here at 800s, right? Anyone

3570
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:21,040
the way up here at 800s, right? Anyone

I will remind you, we are still an

3580
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:30,480
I will remind you, we are still an
 

3581
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,070
I will remind you, we are still an
inside day. All right, we're still

3582
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,080
inside day. All right, we're still
 

3583
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,390
inside day. All right, we're still
inside of Friday. We're still inside of

3584
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:34,400
inside of Friday. We're still inside of
 

3585
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,310
inside of Friday. We're still inside of
the previous week. We are still inside

3586
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:36,320
the previous week. We are still inside
 

3587
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,390
the previous week. We are still inside
of the previous week's value, but we are

3588
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:38,400
of the previous week's value, but we are
 

3589
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,430
of the previous week's value, but we are
moving daily value higher. We are trying

3590
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,440
moving daily value higher. We are trying
 

3591
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,669
moving daily value higher. We are trying
to find acceptance of daily value

3592
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:43,679
to find acceptance of daily value
 

3593
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,350
to find acceptance of daily value
higher.

3594
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:45,360
higher.
 

3595
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,430
higher.
Boom. Here we go, folks. Here comes the

3596
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,440
Boom. Here we go, folks. Here comes the
 

3597
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,270
Boom. Here we go, folks. Here comes the
lift. All right. So, you should get this

3598
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:49,280
lift. All right. So, you should get this
 

3599
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,030
lift. All right. So, you should get this
full TP. We should get into this gray

3600
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:51,040
full TP. We should get into this gray
 

3601
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,110
full TP. We should get into this gray
box and previous week point control. I

3602
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:53,120
box and previous week point control. I
 

3603
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,270
box and previous week point control. I
would say hold even if you are able to

3604
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280
would say hold even if you are able to
 

3605
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,270
would say hold even if you are able to
hold one micro in case you get all the

3606
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:57,280
hold one micro in case you get all the
 

3607
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,550
hold one micro in case you get all the
way up here and you can, you know, if

3608
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:58,560
way up here and you can, you know, if
 

3609
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,870
way up here and you can, you know, if
you get an expansion, right? If you get

3610
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:00,880
you get an expansion, right? If you get
 

3611
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,310
you get an expansion, right? If you get
an expansion candle, something like

3612
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:02,320
an expansion candle, something like
 

3613
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,550
an expansion candle, something like
that, just move your stop into here. You

3614
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
that, just move your stop into here. You
 

3615
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,470
that, just move your stop into here. You
never know in ca just in case they do

3616
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
never know in ca just in case they do
 

3617
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,790
never know in ca just in case they do
this move for you because even one micro

3618
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
this move for you because even one micro
 

3619
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,270
this move for you because even one micro
that's an extra $200 per account for

3620
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280
that's an extra $200 per account for
 

3621
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:17,669
that's an extra $200 per account for
you. All right,

3622
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:17,679

 

3623
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,350

Alex, I want to thank you for your daily

3624
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:19,360
Alex, I want to thank you for your daily
 

3625
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,110
Alex, I want to thank you for your daily
reminder of discipline. Happy New Year,

3626
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,120
reminder of discipline. Happy New Year,
 

3627
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:31,910
reminder of discipline. Happy New Year,
buddy. Happy New Year to you, my friend.

3628
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:31,920

 

3629
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,910

So at the end of the day with my opinion

3630
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:33,920
So at the end of the day with my opinion
 

3631
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,550
So at the end of the day with my opinion
about your methodology, is it all about

3632
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560
about your methodology, is it all about
 

3633
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,350
about your methodology, is it all about
liquidity and identifying value? Yeah.

3634
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:39,360
liquidity and identifying value? Yeah.
 

3635
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,229
liquidity and identifying value? Yeah.
Well, all the market's ever doing is

3636
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:42,239
Well, all the market's ever doing is
 

3637
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,390
Well, all the market's ever doing is
looking to identify value because that's

3638
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:44,400
looking to identify value because that's
 

3639
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,390
looking to identify value because that's
all any market does, right? It's looking

3640
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:46,400
all any market does, right? It's looking
 

3641
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,709
all any market does, right? It's looking
to see where buyers and sellers most

3642
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:48,719
to see where buyers and sellers most
 

3643
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,390
to see where buyers and sellers most
agree on price. And then if there's an

3644
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:50,400
agree on price. And then if there's an
 

3645
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,830
agree on price. And then if there's an
imbalance, if we have more buyers than

3646
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:51,840
imbalance, if we have more buyers than
 

3647
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,270
imbalance, if we have more buyers than
sellers, we're going to move up. we have

3648
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,280
sellers, we're going to move up. we have
 

3649
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,030
sellers, we're going to move up. we have
more sellers than buyers. We're going to

3650
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
more sellers than buyers. We're going to
 

3651
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,870
more sellers than buyers. We're going to
move down and search for a new level of

3652
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:56,880
move down and search for a new level of
 

3653
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,110
move down and search for a new level of
value. It's of my opinion that when

3654
01:23:59,110 --> 01:23:59,120
value. It's of my opinion that when
 

3655
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,709
value. It's of my opinion that when
we're searching for value, we are going

3656
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
we're searching for value, we are going
 

3657
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,990
we're searching for value, we are going
to run stops. ENQ especially is absolute

3658
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,000
to run stops. ENQ especially is absolute
 

3659
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,550
to run stops. ENQ especially is absolute
liquidity [\h__\h] right? It wants to run

3660
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
liquidity [\h__\h] right? It wants to run
 

3661
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,669
liquidity [\h__\h] right? It wants to run
for stops. So that's what we do. We

3662
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:09,679
for stops. So that's what we do. We
 

3663
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,070
for stops. So that's what we do. We
build, we are always in two phases of a

3664
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:12,080
build, we are always in two phases of a
 

3665
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,669
build, we are always in two phases of a
market. We are either building liquidity

3666
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:13,679
market. We are either building liquidity
 

3667
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,149
market. We are either building liquidity
when we're in contraction, which is

3668
01:24:16,149 --> 01:24:16,159
when we're in contraction, which is
 

3669
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,910
when we're in contraction, which is
arguably what we're in at the moment,

3670
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
arguably what we're in at the moment,
 

3671
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,430
arguably what we're in at the moment,
right? where we're squeezing tighter and

3672
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:19,440
right? where we're squeezing tighter and
 

3673
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,870
right? where we're squeezing tighter and
tighter and tighter and tighter and we

3674
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:20,880
tighter and tighter and tighter and we
 

3675
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,470
tighter and tighter and tighter and we
compress more and more and more volume.

3676
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:22,480
compress more and more and more volume.
 

3677
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,669
compress more and more and more volume.
And at some point, we're going to run

3678
01:24:23,669 --> 01:24:23,679
And at some point, we're going to run
 

3679
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,669
And at some point, we're going to run
stops at least one side of that, if not

3680
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:25,679
stops at least one side of that, if not
 

3681
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,149
stops at least one side of that, if not
both. And if we go into an expansion

3682
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:28,159
both. And if we go into an expansion
 

3683
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,149
both. And if we go into an expansion
model or a trend model, then we're going

3684
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:30,159
model or a trend model, then we're going
 

3685
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:31,990
model or a trend model, then we're going
to look for the next block of liquidity

3686
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
to look for the next block of liquidity
 

3687
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,030
to look for the next block of liquidity
to to go and attack into. And that's all

3688
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:35,040
to to go and attack into. And that's all
 

3689
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,189
to to go and attack into. And that's all
it is. So all we're doing as day traders

3690
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:37,199
it is. So all we're doing as day traders
 

3691
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,189
it is. So all we're doing as day traders
when we're trading futures is the same

3692
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:39,199
when we're trading futures is the same
 

3693
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,870
when we're trading futures is the same
as you do on swing, but you're you're

3694
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:40,880
as you do on swing, but you're you're
 

3695
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,870
as you do on swing, but you're you're
having to be, you know, a little bit

3696
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:42,880
having to be, you know, a little bit
 

3697
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,189
having to be, you know, a little bit
more precise and a little bit more

3698
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:45,199
more precise and a little bit more
 

3699
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:47,189
more precise and a little bit more
focused in because the rotations like

3700
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:47,199
focused in because the rotations like
 

3701
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,709
focused in because the rotations like
you've seen today can happen five 10

3702
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
you've seen today can happen five 10
 

3703
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:51,590
you've seen today can happen five 10
points or 20 point rotations. Um whereas

3704
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
points or 20 point rotations. Um whereas
 

3705
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,189
points or 20 point rotations. Um whereas
if you're like a set and forget on the

3706
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:53,199
if you're like a set and forget on the
 

3707
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:56,229
if you're like a set and forget on the
whole swing, right? Then we can look for

3708
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:56,239
whole swing, right? Then we can look for
 

3709
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,910
whole swing, right? Then we can look for
things like holding above previous days

3710
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920
things like holding above previous days
 

3711
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,750
things like holding above previous days
value area high, holding a bid at

3712
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:01,760
value area high, holding a bid at
 

3713
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,750
value area high, holding a bid at
previous week value area low, trying to

3714
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,760
previous week value area low, trying to
 

3715
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,470
previous week value area low, trying to
complete the rotation to the naked point

3716
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:06,480
complete the rotation to the naked point
 

3717
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,270
complete the rotation to the naked point
of control. All right, early in the

3718
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:09,280
of control. All right, early in the
 

3719
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,790
of control. All right, early in the
session. Okay, we get up there,

3720
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:10,800
session. Okay, we get up there,
 

3721
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,950
session. Okay, we get up there,
fantastic, job's done. Maybe then they

3722
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
fantastic, job's done. Maybe then they
 

3723
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,390
fantastic, job's done. Maybe then they
sell back down. If they don't and they

3724
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:14,400
sell back down. If they don't and they
 

3725
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,750
sell back down. If they don't and they
want to rebid it, then we're going to

3726
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:15,760
want to rebid it, then we're going to
 

3727
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,990
want to rebid it, then we're going to
come and test the other side. And I

3728
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:18,000
come and test the other side. And I
 

3729
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,510
come and test the other side. And I
would expect it to fail here. And we

3730
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:19,520
would expect it to fail here. And we
 

3731
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,270
would expect it to fail here. And we
don't fail there, then fantastic. means

3732
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:21,280
don't fail there, then fantastic. means
 

3733
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,470
don't fail there, then fantastic. means
we're going to auction up and we just

3734
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
we're going to auction up and we just
 

3735
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,990
we're going to auction up and we just
look for the next level higher and the

3736
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:24,000
look for the next level higher and the
 

3737
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,110
look for the next level higher and the
next level higher. That's all we do.

3738
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:27,120
next level higher. That's all we do.
 

3739
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,830
next level higher. That's all we do.
So what I ask myself every day is where

3740
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:29,840
So what I ask myself every day is where
 

3741
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,550
So what I ask myself every day is where
are the key levels, right? Where do I

3742
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:32,560
are the key levels, right? Where do I
 

3743
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,510
are the key levels, right? Where do I
want to trade around? So for me that

3744
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
want to trade around? So for me that
 

3745
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,590
want to trade around? So for me that
comes down to location. And the next

3746
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
comes down to location. And the next
 

3747
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,070
comes down to location. And the next
thing I ask myself is who's in control?

3748
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
thing I ask myself is who's in control?
 

3749
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,790
thing I ask myself is who's in control?
What is the momentum? That's that's kind

3750
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:42,800
What is the momentum? That's that's kind
 

3751
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:48,709
What is the momentum? That's that's kind
of it.

3752
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:48,719

 

3753
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,950

Grinding its way slowly. It is. That's

3754
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:50,960
Grinding its way slowly. It is. That's
 

3755
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,550
Grinding its way slowly. It is. That's
exactly what it's doing. Grinding its

3756
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
exactly what it's doing. Grinding its
 

3757
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,310
exactly what it's doing. Grinding its
way slowly. We came right into the edge

3758
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,320
way slowly. We came right into the edge
 

3759
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,910
way slowly. We came right into the edge
of this gray box. Look, we're right into

3760
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:55,920
of this gray box. Look, we're right into
 

3761
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,270
of this gray box. Look, we're right into
the edge of this gray box. I'd love them

3762
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,280
the edge of this gray box. I'd love them
 

3763
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,590
the edge of this gray box. I'd love them
to come and tap this. I think this is

3764
01:25:59,590 --> 01:25:59,600
to come and tap this. I think this is
 

3765
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,189
to come and tap this. I think this is
accurate. I mean, according to Trading

3766
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,199
accurate. I mean, according to Trading
 

3767
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,590
accurate. I mean, according to Trading
View, it's accurate. Who knows? Maybe

3768
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
View, it's accurate. Who knows? Maybe
 

3769
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,590
View, it's accurate. Who knows? Maybe
Ninja has it somewhere else. But, uh,

3770
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:05,600
Ninja has it somewhere else. But, uh,
 

3771
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,110
Ninja has it somewhere else. But, uh,
it's here or hereabouts, right? This

3772
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:07,120
it's here or hereabouts, right? This
 

3773
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,629
it's here or hereabouts, right? This
gray box is point of control. Maybe it's

3774
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
gray box is point of control. Maybe it's
 

3775
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,149
gray box is point of control. Maybe it's
here. Maybe it's here. But this is where

3776
01:26:10,149 --> 01:26:10,159
here. Maybe it's here. But this is where
 

3777
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,910
here. Maybe it's here. But this is where
I have the exact line. But that's why I

3778
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:11,920
I have the exact line. But that's why I
 

3779
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:20,070
I have the exact line. But that's why I
put this gray box out here.

3780
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:20,080

 

3781
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,590

momentum trader. It's reversing from

3782
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
momentum trader. It's reversing from
 

3783
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,830
momentum trader. It's reversing from
here. I mean, it can get stuck up here.

3784
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:23,840
here. I mean, it can get stuck up here.
 

3785
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,189
here. I mean, it can get stuck up here.
I'm not I've not seen enough yet to say

3786
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:27,199
I'm not I've not seen enough yet to say
 

3787
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:30,229
I'm not I've not seen enough yet to say
that it's done, but it's an area where

3788
01:26:30,229 --> 01:26:30,239
that it's done, but it's an area where
 

3789
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:32,870
that it's done, but it's an area where
they might want to sell from. There's I

3790
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:32,880
they might want to sell from. There's I
 

3791
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,310
they might want to sell from. There's I
would not deny that. That's why we have

3792
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320
would not deny that. That's why we have
 

3793
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:39,590
would not deny that. That's why we have
it marked out.

3794
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:39,600

 

3795
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,350

Just remember how you built liquidity on

3796
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
Just remember how you built liquidity on
 

3797
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,189
Just remember how you built liquidity on
the way up. So, you're going to need it

3798
01:26:43,189 --> 01:26:43,199
the way up. So, you're going to need it
 

3799
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:46,310
the way up. So, you're going to need it
to, if I was going to be in a sell,

3800
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
to, if I was going to be in a sell,
 

3801
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,709
to, if I was going to be in a sell,
right, I would want a fail breakout with

3802
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:48,719
right, I would want a fail breakout with
 

3803
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,229
right, I would want a fail breakout with
some, you know, exposure of buyers

3804
01:26:52,229 --> 01:26:52,239
some, you know, exposure of buyers
 

3805
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,629
some, you know, exposure of buyers
caught up at the highs and then a move

3806
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:54,639
caught up at the highs and then a move
 

3807
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,510
caught up at the highs and then a move
back down. Um, this flat top here, we

3808
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:57,520
back down. Um, this flat top here, we
 

3809
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,350
back down. Um, this flat top here, we
can have a look how much buying was in

3810
01:26:59,350 --> 01:26:59,360
can have a look how much buying was in
 

3811
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,430
can have a look how much buying was in
there.

3812
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:01,440
there.
 

3813
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,830
there.
It's a decent amount.

3814
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:03,840
It's a decent amount.
 

3815
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,669
It's a decent amount.
There's a decent amount. The excess,

3816
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:05,679
There's a decent amount. The excess,
 

3817
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,510
There's a decent amount. The excess,
let's have a look on my other screen. We

3818
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:07,520
let's have a look on my other screen. We
 

3819
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,350
let's have a look on my other screen. We
have a little excess into 90. I wouldn't

3820
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:09,360
have a little excess into 90. I wouldn't
 

3821
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,550
have a little excess into 90. I wouldn't
say it's the biggest, but it's okay.

3822
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
say it's the biggest, but it's okay.
 

3823
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,830
say it's the biggest, but it's okay.
Okay. And we've seen that transition

3824
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:11,840
Okay. And we've seen that transition
 

3825
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,790
Okay. And we've seen that transition
from buy side to del to sell side.

3826
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:16,800
from buy side to del to sell side.
 

3827
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,390
from buy side to del to sell side.
I would rather it comes, you know, it

3828
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:18,400
I would rather it comes, you know, it
 

3829
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,870
I would rather it comes, you know, it
has one more shove up, but we built lots

3830
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:20,880
has one more shove up, but we built lots
 

3831
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,070
has one more shove up, but we built lots
of liquidity to run,

3832
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:24,080
of liquidity to run,
 

3833
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,830
of liquidity to run,
right? And what we'd really like is like

3834
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:25,840
right? And what we'd really like is like
 

3835
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,430
right? And what we'd really like is like
something like a big shelf developed

3836
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,440
something like a big shelf developed
 

3837
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,590
something like a big shelf developed
here. So, if we have something like this

3838
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:29,600
here. So, if we have something like this
 

3839
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,990
here. So, if we have something like this
developed here, right, and we get above

3840
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,000
developed here, right, and we get above
 

3841
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,990
developed here, right, and we get above
it and we see buyers come flying in and

3842
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:34,000
it and we see buyers come flying in and
 

3843
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,229
it and we see buyers come flying in and
then we get stuck under that shelf,

3844
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,239
then we get stuck under that shelf,
 

3845
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:37,510
then we get stuck under that shelf,
under that shelf would be here, wouldn't

3846
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
under that shelf would be here, wouldn't
 

3847
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,350
under that shelf would be here, wouldn't
it? Then we can look for a cell and it'

3848
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:39,360
it? Then we can look for a cell and it'
 

3849
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,870
it? Then we can look for a cell and it'
be TP1, TP2, TP3. Might well be that it

3850
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:42,880
be TP1, TP2, TP3. Might well be that it
 

3851
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,709
be TP1, TP2, TP3. Might well be that it
fades from here, but uh you know, you

3852
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719
fades from here, but uh you know, you
 

3853
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,030
fades from here, but uh you know, you
have to respect all these levels that we

3854
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,040
have to respect all these levels that we
 

3855
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,629
have to respect all these levels that we
built out. This node here is

3856
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:48,639
built out. This node here is
 

3857
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,149
built out. This node here is
interesting. I'd rather it comes up

3858
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
interesting. I'd rather it comes up
 

3859
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:51,990
interesting. I'd rather it comes up
higher. Like I said, one more shove and

3860
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:52,000
higher. Like I said, one more shove and
 

3861
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,149
higher. Like I said, one more shove and
then build out a shelf and then use all

3862
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:54,159
then build out a shelf and then use all
 

3863
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:58,870
then build out a shelf and then use all
those late buyers to go lower.

3864
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:58,880

 

3865
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,310

Is the footprint on Trading View? That

3866
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:00,320
Is the footprint on Trading View? That
 

3867
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,310
Is the footprint on Trading View? That
that one I just showed you is yes, it's

3868
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:02,320
that one I just showed you is yes, it's
 

3869
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,790
that one I just showed you is yes, it's
on Trading View. At the moment, we're

3870
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:04,800
on Trading View. At the moment, we're
 

3871
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,110
on Trading View. At the moment, we're
holding a buy side imbalance in 60. So

3872
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:07,120
holding a buy side imbalance in 60. So
 

3873
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,470
holding a buy side imbalance in 60. So
if you remember where we had that big

3874
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:08,480
if you remember where we had that big
 

3875
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,950
if you remember where we had that big
seller, he was at 60, right? Remember

3876
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:10,960
seller, he was at 60, right? Remember
 

3877
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,550
seller, he was at 60, right? Remember
over here? So there's a huge seller at

3878
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:12,560
over here? So there's a huge seller at
 

3879
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,310
over here? So there's a huge seller at
60. We need to get back above that. Once

3880
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:14,320
60. We need to get back above that. Once
 

3881
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,310
60. We need to get back above that. Once
we got above him, we ran it. We have a

3882
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:16,320
we got above him, we ran it. We have a
 

3883
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,510
we got above him, we ran it. We have a
buy side imbalance here that we're

3884
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:17,520
buy side imbalance here that we're
 

3885
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,590
buy side imbalance here that we're
trying to hold. If we fail that, we're

3886
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
trying to hold. If we fail that, we're
 

3887
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,030
trying to hold. If we fail that, we're
coming back to value. If they don't bid

3888
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:21,040
coming back to value. If they don't bid
 

3889
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,709
coming back to value. If they don't bid
value, we will go rotation. If they bid

3890
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
value, we will go rotation. If they bid
 

3891
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,030
value, we will go rotation. If they bid
value, they've still got a shot. We're

3892
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:25,040
value, they've still got a shot. We're
 

3893
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:30,390
value, they've still got a shot. We're
walking value up. Remember,

3894
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:30,400

 

3895
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,070

it's the first time I've seen failed

3896
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
it's the first time I've seen failed
 

3897
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,750
it's the first time I've seen failed
followthrough up there. Don't like the

3898
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:33,760
followthrough up there. Don't like the
 

3899
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,750
followthrough up there. Don't like the
high, but it is the first time we've

3900
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:35,760
high, but it is the first time we've
 

3901
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,070
high, but it is the first time we've
seen failed follow through.

3902
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,080
seen failed follow through.
 

3903
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,990
seen failed follow through.
I wouldn't say that high is the best in

3904
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:40,000
I wouldn't say that high is the best in
 

3905
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,830
I wouldn't say that high is the best in
terms of excess. I think ES's one looks

3906
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:41,840
terms of excess. I think ES's one looks
 

3907
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,310
terms of excess. I think ES's one looks
much better.

3908
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:46,320

 

3909
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,310

Yeah, I agree, Peter. Like the volume is

3910
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
Yeah, I agree, Peter. Like the volume is
 

3911
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,470
Yeah, I agree, Peter. Like the volume is
so low. I was expecting it to like come

3912
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
so low. I was expecting it to like come
 

3913
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,709
so low. I was expecting it to like come
back on and turn on today. It's very

3914
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:52,719
back on and turn on today. It's very
 

3915
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,310
back on and turn on today. It's very
low.

3916
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,320
low.
 

3917
01:28:54,320 --> 01:29:23,590
low.
Very low.

3918
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:23,600

 

3919
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,590

All right, folks.

3920
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:27,600

Not seeing it, bud. Do you mind doing it

3934

Not seeing it, bud. Do you mind doing it

3959
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,870
to you now, dude. Okay, they're still
trying to hold value. You want to be

3960
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:52,880
trying to hold value. You want to be
 

3961
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,870
trying to hold value. You want to be
careful if pushes start to fail here.

3962
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:54,880
careful if pushes start to fail here.
 

3963
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,110
careful if pushes start to fail here.
All right, so they will try. Buyers want

3964

All right, so they will try. Buyers want
 

3965
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,750
All right, so they will try. Buyers want
to hold value and complete this move. If

3966
01:30:59,750 --> 01:30:59,760
to hold value and complete this move. If
 

3967
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,430
to hold value and complete this move. If
you see a push that fails and we come

3968
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:01,440
you see a push that fails and we come
 

3969
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,430
you see a push that fails and we come
under value, this move here can

3970
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:03,440
under value, this move here can
 

3971
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,669
under value, this move here can
collapse. I'm just going to reply to uh

3972
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:05,679
collapse. I'm just going to reply to uh
 

3973

01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:50,800
later, but they messaged me about that a
 

4031
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,629
later, but they messaged me about that a
couple weeks ago. It's finally just gone

01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:52,639
couple weeks ago. It's finally just gone
 

4033
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:56,870

Okay, so getting stuck like we just

4036
01:32:58,550 --> 01:32:58,560
Okay, so getting stuck like we just
 

4037
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,629
Okay, so getting stuck like we just
talked about at this shelf. All right,

4038
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:00,639
talked about at this shelf. All right,
 

4039
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,310
talked about at this shelf. All right,
we've developed a bit of a shelf up here

4040
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:02,320
we've developed a bit of a shelf up here
 

4041
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,750
we've developed a bit of a shelf up here
that buyers are not able to get

4042
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,760
that buyers are not able to get
 

4043
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,310
that buyers are not able to get
acceptance back above right now. We're

4044
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:06,320
acceptance back above right now. We're
 

4045
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,070
acceptance back above right now. We're
starting to see that potential rotation

4046
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,080
starting to see that potential rotation
 

4047
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,470
starting to see that potential rotation
back down to VWAP off the IB trade. It

4048
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:10,480
back down to VWAP off the IB trade. It
 

4049
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,510
back down to VWAP off the IB trade. It
is possible. I'm still a little bit iffy

4050
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:13,520
is possible. I'm still a little bit iffy
 

4051
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:16,629
is possible. I'm still a little bit iffy
on it yet, if I'm honest, just because

4052
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:16,639
on it yet, if I'm honest, just because
 

4053
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,550
on it yet, if I'm honest, just because
we've moved PC up, everything's moving

4054
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,560
we've moved PC up, everything's moving
 

4055
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,830
we've moved PC up, everything's moving
up. I just would like to see it trade

4056
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:21,840
up. I just would like to see it trade
 

4057

4095
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,830

What levels are the downside and how to

4096
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:09,840
What levels are the downside and how to
 

4097
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,590
What levels are the downside and how to
find them if you can, Alex? Well, if

4098
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:11,600
find them if you can, Alex? Well, if
 

4099
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,510

you're looking for a downside, so if
 

4101
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,669
you're looking for a downside, so if
you're in a balance day, if we're going

4102
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:15,679
you're in a balance day, if we're going
 

4103
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,430
you're in a balance day, if we're going
to fail initial balance, if you're going

01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:17,440
to fail initial balance, if you're going
 

4105
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,950

01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:26,550
you're fading this, I'd be first of all,
I'm looking for 40s. Acceptance under

4114
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:26,560
I'm looking for 40s. Acceptance under
 

4115
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,189
I'm looking for 40s. Acceptance under
40s, 20s, acceptance under that, back

4116
01:34:29,189 --> 01:34:29,199
40s, 20s, acceptance under that, back
 

4117
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,189
40s, 20s, acceptance under that, back
down into the 600s again. Acceptance

4118
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:31,199
down into the 600s again. Acceptance
 

4119
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,590
down into the 600s again. Acceptance
under that value area low on the day

4120
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:33,600
under that value area low on the day
 

4121
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,510
under that value area low on the day
down here, 84s. Um, and you don't think

4122
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:37,520
down here, 84s. Um, and you don't think
 

4123
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,990
down here, 84s. Um, and you don't think
about anything beyond that unless you're

4124
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,000
about anything beyond that unless you're
 

4125
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,310
about anything beyond that unless you're
going to find acceptance under previous

4126
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:42,320
going to find acceptance under previous
 

4127
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,669
going to find acceptance under previous
days value. Right? At the moment, we're

4128
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:45,679
days value. Right? At the moment, we're
 

4129
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:47,990
days value. Right? At the moment, we're
not seeing that. At the moment, we're

4130
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,000
not seeing that. At the moment, we're
 

4131
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,910
not seeing that. At the moment, we're
getting this. Right? So, we've come from

4132
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:49,920
getting this. Right? So, we've come from
 

4133
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,830
getting this. Right? So, we've come from
one side, grind up to the other side. If

4134
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:51,840
one side, grind up to the other side. If
 

4135
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,350
one side, grind up to the other side. If
we don't find acceptance up here, we're

4136
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:53,360
we don't find acceptance up here, we're
 

4137
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:54,709
we don't find acceptance up here, we're

trade from here to here. For me
 

4221
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,950
trade from here to here. For me
personally, I don't really like all it

4222
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:54,960
personally, I don't really like all it
 

4223
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,189
personally, I don't really like all it
is, folks, is that we don't have excess

4224
01:36:57,189 --> 01:36:57,199
is, folks, is that we don't have excess
 

4225
01:36:57,199 --> 01:37:00,310
is, folks, is that we don't have excess
up here, right? That's all I don't like.

4226
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:00,320
up here, right? That's all I don't like.
 

4227
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,270
up here, right? That's all I don't like.
What I like to see is

4228
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:03,280
What I like to see is
 

4229
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,830
What I like to see is
a nice big bullish candle up here with

4230
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:05,840
a nice big bullish candle up here with
 

4231
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,830
a nice big bullish candle up here with
tons of buyers trapped in and then

4232
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:07,840
tons of buyers trapped in and then
 

4233
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,189
tons of buyers trapped in and then
seeing the transition. We did have

4234
01:37:09,189 --> 01:37:09,199
seeing the transition. We did have
 

4235
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:10,870
seeing the transition. We did have
buying in here and we saw a transition.

4236
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:10,880
buying in here and we saw a transition.
 

4237
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,109
buying in here and we saw a transition.
There is no doubt about it. And we held

4238
01:37:13,109 --> 01:37:13,119
There is no doubt about it. And we held
 

4239
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,870
There is no doubt about it. And we held
this imbalance. like sellers are in

4240
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:14,880
this imbalance. like sellers are in
 

4241
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,709
this imbalance. like sellers are in
control here, but it just feels like

4242
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:16,719
control here, but it just feels like
 

4243
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:19,109
control here, but it just feels like
nothing more than a pullback to fill

4244
01:37:19,109 --> 01:37:19,119
nothing more than a pullback to fill
 

4245
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,750
nothing more than a pullback to fill
some imbalance. And uh yeah, I'm not

4246
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:21,760
some imbalance. And uh yeah, I'm not
 

4247
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,910
some imbalance. And uh yeah, I'm not
sure yet. It doesn't feel high, how can

4248
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:23,920
sure yet. It doesn't feel high, how can
 

4249
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,590
sure yet. It doesn't feel high, how can
I put this? It doesn't feel high

4250
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:25,600
I put this? It doesn't feel high
 

4251
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,270
I put this? It doesn't feel high
probability to me when there's a low

4252
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:27,280
probability to me when there's a low
 

4253
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,830
probability to me when there's a low
hanging fruit above without excess. It

4254
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:29,840
hanging fruit above without excess. It
 

4255
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,030
hanging fruit above without excess. It
looks pretty good on ES, I would say.

4256
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:33,040
looks pretty good on ES, I would say.
 

4257
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,109
looks pretty good on ES, I would say.
But bulls are still in control. If you

4258
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:35,119
But bulls are still in control. If you
 

4259
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,030
But bulls are still in control. If you
moved to like a five minute chart, do I

4260
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
moved to like a five minute chart, do I
 

4261
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,950
moved to like a five minute chart, do I
have it on here? You will see that balls

4262
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:38,960
have it on here? You will see that balls
 

4263
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,350
have it on here? You will see that balls
are still in control.

4264
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:41,360
are still in control.
 

4265
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:46,629
are still in control.
We move this off.

4266
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639

 

4267
01:37:46,639 --> 01:38:06,709

There we go.

4268
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:06,719

 

4269
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:07,910

I'm a bit worried I'm going to have to

4270
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
I'm a bit worried I'm going to have to
 

4271
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,990
I'm a bit worried I'm going to have to
take this IWC in for a service and I've

4272
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,000
take this IWC in for a service and I've
 

4273
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,229
take this IWC in for a service and I've
only had it 18 months.

4274
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:14,239

 

4275
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:17,430

One of the pins in this

4276
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:17,440
One of the pins in this
 

4277
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,109
One of the pins in this
is loose and I'm worried I'm going to

4278
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:19,119
is loose and I'm worried I'm going to
 

4279
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,109
is loose and I'm worried I'm going to
wear it one day and it's suddenly I'm

4280
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:21,119
wear it one day and it's suddenly I'm
 

4281
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,470
wear it one day and it's suddenly I'm
going to look down and it's not on my

4282
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:22,480
going to look down and it's not on my
 

4283
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,390
going to look down and it's not on my
wrist.

4284
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:24,400
wrist.
 

4285
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:36,229
wrist.
I can bang that in.

4286
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239

 

4287
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,910

Sellers need to get below the New York

4288
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:37,920
Sellers need to get below the New York
 

4289
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:53,830
Sellers need to get below the New York
open. Yeah, I would agree with that.

4290
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:53,840

 

4291
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,910

this [\h__\h] strap on the IWC. Honestly,

4292
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:55,920
this [\h__\h] strap on the IWC. Honestly,
 

4293
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,910
this [\h__\h] strap on the IWC. Honestly,
it's a ridiculously expensive watch. And

4294
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:57,920
it's a ridiculously expensive watch. And
 

4295
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,430

4427
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,830
think healthc care is due like a a lift
and bump. Here we go. So, they're

4428
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:07,840
and bump. Here we go. So, they're
 

4429
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,030
and bump. Here we go. So, they're
finding a bid here. They want to come

4430
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:09,040
finding a bid here. They want to come
 

4431
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,709
finding a bid here. They want to come
back for this if they can

4432
01:44:12,709 --> 01:44:12,719
back for this if they can
 

4433
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,950
back for this if they can
see if they lift up and go for it. If we

4434
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:14,960
see if they lift up and go for it. If we
 

4435
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,550
see if they lift up and go for it. If we
see failed follow through to this shelf

4436
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:16,560
see failed follow through to this shelf
 

4437
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,229
see failed follow through to this shelf
again. So this shelf here is what's

4438
01:44:18,229 --> 01:44:18,239
again. So this shelf here is what's
 

4439
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:20,950
again. So this shelf here is what's
holding price. This is your overunder.

4440
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:20,960
holding price. This is your overunder.

01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,470
holding price. This is your overunder.
If you're short, this is your overunder.

01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,350
Like you need this to hold
that gray box. They did just try and

4446
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,360
that gray box. They did just try and
 

4447
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,189
that gray box. They did just try and
aggressively buy that and get hit. So

4448
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:29,199
aggressively buy that and get hit. So
 

4449
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:31,030
aggressively buy that and get hit. So
there's passive sellers sitting in that

4450
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:31,040
there's passive sellers sitting in that
 

4451
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,790
there's passive sellers sitting in that
gray box right now. And you can see them

01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:32,800
gray box right now. And you can see them
 

4453
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,590
gray box right now. And you can see them
on the book at 70. My my issue would be

4454
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:35,600
on the book at 70. My my issue would be
 

4455
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,430
on the book at 70. My my issue would be
if they lift through that, you are going

4456
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:37,440
if they lift through that, you are going
 

4457
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,430
if they lift through that, you are going
to go 700. Right? If they get through

4458
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,440
to go 700. Right? If they get through
 

4459
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,750
to go 700. Right? If they get through
that gray box, I don't think you want to

4460
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:41,760
that gray box, I don't think you want to
 

4461
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,109
that gray box, I don't think you want to
sit through this short. So, if you took

4462
01:44:43,109 --> 01:44:43,119
sit through this short. So, if you took
 

4463
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,590
sit through this short. So, if you took
this short here or this short here, you

4464
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:45,600
this short here or this short here, you
 

4465
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,350
this short here or this short here, you
should be covering some and looking for

4466
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:47,360
should be covering some and looking for
 

4467
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,430
should be covering some and looking for
a continuation. If you see this, you

4468
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:49,440
a continuation. If you see this, you
 

4469
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,910
a continuation. If you see this, you
want to be out. Don't risk hive day cuz

4470
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:51,920
want to be out. Don't risk hive day cuz

it's more likely we're going to take out

4472
01:44:53,669 --> 01:44:53,679
it's more likely we're going to take out
 

4473
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:57,189
it's more likely we're going to take out
the PC at that point.

4474
01:44:57,189 --> 01:44:57,199
the PC at that point.
 

4475
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:59,590
the PC at that point.

be stubborn.
Someone's playing games on the tape now

Do I use market or limit orders? Uh
limit orders to get in wherever

4500
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,440
limit orders to get in wherever
 

4501
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,109
limit orders to get in wherever
possible. If I can get on a pullback,

4502
01:45:35,109 --> 01:45:35,119
possible. If I can get on a pullback,
 

4503
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:38,390
possible. If I can get on a pullback,
I'm using limits. If I'm forced to take

4504
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:38,400
I'm using limits. If I'm forced to take
 

4505
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,310
I'm using limits. If I'm forced to take
a break above a candle and I know that

4506
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:40,320
a break above a candle and I know that
 

4507
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,709
a break above a candle and I know that
it's still good RR, I will mark it in.

4508
01:45:42,709 --> 01:45:42,719
it's still good RR, I will mark it in.
 

4509
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:45,669
it's still good RR, I will mark it in.
Um, I will add, normally I'll limit in

4510
01:45:45,669 --> 01:45:45,679
Um, I will add, normally I'll limit in
 

4511
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:47,430
Um, I will add, normally I'll limit in
my first position, I'll add on a market

4512
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:47,440
my first position, I'll add on a market
 

4513
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,590
my first position, I'll add on a market
because it means it's going in my way.

4514
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:49,600
because it means it's going in my way.
 

4515
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,910
because it means it's going in my way.
Um, I will exit with limits at key

4516
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:51,920
Um, I will exit with limits at key
 

4517
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,990
Um, I will exit with limits at key
levels, but I will drag my limits down.

4518
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:54,000
levels, but I will drag my limits down.
 

4519
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,510
levels, but I will drag my limits down.
If I feel like I'm not getting filled, I

4520
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:55,520
If I feel like I'm not getting filled, I
 

4521
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,030
If I feel like I'm not getting filled, I
will drag my limit down. So, for

4522
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:57,040
will drag my limit down. So, for
 

4523
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:00,310
will drag my limit down. So, for
example, if if I was long, right, and I

4524
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:00,320
example, if if I was long, right, and I
 

4525
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,750
example, if if I was long, right, and I
had a limit up there and I was long from

4526
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:01,760
had a limit up there and I was long from
 

4527
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,590
had a limit up there and I was long from
down here and I saw this not coming, I

4528
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:03,600
down here and I saw this not coming, I
 

4529
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,750
down here and I saw this not coming, I
will drag that limit there to get filled

4530
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:05,760
will drag that limit there to get filled
 

4531
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,350
will drag that limit there to get filled
basically on a market fill or I'll just

4532
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:07,360
basically on a market fill or I'll just
 

4533
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,510
basically on a market fill or I'll just
drag it below it so I get a quick fill.

4534
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:09,520
drag it below it so I get a quick fill.
 

4535
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,790
drag it below it so I get a quick fill.
I always have my limit staggered where I

4536
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:12,800
I always have my limit staggered where I
 

4537
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,510
I always have my limit staggered where I
want. So, maybe I had a limit here, a

4538
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:15,520
want. So, maybe I had a limit here, a
 

4539
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,149
want. So, maybe I had a limit here, a
limit here, and a limit above. And let's

4540
01:46:18,149 --> 01:46:18,159
limit here, and a limit above. And let's
 

4541
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:19,590
limit here, and a limit above. And let's
say I was long down here. So, we hit

4542
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:19,600
say I was long down here. So, we hit
 

4543
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,149
say I was long down here. So, we hit
that one. We missed this. I can drag my

4544
01:46:22,149 --> 01:46:22,159
that one. We missed this. I can drag my
 

4545
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:23,910
that one. We missed this. I can drag my
limit below and get filled on one of

4546
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:23,920
limit below and get filled on one of
 

4547
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,990
limit below and get filled on one of
them. And maybe I have one left with an

4548
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:26,000
them. And maybe I have one left with an
 

4549
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,470
them. And maybe I have one left with an
entry price of there. For example, I'm

4550
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:28,480
entry price of there. For example, I'm
 

4551
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,910
entry price of there. For example, I'm
not in a position now. I want to make

4552
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:29,920
not in a position now. I want to make
 

4553
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:43,750
not in a position now. I want to make
that clear.

4554
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:43,760

 

4555
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:46,709

Yeah, I saw United have sacked him.

4556
01:46:46,709 --> 01:46:46,719
Yeah, I saw United have sacked him.
 

4557
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:48,310
Yeah, I saw United have sacked him.
I mean, who they Here's the bigger

4558
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:48,320
I mean, who they Here's the bigger
 

4559
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,669
I mean, who they Here's the bigger
question. Who they going to replace him

4560
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:49,679
question. Who they going to replace him
 

4561
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,750
question. Who they going to replace him
with? You just spent all your [\h__\h]

01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:51,760
with? You just spent all your [\h__\h]
 

4563
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,910
with? You just spent all your [\h__\h]
money on a load of [\h__\h] players and

4564
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:53,920
money on a load of [\h__\h] players and
 

4565
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,990
money on a load of [\h__\h] players and
they've sacked your [\h__\h] coach. No one

4566
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:56,000
they've sacked your [\h__\h] coach. No one
 

4567
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,629
they've sacked your [\h__\h] coach. No one
wants to go to that club.

4568
01:46:58,629 --> 01:46:58,639
wants to go to that club.
 

4569
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:01,189
wants to go to that club.
Like

4570
01:47:01,189 --> 01:47:01,199
Like
 

4571
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:03,270
Like
obviously I hate United but I actually

4572
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:03,280
obviously I hate United but I actually
 

4573
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,510
obviously I hate United but I actually
want them to be half decent. I think

4574
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:05,520
want them to be half decent. I think
 

4575
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,910
want them to be half decent. I think
it's healthy for English football. This

4576
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:07,920
it's healthy for English football. This
 

4577
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:09,270
it's healthy for English football. This
looks like it wants to lift. They are

4578
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:09,280
looks like it wants to lift. They are
 

4579
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,270
looks like it wants to lift. They are
getting aggressive here up here into

4580
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:11,280
getting aggressive here up here into
 

4581
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,790
getting aggressive here up here into
60s.

4582
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:12,800
60s.
 

4583
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,590
60s.
Yes. Trying to do a flag break as well.

4584
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:17,600

 

4585
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:22,870

Uh yes, I do use a ATM strategy. Yeah.

4586
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:22,880

 

4587
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,910

Do I have a minimum RR? Not really. Um

4588
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:25,920
Do I have a minimum RR? Not really. Um
 

4589
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,350
Do I have a minimum RR? Not really. Um
like I look for honestly the way I trade

4590
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:29,360
like I look for honestly the way I trade
 

4591
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,109
like I look for honestly the way I trade
it's more about high probability. Do I

4592
01:47:31,109 --> 01:47:31,119
it's more about high probability. Do I
 

4593
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:32,390
it's more about high probability. Do I
think we're going to go to a level like

4594
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:32,400
think we're going to go to a level like
 

4595
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,070
think we're going to go to a level like
one I don't really like trading

4596
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:34,080
one I don't really like trading
 

4597
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,990
one I don't really like trading
negatively. It's not something I'd ever

4598
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:36,000
negatively. It's not something I'd ever
 

4599
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,430
negatively. It's not something I'd ever
look for. I know lots of other people

4600
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:37,440
look for. I know lots of other people
 

4601
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,350
look for. I know lots of other people
do, but the more you tune in here,

4602
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:39,360
do, but the more you tune in here,
 

4603
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,109
do, but the more you tune in here,
you'll see that I'm normally looking for

4604
01:47:41,109 --> 01:47:41,119
you'll see that I'm normally looking for
 

4605
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,430
you'll see that I'm normally looking for
50 to 100 point trades because I think

4606
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:43,440
50 to 100 point trades because I think
 

4607
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,109
50 to 100 point trades because I think
ENQ most of the time will make those

4608
01:47:45,109 --> 01:47:45,119
ENQ most of the time will make those
 

4609
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:46,550
ENQ most of the time will make those
available. So even if you think about

4610
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:46,560
available. So even if you think about
 

4611
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,750
available. So even if you think about
what we got today, what was our RR

4612
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:49,760
what we got today, what was our RR
 

4613
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:54,790
what we got today, what was our RR
today? So we were short

4614
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:54,800

 

4615
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:59,030

in here for this move down into here and

4616
01:47:59,030 --> 01:47:59,040
in here for this move down into here and
 

4617
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,950
in here for this move down into here and
we would have been risking the top of

4618
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:00,960
we would have been risking the top of
 

4619
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,430
we would have been risking the top of
this volume. So it's like a five R there

4620
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:03,440
this volume. So it's like a five R there
 

4621
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,350
this volume. So it's like a five R there
if you want to do it our ways. And then

4622
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:05,360
if you want to do it our ways. And then
 

4623
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,510
if you want to do it our ways. And then
the other way around we were playing dip

4624
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:07,520
the other way around we were playing dip
 

4625
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:11,030
the other way around we were playing dip
longs and adding into them. So our

4626
01:48:11,030 --> 01:48:11,040
longs and adding into them. So our
 

4627
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,270
longs and adding into them. So our
average did move

4628
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:13,280
average did move
 

4629
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:17,109
average did move
but dip longs

4630
01:48:17,109 --> 01:48:17,119

 

4631
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:19,430

back up to here. And we were adding over

4632
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:19,440
back up to here. And we were adding over
 

4633
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,070
back up to here. And we were adding over
600s, remember, as well. And some of you

4634
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:22,080
600s, remember, as well. And some of you
 

4635
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,109
600s, remember, as well. And some of you
are still in it. I'm not in there

4636
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:23,119
are still in it. I'm not in there
 

4637
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:28,550
are still in it. I'm not in there
anymore.

4638
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:28,560

 

4639
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,790

And this is your new shelf between this

4640
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:30,800
And this is your new shelf between this
 

4641
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,390
And this is your new shelf between this
gray box. You can see this gray box

4642
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:32,400
gray box. You can see this gray box
 

4643
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,950
gray box. You can see this gray box
acting as resistance and this box here

4644
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:34,960
acting as resistance and this box here
 

4645
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,470
acting as resistance and this box here
acting as support. These are your

4646
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:36,480
acting as support. These are your
 

4647
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,189
acting as support. These are your
rotations. Basically, 50s to 70s, 20

4648
01:48:39,189 --> 01:48:39,199
rotations. Basically, 50s to 70s, 20
 

4649
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:41,510
rotations. Basically, 50s to 70s, 20
point rotations right now. You're not

4650
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,520

to buy. The best area to buy was those
 

4685
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,950

value area lows that we talked about

01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
and reasons? Yes, I can make it really
 

4835
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,310
and reasons? Yes, I can make it really
simple because we went over it in here

4836
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:34,320
simple because we went over it in here
 

4837
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:37,830
simple because we went over it in here
first. Okay, so we were talking about

4838
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:37,840
first. Okay, so we were talking about
 

4839
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,550
first. Okay, so we were talking about
we were in uh developing a wedge. All

4840
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:40,560
we were in uh developing a wedge. All
 

4841
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:43,030
we were in uh developing a wedge. All
right, and we can notice this volume

4842
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:43,040
right, and we can notice this volume
 

4843
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,629
right, and we can notice this volume
node here. If I zoom this in, this

4844
01:52:44,629 --> 01:52:44,639
node here. If I zoom this in, this
 

4845
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:47,510
node here. If I zoom this in, this
volume node here is 600s. So if we found

4846
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:47,520
volume node here is 600s. So if we found
 

4847
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,430
volume node here is 600s. So if we found
acceptance above 600s, we were looking

4848
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:49,440
acceptance above 600s, we were looking
 

4849
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,070
acceptance above 600s, we were looking
for a squeeze out to 700s. I also said

4850
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:52,080
for a squeeze out to 700s. I also said
 

4851
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,510
for a squeeze out to 700s. I also said
you have to be very careful of a look

4852
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:53,520
you have to be very careful of a look
 

4853
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,229
you have to be very careful of a look
above and fail. Um where do I draw? So

4854
01:52:56,229 --> 01:52:56,239
above and fail. Um where do I draw? So
 

4855
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:57,510
above and fail. Um where do I draw? So
these are the moves I drew out this

4856
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:57,520
these are the moves I drew out this
 

4857
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,870
these are the moves I drew out this
morning and that was then followed by

4858
01:53:00,870 --> 01:53:00,880
morning and that was then followed by
 

4859
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:04,229
morning and that was then followed by
D. Watch the edges remain flexible.

4860
01:53:04,229 --> 01:53:04,239
D. Watch the edges remain flexible.
 

4861
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:06,950
D. Watch the edges remain flexible.
There is a shelf at 600. So those whole

4862
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:06,960
There is a shelf at 600. So those whole
 

4863
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,390
There is a shelf at 600. So those whole
numbers are pretty nice over under

4864
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,400
numbers are pretty nice over under
 

4865
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,870
numbers are pretty nice over under
levels today. Hold 500, test 600, hold

4866
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:10,880
levels today. Hold 500, test 600, hold
 

4867
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,950
levels today. Hold 500, test 600, hold
700. But

4868
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:12,960
700. But
 

4869
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,870
700. But
be aware that should say of a look above

4870
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:14,880
be aware that should say of a look above
 

4871
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,629
be aware that should say of a look above
and fail of each level. So if we go back

4872
01:53:16,629 --> 01:53:16,639
and fail of each level. So if we go back
 

4873
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:19,510
and fail of each level. So if we go back
into what we saw this morning,

4874
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:19,520
into what we saw this morning,
 

4875
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,229
into what we saw this morning,
right, the opening drive,

4876
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:22,239
right, the opening drive,
 

4877
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:25,750
right, the opening drive,
we had the shelf at 600. All right, so

4878
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:25,760
we had the shelf at 600. All right, so
 

4879
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,550
we had the shelf at 600. All right, so
opening drive, I left this alone. I was

4880
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:28,560
opening drive, I left this alone. I was
 

4881
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,910
opening drive, I left this alone. I was
hoping they would squeeze out to here

4882
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:29,920
hoping they would squeeze out to here
 

4883
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,510
hoping they would squeeze out to here
and I would think about that short back

4884
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:31,520
and I would think about that short back
 

4885
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:34,229
and I would think about that short back
down to test this. We didn't make it.

4886
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:34,239
down to test this. We didn't make it.
 

4887
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:36,870
down to test this. We didn't make it.
All right, and where I got involved is

4888
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:36,880
All right, and where I got involved is
 

4889
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,709
All right, and where I got involved is
this, this, and this. And then I started

4890
01:53:38,709 --> 01:53:38,719
this, this, and this. And then I started
 

4891
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:40,550
this, this, and this. And then I started
playing short here for the completion of

4892
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:40,560
playing short here for the completion of
 

4893
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,550
playing short here for the completion of
the rotation back down to a previous day

4894
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:42,560
the rotation back down to a previous day
 

4895
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,550
the rotation back down to a previous day
value area high, previous week value

4896
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:44,560
value area high, previous week value
 

4897
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,189
value area high, previous week value
area low. So the first trade was short

4898
01:53:47,189 --> 01:53:47,199
area low. So the first trade was short
 

4899
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:49,430
area low. So the first trade was short
the old volume shelf with a look above

4900
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,440
the old volume shelf with a look above
 

4901
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:50,950
the old volume shelf with a look above
and fail like we talked about in

4902
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:50,960
and fail like we talked about in
 

4903
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,669
and fail like we talked about in
Discord. This move down to here. Once we

4904
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:53,679
Discord. This move down to here. Once we
 

4905
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:55,109
Discord. This move down to here. Once we
got down to there, I was waiting to see

4906
01:53:55,109 --> 01:53:55,119
got down to there, I was waiting to see
 

4907
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:57,510
got down to there, I was waiting to see
if we put in a higher low and we trap

4908
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:57,520
if we put in a higher low and we trap
 

4909
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:00,390
if we put in a higher low and we trap
sellers down here, which is what we do

4910
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:00,400
sellers down here, which is what we do
 

4911
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:03,030
sellers down here, which is what we do
in this move here. So this is your cheap

4912
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,040
in this move here. So this is your cheap
 

4913
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,910
in this move here. So this is your cheap
buy for the rotation back to New York.

4914
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:05,920
buy for the rotation back to New York.
 

4915
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:11,830
buy for the rotation back to New York.
So, if we look at what that looked like,

4916
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:11,840

 

4917
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,510

you can see I've still got it

4918
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:13,520
you can see I've still got it
 

4919
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,510
you can see I've still got it
highlighted,

4920
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:15,520
highlighted,
 

4921
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:19,350
highlighted,
right? We had sellers stuck

4922
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:19,360
right? We had sellers stuck
 

4923
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:25,750
right? We had sellers stuck
in this move here.

4924
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:25,760

 

4925
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,310

Once we pivot over that and we hold, I

4926
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:28,320
Once we pivot over that and we hold, I
 

4927
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:31,669
Once we pivot over that and we hold, I
now know sellers under 560 a quart and

4928
01:54:31,669 --> 01:54:31,679
now know sellers under 560 a quart and
 

4929
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,910
now know sellers under 560 a quart and
we played long

4930
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:33,920
we played long
 

4931
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,430
we played long
back up the other way. Those were the

4932
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:35,440
back up the other way. Those were the
 

4933
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,669
back up the other way. Those were the
two trades and what you're now looking

4934
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
two trades and what you're now looking
 

4935
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,550
two trades and what you're now looking
to do ideally is complete this move if

4936
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:40,560
to do ideally is complete this move if
 

4937
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,070
to do ideally is complete this move if
you're still long and holding to

4938
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:42,080
you're still long and holding to
 

4939
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,669
you're still long and holding to
previous week point of control. This is

4940
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:43,679
previous week point of control. This is
 

4941
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:46,149
previous week point of control. This is
why I said I still think we have

4942
01:54:46,149 --> 01:54:46,159
why I said I still think we have
 

4943
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:47,910
why I said I still think we have
unfinished business there. It doesn't

4944
01:54:47,910 --> 01:54:47,920
unfinished business there. It doesn't
 

4945
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:50,229
unfinished business there. It doesn't
have to do it. Volume's low but one two

4946
01:54:50,229 --> 01:54:50,239
have to do it. Volume's low but one two
 

4947
01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:53,109
have to do it. Volume's low but one two
leg higher low higher low right in

4948
01:54:53,109 --> 01:54:53,119
leg higher low higher low right in
 

4949
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,589
leg higher low higher low right in
intrim low. They are looking to complete

4950
01:54:55,589 --> 01:54:55,599
intrim low. They are looking to complete
 

4951
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:57,830
intrim low. They are looking to complete
this into here the upside. So they're

4952
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:57,840
this into here the upside. So they're
 

4953
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,910
this into here the upside. So they're
looking to trade 690s, 700, 705, 740s.

4954
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:01,920
looking to trade 690s, 700, 705, 740s.
 

4955
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:03,830
looking to trade 690s, 700, 705, 740s.
Acceptance through 740s will get you

4956
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:03,840
Acceptance through 740s will get you
 

4957
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,910
Acceptance through 740s will get you
back up to 800s. Right? So those were

4958
01:55:05,910 --> 01:55:05,920
back up to 800s. Right? So those were
 

4959
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,390
back up to 800s. Right? So those were
the trades they were. We talked about it

4960
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:08,400
the trades they were. We talked about it
 

4961
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,390
the trades they were. We talked about it
in pre-market show. We talked about it

4962
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:10,400
in pre-market show. We talked about it
 

4963
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,070
in pre-market show. We talked about it
in Discord from early this morning and

4964
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:12,080
in Discord from early this morning and
 

4965
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:13,830
in Discord from early this morning and
then we executed on here. Hopefully that

4966
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:13,840
then we executed on here. Hopefully that
 

4967
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:18,790
then we executed on here. Hopefully that
helps.

4968
01:55:18,790 --> 01:55:18,800

 

4969
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:25,669

No worries. Otus.

4970
01:55:25,669 --> 01:55:25,679

 

4971
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:28,390

Uh, I am Monday to Friday, Daryl, but I

4972
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:28,400
Uh, I am Monday to Friday, Daryl, but I
 

4973
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,390
Uh, I am Monday to Friday, Daryl, but I
took Friday off. Well, I was going to

4974
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:30,400
took Friday off. Well, I was going to
 

4975
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,830
took Friday off. Well, I was going to
take it completely off and have a long

4976
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:31,840
take it completely off and have a long
 

4977
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,229
take it completely off and have a long
weekend. Um, because I thought we'd have

4978
01:55:34,229 --> 01:55:34,239
weekend. Um, because I thought we'd have
 

4979
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:35,910
weekend. Um, because I thought we'd have
a rubbish day and low volume. It ended

4980
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:35,920
a rubbish day and low volume. It ended
 

4981
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,430
a rubbish day and low volume. It ended
up being a really good day. So, I was a

4982
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:37,440
up being a really good day. So, I was a
 

4983
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,790
up being a really good day. So, I was a
bit devastated that I missed that

4984
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:38,800
bit devastated that I missed that
 

4985
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,149
bit devastated that I missed that
morning. So, I came back in the

4986
01:55:40,149 --> 01:55:40,159
morning. So, I came back in the
 

4987
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:44,149
morning. So, I came back in the
afternoon and we traded long Friday

4988
01:55:44,149 --> 01:55:44,159
afternoon and we traded long Friday
 

4989
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:47,270
afternoon and we traded long Friday
afternoon because I missed the sell. So,

4990
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:47,280
afternoon because I missed the sell. So,
 

4991
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:51,030
afternoon because I missed the sell. So,
Friday afternoon,

4992
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:51,040

 

4993
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,910

we traded this. All right. So, this was

4994
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:53,920
we traded this. All right. So, this was
 

4995
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,629
we traded this. All right. So, this was
an old naked point of control from the

4996
01:55:56,629 --> 01:55:56,639
an old naked point of control from the
 

4997
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:59,910
an old naked point of control from the
week from like three weeks before and we

Some of them held on to for acceptance
 

5025
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:32,950
Some of them held on to for acceptance
higher. I didn't. I just took my 100

5026
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:32,960
higher. I didn't. I just took my 100
 

5027
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:39,350

points and got off.

like, I don't believe you. So, I should

5032
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
like, I don't believe you. So, I should
 

5033
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:43,750
like, I don't believe you. So, I should
probably just go and find it, shouldn't

5034
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:43,760
probably just go and find it, shouldn't
 

5035
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:55,270
probably just go and find it, shouldn't
I? Um,

It's a bit of an ugly one, but there we
 

5129

It's a bit of an ugly one, but there we
go. It's trying to complete this and

5130
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:07,440
go. It's trying to complete this and

5133
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:12,229
this is its target. All right, so TP1,
TP2, TP3, and runners up there. Those of

5134
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:12,239
TP2, TP3, and runners up there. Those of
 

5135
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:14,709
TP2, TP3, and runners up there. Those of
you who are still long,

5136
01:59:14,709 --> 01:59:14,719
you who are still long,
 

5137
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:17,030

that's why I just didn't think I didn't

5138
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
that's why I just didn't think I didn't
 

5139
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,310
that's why I just didn't think I didn't
love the short. You would have heard me

5140
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:18,320
love the short. You would have heard me
 

5141
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,910
love the short. You would have heard me
say it like it can do it, but it's not

5142
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:19,920
say it like it can do it, but it's not
 

5143
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,270
say it like it can do it, but it's not
something I love because we don't have

5144
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:21,280
something I love because we don't have
 

5145
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,830
something I love because we don't have
enough excess up here. So, I think we

5146
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:23,840
enough excess up here. So, I think we
 

5147
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,430
enough excess up here. So, I think we
will want to run that, which is what

5148
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,440
will want to run that, which is what
 

5149
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,109
will want to run that, which is what
you're starting to see. And I think this

5150
01:59:27,109 --> 01:59:27,119
you're starting to see. And I think this
 

5151
01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:29,669
you're starting to see. And I think this
is the low hanging fruit is up into

5152
01:59:29,669 --> 01:59:29,679

last month. But as you will notice, I
stream without adverts on, right? So, I

5170
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:53,679
stream without adverts on, right? So, I
 

5171
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,430
stream without adverts on, right? So, I
could make a lot more. Well, I don't

02:00:00,390 --> 02:00:00,400
would be a pain in the ass for you guys.
 

5179

All right. So you're getting some buying
 

5221
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,629
All right. So you're getting some buying
coming up here at 90s is a little bit

5222
02:01:04,629 --> 02:01:04,639
coming up here at 90s is a little bit
 

5223
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:06,629
coming up here at 90s is a little bit
caught right now. Another buyer. There's

5224
02:01:06,629 --> 02:01:06,639
caught right now. Another buyer. There's
 

5225
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:07,910
caught right now. Another buyer. There's
a bit more excess, but I think you're

5226
02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:07,920
a bit more excess, but I think you're
 

5227
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,350
a bit more excess, but I think you're
still going to see one more shove up. I

5228
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:09,360
still going to see one more shove up. I
 

5229
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:10,629
still going to see one more shove up. I
don't think it's finished yet. I think

5230
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
don't think it's finished yet. I think
 

5231
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:11,910
don't think it's finished yet. I think
they're looking for one more shove up.

5232
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:11,920
they're looking for one more shove up.
 

5233
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,430
they're looking for one more shove up.
We got a slight divergence. ES hasn't

5234
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:13,440
We got a slight divergence. ES hasn't
 

5235
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,430
We got a slight divergence. ES hasn't
made the new high yet, but it is trying.

5236
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:15,440
made the new high yet, but it is trying.
 

5237
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:18,229
made the new high yet, but it is trying.
It's tapping into its IB. We should see

5238
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:18,239
It's tapping into its IB. We should see
 

5239
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:20,149
It's tapping into its IB. We should see
one more shove up. We have seen a new

5240
02:01:20,149 --> 02:01:20,159
one more shove up. We have seen a new
 

5241
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:22,550
one more shove up. We have seen a new
high in ENQ and some excess above it for

5242
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:22,560
high in ENQ and some excess above it for
 

5243
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,790
high in ENQ and some excess above it for
the first time. Think we're going to

5244
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:24,800
the first time. Think we're going to
 

5245
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,589
the first time. Think we're going to
come into this gray box here. But you

5246
02:01:27,589 --> 02:01:27,599
come into this gray box here. But you
 

5247
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:30,070
come into this gray box here. But you
guys should be well positioned. Most of

5248
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:30,080
guys should be well positioned. Most of
 

5249
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:32,310
guys should be well positioned. Most of
you, I assume, are either long from down

02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:32,320
you, I assume, are either long from down
 

5251
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,550
you, I assume, are either long from down
here or long from the 600s or maybe you

5252
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,560
here or long from the 600s or maybe you
 

5253
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,510
here or long from the 600s or maybe you
reaccumulated

5298
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:23,920
So, if you guys can smash that like
 

5299
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,189

button, how are we doing? I want at

5300

5302
02:04:41,589 --> 02:04:41,599

 

5303
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:44,709

Okay.

5304
02:04:44,709 --> 02:04:44,719

 

5305
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:47,589

All right. So, same levels, folks. Balls

5306
02:04:47,589 --> 02:04:47,599
All right. So, same levels, folks. Balls
 

5307
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:49,669
All right. So, same levels, folks. Balls
now got a hold the new value area high

5308
02:04:49,669 --> 02:04:49,679
now got a hold the new value area high
 

5309
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:52,470
now got a hold the new value area high
and this shelf at 70s.

5310
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:52,480
and this shelf at 70s.
 

5311
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,470
and this shelf at 70s.
All right. But this is uh let's have a

5312
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:54,480
All right. But this is uh let's have a
 

5313
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,470
All right. But this is uh let's have a
look at this excess. It's a little bit

5314
02:04:56,470 --> 02:04:56,480
look at this excess. It's a little bit
 

5315
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:58,310
look at this excess. It's a little bit
better. So, I'd say buyers now are

5316
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:58,320
better. So, I'd say buyers now are
 

5317
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,470
better. So, I'd say buyers now are
caught above 690s. All right. Buyers are

5318
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:00,480
caught above 690s. All right. Buyers are
 

5319
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,950
caught above 690s. All right. Buyers are
caught above 690s. sellers to control

5320
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:02,960
caught above 690s. sellers to control
 

5321
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:06,310
caught above 690s. sellers to control
690 to 685s. So buyers are caught above

5322
02:05:06,310 --> 02:05:06,320
690 to 685s. So buyers are caught above
 

5323
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,550
690 to 685s. So buyers are caught above
690s. So if you are long, you should

5324
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:08,560
690s. So if you are long, you should
 

5325
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,070
690s. So if you are long, you should
have taken profit, like I said, into

5326
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:10,080
have taken profit, like I said, into
 

5327
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:11,990
have taken profit, like I said, into
this gray box. We talked about it into

5328
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:12,000
this gray box. We talked about it into
 

5329
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,270
this gray box. We talked about it into
this gray box. You should have locked

5330
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:13,280
this gray box. You should have locked
 

5331
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,750
this gray box. You should have locked
most in. You'll need them to rebid here.

5332
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:15,760
most in. You'll need them to rebid here.
 

5333
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:17,669
most in. You'll need them to rebid here.
All right. If they can't rebid there, or

5334
02:05:17,669 --> 02:05:17,679
All right. If they can't rebid there, or
 

5335
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:19,270
All right. If they can't rebid there, or
even if they do, and they can't get back

5336
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:19,280
even if they do, and they can't get back
 

5337
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:20,870
even if they do, and they can't get back
above 690s, you are going to see a

5338
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:20,880
above 690s, you are going to see a
 

5339
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,109
above 690s, you are going to see a
rotation now. So you should be down to

5340
02:05:23,109 --> 02:05:23,119
rotation now. So you should be down to
 

5341
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:34,790
rotation now. So you should be down to
small size.

5342
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:34,800

 

5343
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,709

New York open. Why does it need to hold

5344
02:05:36,709 --> 02:05:36,719
New York open. Why does it need to hold
 

5345
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:39,270
New York open. Why does it need to hold
above that? Okay. So, let let's let's

5346
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:39,280
above that? Okay. So, let let's let's
 

5347
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:42,870
above that? Okay. So, let let's let's
think about this realistically.

5348
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:42,880
think about this realistically.
 

5349
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,830
think about this realistically.

when when there's high volatility. Why?

5370
02:06:12,310 --> 02:06:12,320
when when there's high volatility. Why?
 

5371
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:13,990
when when there's high volatility. Why?
Because most volume is traded there. So

5372
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:14,000
Because most volume is traded there. So
 

5373
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,830
Because most volume is traded there. So
if you need to get big size in or out of

5374
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:15,840
if you need to get big size in or out of
 

5375
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:18,070
if you need to get big size in or out of
the market, where's the chance to do it?

5376
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:18,080
the market, where's the chance to do it?
 

5377
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:21,910
the market, where's the chance to do it?
is going to be in the high volume areas.

5378
02:06:21,910 --> 02:06:21,920
is going to be in the high volume areas.
 

5379
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,470
is going to be in the high volume areas.
Right? So, this area here, we've got to

5380
02:06:24,470 --> 02:06:24,480
Right? So, this area here, we've got to
 

5381
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:27,669
Right? So, this area here, we've got to
think at that open, that is the level

5382
02:06:27,669 --> 02:06:27,679
think at that open, that is the level
 

5383
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:29,189
think at that open, that is the level
that all the cash players went, "Well,

5384
02:06:29,189 --> 02:06:29,199
that all the cash players went, "Well,
 

5385
02:06:29,199 --> 02:06:31,270
that all the cash players went, "Well,
I'm long today. [\h__\h] it. I'm long."

5386
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:31,280
I'm long today. [\h__\h] it. I'm long."
 

5387
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,270
I'm long today. [\h__\h] it. I'm long."
Right? Not the guys playing off key

5388
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:33,280
Right? Not the guys playing off key
 

5389
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:35,990
Right? Not the guys playing off key
levels, the cash players, the market

5390
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:36,000
levels, the cash players, the market
 

5391
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,830
levels, the cash players, the market
making cash players or the funds who are

5392
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:37,840
making cash players or the funds who are
 

5393
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,629
making cash players or the funds who are
like, "I'm long. I'm long and my job is

5394
02:06:40,629 --> 02:06:40,639
like, "I'm long. I'm long and my job is
 

5395
02:06:40,639 --> 02:06:42,629
like, "I'm long. I'm long and my job is
to get long until we get here." Or, "My

5396
02:06:42,629 --> 02:06:42,639
to get long until we get here." Or, "My
 

5397
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:44,470
to get long until we get here." Or, "My
job is to get long for the next 3 weeks

5398
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:44,480
job is to get long for the next 3 weeks
 

5399
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,430
job is to get long for the next 3 weeks
until we get here," for example. Right?

5400
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:47,440
until we get here," for example. Right?
 

5401
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:49,669
until we get here," for example. Right?
So,

5402
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
So,
 

5403
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:52,069
So,
in terms of this level, it's a bit like

5404
02:06:52,069 --> 02:06:52,079
in terms of this level, it's a bit like
 

5405
02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:54,229
in terms of this level, it's a bit like
a VWOP or a T-W where they will keep

5406
02:06:54,229 --> 02:06:54,239
a VWOP or a T-W where they will keep
 

5407
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:56,390
a VWOP or a T-W where they will keep
rebidding it if they have more size to

5408
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:56,400
rebidding it if they have more size to
 

5409
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,629
rebidding it if they have more size to
buy at that level. If their order was

5410
02:06:58,629 --> 02:06:58,639
buy at that level. If their order was
 

5411
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:01,270
buy at that level. If their order was
bid there and rebid here and rebid here

5412
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,280
bid there and rebid here and rebid here
 

5413
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,109
bid there and rebid here and rebid here
and rebid here and rebid here and

5414
02:07:03,109 --> 02:07:03,119
and rebid here and rebid here and
 

5415
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:04,550
and rebid here and rebid here and
they've still got more to buy, they will

5416
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:04,560
they've still got more to buy, they will
 

5417
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:06,390
they've still got more to buy, they will
keep buying it because that is the cash

5418
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:06,400
keep buying it because that is the cash
 

5419
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:09,350
keep buying it because that is the cash
open. And for me, anyone who's watched

5420
02:07:09,350 --> 02:07:09,360
open. And for me, anyone who's watched
 

5421
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,950
open. And for me, anyone who's watched
my stuff on cash gaps and stuff like

5422
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:10,960
my stuff on cash gaps and stuff like
 

5423
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:15,270
my stuff on cash gaps and stuff like
that, cash is king in this market

5424
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:15,280
that, cash is king in this market
 

5425
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,030
that, cash is king in this market
or in any market.

5426
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,040
or in any market.
 

5427
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,550
or in any market.
Okay, so look at the gray box. We just

5428
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:18,560
Okay, so look at the gray box. We just
 

5429
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,310
Okay, so look at the gray box. We just
rebid off it. We literally just talked

5430
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:20,320
rebid off it. We literally just talked
 

5431
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,069
rebid off it. We literally just talked
about that, didn't we? So rebidding off

5432
02:07:22,069 --> 02:07:22,079
about that, didn't we? So rebidding off
 

5433
02:07:22,079 --> 02:07:24,470
about that, didn't we? So rebidding off
it. So this isn't crystal ball stuff,

5434
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:24,480
it. So this isn't crystal ball stuff,
 

5435
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:26,390
it. So this isn't crystal ball stuff,
guys. This is like you can see it

5436
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,400
guys. This is like you can see it
 

5437
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,709
guys. This is like you can see it
happening right in front of you. And we

5438
02:07:28,709 --> 02:07:28,719
happening right in front of you. And we
 

5439
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:30,470
happening right in front of you. And we
talked about the 90s being the important

5440
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:30,480
talked about the 90s being the important
 

5441
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:32,629
talked about the 90s being the important
level. The buyers got stuck at 90s. So

5442
02:07:32,629 --> 02:07:32,639
level. The buyers got stuck at 90s. So
 

5443
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:35,350
level. The buyers got stuck at 90s. So
if we fail to get back above 90s, if

5444
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:35,360
if we fail to get back above 90s, if
 

5445
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:37,669
if we fail to get back above 90s, if
sellers hold 90s, you're going to rotate

5446
02:07:37,669 --> 02:07:37,679
sellers hold 90s, you're going to rotate
 

5447
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:39,589
sellers hold 90s, you're going to rotate
between 90s and that gray box. And if

5448
02:07:39,589 --> 02:07:39,599
between 90s and that gray box. And if
 

5449
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:40,950
between 90s and that gray box. And if
the gray box fails, we're going to come

5450
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:40,960
the gray box fails, we're going to come
 

5451
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,390
the gray box fails, we're going to come
back down to point control. And if we

5452
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:42,400
back down to point control. And if we
 

5453
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,870
back down to point control. And if we
lose that, you get a bigger rotation. So

5454
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:44,880
lose that, you get a bigger rotation. So
 

5455
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,629
lose that, you get a bigger rotation. So
those who have joined me for weeks or

5456
02:07:46,629 --> 02:07:46,639
those who have joined me for weeks or
 

5457
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:48,550
those who have joined me for weeks or
months or even years will just be used

5458
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:48,560
months or even years will just be used
 

5459
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:58,470
months or even years will just be used
to seeing the market move this way. Now

5460
02:07:58,470 --> 02:07:58,480

 

5461
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:01,430

Skucks Deluxe just Skucks Deluxe I think

5462
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:01,440
Skucks Deluxe just Skucks Deluxe I think
 

5463
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:02,870
Skucks Deluxe just Skucks Deluxe I think
I said that right. Just missed your TP.

5464
02:08:02,870 --> 02:08:02,880
I said that right. Just missed your TP.
 

5465
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:05,910
I said that right. Just missed your TP.
What the upside? Um I mean missed final

5466
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:05,920
What the upside? Um I mean missed final
 

5467
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,350
What the upside? Um I mean missed final
one. You might you might still get it

5468
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:07,360
one. You might you might still get it
 

5469
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:09,189
one. You might you might still get it
but like I said you want to be very

5470
02:08:09,189 --> 02:08:09,199
but like I said you want to be very
 

5471
02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:13,430
but like I said you want to be very
careful now. Buyers are caught above 90.

5472
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:13,440
careful now. Buyers are caught above 90.
 

5473
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:15,430
careful now. Buyers are caught above 90.
Right. This is buyers being caught. So,

5474
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:15,440
Right. This is buyers being caught. So,
 

5475
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,669
Right. This is buyers being caught. So,
this needs to reclaim this and do this.

5476
02:08:17,669 --> 02:08:17,679
this needs to reclaim this and do this.
 

5477
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:19,109
this needs to reclaim this and do this.
If it does that, you're fine. But if you

5478
02:08:19,109 --> 02:08:19,119
If it does that, you're fine. But if you
 

5479
02:08:19,119 --> 02:08:21,910
If it does that, you're fine. But if you
keep rejecting 90 and you do this, we

5480
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:21,920
keep rejecting 90 and you do this, we
 

5481
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:23,510
keep rejecting 90 and you do this, we
can get a bit more of a collapse. All

5482
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:23,520
can get a bit more of a collapse. All
 

5483
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:24,709
can get a bit more of a collapse. All
right. So, that's what I'd be looking

5484
02:08:24,709 --> 02:08:24,719
right. So, that's what I'd be looking
 

5485
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:26,390
right. So, that's what I'd be looking
for. You need to, if you're still long,

5486
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:26,400
for. You need to, if you're still long,
 

5487
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:27,990
for. You need to, if you're still long,
you've held this gray box. It's a good

5488
02:08:27,990 --> 02:08:28,000
you've held this gray box. It's a good
 

5489
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,069
you've held this gray box. It's a good
hold. Remember, you've accumulated here.

5490
02:08:30,069 --> 02:08:30,079
hold. Remember, you've accumulated here.
 

5491
02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:32,069
hold. Remember, you've accumulated here.
Hopefully, you've sold some into this.

5492
02:08:32,069 --> 02:08:32,079
Hopefully, you've sold some into this.
 

5493
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:33,830
Hopefully, you've sold some into this.
You've held that. You need to get back

5494
02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:33,840
You've held that. You need to get back
 

5495
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,669
You've held that. You need to get back
above 90. If you start losing this gray

5496
02:08:35,669 --> 02:08:35,679
above 90. If you start losing this gray
 

5497
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:37,189
above 90. If you start losing this gray
box, I would say don't touch it. Cut

5498
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:37,199
box, I would say don't touch it. Cut
 

5499
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:38,870
box, I would say don't touch it. Cut
your position. Personally, it's what I'd

5500
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:38,880
your position. Personally, it's what I'd
 

5501
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:40,629
your position. Personally, it's what I'd
be looking for. Really, you want this to

5502
02:08:40,629 --> 02:08:40,639
be looking for. Really, you want this to
 

5503
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:47,990
be looking for. Really, you want this to
hold and go.

5504
02:08:47,990 --> 02:08:48,000

 

5505
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,790

Uh this is my flow zone pro. You can get

5506
02:08:50,790 --> 02:08:50,800
Uh this is my flow zone pro. You can get
 

5507
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,229
Uh this is my flow zone pro. You can get
this on the website. A version of it

5508
02:08:52,229 --> 02:08:52,239
this on the website. A version of it
 

5509
02:08:52,239 --> 02:08:54,390
this on the website. A version of it
comes with the course. So everything you

5510
02:08:54,390 --> 02:08:54,400
comes with the course. So everything you
 

5511
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:57,830
comes with the course. So everything you
see here,

5512
02:08:57,830 --> 02:08:57,840

 

5513
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,430

you see we probably went into a buy and

5514
02:08:59,430 --> 02:08:59,440
you see we probably went into a buy and
 

5515
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,030
you see we probably went into a buy and
a sell. Yeah, a few buys and sells once

5516
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:01,040
a sell. Yeah, a few buys and sells once
 

5517
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,629
a sell. Yeah, a few buys and sells once
we went sideways, but then we've been in

5518
02:09:02,629 --> 02:09:02,639
we went sideways, but then we've been in

02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:05,910
we went sideways, but then we've been in

02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:12,229
trying to get bullish higher time frame
and lower time frame trying to join when

5526
02:09:12,229 --> 02:09:12,239
and lower time frame trying to join when
 

5527
02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:16,149
and lower time frame trying to join when
we're above the waves.

5528
02:09:16,149 --> 02:09:16,159

 

5529
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:17,910

No, I draw those gray boxes. You would

5530
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:17,920
No, I draw those gray boxes. You would
 

5531
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:19,270
No, I draw those gray boxes. You would
have just if you rewind it, you would

5532
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:19,280
have just if you rewind it, you would
 

5533
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,470
have just if you rewind it, you would
have just seen me draw. They're just

5534
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:20,480
have just seen me draw. They're just
 

5535
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:21,990
have just seen me draw. They're just
based on volume, right? So, I draw them

5536
02:09:21,990 --> 02:09:22,000
based on volume, right? So, I draw them
 

5537
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,430
based on volume, right? So, I draw them
based on volume. You see this shelf

5538
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:23,440
based on volume. You see this shelf
 

5539
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,350
based on volume. You see this shelf
here? That's what it's based on. This

5540
02:09:25,350 --> 02:09:25,360
here? That's what it's based on. This
 

5541
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:28,310
here? That's what it's based on. This
shelf here, gray box. This shelf here is

5542
02:09:28,310 --> 02:09:28,320
shelf here, gray box. This shelf here is
 

5543
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:31,430
shelf here, gray box. This shelf here is
based on a shelf created last week. So

5544
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:31,440
based on a shelf created last week. So
 

5545
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:35,430
based on a shelf created last week. So
if we look at

5546
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:35,440

 

5547
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:37,510

right this

5548
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:37,520
right this
 

5549
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:39,669
right this
right this shelf right so it's just

5550
02:09:39,669 --> 02:09:39,679
right this shelf right so it's just
 

5551
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:42,149
right this shelf right so it's just
where remember if you've got high volume

5552
02:09:42,149 --> 02:09:42,159
where remember if you've got high volume
 

5553
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:44,229
where remember if you've got high volume
it's where we found acceptance of price

5554
02:09:44,229 --> 02:09:44,239
it's where we found acceptance of price
 

5555
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:46,069
it's where we found acceptance of price
it's where buyers and sellers are

5556
02:09:46,069 --> 02:09:46,079
it's where buyers and sellers are
 

5557
02:09:46,079 --> 02:09:55,270
it's where buyers and sellers are
agreeing on price

5558
02:09:55,270 --> 02:09:55,280

 

5559
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,430

again you want this to hold you want

5560
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:57,440
again you want this to hold you want
 

5561
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:59,030
again you want this to hold you want
bears to fail to get a breakdown if

5562
02:09:59,030 --> 02:09:59,040
bears to fail to get a breakdown if
 

5563
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,910
bears to fail to get a breakdown if
you're long Right? You want this to be a

5564
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:01,920
you're long Right? You want this to be a
 

5565
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,750
you're long Right? You want this to be a
failed breakdown so that you've trapped

5566
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:03,760
failed breakdown so that you've trapped
 

5567
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,910
failed breakdown so that you've trapped
lots of bears in here and above 90 you

5568
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:05,920
lots of bears in here and above 90 you
 

5569
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,910
lots of bears in here and above 90 you
should have the ability to go. If bears

5570
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:07,920
should have the ability to go. If bears
 

5571
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,750
should have the ability to go. If bears
get their way, we'll start rotating

5572
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:09,760
get their way, we'll start rotating
 

5573
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:11,510
get their way, we'll start rotating
lower and I would be done with longs for

5574
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:11,520
lower and I would be done with longs for
 

5575
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:13,669
lower and I would be done with longs for
the day or at least for this session I

5576
02:10:13,669 --> 02:10:13,679
the day or at least for this session I
 

5577
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:15,430
the day or at least for this session I
would say unless they rebid this. But

5578
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:15,440
would say unless they rebid this. But
 

5579
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:17,669
would say unless they rebid this. But
that would be very very ugly. Uh because

5580
02:10:17,669 --> 02:10:17,679
that would be very very ugly. Uh because
 

5581
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:21,270
that would be very very ugly. Uh because
if they start to lose this, right, if

5582
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:21,280
if they start to lose this, right, if
 

5583
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,589
if they start to lose this, right, if
this happens and we start to lose this,

5584
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:23,599
this happens and we start to lose this,
 

5585
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:25,189
this happens and we start to lose this,
then we're going to have all this buy

5586
02:10:25,189 --> 02:10:25,199
then we're going to have all this buy
 

5587
02:10:25,199 --> 02:10:27,350
then we're going to have all this buy
side volume trapped and VWAP. And if we

5588
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:27,360
side volume trapped and VWAP. And if we
 

5589
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,750
side volume trapped and VWAP. And if we
lose New York VWAP, and if we lose that,

5590
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:29,760
lose New York VWAP, and if we lose that,
 

5591
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:32,950
lose New York VWAP, and if we lose that,
rotation back down to current day value

5592
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:32,960
rotation back down to current day value
 

5593
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,790
rotation back down to current day value
low, which would be 24-hour VWOP and

5594
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:34,800
low, which would be 24-hour VWOP and
 

5595
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,470
low, which would be 24-hour VWOP and
lower time frame ALGO probably by the

5596
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:36,480
lower time frame ALGO probably by the
 

5597
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:38,390
lower time frame ALGO probably by the
day time we get there. So there is like

5598
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:38,400
day time we get there. So there is like
 

5599
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:41,750
day time we get there. So there is like
another 80 point downside if they let go

5600
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:41,760
another 80 point downside if they let go
 

5601
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:44,550
another 80 point downside if they let go
of these. Until that point though, bulls

5602
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:44,560
of these. Until that point though, bulls
 

5603
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:46,709
of these. Until that point though, bulls
are in control. As long as they hold

5604
02:10:46,709 --> 02:10:46,719
are in control. As long as they hold
 

5605
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:48,709
are in control. As long as they hold
gray box and they have squeeze

5606
02:10:48,709 --> 02:10:48,719
gray box and they have squeeze
 

5607
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:52,390
gray box and they have squeeze
possibility above 90,

5608
02:10:52,390 --> 02:10:52,400
possibility above 90,
 

5609
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,069
possibility above 90,
I wouldn't be buying up here as a new

5610
02:10:54,069 --> 02:10:54,079
I wouldn't be buying up here as a new
 

5611
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:55,830
I wouldn't be buying up here as a new
money position. Right. We remember we we

5612
02:10:55,830 --> 02:10:55,840
money position. Right. We remember we we
 

5613
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,430
money position. Right. We remember we we
were bidding basically off low of day

5614
02:10:57,430 --> 02:10:57,440
were bidding basically off low of day
 

5615
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:04,149
were bidding basically off low of day
today.

5616
02:11:04,149 --> 02:11:04,159

 

5617
02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:09,589

Yeah. Win rate is uh normally like 68 to

5618
02:11:09,589 --> 02:11:09,599
Yeah. Win rate is uh normally like 68 to
 

5619
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:12,950
Yeah. Win rate is uh normally like 68 to
73% month depend like somewhere around

5620
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:12,960
73% month depend like somewhere around
 

5621
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:14,870
73% month depend like somewhere around
there is my win rate. But what I will

5622
02:11:14,870 --> 02:11:14,880
there is my win rate. But what I will
 

5623
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:18,149
there is my win rate. But what I will
tell you with that is I take a lot of

5624
02:11:18,149 --> 02:11:18,159
tell you with that is I take a lot of
 

5625
02:11:18,159 --> 02:11:21,109
tell you with that is I take a lot of
like what I consider break even trades

5626
02:11:21,109 --> 02:11:21,119
like what I consider break even trades
 

5627
02:11:21,119 --> 02:11:23,189
like what I consider break even trades
which are basically scratch and so they

5628
02:11:23,189 --> 02:11:23,199
which are basically scratch and so they
 

5629
02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:26,390
which are basically scratch and so they
might be considered a win right so it's

5630
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,400
might be considered a win right so it's
 

5631
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,149
might be considered a win right so it's
probably I'll be honest it's probably a

5632
02:11:28,149 --> 02:11:28,159
probably I'll be honest it's probably a
 

5633
02:11:28,159 --> 02:11:29,910
probably I'll be honest it's probably a
little bit skewed so like a win where

5634
02:11:29,910 --> 02:11:29,920
little bit skewed so like a win where
 

5635
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:33,910
little bit skewed so like a win where
I've made one tick two ticks but

5636
02:11:33,910 --> 02:11:33,920
I've made one tick two ticks but
 

5637
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:36,149
I've made one tick two ticks but
not necessarily the ones banking right

5638
02:11:36,149 --> 02:11:36,159
not necessarily the ones banking right
 

5639
02:11:36,159 --> 02:11:40,310
not necessarily the ones banking right
whereas uh RR you saw today like I think

5640
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:40,320
whereas uh RR you saw today like I think
 

5641
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,390
whereas uh RR you saw today like I think
RR is hard as well because both trades

5642
02:11:42,390 --> 02:11:42,400
RR is hard as well because both trades
 

5643
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:45,589
RR is hard as well because both trades
today were like five are um but we're in

5644
02:11:45,589 --> 02:11:45,599
today were like five are um but we're in
 

5645
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:48,149
today were like five are um but we're in
a lower

5646
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:48,159
a lower
 

5647
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:50,149
a lower
lower volatility kind of day, right? But

5648
02:11:50,149 --> 02:11:50,159
lower volatility kind of day, right? But
 

5649
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:53,270
lower volatility kind of day, right? But
we try and get 40 50 points minimum is

5650
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:53,280
we try and get 40 50 points minimum is
 

5651
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,669
we try and get 40 50 points minimum is
what I'm looking for.

5652
02:11:55,669 --> 02:11:55,679
what I'm looking for.
 

5653
02:11:55,679 --> 02:11:56,950
what I'm looking for.
Hope that helps. I know it's probably

5654
02:11:56,950 --> 02:11:56,960
Hope that helps. I know it's probably
 

5655
02:11:56,960 --> 02:11:58,470
Hope that helps. I know it's probably
not that useful, but I always think win

5656
02:11:58,470 --> 02:11:58,480
not that useful, but I always think win
 

5657
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:06,229
not that useful, but I always think win
rate can be a bit skewed.

5658
02:12:06,229 --> 02:12:06,239

 

5659
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:10,470

Can we see a cell of 700 to 738 in this

5660
02:12:10,470 --> 02:12:10,480
Can we see a cell of 700 to 738 in this
 

5661
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:12,390
Can we see a cell of 700 to 738 in this
box? Yeah.

5662
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:12,400
box? Yeah.
 

5663
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,550
box? Yeah.
Yeah. in here you're talking about?

5664
02:12:14,550 --> 02:12:14,560
Yeah. in here you're talking about?
 

5665
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,990
Yeah. in here you're talking about?
Yeah. But you're going to need them to

5666
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:16,000
Yeah. But you're going to need them to
 

5667
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,430
Yeah. But you're going to need them to
trap, right? So if we get up

5668
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:19,440
trap, right? So if we get up
 

5669
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:22,390
trap, right? So if we get up
anywhere from here can be a sell, but

5670
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:22,400
anywhere from here can be a sell, but
 

5671
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,069
anywhere from here can be a sell, but
remember it's got to prove yourself. You

5672
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:24,079
remember it's got to prove yourself. You
 

5673
02:12:24,079 --> 02:12:26,229
remember it's got to prove yourself. You
don't want to be like sell some here,

5674
02:12:26,229 --> 02:12:26,239
don't want to be like sell some here,
 

5675
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:27,750
don't want to be like sell some here,
sell some here, sell some here, sell

5676
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:27,760
sell some here, sell some here, sell
 

5677
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:29,990
sell some here, sell some here, sell
some here, and they come up to 800 and

5678
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:30,000
some here, and they come up to 800 and
 

5679
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,350
some here, and they come up to 800 and
you blow up, right? Because you'll be

5680
02:12:31,350 --> 02:12:31,360
you blow up, right? Because you'll be
 

5681
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,189

front side because what's happening

5682
02:12:33,189 --> 02:12:33,199
front side because what's happening
 

5683
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:35,189
front side because what's happening
right now,

5684
02:12:35,189 --> 02:12:35,199
right now,
 

5685
02:12:35,199 --> 02:12:36,870
right now,
right? This can still happen, right?

5686
02:12:36,870 --> 02:12:36,880
right? This can still happen, right?
 

5687
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,149
right? This can still happen, right?
Doesn't have to happen. That can still

5688
02:12:38,149 --> 02:12:38,159
Doesn't have to happen. That can still
 

5689
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:40,470
Doesn't have to happen. That can still
happen. What you need to see if you want

5690
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:40,480
happen. What you need to see if you want
 

5691
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:43,270
happen. What you need to see if you want
to sell in this gray box is some kind of

5692
02:12:43,270 --> 02:12:43,280
to sell in this gray box is some kind of
 

5693
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:45,589
to sell in this gray box is some kind of
shove up with exhaustion and then lower

5694
02:12:45,589 --> 02:12:45,599
shove up with exhaustion and then lower
 

5695
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:48,870
shove up with exhaustion and then lower
high and leaving buyers trapped. So what

5696
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:48,880
high and leaving buyers trapped. So what
 

5697
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,390
high and leaving buyers trapped. So what
that might look like, it could be a

5698
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:50,400
that might look like, it could be a
 

5699
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:52,149
that might look like, it could be a
candle like this. This is an extreme

5700
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:52,159
candle like this. This is an extreme
 

5701
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:54,470
candle like this. This is an extreme
version with a nice long wick where you

5702
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:54,480
version with a nice long wick where you
 

5703
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:55,750
version with a nice long wick where you
know passive sellers come in. Maybe

5704
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:55,760
know passive sellers come in. Maybe
 

5705
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:57,430
know passive sellers come in. Maybe
you're watching footprint, maybe you're

5706
02:12:57,430 --> 02:12:57,440
you're watching footprint, maybe you're
 

5707
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:59,750
you're watching footprint, maybe you're
watching bookmap, right? Something like

5708
02:12:59,750 --> 02:12:59,760
watching bookmap, right? Something like
 

5709
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:02,069
watching bookmap, right? Something like
that into there. You don't want to get

5710
02:13:02,069 --> 02:13:02,079
that into there. You don't want to get
 

5711
02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:04,709
that into there. You don't want to get
front side just just because remember

5712
02:13:04,709 --> 02:13:04,719
front side just just because remember
 

5713
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:05,750
front side just just because remember
what I talked about at the beginning of

5714
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:05,760
what I talked about at the beginning of
 

5715
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,669
what I talked about at the beginning of
the day. What are we talking about?

the day. What are we talking about?
location

5718
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:09,520
location
 

5719
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:13,350
location
and momentum. Is this a good location to

5720
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:13,360
and momentum. Is this a good location to
 

5721
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:15,990
and momentum. Is this a good location to
be short in? I'd argue it could it could

5722
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,000
be short in? I'd argue it could it could
 

5723
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,069
be short in? I'd argue it could it could
be a very good location to be short in.

5724
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:18,079
be a very good location to be short in.
 

5725
02:13:18,079 --> 02:13:20,069
be a very good location to be short in.
What is the momentum currently? It's

What is the momentum currently? It's
 

5727
02:13:20,079 --> 02:13:22,550
What is the momentum currently? It's
bullish. We don't want to short against

While this is slow, I want to check out

While this is slow, I want to check out
 

5733

While this is slow, I want to check out
this funded next thing cuz uh see how

02:13:44,709 --> 02:13:44,719
this funded next thing cuz uh see how
 

5735
02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:56,870
this funded next thing cuz uh see how
good this is.

5736
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:56,880

 

5737
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:59,510

There's the website updated.

5738
02:13:59,510 --> 02:13:59,520
There's the website updated.
 

5739
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:00,709
There's the website updated.
Here we go. So, they're starting to

5740
02:14:00,709 --> 02:14:00,719
Here we go. So, they're starting to
 

5741
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:02,149
Here we go. So, they're starting to
squeeze. They're trying to do it. They

5742
02:14:02,149 --> 02:14:02,159
squeeze. They're trying to do it. They
 

5743
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:04,390
squeeze. They're trying to do it. They
want to complete it. The gray box is

5744
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:04,400
want to complete it. The gray box is
 

5745
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,149
want to complete it. The gray box is
holding is holding. They want to get

5746
02:14:06,149 --> 02:14:06,159
holding is holding. They want to get
 

5747
02:14:06,159 --> 02:14:07,910
holding is holding. They want to get
above the 90s. I told you that's the

5748
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:07,920
above the 90s. I told you that's the
 

5749
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:09,589
above the 90s. I told you that's the
pain point right now. Bulls need to get

5750
02:14:09,589 --> 02:14:09,599
pain point right now. Bulls need to get
 

5751
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:11,350
pain point right now. Bulls need to get
back above 90s because they are out of

5752
02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:11,360
back above 90s because they are out of
 

5753
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,270
back above 90s because they are out of
position right now. And if they get

5754
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:13,280
position right now. And if they get
 

5755
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,350
position right now. And if they get
above back above that, they can look for

5756
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:15,360
above back above that, they can look for
 

5757
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:17,030
above back above that, they can look for
the squeeze out. They've got to start

5758
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,040
the squeeze out. They've got to start
 

5759
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:58,950
the squeeze out. They've got to start
getting back above the 90s.

5760
02:14:58,950 --> 02:14:58,960

 

5761
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,790

Uh for me, Brett, New York session,

5762
02:15:00,790 --> 02:15:00,800
Uh for me, Brett, New York session,
 

5763
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,069
Uh for me, Brett, New York session,
right? Because that's when the most of

5764
02:15:02,069 --> 02:15:02,079
right? Because that's when the most of
 

5765
02:15:02,079 --> 02:15:04,069
right? Because that's when the most of
volume comes in. But um you know, you

5766
02:15:04,069 --> 02:15:04,079
volume comes in. But um you know, you
 

5767
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:06,069
volume comes in. But um you know, you
can measure

5768
02:15:06,069 --> 02:15:06,079
can measure
 

5769
02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:08,229
can measure
what's happened overnight. Sometimes is

5770
02:15:08,229 --> 02:15:08,239
what's happened overnight. Sometimes is
 

5771
02:15:08,239 --> 02:15:10,149
what's happened overnight. Sometimes is
useful coming into a new session, right?

5772
02:15:10,149 --> 02:15:10,159
useful coming into a new session, right?
 

5773
02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:18,709
useful coming into a new session, right?
if we're gapping up or gapping down.

5774
02:15:18,709 --> 02:15:18,719

 

5775
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:19,910

How do you tell when it's a short

5776
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:19,920
How do you tell when it's a short
 

5777
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:21,910
How do you tell when it's a short
squeeze or long buying? Uh, it's more

5778
02:15:21,910 --> 02:15:21,920
squeeze or long buying? Uh, it's more
 

5779
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:23,510
squeeze or long buying? Uh, it's more
about the looking left and seeing where

5780
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:23,520
about the looking left and seeing where
 

5781
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:25,189
about the looking left and seeing where
that liquidity is. But I mean, it can be

5782
02:15:25,189 --> 02:15:25,199
that liquidity is. But I mean, it can be
 

5783
02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:26,629
that liquidity is. But I mean, it can be
both those things at the same time,

5784
02:15:26,629 --> 02:15:26,639
both those things at the same time,
 

5785
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:29,589
both those things at the same time,
right? If it's market participation, as

5786
02:15:29,589 --> 02:15:29,599
right? If it's market participation, as
 

5787
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:31,990
right? If it's market participation, as
in market order participation, then we

5788
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,000
in market order participation, then we
 

5789
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,069
in market order participation, then we
know it's people chasing in and stops

5790
02:15:34,069 --> 02:15:34,079
know it's people chasing in and stops
 

5791
02:15:34,079 --> 02:15:37,669
know it's people chasing in and stops
getting run, right? If it's just gradual

5792
02:15:37,669 --> 02:15:37,679
getting run, right? If it's just gradual
 

5793
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:40,470
getting run, right? If it's just gradual
limit up buying absorbing, then we know

5794
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:40,480
limit up buying absorbing, then we know
 

5795
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:42,229
limit up buying absorbing, then we know
it's just genuine buying with a passive

5796
02:15:42,229 --> 02:15:42,239
it's just genuine buying with a passive
 

5797
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:43,910
it's just genuine buying with a passive
seller walking it up. It's very

5798
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:43,920
seller walking it up. It's very
 

5799
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:48,149
seller walking it up. It's very
different.

5800
02:15:48,149 --> 02:15:48,159

money, but it didn't um
it didn't go all the way down. Where is

5828
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:25,360
it didn't go all the way down. Where is
 

5829
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:26,870
it didn't go all the way down. Where is
So,

5830
02:16:26,870 --> 02:16:26,880
So,
 

5831
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,149
So,
when I talked about the look above and

5832
02:16:28,149 --> 02:16:28,159
when I talked about the look above and
 

5833
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:31,430
when I talked about the look above and
fail 600s, this is way back. Let's get

5834
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:31,440
fail 600s, this is way back. Let's get
 

5835
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:34,070
fail 600s, this is way back. Let's get
down to today.

5836
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:34,080
down to today.
 

5837
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,429
down to today.
As you can see here, I was playing the

5838
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:35,439
As you can see here, I was playing the
 

5839
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,589
As you can see here, I was playing the
look above and fail for 600s. All right,

5840
02:16:37,589 --> 02:16:37,599
look above and fail for 600s. All right,
 

5841
02:16:37,599 --> 02:16:39,429
look above and fail for 600s. All right,
moved my stopped in, locked in some

5842
02:16:39,429 --> 02:16:39,439
moved my stopped in, locked in some
 

5843
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:42,230
moved my stopped in, locked in some
money. Yeah, there's no rules of when to

5844
02:16:42,230 --> 02:16:42,240
money. Yeah, there's no rules of when to
 

5845
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,830
money. Yeah, there's no rules of when to
trade. I don't like trading GlobeEx

5846
02:16:43,830 --> 02:16:43,840
trade. I don't like trading GlobeEx
 

5847
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:45,349
trade. I don't like trading GlobeEx
unless there's a really good setup

5848
02:16:45,349 --> 02:16:45,359
unless there's a really good setup
 

5849
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:47,750
unless there's a really good setup
because volume is so low. So, you can

5850
02:16:47,750 --> 02:16:47,760
because volume is so low. So, you can
 

5851
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:50,070
because volume is so low. So, you can
get skipped on, the spread can open up

5852
02:16:50,070 --> 02:16:50,080
get skipped on, the spread can open up
 

5853
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:51,750
get skipped on, the spread can open up
if some news hits that you're not ready

5854
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:51,760
if some news hits that you're not ready
 

5855
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:53,190
if some news hits that you're not ready
for and the spread opens up, you're

5856
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:53,200
for and the spread opens up, you're
 

5857
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,950
for and the spread opens up, you're
going to get absolutely cooked. I'd much

5858
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:54,960
going to get absolutely cooked. I'd much
 

5859
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:58,150
going to get absolutely cooked. I'd much
rather trade the New York session. Plus,

5860
02:16:58,150 --> 02:16:58,160
rather trade the New York session. Plus,
 

5861
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,709
rather trade the New York session. Plus,
it limits my exposure mentally to be on

5862
02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:00,719
it limits my exposure mentally to be on
 

5863
02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:02,469
it limits my exposure mentally to be on
the charts because this is a tiring

5864
02:17:02,469 --> 02:17:02,479
the charts because this is a tiring
 

5865
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:04,150
the charts because this is a tiring
game, folks. If you're going to sit here

5866
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:04,160
game, folks. If you're going to sit here
 

5867
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:06,389
game, folks. If you're going to sit here
and try and trade, you know, New York

5868
02:17:06,389 --> 02:17:06,399
and try and trade, you know, New York
 

5869
02:17:06,399 --> 02:17:08,790
and try and trade, you know, New York
session and afternoon session and then a

5870
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:08,800
session and afternoon session and then a
 

5871
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,549
session and afternoon session and then a
bit of Asia or I'm going to stay up and

5872
02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:10,559
bit of Asia or I'm going to stay up and
 

5873
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:12,070
bit of Asia or I'm going to stay up and
trade like you're just you're going to

5874
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:12,080
trade like you're just you're going to
 

5875
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:16,790
trade like you're just you're going to
burn out so quick.

5876
02:17:16,790 --> 02:17:16,800

 

5877
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:18,549

If you put the volume profile on the

5878
02:17:18,549 --> 02:17:18,559
If you put the volume profile on the
 

5879
02:17:18,559 --> 02:17:20,950
If you put the volume profile on the
Asian open,

5880
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:20,960
Asian open,
 

5881
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:23,270
Asian open,
then the PC aligns with the double top

5882
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:23,280
then the PC aligns with the double top
 

5883
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:26,709
then the PC aligns with the double top
area. Hopefully, it bounces. Huh? If you

5884
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:26,719
area. Hopefully, it bounces. Huh? If you
 

5885
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:29,830
area. Hopefully, it bounces. Huh? If you
put volume profile on Asia open, what do

5886
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:29,840
put volume profile on Asia open, what do
 

5887
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:32,469
put volume profile on Asia open, what do
you mean then the PC aligns? Oh, then

5888
02:17:32,469 --> 02:17:32,479
you mean then the PC aligns? Oh, then
 

5889
02:17:32,479 --> 02:17:34,469
you mean then the PC aligns? Oh, then
then the PC aligns with a double top. Is

5890
02:17:34,469 --> 02:17:34,479
then the PC aligns with a double top. Is
 

5891
02:17:34,479 --> 02:17:41,589
then the PC aligns with a double top. Is
that what you're saying? Um,

5892
02:17:41,589 --> 02:17:41,599

 

5893
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:43,429

I don't think that's possible, mate,

5894
02:17:43,429 --> 02:17:43,439
I don't think that's possible, mate,
 

5895
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:46,629
I don't think that's possible, mate,
because or you

5896
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:46,639
because or you
 

5897
02:17:46,639 --> 02:17:48,790
because or you
you mean the point of control was 500 in

5898
02:17:48,790 --> 02:17:48,800
you mean the point of control was 500 in
 

5899
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:51,190
you mean the point of control was 500 in
the in around 500 or 490 in the Asia

5900
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:51,200
the in around 500 or 490 in the Asia
 

5901
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,309
the in around 500 or 490 in the Asia
session. Is that what you're talking

5902
02:17:52,309 --> 02:17:52,319
session. Is that what you're talking
 

5903
02:17:52,319 --> 02:17:54,549
session. Is that what you're talking
about? And then London held the dip.

5904
02:17:54,549 --> 02:17:54,559
about? And then London held the dip.
 

5905
02:17:54,559 --> 02:17:55,990
about? And then London held the dip.
Maybe that's what you mean cuz we're

5906
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:56,000
Maybe that's what you mean cuz we're
 

5907
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,669
Maybe that's what you mean cuz we're
nowhere near any of that right now.

5908
02:17:59,669 --> 02:17:59,679
nowhere near any of that right now.
 

5909
02:17:59,679 --> 02:18:01,190
nowhere near any of that right now.
Maybe I just misunderstood what you

5910
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:01,200
Maybe I just misunderstood what you
 

5911
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:03,910
Maybe I just misunderstood what you
meant. Right. So this remember the 90s

5912
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:03,920
meant. Right. So this remember the 90s
 

5913
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:05,750
meant. Right. So this remember the 90s
we kept talking about 90s is important

5914
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:05,760
we kept talking about 90s is important
 

5915
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:07,270
we kept talking about 90s is important
because this where buyers are trapped

5916
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:07,280
because this where buyers are trapped
 

5917
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:09,910
because this where buyers are trapped
above 90s. They still cannot get above

5918
02:18:09,910 --> 02:18:09,920
above 90s. They still cannot get above
 

5919
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:12,070
above 90s. They still cannot get above
90s. Buyers have got to get above the

5920
02:18:12,070 --> 02:18:12,080
90s. Buyers have got to get above the
 

5921
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:14,870
90s. Buyers have got to get above the
90s right now.

5922
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:14,880
90s right now.
 

5923
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:18,709
90s right now.
Right. This is where the buying came in

5924
02:18:18,709 --> 02:18:18,719
Right. This is where the buying came in
 

5925
02:18:18,719 --> 02:18:21,830
Right. This is where the buying came in
here. Right. These buyers are currently

5926
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:21,840
here. Right. These buyers are currently
 

5927
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:24,230
here. Right. These buyers are currently
trapped in the market and most of it

5928
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:24,240
trapped in the market and most of it
 

5929
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:25,910
trapped in the market and most of it
came in I have to look at my other

5930
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:25,920
came in I have to look at my other
 

5931
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,830
came in I have to look at my other
indicator. Most of it came in at 88 and

5932
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:27,840
indicator. Most of it came in at 88 and
 

5933
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:30,389
indicator. Most of it came in at 88 and
90. Above that is thin but 88 and 90 was

5934
02:18:30,389 --> 02:18:30,399
90. Above that is thin but 88 and 90 was
 

5935
02:18:30,399 --> 02:18:33,030
90. Above that is thin but 88 and 90 was
some big time buyers.

5936
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:33,040
some big time buyers.
 

5937
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:34,629
some big time buyers.
So we need to get back above that for

5938
02:18:34,629 --> 02:18:34,639
So we need to get back above that for
 

5939
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:36,469
So we need to get back above that for
the bulls to have a shot of completing

5940
02:18:36,469 --> 02:18:36,479
the bulls to have a shot of completing
 

5941
02:18:36,479 --> 02:18:37,910
the bulls to have a shot of completing
it. If they can't get back above that

5942
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:37,920
it. If they can't get back above that
 

5943
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:39,509
it. If they can't get back above that
they're in danger of a failed break

5944
02:18:39,509 --> 02:18:39,519
they're in danger of a failed break
 

5945
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:42,549
they're in danger of a failed break
higher. [snorts]

5946
02:18:42,549 --> 02:18:42,559
higher. [snorts]
 

5947
02:18:42,559 --> 02:18:44,549
higher. [snorts]
I'm pretty new and was told not to trade

5948
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:44,559
I'm pretty new and was told not to trade
 

5949
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:46,629
I'm pretty new and was told not to trade
after until after 15 minutes. I think

5950
02:18:46,629 --> 02:18:46,639
after until after 15 minutes. I think
 

5951
02:18:46,639 --> 02:18:48,230
after until after 15 minutes. I think
whoever told you that is very wise.

5952
02:18:48,230 --> 02:18:48,240
whoever told you that is very wise.
 

5953
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:51,589
whoever told you that is very wise.
Yeah, if you're new, let it calm down.

5954
02:18:51,589 --> 02:18:51,599
Yeah, if you're new, let it calm down.
 

5955
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:54,389
Yeah, if you're new, let it calm down.
Absolutely. I I completely agree with

5956
02:18:54,389 --> 02:18:54,399
Absolutely. I I completely agree with
 

5957
02:18:54,399 --> 02:18:57,349
Absolutely. I I completely agree with
that because it's very volatile and in

5958
02:18:57,349 --> 02:18:57,359
that because it's very volatile and in
 

5959
02:18:57,359 --> 02:18:59,589
that because it's very volatile and in
the open and you'll get caught out. So,

5960
02:18:59,589 --> 02:18:59,599
the open and you'll get caught out. So,
 

5961
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:06,070
the open and you'll get caught out. So,
I would agree with that, Nate.

5962
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:06,080

 

5963
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:09,030

Watching RSI to get into overbought and

5964
02:19:09,030 --> 02:19:09,040
Watching RSI to get into overbought and
 

5965
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,349
Watching RSI to get into overbought and
cross EMA pointless. I think it's not

5966
02:19:11,349 --> 02:19:11,359
cross EMA pointless. I think it's not
 

5967
02:19:11,359 --> 02:19:14,549
cross EMA pointless. I think it's not
pointless on higher time frames.

5968
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:14,559
pointless on higher time frames.
 

5969
02:19:14,559 --> 02:19:16,549
pointless on higher time frames.
I don't think RSI really cares about

5970
02:19:16,549 --> 02:19:16,559
I don't think RSI really cares about
 

5971
02:19:16,559 --> 02:19:19,270
I don't think RSI really cares about
anything on like a one minute or a tick,

5972
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:19,280
anything on like a one minute or a tick,
 

5973
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:20,950
anything on like a one minute or a tick,
but I think on higher time frames it

5974
02:19:20,950 --> 02:19:20,960
but I think on higher time frames it
 

5975
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:30,389
but I think on higher time frames it
could become useful.

5976
02:19:30,389 --> 02:19:30,399

 

5977
02:19:30,399 --> 02:19:33,830

Uh we're we're not at yesterday's top.

5978
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:33,840
Uh we're we're not at yesterday's top.
 

5979
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:36,629
Uh we're we're not at yesterday's top.
I'm watching the profile here. We're

5980
02:19:36,629 --> 02:19:36,639
I'm watching the profile here. We're
 

5981
02:19:36,639 --> 02:19:38,070
I'm watching the profile here. We're
coming into previous week point of

5982
02:19:38,070 --> 02:19:38,080
coming into previous week point of
 

5983
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:41,990
coming into previous week point of
control. We're above old value. We left

5984
02:19:41,990 --> 02:19:42,000
control. We're above old value. We left
 

5985
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,549
control. We're above old value. We left
Friday's value. Friday's top value was

5986
02:19:44,549 --> 02:19:44,559
Friday's value. Friday's top value was
 

5987
02:19:44,559 --> 02:19:47,589
Friday's value. Friday's top value was
55 54. It's way down there. Unless

5988
02:19:47,589 --> 02:19:47,599
55 54. It's way down there. Unless
 

5989
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:49,190
55 54. It's way down there. Unless
you're talking about TPO. Maybe you're

5990
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:49,200
you're talking about TPO. Maybe you're
 

5991
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:50,950
you're talking about TPO. Maybe you're
talking about TPO

5992
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:50,960
talking about TPO
 

5993
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:53,670
talking about TPO
in terms of time. But yeah, I'm watching

5994
02:19:53,670 --> 02:19:53,680
in terms of time. But yeah, I'm watching
 

5995
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:55,110
in terms of time. But yeah, I'm watching
to see if we can get into previous week

5996
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:55,120
to see if we can get into previous week
 

5997
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:57,270
to see if we can get into previous week
point control and then if if we sell

5998
02:19:57,270 --> 02:19:57,280
point control and then if if we sell
 

5999
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:03,830
point control and then if if we sell
look above and fail or if we base.

6000
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:03,840

 

6001
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:06,469

Do I look at expected high of the day in

6002
02:20:06,469 --> 02:20:06,479
Do I look at expected high of the day in
 

6003
02:20:06,479 --> 02:20:08,469
Do I look at expected high of the day in
ESNQ? Not really. What do you use for

6004
02:20:08,469 --> 02:20:08,479
ESNQ? Not really. What do you use for
 

6005
02:20:08,479 --> 02:20:10,870
ESNQ? Not really. What do you use for
that? The like gamma for the expected

6006
02:20:10,870 --> 02:20:10,880
that? The like gamma for the expected
 

6007
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:15,110
that? The like gamma for the expected
move.

6008
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:15,120

 

6009
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:16,870

What strategy do I use for swings?

6010
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:16,880
What strategy do I use for swings?
 

6011
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:19,830
What strategy do I use for swings?
Exactly the same as I trade with. I look

6012
02:20:19,830 --> 02:20:19,840
Exactly the same as I trade with. I look
 

6013
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,910
Exactly the same as I trade with. I look
for just everything's on much higher

6014
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:21,920
for just everything's on much higher
 

6015
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:24,550
for just everything's on much higher
time frame, weekly, daily, 4 hour. I

6016
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:24,560
time frame, weekly, daily, 4 hour. I
 

6017
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:26,870
time frame, weekly, daily, 4 hour. I
look for price to move in. If I'm long,

6018
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:26,880
look for price to move in. If I'm long,
 

6019
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:28,950
look for price to move in. If I'm long,
I want to be long biased as much as

6020
02:20:28,950 --> 02:20:28,960
I want to be long biased as much as
 

6021
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:30,790
I want to be long biased as much as
possible in swing positions, especially

6022
02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:30,800
possible in swing positions, especially
 

6023
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:32,389
possible in swing positions, especially
when I'm looking to hold for multiple

6024
02:20:32,389 --> 02:20:32,399
when I'm looking to hold for multiple
 

6025
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:34,630
when I'm looking to hold for multiple
months. Um, unless we're in a bare

6026
02:20:34,630 --> 02:20:34,640
months. Um, unless we're in a bare
 

6027
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,790
months. Um, unless we're in a bare
market, that's different. And even then,

6028
02:20:36,790 --> 02:20:36,800
market, that's different. And even then,
 

6029
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:40,070
market, that's different. And even then,
I'd rather be long in SQ or something.

6030
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:40,080
I'd rather be long in SQ or something.
 

6031
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:44,150
I'd rather be long in SQ or something.
Um, but I look to buy in areas of demand

6032
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:44,160
Um, but I look to buy in areas of demand
 

6033
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,070
Um, but I look to buy in areas of demand
where we have a good base and volume

6034
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:46,080
where we have a good base and volume
 

6035
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:48,630
where we have a good base and volume
built out where I can see short sellers

6036
02:20:48,630 --> 02:20:48,640
built out where I can see short sellers
 

6037
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:50,070
built out where I can see short sellers
are getting themselves caught in the

6038
02:20:50,070 --> 02:20:50,080
are getting themselves caught in the
 

6039
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:51,750
are getting themselves caught in the
market where we run liquidity and we

6040
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:51,760
market where we run liquidity and we
 

6041
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:53,429
market where we run liquidity and we
reclaim and then I think okay, we've got

6042
02:20:53,429 --> 02:20:53,439
reclaim and then I think okay, we've got
 

6043
02:20:53,439 --> 02:20:56,950
reclaim and then I think okay, we've got
a good move higher. So, I'm I mean I'm

6044
02:20:56,950 --> 02:20:56,960
a good move higher. So, I'm I mean I'm
 

6045
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:58,950
a good move higher. So, I'm I mean I'm
still holding a lot of my positions from

6046
02:20:58,950 --> 02:20:58,960
still holding a lot of my positions from
 

6047
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:02,950
still holding a lot of my positions from
last year. I'm still long Apple from I

6048
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:02,960
last year. I'm still long Apple from I
 

6049
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:04,230
last year. I'm still long Apple from I
have to get this out. I always forget if

6050
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:04,240
have to get this out. I always forget if
 

6051
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:12,230
have to get this out. I always forget if
it's 220 or 202

6052
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,240

 

6053
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:16,070

my average on this.

6054
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:16,080
my average on this.
 

6055
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,230
my average on this.
So Apple I'm actually long yeah 202. So

6056
02:21:18,230 --> 02:21:18,240
So Apple I'm actually long yeah 202. So
 

6057
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:20,469
So Apple I'm actually long yeah 202. So
I added a bit. So I'm long from 208

6058
02:21:20,469 --> 02:21:20,479
I added a bit. So I'm long from 208
 

6059
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:25,030
I added a bit. So I'm long from 208
average in Apple. AMD um I was long from

6060
02:21:25,030 --> 02:21:25,040
average in Apple. AMD um I was long from
 

6061
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:29,670
average in Apple. AMD um I was long from
the 158 but I sold most of it into that

6062
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:29,680
the 158 but I sold most of it into that
 

6063
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:32,070
the 158 but I sold most of it into that
like 280 move. I'm still holding a

6064
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:32,080
like 280 move. I'm still holding a
 

6065
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:33,429
like 280 move. I'm still holding a
little bit.

6066
02:21:33,429 --> 02:21:33,439
little bit.
 

6067
02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:35,670
little bit.
Amazon, I'm only up 5%. I'm long from

6068
02:21:35,670 --> 02:21:35,680
Amazon, I'm only up 5%. I'm long from
 

6069
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:39,110
Amazon, I'm only up 5%. I'm long from
216. That's a small size. Meta, I'm up

6070
02:21:39,110 --> 02:21:39,120
216. That's a small size. Meta, I'm up
 

6071
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:43,429
216. That's a small size. Meta, I'm up
12%. I'm long from 590s. All right. So,

6072
02:21:43,429 --> 02:21:43,439
12%. I'm long from 590s. All right. So,
 

6073
02:21:43,439 --> 02:21:44,950
12%. I'm long from 590s. All right. So,
I'm looking for discount prices. I'm

6074
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:44,960
I'm looking for discount prices. I'm
 

6075
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:46,550
I'm looking for discount prices. I'm
looking for shorts to be trapped. And

6076
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:46,560
looking for shorts to be trapped. And
 

6077
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:49,670
looking for shorts to be trapped. And
I'm looking for potential for expansion

6078
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:49,680
I'm looking for potential for expansion
 

6079
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:53,030
I'm looking for potential for expansion
at least up into a first level.

6080
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:53,040
at least up into a first level.
 

6081
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:54,309
at least up into a first level.
And the same if I was getting short

6082
02:21:54,309 --> 02:21:54,319
And the same if I was getting short
 

6083
02:21:54,319 --> 02:21:56,469
And the same if I was getting short
bias, right? I'd look for, you know, a

6084
02:21:56,469 --> 02:21:56,479
bias, right? I'd look for, you know, a
 

6085
02:21:56,479 --> 02:21:58,630
bias, right? I'd look for, you know, a
blowoff top followed by some

6086
02:21:58,630 --> 02:21:58,640
blowoff top followed by some
 

6087
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:00,790
blowoff top followed by some
consolidation of buyers trying to come

6088
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:00,800
consolidation of buyers trying to come
 

6089
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:03,590
consolidation of buyers trying to come
in at a extreme premium price and then

6090
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:03,600
in at a extreme premium price and then
 

6091
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:04,870
in at a extreme premium price and then
I'd be looking for us to move away from

6092
02:22:04,870 --> 02:22:04,880
I'd be looking for us to move away from
 

6093
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:07,110
I'd be looking for us to move away from
that level. Here we go. Bulls finally.

6094
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:07,120
that level. Here we go. Bulls finally.
 

6095
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:08,790
that level. Here we go. Bulls finally.

they? Two hours to try and come up to
 

6101
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:14,230
they? Two hours to try and come up to
this uh naked point of control up here

6102
02:22:14,230 --> 02:22:14,240
this uh naked point of control up here
 

6103
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:17,190
this uh naked point of control up here
from the previous week.

6104
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:17,200
from the previous week.
 

6105
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,429
from the previous week.
I'm not long Tessa. I'm not long Tessa

The long was when everyone said Elon was

6110
02:22:26,150 --> 02:22:26,160
The long was when everyone said Elon was
 

6111
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,230
The long was when everyone said Elon was
uh a word which we can't repeat on here

6112
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:28,240
uh a word which we can't repeat on here
 

6113
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:29,830
uh a word which we can't repeat on here
and that it should go to hell. That was

6114
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:29,840
and that it should go to hell. That was
 

6115
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:32,070
and that it should go to hell. That was
the obvious buy opportunity. Uh it's

6116
02:22:32,070 --> 02:22:32,080
the obvious buy opportunity. Uh it's
 

6117
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:34,150
the obvious buy opportunity. Uh it's
driven up towards 500. We've seen some

6118
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,160
driven up towards 500. We've seen some
 

6119
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,150
driven up towards 500. We've seen some
decent profit taking. Doesn't mean it

6120
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:36,160
decent profit taking. Doesn't mean it
 

6121
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:40,150
decent profit taking. Doesn't mean it
can't go higher but yeah moving into

6122
02:22:40,150 --> 02:22:40,160
can't go higher but yeah moving into
 

6123
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:41,750
can't go higher but yeah moving into
more robotics which I do think I've got

6124
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:41,760
more robotics which I do think I've got
 

6125
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:44,230
more robotics which I do think I've got
a good shot this year. I've made a note

6126
02:22:44,230 --> 02:22:44,240
a good shot this year. I've made a note
 

6127
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:47,190
a good shot this year. I've made a note
of some ETFs I want to look at actually.

6128
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:47,200
of some ETFs I want to look at actually.
 

6129
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:49,750
of some ETFs I want to look at actually.
Just haven't had a chance to sit down.

6130
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:49,760
Just haven't had a chance to sit down.
 

6131
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:52,710
Just haven't had a chance to sit down.
Um, see, give some to you guys if I've

6132
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:52,720
Um, see, give some to you guys if I've
 

6133
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:54,790
Um, see, give some to you guys if I've
got it here. Please tell I didn't delete

6134
02:22:54,790 --> 02:22:54,800
got it here. Please tell I didn't delete
 

6135
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:59,750
got it here. Please tell I didn't delete
it. Um, yeah, I want to look at uh NLR

6136
02:22:59,750 --> 02:22:59,760
it. Um, yeah, I want to look at uh NLR
 

6137
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:01,510
it. Um, yeah, I want to look at uh NLR
and nuclear power this year if we're

6138
02:23:01,510 --> 02:23:01,520
and nuclear power this year if we're
 

6139
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:03,910
and nuclear power this year if we're
going to get a run into AI and data

6140
02:23:03,910 --> 02:23:03,920
going to get a run into AI and data
 

6141
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:07,110
going to get a run into AI and data
centers. Um, I think BIO's been

6142
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:07,120
centers. Um, I think BIO's been
 

6143
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:08,950
centers. Um, I think BIO's been
absolutely smacked. So, I want to have a

6144
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:08,960
absolutely smacked. So, I want to have a
 

6145
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:12,469
absolutely smacked. So, I want to have a
look at some of those. Um, IBB or

6146
02:23:12,469 --> 02:23:12,479
look at some of those. Um, IBB or
 

6147
02:23:12,479 --> 02:23:15,429
look at some of those. Um, IBB or
something. Um, and I'll still look at

6148
02:23:15,429 --> 02:23:15,439
something. Um, and I'll still look at
 

6149
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:16,950
something. Um, and I'll still look at
the data centers. I just wonder if

6150
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:16,960
the data centers. I just wonder if
 

6151
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:18,469
the data centers. I just wonder if
there's been too much exposure too

6152
02:23:18,469 --> 02:23:18,479
there's been too much exposure too
 

6153
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:21,110
there's been too much exposure too
quick. But if they offer, you know, if

6154
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:21,120
quick. But if they offer, you know, if
 

6155
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:22,710
quick. But if they offer, you know, if
we go into a panic market, I would do

6156
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:22,720
we go into a panic market, I would do
 

6157
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:24,150
we go into a panic market, I would do
want to accumulate some of the

6158
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:24,160
want to accumulate some of the
 

6159
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:28,790
want to accumulate some of the
speculative names cheap if possible.

6160
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:28,800

 

6161
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:32,070

Yeah, I hold over earnings if if I'm

6162
02:23:32,070 --> 02:23:32,080
Yeah, I hold over earnings if if I'm
 

6163
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:34,550
Yeah, I hold over earnings if if I'm
positioned well for them, Eddie. So, I

6164
02:23:34,550 --> 02:23:34,560
positioned well for them, Eddie. So, I
 

6165
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:36,630
positioned well for them, Eddie. So, I
wouldn't buy in a runup to earnings and

6166
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:36,640
wouldn't buy in a runup to earnings and
 

6167
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:38,309
wouldn't buy in a runup to earnings and
hold. Like, if I was going to buy in a

6168
02:23:38,309 --> 02:23:38,319
hold. Like, if I was going to buy in a
 

6169
02:23:38,319 --> 02:23:40,230
hold. Like, if I was going to buy in a
run-up to earnings, I'd be assuming it

6170
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:40,240
run-up to earnings, I'd be assuming it
 

6171
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:42,630
run-up to earnings, I'd be assuming it
would be a sell the news and I'd trim.

6172
02:23:42,630 --> 02:23:42,640
would be a sell the news and I'd trim.
 

6173
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:45,830
would be a sell the news and I'd trim.
But if I'm buying and I'm looking to

6174
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:45,840
But if I'm buying and I'm looking to
 

6175
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:49,030
But if I'm buying and I'm looking to
hold multiple months, multiple years,

6176
02:23:49,030 --> 02:23:49,040
hold multiple months, multiple years,
 

6177
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:51,110
hold multiple months, multiple years,
then I'll hold through earnings. But

6178
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:51,120
then I'll hold through earnings. But
 

6179
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:54,389
then I'll hold through earnings. But
only if I'm confident in the play and if

6180
02:23:54,389 --> 02:23:54,399
only if I'm confident in the play and if
 

6181
02:23:54,399 --> 02:23:57,030
only if I'm confident in the play and if
it's a thick name. Yeah, it's a thick

6182
02:23:57,030 --> 02:23:57,040
it's a thick name. Yeah, it's a thick
 

6183
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:59,590
it's a thick name. Yeah, it's a thick
name.

6184
02:23:59,590 --> 02:23:59,600
name.
 

6185
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:01,349
name.
Am I looking long? No, because we're

6186
02:24:01,349 --> 02:24:01,359
Am I looking long? No, because we're
 

6187
02:24:01,359 --> 02:24:02,950
Am I looking long? No, because we're
coming into the key area. You should

6188
02:24:02,950 --> 02:24:02,960
coming into the key area. You should
 

6189
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:05,270
coming into the key area. You should
have already been long. Um, I'm

6190
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:05,280
have already been long. Um, I'm
 

6191
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:06,790
have already been long. Um, I'm
currently flat, guys. I haven't touched

6192
02:24:06,790 --> 02:24:06,800
currently flat, guys. I haven't touched
 

6193
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:09,030
currently flat, guys. I haven't touched
it since. Look, I can show you. It's the

6194
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:09,040
it since. Look, I can show you. It's the
 

6195
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:11,990
it since. Look, I can show you. It's the
same as earlier. I don't know why I'm up

6196
02:24:11,990 --> 02:24:12,000
same as earlier. I don't know why I'm up
 

6197
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,030
same as earlier. I don't know why I'm up
2 3,000 on the day or something. Um I

6198
02:24:15,030 --> 02:24:15,040
2 3,000 on the day or something. Um I
 

6199
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:18,710
2 3,000 on the day or something. Um I
haven't touched it since

6200
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:18,720

 

6201
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:21,510

I haven't touched it since this long.

6202
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:21,520
I haven't touched it since this long.
 

6203
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,389
I haven't touched it since this long.
Was it here? First go, second go up into

6204
02:24:24,389 --> 02:24:24,399
Was it here? First go, second go up into
 

6205
02:24:24,399 --> 02:24:30,150
Was it here? First go, second go up into
this. I cut it too early. That's right.

6206
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:30,160
this. I cut it too early. That's right.
 

6207
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:31,429
this. I cut it too early. That's right.
You're starting to see three drives

6208
02:24:31,429 --> 02:24:31,439
You're starting to see three drives
 

6209
02:24:31,439 --> 02:24:33,190
You're starting to see three drives
here. So you you want to be careful if

6210
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:33,200
here. So you you want to be careful if
 

6211
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:38,710
here. So you you want to be careful if
they don't make a new high here.

6212
02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:38,720

 

6213
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:41,670

One, two, three. Ideally, this completes

6214
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:41,680
One, two, three. Ideally, this completes
 

6215
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:44,230
One, two, three. Ideally, this completes
and then you can think about backside if

6216
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:44,240
and then you can think about backside if
 

6217
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:47,349
and then you can think about backside if
they really want to do it. You might go

6218
02:24:47,349 --> 02:24:47,359
they really want to do it. You might go
 

6219
02:24:47,359 --> 02:24:50,070
they really want to do it. You might go
sideways here. It's possible. It's what

6220
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:50,080
sideways here. It's possible. It's what
 

6221
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:53,670
sideways here. It's possible. It's what
we've done before.

6222
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:53,680

 

6223
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:55,830

Yeah.

6224
02:24:55,830 --> 02:24:55,840
Yeah.
 

6225
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:58,469
Yeah.
There's here again big levels up here

6226
02:24:58,469 --> 02:24:58,479
There's here again big levels up here
 

6227
02:24:58,479 --> 02:25:00,550
There's here again big levels up here
that we keep selling off and here and

6228
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:00,560
that we keep selling off and here and
 

6229
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:01,830
that we keep selling off and here and
here and here and here. So, this is

6230
02:25:01,830 --> 02:25:01,840
here and here and here. So, this is
 

6231
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:03,830
here and here and here. So, this is
where the buyers were caught, right? So,

6232
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:03,840
where the buyers were caught, right? So,
 

6233
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:05,510
where the buyers were caught, right? So,
if we go back to Tuesday the 30th,

6234
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:05,520
if we go back to Tuesday the 30th,
 

6235
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,270
if we go back to Tuesday the 30th,
that's where buyers were caught offside.

6236
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,280
that's where buyers were caught offside.
 

6237
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:11,429
that's where buyers were caught offside.
That's why we've sold that every time.

6238
02:25:11,429 --> 02:25:11,439

 

6239
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:13,750

There's a big level this gray box. It's

6240
02:25:13,750 --> 02:25:13,760
There's a big level this gray box. It's
 

6241
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:26,630
There's a big level this gray box. It's
a big level.

6242
02:25:26,630 --> 02:25:26,640

 

6243
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:28,469

How did I learn to get into the habit of

6244
02:25:28,469 --> 02:25:28,479
How did I learn to get into the habit of
 

6245
02:25:28,479 --> 02:25:33,030
How did I learn to get into the habit of
staying disciplined? Uh, by losing.

6246
02:25:33,030 --> 02:25:33,040

 

6247
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:35,910

Genuinely, that's the answer. by losing

6248
02:25:35,910 --> 02:25:35,920
Genuinely, that's the answer. by losing
 

6249
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:40,950
Genuinely, that's the answer. by losing
lots and lots and lots and lots and lots

6250
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:40,960
lots and lots and lots and lots and lots
 

6251
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:43,590
lots and lots and lots and lots and lots
and lots of times

6252
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:43,600
and lots of times
 

6253
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:46,230
and lots of times
and then realizing that the way you're

6254
02:25:46,230 --> 02:25:46,240
and then realizing that the way you're
 

6255
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:48,309
and then realizing that the way you're
going to get or the way you are going to

6256
02:25:48,309 --> 02:25:48,319
going to get or the way you are going to
 

6257
02:25:48,319 --> 02:25:51,750
going to get or the way you are going to
make more money trading is not by

6258
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:51,760
make more money trading is not by
 

6259
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:55,349
make more money trading is not by
trading more. It's by going through your

6260
02:25:55,349 --> 02:25:55,359
trading more. It's by going through your
 

6261
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:57,670
trading more. It's by going through your
stats and seeing what you're good at and

6262
02:25:57,670 --> 02:25:57,680
stats and seeing what you're good at and
 

6263
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:59,990
stats and seeing what you're good at and
sticking to that.

6264
02:25:59,990 --> 02:26:00,000
sticking to that.
 

6265
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,950
sticking to that.
So if if I get long now, I am chasing

6266
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:02,960
So if if I get long now, I am chasing
 

6267
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:05,830
So if if I get long now, I am chasing
the market because remember our longs

6268
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:05,840
the market because remember our longs
 

6269
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,630
the market because remember our longs
were all the way down here, right here

6270
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:08,640
were all the way down here, right here
 

6271
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:10,309
were all the way down here, right here
and here. We were looking to buy in

6272
02:26:10,309 --> 02:26:10,319
and here. We were looking to buy in
 

6273
02:26:10,319 --> 02:26:12,870
and here. We were looking to buy in
discount on the holds of value after

6274
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:12,880
discount on the holds of value after
 

6275
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:15,190
discount on the holds of value after
shorts got caught. If I'm trading long

6276
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:15,200
shorts got caught. If I'm trading long
 

6277
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:17,670
shorts got caught. If I'm trading long
now, okay, maybe we get lucky and it

6278
02:26:17,670 --> 02:26:17,680
now, okay, maybe we get lucky and it
 

6279
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:21,190
now, okay, maybe we get lucky and it
gets at 707s, but that is a watch my

6280
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:21,200
gets at 707s, but that is a watch my
 

6281
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:23,349
gets at 707s, but that is a watch my
French here. That is not a good long

6282
02:26:23,349 --> 02:26:23,359
French here. That is not a good long
 

6283
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:25,429
French here. That is not a good long
position to get up into here. All right,

6284
02:26:25,429 --> 02:26:25,439
position to get up into here. All right,
 

6285
02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:27,830
position to get up into here. All right,
because the risk is that we come to

6286
02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:27,840
because the risk is that we come to
 

6287
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,349
because the risk is that we come to
point of control, we come to New York

6288
02:26:29,349 --> 02:26:29,359
point of control, we come to New York
 

6289
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:31,670
point of control, we come to New York
open, we come to VWAP, we collapse down

6290
02:26:31,670 --> 02:26:31,680
open, we come to VWAP, we collapse down
 

6291
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:34,309
open, we come to VWAP, we collapse down
all the way down here. So, how am I

6292
02:26:34,309 --> 02:26:34,319
all the way down here. So, how am I
 

6293
02:26:34,319 --> 02:26:36,070
all the way down here. So, how am I
going to set my RR there? So, negative

6294
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:36,080
going to set my RR there? So, negative
 

6295
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:38,230
going to set my RR there? So, negative
RR trade. I I don't want to do that.

6296
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:38,240
RR trade. I I don't want to do that.
 

6297
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,750
RR trade. I I don't want to do that.
That's just a that's just a poor

6298
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:39,760
That's just a that's just a poor
 

6299
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:41,750
That's just a that's just a poor
location to trade in. Especially we got

6300
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:41,760
location to trade in. Especially we got
 

6301
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:43,590
location to trade in. Especially we got
three drives. We haven't We take out the

6302
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:43,600
three drives. We haven't We take out the
 

6303
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:46,230
three drives. We haven't We take out the
high then

6304
02:26:46,230 --> 02:26:46,240
high then
 

6305
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:48,469
high then
to take out the high. I just don't want

6306
02:26:48,469 --> 02:26:48,479
to take out the high. I just don't want
 

6307
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:49,910
to take out the high. I just don't want
to do it. Even if it's one of those,

6308
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:49,920
to do it. Even if it's one of those,
 

6309
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:51,429
to do it. Even if it's one of those,
right? Even if this worked out, even if

6310
02:26:51,429 --> 02:26:51,439
right? Even if this worked out, even if
 

6311
02:26:51,439 --> 02:26:52,870
right? Even if this worked out, even if
you hit long now and it worked out and

6312
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:52,880
you hit long now and it worked out and
 

6313
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:55,190
you hit long now and it worked out and
got to there and you gave yourself a

6314
02:26:55,190 --> 02:26:55,200
got to there and you gave yourself a
 

6315
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:57,349
got to there and you gave yourself a
dopamine hit for making money, it's a

6316
02:26:57,349 --> 02:26:57,359
dopamine hit for making money, it's a
 

6317
02:26:57,359 --> 02:26:59,830
dopamine hit for making money, it's a
it's an awful trade.

6318
02:26:59,830 --> 02:26:59,840
it's an awful trade.
 

6319
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:01,429
it's an awful trade.
So, you've got to get out of like the

6320
02:27:01,429 --> 02:27:01,439
So, you've got to get out of like the
 

6321
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:03,830
So, you've got to get out of like the
dopamine hit chase based on money and

6322
02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:03,840
dopamine hit chase based on money and
 

6323
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:05,429
dopamine hit chase based on money and
you've got to get into the dopamine hit

6324
02:27:05,429 --> 02:27:05,439
you've got to get into the dopamine hit
 

6325
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:07,429
you've got to get into the dopamine hit
chase based on good process. That

6326
02:27:07,429 --> 02:27:07,439
chase based on good process. That
 

6327
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:09,030
chase based on good process. That
includes losses. Like, you have to

6328
02:27:09,030 --> 02:27:09,040
includes losses. Like, you have to
 

6329
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:12,070
includes losses. Like, you have to
congratulate yourself for taking a good

6330
02:27:12,070 --> 02:27:12,080
congratulate yourself for taking a good
 

6331
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:15,349
congratulate yourself for taking a good
loss. If you enter a good trade and you

6332
02:27:15,349 --> 02:27:15,359
loss. If you enter a good trade and you
 

6333
02:27:15,359 --> 02:27:17,910
loss. If you enter a good trade and you
stop out at the correct level, it's just

6334
02:27:17,910 --> 02:27:17,920
stop out at the correct level, it's just
 

6335
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:19,510
stop out at the correct level, it's just
how it is. You're not going to get

6336
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:19,520
how it is. You're not going to get
 

6337
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:22,550
how it is. You're not going to get
pocket aces. Well, you might think

6338
02:27:22,550 --> 02:27:22,560
pocket aces. Well, you might think
 

6339
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:24,790
pocket aces. Well, you might think
you're sitting at a table with Jack Jack

6340
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:24,800
you're sitting at a table with Jack Jack
 

6341
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,870
you're sitting at a table with Jack Jack
and you're like, I'm good here. But the

6342
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:26,880
and you're like, I'm good here. But the
 

6343
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:28,790
and you're like, I'm good here. But the
guy opp you has got the guy opposite has

6344
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:28,800
guy opp you has got the guy opposite has
 

6345
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:30,710
guy opp you has got the guy opposite has
got pocket aces. Sometimes that is going

6346
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:30,720
got pocket aces. Sometimes that is going
 

6347
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:35,190
got pocket aces. Sometimes that is going
to happen. That's the market.

6348
02:27:35,190 --> 02:27:35,200

 

6349
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:37,190

Okay. So, back to this gray shelf again.

6350
02:27:37,190 --> 02:27:37,200
Okay. So, back to this gray shelf again.
 

6351
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,710
Okay. So, back to this gray shelf again.
Starting to leave some volume trapped

6352
02:27:38,710 --> 02:27:38,720
Starting to leave some volume trapped
 

6353
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:41,270
Starting to leave some volume trapped
higher now. So I would now tell you that

6354
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:41,280
higher now. So I would now tell you that
 

6355
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:43,030
higher now. So I would now tell you that
uh in that initial balance high which is

6356
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:43,040
uh in that initial balance high which is
 

6357
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:45,429
uh in that initial balance high which is
a purple line one of you just asked you

6358
02:27:45,429 --> 02:27:45,439
a purple line one of you just asked you
 

6359
02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:48,230
a purple line one of you just asked you
have a huge amount of buyers uh stuck

6360
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:48,240
have a huge amount of buyers uh stuck
 

6361
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:50,630
have a huge amount of buyers uh stuck
there aggressive buyers at 83. So the

6362
02:27:50,630 --> 02:27:50,640
there aggressive buyers at 83. So the
 

6363
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:52,950
there aggressive buyers at 83. So the
two levels that buyers are now stuck at

6364
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:52,960
two levels that buyers are now stuck at
 

6365
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:55,910
two levels that buyers are now stuck at
are 83 and 90. So if they can't get

6366
02:27:55,910 --> 02:27:55,920
are 83 and 90. So if they can't get
 

6367
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:58,870
are 83 and 90. So if they can't get
above 83 you're probably going to get a

6368
02:27:58,870 --> 02:27:58,880
above 83 you're probably going to get a
 

6369
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:01,190
above 83 you're probably going to get a
rotation back down into this shelf of

6370
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:01,200
rotation back down into this shelf of
 

6371
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:04,150
rotation back down into this shelf of
like 60 to 54. You not got a lot of room

6372
02:28:04,150 --> 02:28:04,160
like 60 to 54. You not got a lot of room
 

6373
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:06,550
like 60 to 54. You not got a lot of room
to play with stuff. So they're going to

6374
02:28:06,550 --> 02:28:06,560
to play with stuff. So they're going to
 

6375
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:09,590
to play with stuff. So they're going to
come and test this IB now and buyers

6376
02:28:09,590 --> 02:28:09,600
come and test this IB now and buyers
 

6377
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,349
come and test this IB now and buyers
need to get back above that IB and they

6378
02:28:11,349 --> 02:28:11,359
need to get back above that IB and they
 

6379
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:13,110
need to get back above that IB and they
need to get back above 90. So you can

6380
02:28:13,110 --> 02:28:13,120
need to get back above 90. So you can
 

6381
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:15,349
need to get back above 90. So you can
see this shelf developing but the actual

6382
02:28:15,349 --> 02:28:15,359
see this shelf developing but the actual
 

6383
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:18,550
see this shelf developing but the actual
buyer he's here and he's here. These are

6384
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:18,560
buyer he's here and he's here. These are
 

6385
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:20,309
buyer he's here and he's here. These are
his two pain points. This is where he's

6386
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:20,319
his two pain points. This is where he's
 

6387
02:28:20,319 --> 02:28:21,910
his two pain points. This is where he's
underwater right now. Right? So he's

6388
02:28:21,910 --> 02:28:21,920
underwater right now. Right? So he's
 

6389
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:24,070
underwater right now. Right? So he's
bought huge here and here. If we get

6390
02:28:24,070 --> 02:28:24,080
bought huge here and here. If we get
 

6391
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:26,150
bought huge here and here. If we get
back above him, all right, then he's

6392
02:28:26,150 --> 02:28:26,160
back above him, all right, then he's
 

6393
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:27,429
back above him, all right, then he's
going to be a happy man and he's

6394
02:28:27,429 --> 02:28:27,439
going to be a happy man and he's
 

6395
02:28:27,439 --> 02:28:28,870
going to be a happy man and he's
comfortable. But if we keep rejecting

6396
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:28,880
comfortable. But if we keep rejecting
 

6397
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:30,550
comfortable. But if we keep rejecting
here and here, he's going to start

6398
02:28:30,550 --> 02:28:30,560
here and here, he's going to start
 

6399
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:32,070
here and here, he's going to start
stopping out and now we're add cell

6400
02:28:32,070 --> 02:28:32,080
stopping out and now we're add cell
 

6401
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:40,950
stopping out and now we're add cell
pressure.

6402
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:40,960

 

6403
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:44,630

I'll show you him. See him right here.

6404
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:44,640
I'll show you him. See him right here.
 

6405
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:46,230
I'll show you him. See him right here.
Right. I can see his delta. See this

6406
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:46,240
Right. I can see his delta. See this
 

6407
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:50,150
Right. I can see his delta. See this
right here? 83 and 90. That's his pain

6408
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:50,160
right here? 83 and 90. That's his pain
 

6409
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:54,150
right here? 83 and 90. That's his pain
point.

6410
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:54,160

 

6411
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:56,150

We get back above those. He's nice and

6412
02:28:56,150 --> 02:28:56,160
We get back above those. He's nice and
 

6413
02:28:56,160 --> 02:29:07,429
We get back above those. He's nice and
comfy.

6414
02:29:07,429 --> 02:29:07,439

 

6415
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:09,190

Purple line is initial balance. That's

6416
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:09,200
Purple line is initial balance. That's
 

6417
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:12,710
Purple line is initial balance. That's
your initial balance.

6418
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:12,720
your initial balance.
 

6419
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:15,510
your initial balance.
New highs is on a yes. So maybe maybe we

6420
02:29:15,510 --> 02:29:15,520
New highs is on a yes. So maybe maybe we
 

6421
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:18,309
New highs is on a yes. So maybe maybe we
can get this move to point control.

6422
02:29:18,309 --> 02:29:18,319
can get this move to point control.
 

6423
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:20,469
can get this move to point control.
See they're struggling at that 90 edge

6424
02:29:20,469 --> 02:29:20,479
See they're struggling at that 90 edge
 

6425
02:29:20,479 --> 02:29:22,230
See they're struggling at that 90 edge
of the gray box where that buyer's been

6426
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:22,240
of the gray box where that buyer's been
 

6427
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:24,710
of the gray box where that buyer's been
stuck. My expectations is it should go

6428
02:29:24,710 --> 02:29:24,720
stuck. My expectations is it should go
 

6429
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:25,910
stuck. My expectations is it should go
point of control, but it should have

6430
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:25,920
point of control, but it should have
 

6431
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:28,710
point of control, but it should have
already done it. It's a very slow market

6432
02:29:28,710 --> 02:29:28,720
already done it. It's a very slow market
 

6433
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:31,190
already done it. It's a very slow market
again. I'm not in anything here. I'm

6434
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:31,200
again. I'm not in anything here. I'm
 

6435
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:32,550
again. I'm not in anything here. I'm
just calling what I'm seeing. I've

6436
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:32,560
just calling what I'm seeing. I've
 

6437
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:37,270
just calling what I'm seeing. I've
already have my trades.

6438
02:29:37,270 --> 02:29:37,280

 

6439
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,030

VIX low of day as well, folks. So,

6440
02:29:39,030 --> 02:29:39,040
VIX low of day as well, folks. So,
 

6441
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:40,950
VIX low of day as well, folks. So,
everything timing here for a potential

6442
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:40,960
everything timing here for a potential
 

6443
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:45,670
everything timing here for a potential
squeeze up

6444
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:45,680

 

6445
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:47,990

that 90. What do we say? 1985. That's

6446
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:48,000
that 90. What do we say? 1985. That's
 

6447
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,910
that 90. What do we say? 1985. That's
the level. We're now stuck between 90

6448
02:29:49,910 --> 02:29:49,920
the level. We're now stuck between 90
 

6449
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:53,190
the level. We're now stuck between 90
and 85. Right. So, we just give it.

6450
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:53,200
and 85. Right. So, we just give it.
 

6451
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:55,510
and 85. Right. So, we just give it.
We just talked about it. Let's see if

6452
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:55,520
We just talked about it. Let's see if
 

6453
02:29:55,520 --> 02:30:09,670
We just talked about it. Let's see if
the buyer reloads at 90 and if they soak

6454
02:30:09,670 --> 02:30:09,680

 

6455
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:11,750

they're trying to soak 85. He tried to

6456
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:11,760
they're trying to soak 85. He tried to
 

6457
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:13,670
they're trying to soak 85. He tried to
reload there at 90. He just came in and

6458
02:30:13,670 --> 02:30:13,680
reload there at 90. He just came in and
 

6459
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:16,070
reload there at 90. He just came in and
just literally as I said that he's 153

6460
02:30:16,070 --> 02:30:16,080
just literally as I said that he's 153
 

6461
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:18,710
just literally as I said that he's 153
lot long at 90. So he's just added if he

6462
02:30:18,710 --> 02:30:18,720
lot long at 90. So he's just added if he
 

6463
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:20,150
lot long at 90. So he's just added if he
doesn't get a breakout soon he's going

6464
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:20,160
doesn't get a breakout soon he's going
 

6465
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:22,469
doesn't get a breakout soon he's going
to get very very unhappy and get caught.

6466
02:30:22,469 --> 02:30:22,479
to get very very unhappy and get caught.
 

6467
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:24,710
to get very very unhappy and get caught.
So here's the move back to 85. He's now

6468
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:24,720
So here's the move back to 85. He's now
 

6469
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:27,030
So here's the move back to 85. He's now
trying to soak 85. So, we've got a big

6470
02:30:27,030 --> 02:30:27,040
trying to soak 85. So, we've got a big
 

6471
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:28,550
trying to soak 85. So, we've got a big
player here trying to absorb his book at

6472
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:28,560
player here trying to absorb his book at
 

6473
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:31,030
player here trying to absorb his book at
85 and add at 90. If he does not get his

6474
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:31,040
85 and add at 90. If he does not get his
 

6475
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:32,790
85 and add at 90. If he does not get his
way, he's going to have too much size on

6476
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:32,800
way, he's going to have too much size on
 

6477
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:34,309
way, he's going to have too much size on
this book and you're going to see a

6478
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:34,319
this book and you're going to see a
 

6479
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:36,389
this book and you're going to see a
nasty snap. So, he needs this to break

6480
02:30:36,389 --> 02:30:36,399
nasty snap. So, he needs this to break
 

6481
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:39,750
nasty snap. So, he needs this to break
above 90 soon

6482
02:30:39,750 --> 02:30:39,760
above 90 soon
 

6483
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:41,590
above 90 soon
because all he's doing is adding buyside

6484
02:30:41,590 --> 02:30:41,600
because all he's doing is adding buyside
 

6485
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:43,510
because all he's doing is adding buyside
delta here. And there's no sellside

6486
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:43,520
delta here. And there's no sellside
 

6487
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:45,670
delta here. And there's no sellside
delta. They're just soaking this like

6488
02:30:45,670 --> 02:30:45,680
delta. They're just soaking this like
 

6489
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:48,070
delta. They're just soaking this like
passively sitting reloading, reloading,

6490
02:30:48,070 --> 02:30:48,080
passively sitting reloading, reloading,
 

6491
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:49,590
passively sitting reloading, reloading,
reloading. But the moment this breaks

6492
02:30:49,590 --> 02:30:49,600
reloading. But the moment this breaks
 

6493
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:52,230
reloading. But the moment this breaks
90, we will go 700. But if he can't get

6494
02:30:52,230 --> 02:30:52,240
90, we will go 700. But if he can't get
 

6495
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:54,389
90, we will go 700. But if he can't get
his move, he's going to get washed out.

6496
02:30:54,389 --> 02:30:54,399
his move, he's going to get washed out.
 

6497
02:30:54,399 --> 02:30:56,150
his move, he's going to get washed out.
So, this is one player who might be

6498
02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:56,160
So, this is one player who might be
 

6499
02:30:56,160 --> 02:31:03,429
So, this is one player who might be
stuck here.

6500
02:31:03,429 --> 02:31:03,439

 

6501
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:04,790

I'm always interested in these moves

6502
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:04,800
I'm always interested in these moves
 

6503
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:06,790
I'm always interested in these moves
when there's like 50 to 100 points to

6504
02:31:06,790 --> 02:31:06,800
when there's like 50 to 100 points to
 

6505
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:08,150
when there's like 50 to 100 points to
play with, but not when we're talking

6506
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:08,160
play with, but not when we're talking
 

6507
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:12,630
play with, but not when we're talking
about five point rotations.

6508
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:12,640

 

6509
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:14,230

So, you can if they don't get back above

6510
02:31:14,230 --> 02:31:14,240
So, you can if they don't get back above
 

6511
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:19,830
So, you can if they don't get back above
85, he's going to be caught.

6512
02:31:19,830 --> 02:31:19,840

 

6513
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:21,030

He's getting caught here. They're being

6514
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:21,040
He's getting caught here. They're being
 

6515
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,230
He's getting caught here. They're being
aggressive. He's caught. He's starting

6516
02:31:22,230 --> 02:31:22,240
aggressive. He's caught. He's starting
 

6517
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:23,750
aggressive. He's caught. He's starting
to stop out here. They're going to wash

6518
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:23,760
to stop out here. They're going to wash
 

6519
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,990
to stop out here. They're going to wash
him out now by the looks of it. If he

6520
02:31:25,990 --> 02:31:26,000
him out now by the looks of it. If he
 

6521
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:31,510
him out now by the looks of it. If he
can't get back above 85, he's offside.

6522
02:31:31,510 --> 02:31:31,520

 

6523
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:34,389

So 78 is by side delta. 75 by side

6524
02:31:34,389 --> 02:31:34,399
So 78 is by side delta. 75 by side
 

6525
02:31:34,399 --> 02:31:36,710
So 78 is by side delta. 75 by side
delta. I'd say under 75. And you can get

6526
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:36,720
delta. I'd say under 75. And you can get
 

6527
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:38,550
delta. I'd say under 75. And you can get
a little snap,

6528
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:38,560
a little snap,
 

6529
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:41,270
a little snap,
little low volume node there. And value

6530
02:31:41,270 --> 02:31:41,280
little low volume node there. And value
 

6531
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:43,670
little low volume node there. And value
area high on the day for me, not for you

6532
02:31:43,670 --> 02:31:43,680
area high on the day for me, not for you
 

6533
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:45,110
area high on the day for me, not for you
guys, but for what I'm looking at Ninja

6534
02:31:45,110 --> 02:31:45,120
guys, but for what I'm looking at Ninja
 

6535
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:47,270
guys, but for what I'm looking at Ninja
Trader is 75. So if we drift below that

6536
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:47,280
Trader is 75. So if we drift below that
 

6537
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,630
Trader is 75. So if we drift below that
based on delta, we're going to come all

6538
02:31:48,630 --> 02:31:48,640
based on delta, we're going to come all
 

6539
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:50,710
based on delta, we're going to come all
the way down to 50s. Well, definitely to

6540
02:31:50,710 --> 02:31:50,720
the way down to 50s. Well, definitely to
 

6541
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:53,670
the way down to 50s. Well, definitely to
60s and 50s. So, his stops are starting

6542
02:31:53,670 --> 02:31:53,680
60s and 50s. So, his stops are starting
 

6543
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:55,030
60s and 50s. So, his stops are starting
to get run here. He's starting to get

6544
02:31:55,030 --> 02:31:55,040
to get run here. He's starting to get
 

6545
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:57,190
to get run here. He's starting to get
bit a little bit panicky. He oversized

6546
02:31:57,190 --> 02:31:57,200
bit a little bit panicky. He oversized
 

6547
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,429
bit a little bit panicky. He oversized
between 85 and 90 and he hasn't got his

6548
02:31:59,429 --> 02:31:59,439
between 85 and 90 and he hasn't got his
 

6549
02:31:59,439 --> 02:32:02,150
between 85 and 90 and he hasn't got his
way. And if they snap here, it's uh

6550
02:32:02,150 --> 02:32:02,160
way. And if they snap here, it's uh
 

6551
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:03,670
way. And if they snap here, it's uh
night night, sweetheart. There you go.

6552
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:03,680
night night, sweetheart. There you go.
 

6553
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,830
night night, sweetheart. There you go.
Goodbye, buddy. So, he just caught him.

6554
02:32:05,830 --> 02:32:05,840
Goodbye, buddy. So, he just caught him.
 

6555
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:08,710
Goodbye, buddy. So, he just caught him.
He got himself caught.

6556
02:32:08,710 --> 02:32:08,720
He got himself caught.
 

6557
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:10,630
He got himself caught.
And you can't see that in candles,

6558
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:10,640
And you can't see that in candles,
 

6559
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:12,389
And you can't see that in candles,
right? You cannot see that in candles.

6560
02:32:12,389 --> 02:32:12,399
right? You cannot see that in candles.
 

6561
02:32:12,399 --> 02:32:13,670
right? You cannot see that in candles.
That's me telling you what's actually

6562
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:13,680
That's me telling you what's actually
 

6563
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:16,309
That's me telling you what's actually
going on.

6564
02:32:16,309 --> 02:32:16,319
going on.
 

6565
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:18,389
going on.
This This right here told the story. All

6566
02:32:18,389 --> 02:32:18,399
This This right here told the story. All
 

6567
02:32:18,399 --> 02:32:20,630
This This right here told the story. All
right. You see, I said 90 and 85.

6568
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:20,640
right. You see, I said 90 and 85.
 

6569
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:23,670
right. You see, I said 90 and 85.
There's the move up to 90. Here's 85. He

6570
02:32:23,670 --> 02:32:23,680
There's the move up to 90. Here's 85. He
 

6571
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:26,870
There's the move up to 90. Here's 85. He
added so much in here and here. And he

6572
02:32:26,870 --> 02:32:26,880
added so much in here and here. And he
 

6573
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,389
added so much in here and here. And he
didn't get his way. So, he started to

6574
02:32:28,389 --> 02:32:28,399
didn't get his way. So, he started to
 

6575
02:32:28,399 --> 02:32:29,990
didn't get his way. So, he started to
panic. Sellers came in and now he's

6576
02:32:29,990 --> 02:32:30,000
panic. Sellers came in and now he's
 

6577
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,750
panic. Sellers came in and now he's
stopping out. And there's the rotation

6578
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:31,760
stopping out. And there's the rotation
 

6579
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:32,950
stopping out. And there's the rotation
all the way back down to point of

6580
02:32:32,950 --> 02:32:32,960
all the way back down to point of
 

6581
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:34,150
all the way back down to point of
control that we just talked about.

6582
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:34,160
control that we just talked about.
 

6583
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:35,590
control that we just talked about.
Right? So, it's happening right before

6584
02:32:35,590 --> 02:32:35,600
Right? So, it's happening right before
 

6585
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:37,990
Right? So, it's happening right before
your eyes. That is the advantage of

6586
02:32:37,990 --> 02:32:38,000
your eyes. That is the advantage of
 

6587
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:48,790
your eyes. That is the advantage of
understanding order flow.

6588
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:48,800

 

6589
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,870

looking for a push down to 608. I mean,

6590
02:32:50,870 --> 02:32:50,880
looking for a push down to 608. I mean,
 

6591
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:53,030
looking for a push down to 608. I mean,
I I I would say respect what's in front

6592
02:32:53,030 --> 02:32:53,040
I I I would say respect what's in front
 

6593
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:57,190
I I I would say respect what's in front
of you, right? Your inside value.

6594
02:32:57,190 --> 02:32:57,200
of you, right? Your inside value.
 

6595
02:32:57,200 --> 02:32:59,910
of you, right? Your inside value.
Respect this P, right? Your inside

6596
02:32:59,910 --> 02:32:59,920
Respect this P, right? Your inside
 

6597
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:03,429
Respect this P, right? Your inside
value. If you get underneath,

6598
02:33:03,429 --> 02:33:03,439
value. If you get underneath,
 

6599
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:05,110
value. If you get underneath,
it's dangerous, isn't it? If you get

6600
02:33:05,110 --> 02:33:05,120
it's dangerous, isn't it? If you get
 

6601
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:07,590
it's dangerous, isn't it? If you get
underneath 50s and underneath the New

6602
02:33:07,590 --> 02:33:07,600
underneath 50s and underneath the New
 

6603
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,750
underneath 50s and underneath the New
York open and by that time hopefully

6604
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:09,760
York open and by that time hopefully
 

6605
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:11,270
York open and by that time hopefully
VWOPS here. If you get a snap of that

6606
02:33:11,270 --> 02:33:11,280
VWOPS here. If you get a snap of that
 

6607
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,110
VWOPS here. If you get a snap of that
then I think you get back down to those

6608
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:13,120
then I think you get back down to those
 

6609
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:15,750
then I think you get back down to those
low 600s. But don't if you if you've

6610
02:33:15,750 --> 02:33:15,760
low 600s. But don't if you if you've
 

6611
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:17,349
low 600s. But don't if you if you've
played this short on what I was just

6612
02:33:17,349 --> 02:33:17,359
played this short on what I was just
 

6613
02:33:17,359 --> 02:33:18,870
played this short on what I was just
talking about if you've played that just

6614
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:18,880
talking about if you've played that just
 

6615
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:23,030
talking about if you've played that just
pay yourself because we're inside right

6616
02:33:23,030 --> 02:33:23,040
pay yourself because we're inside right
 

6617
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:26,550
pay yourself because we're inside right
think about previous week

6618
02:33:26,550 --> 02:33:26,560
think about previous week
 

6619
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:28,710
think about previous week
think about current day. We're inside

6620
02:33:28,710 --> 02:33:28,720
think about current day. We're inside
 

6621
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:32,230
think about current day. We're inside
the rotation. You got to pay yourself. I

6622
02:33:32,230 --> 02:33:32,240
the rotation. You got to pay yourself. I
 

6623
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:33,670
the rotation. You got to pay yourself. I
mean, there's clearly an aggressive

6624
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:33,680
mean, there's clearly an aggressive
 

6625
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:36,630
mean, there's clearly an aggressive
buyer here today

6626
02:33:36,630 --> 02:33:36,640
buyer here today
 

6627
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,550
buyer here today
who just got washed out. So, who knows

6628
02:33:38,550 --> 02:33:38,560
who just got washed out. So, who knows
 

6629
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,830
who just got washed out. So, who knows
if he comes back on. So, we're going

6630
02:33:39,830 --> 02:33:39,840
if he comes back on. So, we're going
 

6631
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:42,790
if he comes back on. So, we're going
back to 85. So, 85 to 90 is that same

6632
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:42,800
back to 85. So, 85 to 90 is that same
 

6633
02:33:42,800 --> 02:33:45,750
back to 85. So, 85 to 90 is that same
point. So, he's just rebid aggressively

6634
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:45,760
point. So, he's just rebid aggressively
 

6635
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:48,389
point. So, he's just rebid aggressively
from 67. So, the question now is can he

6636
02:33:48,389 --> 02:33:48,399
from 67. So, the question now is can he
 

6637
02:33:48,399 --> 02:33:50,790
from 67. So, the question now is can he
get back above 85? Is he if he can't,

6638
02:33:50,790 --> 02:33:50,800
get back above 85? Is he if he can't,
 

6639
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:56,790
get back above 85? Is he if he can't,
he's just going to be stuck again?

6640
02:33:56,790 --> 02:33:56,800

 

6641
02:33:56,800 --> 02:33:57,990

How do I know where the buyers and

6642
02:33:57,990 --> 02:33:58,000
How do I know where the buyers and
 

6643
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,270
How do I know where the buyers and
sellers are? Do you see them on the book

6644
02:33:59,270 --> 02:33:59,280
sellers are? Do you see them on the book
 

6645
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,270
sellers are? Do you see them on the book
map? Yeah, I'm literally That's exactly

6646
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:01,280
map? Yeah, I'm literally That's exactly
 

6647
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:03,349
map? Yeah, I'm literally That's exactly
it. And that's why I have them literally

6648
02:34:03,349 --> 02:34:03,359
it. And that's why I have them literally
 

6649
02:34:03,359 --> 02:34:04,790
it. And that's why I have them literally
watching them. I can see their pain

6650
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:04,800
watching them. I can see their pain
 

6651
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:06,870
watching them. I can see their pain
point. I can see how they're

6652
02:34:06,870 --> 02:34:06,880
point. I can see how they're
 

6653
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:11,910
point. I can see how they're
participating.

6654
02:34:11,910 --> 02:34:11,920

 

6655
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:13,190

No, I haven't done the giveaway yet.

6656
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:13,200
No, I haven't done the giveaway yet.
 

6657
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:15,750
No, I haven't done the giveaway yet.
We'll do it at the uh 15 minutes or

6658
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:15,760
We'll do it at the uh 15 minutes or
 

6659
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:20,550
We'll do it at the uh 15 minutes or
whatever it is. We'll do it then.

6660
02:34:20,550 --> 02:34:20,560

 

6661
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:23,030

I tell you what though.

6662
02:34:23,030 --> 02:34:23,040
I tell you what though.
 

6663
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:24,630
I tell you what though.
Divergence ES and it's holding above

6664
02:34:24,630 --> 02:34:24,640
Divergence ES and it's holding above
 

6665
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:25,990
Divergence ES and it's holding above
initial balance. They just rebid it. All

6666
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:26,000
initial balance. They just rebid it. All
 

6667
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,469
initial balance. They just rebid it. All
right. Here's 85s. And if they get

6668
02:34:28,469 --> 02:34:28,479
right. Here's 85s. And if they get
 

6669
02:34:28,479 --> 02:34:30,070
right. Here's 85s. And if they get
through that, he wants to check 90. If

6670
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:30,080
through that, he wants to check 90. If
 

6671
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:31,750
through that, he wants to check 90. If
they get through 90, you probably get a

6672
02:34:31,750 --> 02:34:31,760
they get through 90, you probably get a
 

6673
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:36,150
they get through 90, you probably get a
squeeze.

6674
02:34:36,150 --> 02:34:36,160

 

6675
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:37,910

You get through 90, I would say probably

6676
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:37,920
You get through 90, I would say probably
 

6677
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:40,150
You get through 90, I would say probably
going to get uh previous point control,

6678
02:34:40,150 --> 02:34:40,160
going to get uh previous point control,
 

6679
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:49,110
going to get uh previous point control,
probably going to hit 700s.

6680
02:34:49,110 --> 02:34:49,120

 

6681
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:50,870

Can you use regular volume profile to

6682
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:50,880
Can you use regular volume profile to
 

6683
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:53,510
Can you use regular volume profile to
spot them? Um, no. I mean, you you'll be

6684
02:34:53,510 --> 02:34:53,520
spot them? Um, no. I mean, you you'll be
 

6685
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:56,070
spot them? Um, no. I mean, you you'll be
able to see the levels of of some

6686
02:34:56,070 --> 02:34:56,080
able to see the levels of of some
 

6687
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:59,510
able to see the levels of of some
importance, but uh not to the same

6688
02:34:59,510 --> 02:34:59,520
importance, but uh not to the same
 

6689
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:01,590
importance, but uh not to the same
extent because you won't be able to see

6690
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:01,600
extent because you won't be able to see
 

6691
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:03,429
extent because you won't be able to see
if they're a buyer or seller or where

6692
02:35:03,429 --> 02:35:03,439
if they're a buyer or seller or where
 

6693
02:35:03,439 --> 02:35:05,030
if they're a buyer or seller or where
they're stuck or how much size they

6694
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:05,040
they're stuck or how much size they
 

6695
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:06,389
they're stuck or how much size they
have. You'll just know that, oh, there's

6696
02:35:06,389 --> 02:35:06,399
have. You'll just know that, oh, there's
 

6697
02:35:06,399 --> 02:35:10,230
have. You'll just know that, oh, there's
a node there. You won't know who's

6698
02:35:10,230 --> 02:35:10,240
a node there. You won't know who's
 

6699
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:11,750
a node there. You won't know who's
participated there and what their pain

6700
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:11,760
participated there and what their pain
 

6701
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:13,590
participated there and what their pain
point is, right? So, if you see a new a

6702
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:13,600
point is, right? So, if you see a new a
 

6703
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:15,830
point is, right? So, if you see a new a
huge node, you don't know if it's, you

6704
02:35:15,830 --> 02:35:15,840
huge node, you don't know if it's, you
 

6705
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,349
huge node, you don't know if it's, you
know, more selling in there or more

6706
02:35:17,349 --> 02:35:17,359
know, more selling in there or more
 

6707
02:35:17,359 --> 02:35:21,750
know, more selling in there or more
buying in there.

6708
02:35:21,750 --> 02:35:21,760

 

6709
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:24,230

So they rejected 90s again, getting back

6710
02:35:24,230 --> 02:35:24,240
So they rejected 90s again, getting back
 

6711
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:26,309
So they rejected 90s again, getting back
under 85s again. You can see this

6712
02:35:26,309 --> 02:35:26,319
under 85s again. You can see this
 

6713
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:29,910
under 85s again. You can see this
rotation so important. 85 and 90s, I'm

6714
02:35:29,910 --> 02:35:29,920
rotation so important. 85 and 90s, I'm
 

6715
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,750
rotation so important. 85 and 90s, I'm
telling you, they are your levels right

6716
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:31,760
telling you, they are your levels right
 

6717
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:36,309
telling you, they are your levels right
now.

6718
02:35:36,309 --> 02:35:36,319

02:35:52,070 --> 02:35:52,080
always away NFC and the amount of times
 

6725
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:56,790
always away NFC and the amount of times
I have that it's unreal.

6726
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:56,800

6765
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:57,990
walking price up right now. So, it's
bullish.

6766
02:36:57,990 --> 02:36:58,000

aggressive selling, lower highs

6774
02:37:12,309 --> 02:37:12,319

 

6775
02:37:12,319 --> 02:37:14,070

moving up. That means there's a passive

6776
02:37:14,070 --> 02:37:14,080
moving up. That means there's a passive
 

6777
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:16,389
moving up. That means there's a passive
buyer walking price up because the

6778
02:37:16,389 --> 02:37:16,399
buyer walking price up because the
 

6779
02:37:16,399 --> 02:37:17,990
buyer walking price up because the
aggressors are the sellers here. That

6780
02:37:17,990 --> 02:37:18,000
aggressors are the sellers here. That
 

6781
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,190
aggressors are the sellers here. That
might start to shift. If you get an

6782
02:37:19,190 --> 02:37:19,200
might start to shift. If you get an
 

6783
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:20,630
might start to shift. If you get an
aggressive buyer coming, you can really

6784
02:37:20,630 --> 02:37:20,640
aggressive buyer coming, you can really
 

6785
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:22,870
aggressive buyer coming, you can really
start squeezing.

6786
02:37:22,870 --> 02:37:22,880
start squeezing.
 

6787
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:25,190
start squeezing.
But this is bullish, right? If you if

6788
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:25,200
But this is bullish, right? If you if
 

6789
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:27,190
But this is bullish, right? If you if
you if price is moving up and CVD is

6790
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:27,200
you if price is moving up and CVD is
 

6791
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:28,389
you if price is moving up and CVD is
moving down, it's bullish. Means you've

6792
02:37:28,389 --> 02:37:28,399
moving down, it's bullish. Means you've
 

6793
02:37:28,399 --> 02:37:29,750
moving down, it's bullish. Means you've
got passive buyers and aggressive

6794
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:29,760
got passive buyers and aggressive
 

6795
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:31,990
got passive buyers and aggressive
sellers getting absolutely clobbered.

6796
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:32,000
sellers getting absolutely clobbered.
 

6797
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,750
sellers getting absolutely clobbered.
So, let's think about it. You got market

6798
02:37:33,750 --> 02:37:33,760
So, let's think about it. You got market
 

6799
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:35,110
So, let's think about it. You got market
order selling. Sell more. Sell more.

6800
02:37:35,110 --> 02:37:35,120
order selling. Sell more. Sell more.
 

6801
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:36,870
order selling. Sell more. Sell more.
Sell more. Somewhere. Somewhere. Yeah.

Sell more. Somewhere. Somewhere. Yeah.
 

6803
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:45,190
Sell more. Somewhere. Somewhere. Yeah.
See the divergence. Yeah. Nice.

6804
02:37:45,190 --> 02:37:45,200

 

6805
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:46,389

Okay, here we go. They're through the

6806
02:37:46,389 --> 02:37:46,399
Okay, here we go. They're through the
 

6807
02:37:46,399 --> 02:37:48,710
Okay, here we go. They're through the
90s. So, my expectation now is the 700s

6808
02:37:48,710 --> 02:37:48,720
90s. So, my expectation now is the 700s
 

6809
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:59,190
90s. So, my expectation now is the 700s
and that previous week point control.

6810
02:37:59,190 --> 02:37:59,200

 

6811

know what people's backgrounds are.

6822
02:38:19,190 --> 02:38:19,200

 

6823
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:28,070

Michael Kane.

6824
02:38:28,070 --> 02:38:28,080

 

6825
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:47,110

Almost there, man. Very very close.

6826
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:47,120

 

6827
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:49,510

value area high now moved up folks. So

6828
02:38:49,510 --> 02:38:49,520
value area high now moved up folks. So
 

6829
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:51,990
value area high now moved up folks. So
690 now value area high. We're still

6830
02:38:51,990 --> 02:38:52,000
690 now value area high. We're still
 

6831
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,670
690 now value area high. We're still
rebidding. So we're still continuing to

6832
02:38:53,670 --> 02:38:53,680
rebidding. So we're still continuing to
 

6833
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:56,309
rebidding. So we're still continuing to
move value higher. This is still very

6834
02:38:56,309 --> 02:38:56,319
move value higher. This is still very
 

6835
02:38:56,319 --> 02:39:00,550
move value higher. This is still very
bullish. There you go. So here's 700s.

6836
02:39:00,550 --> 02:39:00,560
bullish. There you go. So here's 700s.
 

6837
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:02,469
bullish. There you go. So here's 700s.
Lovely move into 700s here. So, make

6838
02:39:02,469 --> 02:39:02,479
Lovely move into 700s here. So, make
 

6839
02:39:02,479 --> 02:39:03,510
Lovely move into 700s here. So, make
sure you're locking some in. You're

6840
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:03,520
sure you're locking some in. You're
 

6841
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:04,630
sure you're locking some in. You're
seeing some aggressive buying take

6842
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:04,640
seeing some aggressive buying take
 

6843
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:05,990
seeing some aggressive buying take
place. I think you might get a little

6844
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:06,000
place. I think you might get a little
 

6845
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,309
place. I think you might get a little
tickle higher here. There was passive

6846
02:39:08,309 --> 02:39:08,319
tickle higher here. There was passive
 

6847
02:39:08,319 --> 02:39:10,070
tickle higher here. There was passive
selling at 700. I think you might get

6848
02:39:10,070 --> 02:39:10,080
selling at 700. I think you might get
 

6849
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:15,110
selling at 700. I think you might get
one little more shove up through it.

6850
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:15,120

 

6851
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:16,630

our box?

6860
02:39:25,990 --> 02:39:26,000

short didn't last very long. That one

6868
02:39:33,990 --> 02:39:34,000
short didn't last very long. That one
 

6869
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,510
short didn't last very long. That one
player got stuck, but the moment they

6870
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:35,520
player got stuck, but the moment they
 

6871
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:37,590
player got stuck, but the moment they
reclaimed, he took over. Like we said,

6872
02:39:37,590 --> 02:39:37,600
reclaimed, he took over. Like we said,
 

6873
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:39,910
reclaimed, he took over. Like we said,
we had a strong buyer on the tape. 85 to

6874

we had a strong buyer on the tape. 85 to
 

6875
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:41,990
we had a strong buyer on the tape. 85 to
90s. He's now in the money. And you

6876
02:39:41,990 --> 02:39:42,000

it. I mean, how long did they take to do
 

6885
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:51,110
it. I mean, how long did they take to do
that? Incredible. Anything above this is

that? Incredible. Anything above this is
 

6887
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:52,630
that? Incredible. Anything above this is
a bonus. You can see a little reaction

6888
02:39:52,630 --> 02:39:52,640
a bonus. You can see a little reaction
 

6889
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,870
a bonus. You can see a little reaction
there into PC. Anything above this now

6890
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:54,880
there into PC. Anything above this now
 

6891
02:39:54,880 --> 02:40:09,910
there into PC. Anything above this now
is an absolute bonus.

6892
02:40:09,910 --> 02:40:09,920

 

6893
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:11,190

You've never seen anyone talking about

6894
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:11,200
You've never seen anyone talking about
 

6895
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:14,389
You've never seen anyone talking about
value area maps and footprints. Yeah,

6896
02:40:14,389 --> 02:40:14,399
value area maps and footprints. Yeah,
 

6897
02:40:14,399 --> 02:40:17,510
value area maps and footprints. Yeah,
because most most people on YouTube are

6898
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:17,520
because most most people on YouTube are
 

6899
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:21,429
because most most people on YouTube are
full of [\h__\h]

6900
02:40:21,429 --> 02:40:21,439

 

6901
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:23,750

Bro, bro, I got a fair value gap, bro.

6902
02:40:23,750 --> 02:40:23,760
Bro, bro, I got a fair value gap, bro.
 

6903
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:26,790
Bro, bro, I got a fair value gap, bro.
Oh my god. This guy ICT told me how to

6904
02:40:26,790 --> 02:40:26,800
Oh my god. This guy ICT told me how to
 

6905
02:40:26,800 --> 02:40:29,830
Oh my god. This guy ICT told me how to
shut [\h__\h] up. That's the problem right

6906
02:40:29,830 --> 02:40:29,840
shut [\h__\h] up. That's the problem right
 

6907
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:38,469
shut [\h__\h] up. That's the problem right
there.

6908
02:40:38,469 --> 02:40:38,479

 

6909
02:40:38,479 --> 02:40:40,070

That's not a digger, you guys. That's

6910
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:40,080
That's not a digger, you guys. That's
 

6911
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:43,110
That's not a digger, you guys. That's
just like what YouTube is, right?

6912
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:43,120
just like what YouTube is, right?
 

6913
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:45,270
just like what YouTube is, right?
The truth is everything works. It's just

6914
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:45,280
The truth is everything works. It's just
 

6915
02:40:45,280 --> 02:40:49,030
The truth is everything works. It's just
how much detail do you want?

6916
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:49,040
how much detail do you want?
 

6917
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:52,630
how much detail do you want?
I could dumb it all down for you. Like

6918
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:52,640
I could dumb it all down for you. Like
 

6919
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:54,309
I could dumb it all down for you. Like
you can use the gap, you can use fair

6920
02:40:54,309 --> 02:40:54,319
you can use the gap, you can use fair
 

6921
02:40:54,319 --> 02:40:56,870
you can use the gap, you can use fair
value gaps. Like you can they exist.

6922
02:40:56,870 --> 02:40:56,880
value gaps. Like you can they exist.
 

6923
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:59,590
value gaps. Like you can they exist.
They're just not necessarily accurate

6924
02:40:59,590 --> 02:40:59,600
They're just not necessarily accurate
 

6925
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:01,270
They're just not necessarily accurate
because where you see a gap won't

6926
02:41:01,270 --> 02:41:01,280
because where you see a gap won't
 

6927
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:02,950
because where you see a gap won't
necessarily be where the imbalance is

6928
02:41:02,950 --> 02:41:02,960
necessarily be where the imbalance is
 

6929
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:05,830
necessarily be where the imbalance is
because the imbalance is like based on

6930
02:41:05,830 --> 02:41:05,840
because the imbalance is like based on
 

6931
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:12,389
because the imbalance is like based on
how that transaction took place.

6932
02:41:12,389 --> 02:41:12,399

 

6933
02:41:12,399 --> 02:41:13,670

Well, brother, you killed that trade

6934
02:41:13,670 --> 02:41:13,680
Well, brother, you killed that trade
 

6935
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:14,950
Well, brother, you killed that trade
from the start. I got stopped out, but

6936
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:14,960
from the start. I got stopped out, but
 

6937
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:17,349
from the start. I got stopped out, but
it's fine. Oh, you're welcome, man. No

6938
02:41:17,349 --> 02:41:17,359
it's fine. Oh, you're welcome, man. No
 

6939
02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:19,590
it's fine. Oh, you're welcome, man. No
worries. No worries, guys. Which bookmap

6940
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:19,600
worries. No worries, guys. Which bookmap
 

6941
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:21,349
worries. No worries, guys. Which bookmap
package do I use just so I can trade

6942
02:41:21,349 --> 02:41:21,359
package do I use just so I can trade
 

6943
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:23,990
package do I use just so I can trade
with the same info? Uh you just need uh

6944
02:41:23,990 --> 02:41:24,000
with the same info? Uh you just need uh
 

6945
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,389
with the same info? Uh you just need uh
standard one just with CME data or or

6946
02:41:26,389 --> 02:41:26,399
standard one just with CME data or or
 

6947
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:28,230
standard one just with CME data or or
just some data feed. You don't need

6948
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:28,240
just some data feed. You don't need
 

6949
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:29,750
just some data feed. You don't need
anything special guys. I don't use any

6950
02:41:29,750 --> 02:41:29,760
anything special guys. I don't use any
 

6951
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:32,550
anything special guys. I don't use any
of like the huge indicators or you you

6952
02:41:32,550 --> 02:41:32,560
of like the huge indicators or you you
 

6953
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:34,469
of like the huge indicators or you you
literally if you're reading price you

6954
02:41:34,469 --> 02:41:34,479
literally if you're reading price you
 

6955
02:41:34,479 --> 02:41:35,990
literally if you're reading price you
don't you don't need it. I mean I know

6956
02:41:35,990 --> 02:41:36,000
don't you don't need it. I mean I know
 

6957
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,830
don't you don't need it. I mean I know
some guys like having icebergs and all

6958
02:41:37,830 --> 02:41:37,840
some guys like having icebergs and all
 

6959
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:40,550
some guys like having icebergs and all
that stuff. My opinion is you don't need

6960
02:41:40,550 --> 02:41:40,560
that stuff. My opinion is you don't need
 

6961
02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:42,950
that stuff. My opinion is you don't need
it. But

6962
02:41:42,950 --> 02:41:42,960
it. But
 

6963
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:45,190
it. But
look that's just my opinion. You guys

6964
02:41:45,190 --> 02:41:45,200
look that's just my opinion. You guys
 

6965
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:47,830
look that's just my opinion. You guys
should should use whatever you whatever

6966
02:41:47,830 --> 02:41:47,840
should should use whatever you whatever
 

6967
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:49,830
should should use whatever you whatever
resonates with you. If I if I don't

6968
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:49,840
resonates with you. If I if I don't
 

6969
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:51,510
resonates with you. If I if I don't
resonate with you, don't don't don't

6970
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:51,520
resonate with you, don't don't don't
 

6971
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:53,030
resonate with you, don't don't don't
trade my way, you know, and and that's

6972
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,040
trade my way, you know, and and that's
 

6973
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:58,230
trade my way, you know, and and that's
fine. There's plenty of ways to trade.

6974
02:41:58,230 --> 02:41:58,240

 

6975
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:01,190

No, I mean, we don't we we don't go

6976
02:42:01,190 --> 02:42:01,200
No, I mean, we don't we we don't go
 

6977
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,870
No, I mean, we don't we we don't go
short just because we hit an area. This

6978
02:42:02,870 --> 02:42:02,880
short just because we hit an area. This
 

6979
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:04,870
short just because we hit an area. This
this is a level of interest, right?

6980
02:42:04,870 --> 02:42:04,880
this is a level of interest, right?
 

6981
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:06,710
this is a level of interest, right?
Imagine you go short. Now, we talked

6982
02:42:06,710 --> 02:42:06,720
Imagine you go short. Now, we talked
 

6983
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:08,150
Imagine you go short. Now, we talked
about this, right? Imagine you got short

6984
02:42:08,150 --> 02:42:08,160
about this, right? Imagine you got short
 

6985
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,990
about this, right? Imagine you got short
here in the edge of the gray box and

6986
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,000
here in the edge of the gray box and
 

6987
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,230
here in the edge of the gray box and
you've added short here and the price

6988
02:42:12,230 --> 02:42:12,240
you've added short here and the price
 

6989
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:13,910
you've added short here and the price
squeeze up to here and you add and now

6990
02:42:13,910 --> 02:42:13,920
squeeze up to here and you add and now
 

6991
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:15,750
squeeze up to here and you add and now
you're full size in here and they go,

6992
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:15,760
you're full size in here and they go,
 

6993
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:17,030
you're full size in here and they go,
"Well, [\h__\h] it. We're going to go and

6994
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:17,040
"Well, [\h__\h] it. We're going to go and
 

6995
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,870
"Well, [\h__\h] it. We're going to go and
take this out and run all the stops."

6996
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:18,880
take this out and run all the stops."
 

6997
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:20,309
take this out and run all the stops."
Right. We don't short. We talked about

6998
02:42:20,309 --> 02:42:20,319
Right. We don't short. We talked about
 

6999
02:42:20,319 --> 02:42:22,309
Right. We don't short. We talked about
this. We don't short front side. All

7000
02:42:22,309 --> 02:42:22,319
this. We don't short front side. All
 

7001
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:25,190
this. We don't short front side. All
right. Right. The We are doing this

7002
02:42:25,190 --> 02:42:25,200
right. Right. The We are doing this
 

7003
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:27,110
right. Right. The We are doing this
right now. Right. There is the maybe a

7004
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:27,120
right now. Right. There is the maybe a
 

7005
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:28,710
right now. Right. There is the maybe a
little snapshot down to here. That was

7006
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:28,720
little snapshot down to here. That was
 

7007
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:29,830
little snapshot down to here. That was
that was all you could have probably

7008
02:42:29,830 --> 02:42:29,840
that was all you could have probably
 

7009
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:32,070
that was all you could have probably
had. We're front side. We're going to

7010
02:42:32,070 --> 02:42:32,080
had. We're front side. We're going to
 

7011
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:34,070
had. We're front side. We're going to
need to leave volume trapped. We're

7012
02:42:34,070 --> 02:42:34,080
need to leave volume trapped. We're
 

7013
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:36,389
need to leave volume trapped. We're
either going to need excess high or

7014
02:42:36,389 --> 02:42:36,399
either going to need excess high or
 

7015
02:42:36,399 --> 02:42:38,230
either going to need excess high or
we're going to need to build out a shelf

7016
02:42:38,230 --> 02:42:38,240
we're going to need to build out a shelf
 

7017
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:39,910
we're going to need to build out a shelf
and leave volume trapped for the

7018
02:42:39,910 --> 02:42:39,920
and leave volume trapped for the
 

7019
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:42,150
and leave volume trapped for the
rotation back down. But I'll tell you

7020
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:42,160
rotation back down. But I'll tell you
 

7021
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:44,870
rotation back down. But I'll tell you
now, until you get below this, right,

7022
02:42:44,870 --> 02:42:44,880
now, until you get below this, right,
 

7023
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:47,030
now, until you get below this, right,
every short can be soaked off here or

7024
02:42:47,030 --> 02:42:47,040
every short can be soaked off here or
 

7025
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:48,870
every short can be soaked off here or
here, right? We can bounce off here. We

7026
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:48,880
here, right? We can bounce off here. We
 

7027
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:51,429
here, right? We can bounce off here. We
can bounce off here. But if we get too

7028
02:42:51,429 --> 02:42:51,439
can bounce off here. But if we get too
 

7029
02:42:51,439 --> 02:42:54,230
can bounce off here. But if we get too
much volume in here and we leave that,

7030
02:42:54,230 --> 02:42:54,240
much volume in here and we leave that,
 

7031
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:56,070
much volume in here and we leave that,
right, if we have this huge shelf and we

7032
02:42:56,070 --> 02:42:56,080
right, if we have this huge shelf and we
 

7033
02:42:56,080 --> 02:42:57,429
right, if we have this huge shelf and we
leave that, then you're going to get a

7034
02:42:57,429 --> 02:42:57,439
leave that, then you're going to get a
 

7035
02:42:57,439 --> 02:43:01,670
leave that, then you're going to get a
nice short.

7036
02:43:01,670 --> 02:43:01,680

 

7037
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:03,910

I've seen some profit taking here. Just

7038
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:03,920
I've seen some profit taking here. Just
 

7039
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:06,389
I've seen some profit taking here. Just
depends if they rebid this now on this

7040
02:43:06,389 --> 02:43:06,399
depends if they rebid this now on this
 

7041
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:11,910
depends if they rebid this now on this
value.

7042
02:43:11,910 --> 02:43:11,920

 

7043
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:14,070

Big sell off that strong sell. Let's see

7044
02:43:14,070 --> 02:43:14,080
Big sell off that strong sell. Let's see
 

7045
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,309
Big sell off that strong sell. Let's see
if they drive back up and resell it. And

7046
02:43:16,309 --> 02:43:16,319
if they drive back up and resell it. And
 

7047
02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:17,190
if they drive back up and resell it. And
that's what you're looking for.

7048
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:17,200
that's what you're looking for.
 

7049
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:18,790
that's what you're looking for.
Remember, you're looking for failed

7050
02:43:18,790 --> 02:43:18,800
Remember, you're looking for failed
 

7051
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:21,349
Remember, you're looking for failed
follow-through. You're looking for this

7052
02:43:21,349 --> 02:43:21,359
follow-through. You're looking for this
 

7053
02:43:21,359 --> 02:43:23,990
follow-through. You're looking for this
kind of move. It's quite nice. You're

7054
02:43:23,990 --> 02:43:24,000
kind of move. It's quite nice. You're
 

7055
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,270
kind of move. It's quite nice. You're
looking for failed follow through and a

7056
02:43:27,270 --> 02:43:27,280
looking for failed follow through and a
 

7057
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:29,270
looking for failed follow through and a
leave of rotation. And then you have to

7058
02:43:29,270 --> 02:43:29,280
leave of rotation. And then you have to
 

7059
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:31,670
leave of rotation. And then you have to
respect each level on the way down

7060
02:43:31,670 --> 02:43:31,680
respect each level on the way down
 

7061
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:35,190
respect each level on the way down
because it's created structure.

7062
02:43:35,190 --> 02:43:35,200
because it's created structure.
 

7063
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:38,710
because it's created structure.
PC was good. That was good level.

7064

7065
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:41,030
PC was good. That was good level.
Right. Look where we are. 85s, right?

7066
02:43:41,030 --> 02:43:41,040
Right. Look where we are. 85s, right?
 

7067
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:43,750
Right. Look where we are. 85s, right?
85s and 90s. So if he doesn't rebid

7068
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:43,760
85s and 90s. So if he doesn't rebid
 

7069
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:46,150
85s and 90s. So if he doesn't rebid
this, then we know he exited at PC.

7070
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:46,160
this, then we know he exited at PC.
 

7071
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:47,590
this, then we know he exited at PC.
You've got an imbalance now all the way

7072
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:47,600
You've got an imbalance now all the way
 

7073
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:49,110
You've got an imbalance now all the way
up to 95. Looking a little bit better

7074
02:43:49,110 --> 02:43:49,120
up to 95. Looking a little bit better
 

7075
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:51,030
up to 95. Looking a little bit better
for a short now. So if they push up and

7076
02:43:51,030 --> 02:43:51,040
for a short now. So if they push up and
 

7077
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:54,469
for a short now. So if they push up and
start failing, then maybe you're still

7078
02:43:54,469 --> 02:43:54,479
start failing, then maybe you're still
 

7079
02:43:54,479 --> 02:43:55,990
start failing, then maybe you're still
above initial balance. I will tell you

7080
02:43:55,990 --> 02:43:56,000
above initial balance. I will tell you
 

7081
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,830
above initial balance. I will tell you
that. And ES is comfortably above

7082
02:43:57,830 --> 02:43:57,840
that. And ES is comfortably above
 

7083
02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:04,550
that. And ES is comfortably above
initial balance as well.

7084
02:44:04,550 --> 02:44:04,560

 

7085
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:08,150

They're trying to bid 80s now. We know

7086
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:08,160
They're trying to bid 80s now. We know
 

7087
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:12,870
They're trying to bid 80s now. We know
that he came in at 85 and 90s. So I

7088
02:44:12,870 --> 02:44:12,880
that he came in at 85 and 90s. So I
 

7089
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:14,309
that he came in at 85 and 90s. So I
would be interested if there's a big

7090
02:44:14,309 --> 02:44:14,319
would be interested if there's a big
 

7091
02:44:14,319 --> 02:44:16,710
would be interested if there's a big
reaction on the next shove up. If I see

7092
02:44:16,710 --> 02:44:16,720
reaction on the next shove up. If I see
 

7093
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:18,550
reaction on the next shove up. If I see
buyers mark it in and get absolutely

7094
02:44:18,550 --> 02:44:18,560
buyers mark it in and get absolutely
 

7095
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:19,910
buyers mark it in and get absolutely
clobbered, I'll be interested in this

7096
02:44:19,910 --> 02:44:19,920
clobbered, I'll be interested in this
 

7097
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:22,389

trend until we leave this huge volume
area. Here

7142
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:25,200

 

7143
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:29,269

But if we sell that,
 

7153
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:47,750

here's the test of it reaction

7154
02:45:47,750 --> 02:45:47,760
here's the test of it reaction
 

7155
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:51,269
here's the test of it reaction
that buyer there is caught so far.

7156

to see. There we go. Bang. Just called

7162
02:45:58,870 --> 02:45:58,880
to see. There we go. Bang. Just called
 

7163
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:01,750
to see. There we go. Bang. Just called
it. Literally gave you to the tick.

7164
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:01,760
it. Literally gave you to the tick.
 

7165

So filling some of these imbalances.
 

7169
02:46:06,319 --> 02:46:14,150
So filling some of these imbalances.
Let's see if we can get 67s. Now,

7170
02:46:14,150 --> 02:46:14,160

 

7171
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:15,670

if we're going to hold this dip, I'm not

7172
02:46:15,670 --> 02:46:15,680
if we're going to hold this dip, I'm not
 

7173
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:17,349
if we're going to hold this dip, I'm not
interested in holding any longer into

7174
02:46:17,349 --> 02:46:17,359
interested in holding any longer into
 

7175
02:46:17,359 --> 02:46:19,110
interested in holding any longer into
this gray box. So, you can see this cell

7176
02:46:19,110 --> 02:46:19,120
this gray box. So, you can see this cell
 

7177
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:20,790
this gray box. So, you can see this cell
right here. I just gave you this exact

7178
02:46:20,790 --> 02:46:20,800
right here. I just gave you this exact
 

7179
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:22,630
right here. I just gave you this exact
cell. This is your cover point.1, cover

7180
02:46:22,630 --> 02:46:22,640
cell. This is your cover point.1, cover
 

7181
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:25,510
cell. This is your cover point.1, cover
point two. If we leave this, if we leave

7182
02:46:25,510 --> 02:46:25,520
point two. If we leave this, if we leave
 

7183
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:28,230
point two. If we leave this, if we leave
this, we will get a beautiful drive

7184
02:46:28,230 --> 02:46:28,240
this, we will get a beautiful drive
 

7185
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:31,190
this, we will get a beautiful drive
down. And I will add heavier if we leave

7186
02:46:31,190 --> 02:46:31,200
down. And I will add heavier if we leave
 

7187
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:37,349
down. And I will add heavier if we leave
that.

7188
02:46:37,349 --> 02:46:37,359

Maybe we sweep these lows if we get

Maybe we sweep these lows if we get
 

7219
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:27,990
Maybe we sweep these lows if we get
lucky and get down to that New York

7220
02:47:27,990 --> 02:47:28,000
lucky and get down to that New York

There we go. There we go. Lovely.
Lovely. All right, moving stock down

Lovely. All right, moving stock down
 

7231
02:47:46,399 --> 02:47:48,389
Lovely. All right, moving stock down
now. Protecting this even more. And

7232
02:47:48,389 --> 02:47:48,399
now. Protecting this even more. And
 

7233
02:47:48,399 --> 02:47:50,070
now. Protecting this even more. And
let's see if we can get under this shelf

7234
02:47:50,070 --> 02:47:50,080
let's see if we can get under this shelf
 

7235
02:47:50,080 --> 02:47:54,630
let's see if we can get under this shelf
now. Can we get under the New York open?

7236
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:54,640

 

7237
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:55,990

So, covering more into that little

7238
02:47:55,990 --> 02:47:56,000
So, covering more into that little
 

7239
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,469
So, covering more into that little
pocket. This top of this gray box here.

7240
02:47:58,469 --> 02:47:58,479
pocket. This top of this gray box here.
 

7241
02:47:58,479 --> 02:47:59,750
pocket. This top of this gray box here.
Should have probably extended it. See

7242
02:47:59,750 --> 02:47:59,760
Should have probably extended it. See
 

7243
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:01,510
Should have probably extended it. See
this little node here hovering some in

02:48:01,510 --> 02:48:01,520
this little node here hovering some in
 

7245
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:03,349
this little node here hovering some in
front of that. I want to see if we stay

7246
02:48:03,349 --> 02:48:03,359
front of that. I want to see if we stay
 

7247
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:06,070
front of that. I want to see if we stay
heavy. Now, as I said, it's counter

7248
02:48:06,070 --> 02:48:06,080
heavy. Now, as I said, it's counter
 

7249
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:08,790
heavy. Now, as I said, it's counter
trend, smaller size. You lock in as we

7250
02:48:08,790 --> 02:48:08,800
trend, smaller size. You lock in as we
 

7251
02:48:08,800 --> 02:48:20,070
trend, smaller size. You lock in as we
go.

7252
02:48:20,070 --> 02:48:20,080

 

7253
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:21,429

Sellers got caught at that low on that

7254
02:48:21,429 --> 02:48:21,439
Sellers got caught at that low on that
 

7255
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:23,190
Sellers got caught at that low on that
last candle for sure. They they came in

7256
02:48:23,190 --> 02:48:23,200
last candle for sure. They they came in
 

7257
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:24,469
last candle for sure. They they came in
on the breakout. I still think it's got

7258
02:48:24,469 --> 02:48:24,479
on the breakout. I still think it's got
 

7259
02:48:24,479 --> 02:48:25,990
on the breakout. I still think it's got
a chance to move lower, especially if ES

7260
02:48:25,990 --> 02:48:26,000
a chance to move lower, especially if ES
 

7261
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,590
a chance to move lower, especially if ES
starts breaking down under IV. That's

7262
02:48:27,590 --> 02:48:27,600
starts breaking down under IV. That's
 

7263
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:29,910
starts breaking down under IV. That's
what I'd be watching at now.

7264
02:48:29,910 --> 02:48:29,920
what I'd be watching at now.
 

7265
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:32,230
what I'd be watching at now.
If ES lets go of IB then u we get a

7266
02:48:32,230 --> 02:48:32,240
If ES lets go of IB then u we get a
 

7267
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:35,830
If ES lets go of IB then u we get a
really nice move continuation move.

7268
02:48:35,830 --> 02:48:35,840
really nice move continuation move.
 

7269
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:37,750

is it to keep an eye on the last two
 

7325
02:49:56,800 --> 02:49:58,550
is it to keep an eye on the last two
highs and lows on the 15-minute? I mean,

7326
02:49:58,550 --> 02:49:58,560
highs and lows on the 15-minute? I mean,
 

7327
02:49:58,560 --> 02:50:00,550
highs and lows on the 15-minute? I mean,
it's useful if you're trading off that.

02:50:00,550 --> 02:50:00,560
it's useful if you're trading off that.
 

7329

it's useful if you're trading off that.
And I don't know what time frame you're

7330
02:50:01,830 --> 02:50:01,840
And I don't know what time frame you're
 

7331
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:05,030
And I don't know what time frame you're
trading off, but I mean, it can show you

02:50:05,030 --> 02:50:05,040
trading off, but I mean, it can show you
 

7333
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:07,510
trading off, but I mean, it can show you
minor swing points, but

7334
02:50:07,510 --> 02:50:07,520
minor swing points, but
 

7335
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:09,990
minor swing points, but
I wouldn't say it's like one time frame

7336
02:50:09,990 --> 02:50:10,000
I wouldn't say it's like one time frame
 

7337
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,150
I wouldn't say it's like one time frame
is better than another. I use hourly

7338
02:50:12,150 --> 02:50:12,160
is better than another. I use hourly
 

7339
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:13,510
is better than another. I use hourly
personally. What I'm always looking at

7340

personally. What I'm always looking at
 

7341
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:17,910
personally. What I'm always looking at
is hourly hourly runs for expectations.

02:50:23,439 --> 02:50:24,710
So, trim some, please, if you haven't
already.

7350
02:50:24,710 --> 02:50:24,720
already.
 

7351
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:26,150
already.
and let's see if we can break below.

7352
02:50:26,150 --> 02:50:26,160
and let's see if we can break below.
 

7353
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:27,990
and let's see if we can break below.
We're looking to see if ES wants to join

7354
02:50:27,990 --> 02:50:28,000
We're looking to see if ES wants to join
 

7355
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,870
We're looking to see if ES wants to join
the party underneath initial balance

7356
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:30,880
the party underneath initial balance
 

7357
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:32,550
the party underneath initial balance
high and that will really help us if we

7358
02:50:32,550 --> 02:50:32,560
high and that will really help us if we
 

7359
02:50:32,560 --> 02:50:34,870
high and that will really help us if we
get that. I'm not ruling out a move back

7360
02:50:34,870 --> 02:50:34,880
get that. I'm not ruling out a move back
 

7361
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:36,870
get that. I'm not ruling out a move back
to 600 which would be mega. Then it

7362
02:50:36,870 --> 02:50:36,880
to 600 which would be mega. Then it
 

7363
02:50:36,880 --> 02:50:38,870
to 600 which would be mega. Then it
would be an 80 plus point trade and

7364
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:38,880
would be an 80 plus point trade and
 

7365
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:40,630
would be an 80 plus point trade and
ideally I can get some more size on if

7366
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:40,640
ideally I can get some more size on if
 

7367
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:43,750
ideally I can get some more size on if
we do that. But I've trimmed into this

7368
02:50:43,750 --> 02:50:43,760
we do that. But I've trimmed into this
 

7369
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:50,309
we do that. But I've trimmed into this
node. So I'm short from the 83s.

7370
02:50:50,309 --> 02:50:50,319

 

7371
02:50:50,319 --> 02:50:53,030

And here's the bid off this gray box off

7372
02:50:53,030 --> 02:50:53,040
And here's the bid off this gray box off
 

7373
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:55,590
And here's the bid off this gray box off
the node. So maybe they re revisit back

7374
02:50:55,590 --> 02:50:55,600
the node. So maybe they re revisit back
 

7375
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:58,070
the node. So maybe they re revisit back
to 80s. I'm not going to let it come

7376
02:50:58,070 --> 02:50:58,080
to 80s. I'm not going to let it come
 

7377
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:08,710
to 80s. I'm not going to let it come
back above that

7378
02:51:08,710 --> 02:51:08,720

 

7379
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:10,389

into this little low volume node. We can

7380
02:51:10,389 --> 02:51:10,399

7381
02:51:10,399 --> 02:51:12,070
