account, can't get to my prop because

14
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239

they say I'm missing a W8 form and it's

16
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
they say I'm missing a W8 form and it's
 

17
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,309
they say I'm missing a W8 form and it's
not linked to the account when I've

18
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
not linked to the account when I've
 

19
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,710
not linked to the account when I've
emailed them about that being an error.

20
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
emailed them about that being an error.
 

21
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,789
emailed them about that being an error.
Um, but there we go. So, no trading for

22
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
Um, but there we go. So, no trading for
 

23
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,710
Um, but there we go. So, no trading for
me today until they fix this this uh

24
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
me today until they fix this this uh
 

25
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,949
me today until they fix this this uh
problem. So, hopefully I don't miss out

26
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
problem. So, hopefully I don't miss out
 

27
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,869
problem. So, hopefully I don't miss out
on an absolutely amazing setup today.

28
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
on an absolutely amazing setup today.
 

29
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,030
on an absolutely amazing setup today.
But let's get you guys prepared no

30
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
But let's get you guys prepared no
 

31
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,190
But let's get you guys prepared no
matter what. All right, what are we

32
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
matter what. All right, what are we
 

33
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,030
matter what. All right, what are we
looking at here?

34
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
looking at here?
 

35
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,509
looking at here?
We can see that for a few weeks we had a

36
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
We can see that for a few weeks we had a
 

37
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,589
We can see that for a few weeks we had a
range. All right, this was our range

38
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
range. All right, this was our range
 

39
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,350
range. All right, this was our range
and we left that range. Inside this

40
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
and we left that range. Inside this
 

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,470
and we left that range. Inside this
range, we have a very high volume area

42
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
range, we have a very high volume area
 

43
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,030
range, we have a very high volume area
right here standing out.

44
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
right here standing out.
 

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,430
right here standing out.
All right, very simply, we need to

46
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
All right, very simply, we need to
 

47
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,509
All right, very simply, we need to
maintain control of that volume area.

48
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
maintain control of that volume area.
 

49
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,110
maintain control of that volume area.
Um, I would still be looking at the old

50
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
Um, I would still be looking at the old
 

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,870
Um, I would still be looking at the old
contract now for now probably until

52
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
contract now for now probably until
 

53
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,390
contract now for now probably until
tomorrow for those of you aware. So

54
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
tomorrow for those of you aware. So
 

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,909
tomorrow for those of you aware. So
anything I'm going to quote you will be

56
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
anything I'm going to quote you will be
 

57
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,469
anything I'm going to quote you will be
old contract uh levels not the new

58
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
old contract uh levels not the new
 

59
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,150
old contract uh levels not the new
contract levels. So very very simply all

60
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
contract levels. So very very simply all
 

61
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,230
contract levels. So very very simply all
right you would be looking at Thursday's

62
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
right you would be looking at Thursday's
 

63
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,189
right you would be looking at Thursday's
low here to act as uh resistance or

64
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
low here to act as uh resistance or
 

65
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,270
low here to act as uh resistance or
supply and this low volume node here.

66
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
supply and this low volume node here.
 

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,030
supply and this low volume node here.
I'd be very careful once we start

68
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
I'd be very careful once we start
 

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,710
I'd be very careful once we start
reclaiming sort of 480s 500s. All right.

70
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
reclaiming sort of 480s 500s. All right.
 

71
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,230
reclaiming sort of 480s 500s. All right.
But if this reacts, all right, then we

72
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
But if this reacts, all right, then we
 

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,790
But if this reacts, all right, then we
expect some selling here and a move back

74
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
expect some selling here and a move back
 

75
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,110
expect some selling here and a move back
down into this kind of level here. So I

76
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
down into this kind of level here. So I
 

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,990
down into this kind of level here. So I
think from 500, right, top side 500 into

78
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
think from 500, right, top side 500 into
 

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,310
think from 500, right, top side 500 into
300, maybe even 200 is a possible

80
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
300, maybe even 200 is a possible
 

81
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,070
300, maybe even 200 is a possible
rotation today. It would not surprise me

82
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
rotation today. It would not surprise me
 

83
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,990
rotation today. It would not surprise me
to see sort of an inside bar be built

84
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
to see sort of an inside bar be built
 

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,150
to see sort of an inside bar be built
because this was a big move, but I would

86
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
because this was a big move, but I would
 

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,469
because this was a big move, but I would
expect the rotation to happen. Uh

88
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
expect the rotation to happen. Uh
 

89
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,830
expect the rotation to happen. Uh
absolute max, you don't want it

90
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
absolute max, you don't want it
 

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,350
absolute max, you don't want it
reclaiming 560s and definitely not 600s.

92
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
reclaiming 560s and definitely not 600s.
 

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,189
reclaiming 560s and definitely not 600s.
All right. So, anything here, you're

94
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
All right. So, anything here, you're
 

95
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,950
All right. So, anything here, you're
looking for that move down into here. I

96
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
looking for that move down into here. I
 

97
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,710
looking for that move down into here. I
would say that's the protrend move right

98
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
would say that's the protrend move right
 

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,270
would say that's the protrend move right
now. Any reclaim of this, well, then all

100
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
now. Any reclaim of this, well, then all
 

101
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,029
now. Any reclaim of this, well, then all
bearish thesis is off the table because

102
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
bearish thesis is off the table because
 

103
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,029
bearish thesis is off the table because
it means they've lost the impetus. We

104
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
it means they've lost the impetus. We
 

105
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,670
it means they've lost the impetus. We
are at the mean, right? 20-day, 50-day,

106
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
are at the mean, right? 20-day, 50-day,
 

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,230
are at the mean, right? 20-day, 50-day,
5day above after a couple days. 5day

108
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
5day above after a couple days. 5day
 

109
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,909
5day above after a couple days. 5day
will come here. Eventually, we'll get

110
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
will come here. Eventually, we'll get
 

111
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,510
will come here. Eventually, we'll get
very, very tight. So, I'd be watching

112
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
very, very tight. So, I'd be watching
 

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,950
very, very tight. So, I'd be watching
for this drift up into here to be sold

114
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
for this drift up into here to be sold
 

115
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,870
for this drift up into here to be sold
into for a retest of that. That's your

116
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
into for a retest of that. That's your
 

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,310
into for a retest of that. That's your
target. You just you're going to be

118
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
target. You just you're going to be
 

119
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,710
target. You just you're going to be
taking money off the table. sort of 300,

120
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
taking money off the table. sort of 300,
 

121
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,430
taking money off the table. sort of 300,
280, 200. And you know, if it breaks

122
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
280, 200. And you know, if it breaks
 

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,710
280, 200. And you know, if it breaks
down, great. You're positioned for it.

124
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
down, great. You're positioned for it.
 

125
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,550
down, great. You're positioned for it.
But I'm not, my expectations is not a

126
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
But I'm not, my expectations is not a
 

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,909
But I'm not, my expectations is not a
big breakdown today. It's not like we

128
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
big breakdown today. It's not like we
 

129
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,230
big breakdown today. It's not like we
have major major news coming today. So,

130
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
have major major news coming today. So,
 

131
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,070
have major major news coming today. So,
I'm probably thinking about an inside

132
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
I'm probably thinking about an inside
 

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,070
I'm probably thinking about an inside
bar.

134
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
bar.
 

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,510
bar.
Uh, let's have a look on the hourly. We

136
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
Uh, let's have a look on the hourly. We
 

137
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,909
Uh, let's have a look on the hourly. We
can look at some key levels that this

138
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
can look at some key levels that this
 

139
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,909
can look at some key levels that this
might come into. Let me just pull this

140
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
might come into. Let me just pull this
 

141
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,430
might come into. Let me just pull this
down for you. Make this a little bit

142
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
down for you. Make this a little bit
 

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,110
down for you. Make this a little bit
bigger. There we go. All right. So you

144
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
bigger. There we go. All right. So you
 

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,510
bigger. There we go. All right. So you
can see previous week value area low and

146
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
can see previous week value area low and
 

147
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,270
can see previous week value area low and
the week before value area low around

148
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
the week before value area low around
 

149
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,590
the week before value area low around
these sort of 450s. It it must not

150
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
these sort of 450s. It it must not
 

151
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,510
these sort of 450s. It it must not
reclaim that. All right. It really must

152
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
reclaim that. All right. It really must
 

153
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,309
reclaim that. All right. It really must
not reclaim 450s. Uh I would see this as

154
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
not reclaim 450s. Uh I would see this as
 

155
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,469
not reclaim 450s. Uh I would see this as
a pullback leg after leaving the range.

156
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
a pullback leg after leaving the range.
 

157
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,189
a pullback leg after leaving the range.
Here's the balance. We left the range.

158
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
Here's the balance. We left the range.
 

159
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,749
Here's the balance. We left the range.
This is a pullback or break and retest

160
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
This is a pullback or break and retest
 

161
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,990
This is a pullback or break and retest
we can call it. All right. Uh we're

162
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
we can call it. All right. Uh we're
 

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,590
we can call it. All right. Uh we're
already reclaiming previous day value

164
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
already reclaiming previous day value
 

165
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,189
already reclaiming previous day value
area very high which is not a good look.

166
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
area very high which is not a good look.
 

167
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,550
area very high which is not a good look.
But let's just see. I would be watching

168
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
But let's just see. I would be watching
 

169
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,469
But let's just see. I would be watching
these weekly levels up into here. All

170
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
these weekly levels up into here. All
 

171
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,430
these weekly levels up into here. All
right. If we lose this and then and we

172
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
right. If we lose this and then and we
 

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,670
right. If we lose this and then and we
look above if we look above previous day

174
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
look above if we look above previous day
 

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,230
look above if we look above previous day
value area high and we stay heavy

176
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
value area high and we stay heavy
 

177
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,070
value area high and we stay heavy
against previous week value area low.

178
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
against previous week value area low.
 

179
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,469
against previous week value area low.
All right. If we do something like this,

180
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
All right. If we do something like this,
 

181
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,550
All right. If we do something like this,
that's your short for the rotation back

182
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
that's your short for the rotation back
 

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,670
that's your short for the rotation back
down. Very simple. If they reclaim this

184
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
down. Very simple. If they reclaim this
 

185
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,110
down. Very simple. If they reclaim this
and especially if they back test

186
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
and especially if they back test
 

187
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,589
and especially if they back test
previous day value, all right, and he

188
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
previous day value, all right, and he
 

189
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,790
previous day value, all right, and he
holds inside this, then they will look

190
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
holds inside this, then they will look
 

191
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,909
holds inside this, then they will look
for that rotation up here. Um, you have

192
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
for that rotation up here. Um, you have
 

193
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,110
for that rotation up here. Um, you have
previous week point of control.

194
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
previous week point of control.
 

195
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,670
previous week point of control.
Has that been adjusted?

196
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680

 

197
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,589

That don't look right.

198
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599

 

199
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,469

Okay, that light up. All right. Yeah,

200
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
Okay, that light up. All right. Yeah,
 

201
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,830
Okay, that light up. All right. Yeah,
previous week point control up there,

202
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
previous week point control up there,
 

203
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,510
previous week point control up there,
which you might want to aim for.

204
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
which you might want to aim for.
 

205
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,469
which you might want to aim for.
Technically speaking, this is naked

206
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
Technically speaking, this is naked
 

207
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,309
Technically speaking, this is naked
because it's Monday and we've not

208
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
because it's Monday and we've not
 

209
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,870
because it's Monday and we've not
retested it. We we traded under lots of

210
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
retested it. We we traded under lots of
 

211
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,790
retested it. We we traded under lots of
times last week. technically technically

212
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
times last week. technically technically
 

213
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,870
times last week. technically technically
speaking it's naked. Um so that's what

214
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
speaking it's naked. Um so that's what
 

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,510
speaking it's naked. Um so that's what
I'll be looking for today. Um all the

216
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
I'll be looking for today. Um all the
 

217
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,589
I'll be looking for today. Um all the
time we're against we're staying heavy

218
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
time we're against we're staying heavy
 

219
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,990
time we're against we're staying heavy
against this possible short. If we lose

220
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
against this possible short. If we lose
 

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,150
against this possible short. If we lose
previous day value area high possible

222
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
previous day value area high possible
 

223
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,469
previous day value area high possible
re-entry and your cover points are 240s

225
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,469

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,909

there great you're positioned for it but

228
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
there great you're positioned for it but
 

229
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,309
there great you're positioned for it but
I wouldn't be having expectations that

230
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
I wouldn't be having expectations that
 

231
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,589
I wouldn't be having expectations that
it does. on the other side of it.

232
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
it does. on the other side of it.
 

233
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,749
it does. on the other side of it.
Conversely, if we start basing above

234
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
Conversely, if we start basing above
 

235
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,990
Conversely, if we start basing above
previous days value area high and we

236
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
previous days value area high and we
 

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,309
previous days value area high and we
reclaim previous day value area low and

238
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
reclaim previous day value area low and
 

239
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,230
reclaim previous day value area low and
it's not a look above a fail, right? As

240
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
it's not a look above a fail, right? As
 

241
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,469
it's not a look above a fail, right? As
long as it doesn't do this and it does

242
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
long as it doesn't do this and it does
 

243
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,309
long as it doesn't do this and it does
this, then there's a trade back inside

244
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
this, then there's a trade back inside
 

245
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,589
this, then there's a trade back inside
and we will be week three in here, which

246
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
and we will be week three in here, which
 

247
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,070
and we will be week three in here, which
is not what we want, but have to be

248
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
is not what we want, but have to be
 

249
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,189
is not what we want, but have to be
aware of what what is possible.

250
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
aware of what what is possible.
 

251
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,670
aware of what what is possible.
Okay, moving into lower time frames

252
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680

 

253
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,749

and we can have a look at some of the

254
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
and we can have a look at some of the
 

255
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,589
and we can have a look at some of the
other indexes.

256
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599

 

257
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,469

All right, ES here

258
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
All right, ES here
 

259
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,469
All right, ES here
doing the same kind of move. It's uh

260
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
doing the same kind of move. It's uh
 

261
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,149
doing the same kind of move. It's uh
never really let go of balance.

262
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
never really let go of balance.
 

263
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,149
never really let go of balance.
That's uh a little bit different looking

264
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
That's uh a little bit different looking
 

265
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,149
That's uh a little bit different looking
over there on ES. So even if we just

266
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
over there on ES. So even if we just
 

267
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:53,590
over there on ES. So even if we just
have a look

268
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600

 

269
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,310

That's not great.

270
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
That's not great.
 

271
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,310
That's not great.
That's quite big divergence. That's not

272
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
That's quite big divergence. That's not
 

273
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,110
That's quite big divergence. That's not
great. And you can see it held those

274
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
great. And you can see it held those
 

275
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,150
great. And you can see it held those
800s. So testing I've just measured out

276
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
800s. So testing I've just measured out
 

277
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,509
800s. So testing I've just measured out
just since we've been up here in

278
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
just since we've been up here in
 

279
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,269
just since we've been up here in
balance. Testing the top side of value

280
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
balance. Testing the top side of value
 

281
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,310
balance. Testing the top side of value
here. So 470s. I'd say 490 is a max.

282
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
here. So 470s. I'd say 490 is a max.
 

283
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,190
here. So 470s. I'd say 490 is a max.
Claim reclaim that. And uh well that can

284
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
Claim reclaim that. And uh well that can
 

285
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,550
Claim reclaim that. And uh well that can
still start squeezing. You've got

286
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
still start squeezing. You've got
 

287
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,870
still start squeezing. You've got
divergence there. It's very possible

288
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
divergence there. It's very possible
 

289
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,190
divergence there. It's very possible
that that starts squeezing, but I

290
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
that that starts squeezing, but I
 

291
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,630
that that starts squeezing, but I
they've made that tricky. I'm going to

292
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
they've made that tricky. I'm going to
 

293
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,030
they've made that tricky. I'm going to
be honest. Um, they need to hold versus

294
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
be honest. Um, they need to hold versus
 

295
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,350
be honest. Um, they need to hold versus
900. All right. And that rotation back

296
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
900. All right. And that rotation back
 

297
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,509
900. All right. And that rotation back
down. And ES needs to do this breakdown

298
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
down. And ES needs to do this breakdown
 

299
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,350
down. And ES needs to do this breakdown
for

300
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
for
 

301
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,150
for
uh everything to line up. If we start

302
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
uh everything to line up. If we start
 

303
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,990
uh everything to line up. If we start
reclaiming that, then this move here is

304
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
reclaiming that, then this move here is
 

305
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,550
reclaiming that, then this move here is
on. And remember, we've seen a rotation

306
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
on. And remember, we've seen a rotation
 

307
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,470
on. And remember, we've seen a rotation
out of big tech recently, which is why

308
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
out of big tech recently, which is why
 

309
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,630
out of big tech recently, which is why
you're seeing this, which is why RTY put

310
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
you're seeing this, which is why RTY put
 

311
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,269
you're seeing this, which is why RTY put
in a new alltime high last week. So, it

312
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
in a new alltime high last week. So, it
 

313
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,670
in a new alltime high last week. So, it
is possible backside here if it can't

314
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
is possible backside here if it can't
 

315
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,310
is possible backside here if it can't
get back above and come back down into

316
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
get back above and come back down into
 

317
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,150
get back above and come back down into
some level of sensibility. Um, let's

318
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
some level of sensibility. Um, let's
 

319
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,670
some level of sensibility. Um, let's
have a look at the Dixie. It's trying to

320
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
have a look at the Dixie. It's trying to
 

321
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,310
have a look at the Dixie. It's trying to
find a bit of a bid there, but it's

322
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
find a bit of a bid there, but it's
 

323
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,829
find a bit of a bid there, but it's
bearish, but it is trying to find a bit

324
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
bearish, but it is trying to find a bit
 

325
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,230
bearish, but it is trying to find a bit

327
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,110

pulling back. Failed to reclaim that

328
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
pulling back. Failed to reclaim that
 

329
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,949

level so far, but still looks pretty

330
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
level so far, but still looks pretty
 

331
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,630
level so far, but still looks pretty
bullish.

332
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
bullish.
 

333
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,350

Vicks, all right, dancing in range. You

334
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
Vicks, all right, dancing in range. You
 

335
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,030
Vicks, all right, dancing in range. You
can see no acceptance outside of this

can see no acceptance outside of this
 

337
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,389
can see no acceptance outside of this

339
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,069

340
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
side. We're dancing in range. That sort
 

341
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,230

345
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,110

And this is what I was talking about. If

346
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
And this is what I was talking about. If
 

347
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,509
And this is what I was talking about. If
it can't reclaim this box here, it

348
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
it can't reclaim this box here, it
 

349
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,190
it can't reclaim this box here, it
probably revisits some of this. And if

350
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
probably revisits some of this. And if
 

351
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,030
probably revisits some of this. And if
it loses that downside pressure, if it

352
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
it loses that downside pressure, if it
 

353
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,389
it loses that downside pressure, if it
holds this, it will have another attempt

354
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
holds this, it will have another attempt
 

355
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,310
holds this, it will have another attempt
at it. Let's have a look at the mag

356
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
at it. Let's have a look at the mag
 

357
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,230

here.

358
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240

 

359
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,790

Slight gap up on Apple, but no change.

360
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800

 

361
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,269

It's just boxed in.

362
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
It's just boxed in.
 

363
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,110
It's just boxed in.
No acceptance above, no acceptance

364
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
No acceptance above, no acceptance
 

365
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,430
No acceptance above, no acceptance
below. So, let's set some price alerts

366
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
below. So, let's set some price alerts
 

367
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,430
below. So, let's set some price alerts
here

368
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
here
 

369
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:18,470
here
each side of the range.

370
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480

 

371
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,470

All right, Amazon

372
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
All right, Amazon
 

373
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,949
All right, Amazon
slight gap up there, but it is trading

374
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
slight gap up there, but it is trading
 

375
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,190
slight gap up there, but it is trading
near these lows from previous week. All

376
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
near these lows from previous week. All
 

377
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,910
near these lows from previous week. All
right, so previous week lows needs to

378
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
right, so previous week lows needs to
 

379
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,910
right, so previous week lows needs to
hold above here. Failed to break, failed

380
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
hold above here. Failed to break, failed
 

381
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,630
hold above here. Failed to break, failed
to break, wash down. All right, you want

382
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
to break, wash down. All right, you want
 

383
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,790
to break, wash down. All right, you want
to be careful of this look now on

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
to be careful of this look now on
 

385
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,550

All right. So, it needs to reclaim 228

388

All right. So, it needs to reclaim 228
 

389
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,630
All right. So, it needs to reclaim 228

390
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640

391

395
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,509
kind of story, but it's a little bit
ahead of Amazon. There's your neckline.

it's back testing this kind of level. If

They're trying to push for 500. It is as
simple as that. It's very, very strong.

470
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
simple as that. It's very, very strong.
 

471
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,269
simple as that. It's very, very strong.
Um, I would expect it's OPEX this week,

472
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
Um, I would expect it's OPEX this week,
 

473
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,629
Um, I would expect it's OPEX this week,
so I'd expect there's some stuff up here

474
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
so I'd expect there's some stuff up here
 

475
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,350
so I'd expect there's some stuff up here
at like pro the probable levels 75, 80,

476
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
at like pro the probable levels 75, 80,
 

477
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,750
at like pro the probable levels 75, 80,
90, 500 I would expect on Tesla. So,

478
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
90, 500 I would expect on Tesla. So,
 

479
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,750
90, 500 I would expect on Tesla. So,
relative strength there. Oracle, let's

480
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
relative strength there. Oracle, let's
 

481
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,790
relative strength there. Oracle, let's
just have a look at these ones that had

482
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
just have a look at these ones that had
 

483
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,550
just have a look at these ones that had
earnings last week. Opening up slightly

484
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
earnings last week. Opening up slightly
 

485
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,509
earnings last week. Opening up slightly
inside and slightly down and EV AVGO,

486
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
inside and slightly down and EV AVGO,
 

487
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,829
inside and slightly down and EV AVGO,
same kind of story. Still sort of has

488
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
same kind of story. Still sort of has
 

489
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,590
same kind of story. Still sort of has
not found it base yet. It's trying, but

490
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
not found it base yet. It's trying, but
 

491
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,190
not found it base yet. It's trying, but
you know, you can't rule out another leg

492
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,200
you know, you can't rule out another leg
 

493
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,949
you know, you can't rule out another leg
down yet, right? Maybe some relief and

494
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
down yet, right? Maybe some relief and
 

495
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,030
down yet, right? Maybe some relief and
then base and then leg down. We just

496
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
then base and then leg down. We just
 

497
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,190
then base and then leg down. We just
have to see into end of year.

498
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,200
have to see into end of year.
 

499
00:13:49,200 --> 00:14:00,069

right. So, you're underneath New York

654
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
right. So, you're underneath New York
 

655
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,070
right. So, you're underneath New York
open. You had some big sellers come in

at 70. They got caught. All right. So
 

659
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,750
at 70. They got caught. All right. So
far, you're in a balance. uh pre-market

you had some buying of over 400. They
 

663
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,310
you had some buying of over 400. They
got caught and you're just trapped

664
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
got caught and you're just trapped
 

665
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,110

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
between the two right now
 

667
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,549
between the two right now
and you're watching this level. If you

668
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
and you're watching this level. If you
 

669
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,630
and you're watching this level. If you
start to lose value, all right, if you

670
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
start to lose value, all right, if you
 

671
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,590
start to lose value, all right, if you
look above and fail, the the things I'd

672
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
look above and fail, the the things I'd
 

673
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,909
look above and fail, the the things I'd
be looking for today are a trade back

674
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
be looking for today are a trade back
 

675
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,669
be looking for today are a trade back
under. If it loses value,

676
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
under. If it loses value,
 

677
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,909
under. If it loses value,
if it loses value, at least this to view

up and previous day point control and
 

681
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,029
up and previous day point control and
close the gap and you can have cover

682
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
close the gap and you can have cover
 

683
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,470
close the gap and you can have cover
points there and then covering the rest

684
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
points there and then covering the rest
 

685
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,909
points there and then covering the rest
here. If we base above value, I mean, I

686
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
here. If we base above value, I mean, I
 

687
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,510
here. If we base above value, I mean, I
don't love the long, I'll be honest. But

688
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
don't love the long, I'll be honest. But
 

689
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,830
don't love the long, I'll be honest. But
if we do this up here, maybe they come

690
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
if we do this up here, maybe they come
 

691
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,510
if we do this up here, maybe they come
into this and then I'd be looking for a

692
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
into this and then I'd be looking for a
 

693
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,350
into this and then I'd be looking for a
look above and fail, trade back down to

694
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
look above and fail, trade back down to
 

695
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,750
look above and fail, trade back down to
value and lose a value again. Uh, if

696
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
value and lose a value again. Uh, if
 

697
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,950
value and lose a value again. Uh, if
you're going to long this, you've got to

698
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
you're going to long this, you've got to
 

699
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,789
you're going to long this, you've got to
remember the cheap long was down here

700
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
remember the cheap long was down here
 

701
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,350
remember the cheap long was down here
overnight. Uh, we're now above previous

702
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
overnight. Uh, we're now above previous
 

703
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,270
overnight. Uh, we're now above previous
day value, underneath previous week.

704
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
day value, underneath previous week.
 

705

weeks worth of supply up up above this
 

713

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
you are getting hammered. It's like I
 

769
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,830
you are getting hammered. It's like I
said, once you lose value, you'll come

770
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
said, once you lose value, you'll come
 

771
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,669
said, once you lose value, you'll come
into a rotation. All right, so the next

772
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
into a rotation. All right, so the next
 

773

these 300. So as you start to drift
 

777
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,990
these 300. So as you start to drift
down, you can pull some money off the

778
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
down, you can pull some money off the
 

779
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,310
down, you can pull some money off the
table. If it stays heavy now, right, if

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,190
it stays heavy versus there, this and
this are possible. And then this is the

784
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
this are possible. And then this is the
 

785
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,870
this are possible. And then this is the
edge of the range. You would be covering

786
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
edge of the range. You would be covering
 

787
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,470
edge of the range. You would be covering
on the way down, right? So if you're

788
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
on the way down, right? So if you're
 

789
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,830
on the way down, right? So if you're
already short, great. Otherwise, you're

790
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
already short, great. Otherwise, you're
 

791
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,350
already short, great. Otherwise, you're
looking for a turn back into get short,

792
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,360
looking for a turn back into get short,
 

793
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,590
looking for a turn back into get short,
cover one, cover two, a little bit into

794
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
cover one, cover two, a little bit into
 

795
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,270
cover one, cover two, a little bit into
this whole zone, cover three, and

796
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
this whole zone, cover three, and
 

797
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,350
this whole zone, cover three, and
anything beyond that is uh well, you're

798
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
anything beyond that is uh well, you're
 

799
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,630
anything beyond that is uh well, you're
looking very good at that point, aren't

800
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
looking very good at that point, aren't
 

801
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,990
looking very good at that point, aren't
you?

802
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000

 

803
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,510

Where should I enter? I don't think I

804
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
Where should I enter? I don't think I
 

805
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,789
Where should I enter? I don't think I
could have make this made this clearer

806
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
could have make this made this clearer
 

807
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,270
could have make this made this clearer
today. Underneath value, I don't

808
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
today. Underneath value, I don't
 

809
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,870
today. Underneath value, I don't
understand what you guys listen to. When

810
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
understand what you guys listen to. When
 

811
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,270
understand what you guys listen to. When
you lose this, we go rotation. I've said

812
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
you lose this, we go rotation. I've said
 

813
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,230
you lose this, we go rotation. I've said
it about I must have genuinely said it

814
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
it about I must have genuinely said it
 

815
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,230
it about I must have genuinely said it
about five times this morning. I'm not

816
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
about five times this morning. I'm not
 

817
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,390
about five times this morning. I'm not
even taking a piss. Like,

818
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400

 

819
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,350

what is a WA? It's a tax form if you're

820
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
what is a WA? It's a tax form if you're
 

821
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,110
what is a WA? It's a tax form if you're
from the UK um and uh working in

822
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
from the UK um and uh working in
 

823
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,710
from the UK um and uh working in
America, but I don't need to do it

824
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
America, but I don't need to do it
 

825
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,149
America, but I don't need to do it
because they have a green card. So,

826
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
because they have a green card. So,
 

827
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,590
because they have a green card. So,
that's why I didn't fill it in for them.

828
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
that's why I didn't fill it in for them.
 

829
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,310
that's why I didn't fill it in for them.
But, it's just their system

830
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
But, it's just their system
 

831
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,669
But, it's just their system
because they know I'm from the UK

832
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
because they know I'm from the UK
 

833
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,710
because they know I'm from the UK
originally. So, it's just stupid error

834
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
originally. So, it's just stupid error
 

835
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,830
originally. So, it's just stupid error
on their system. But, there we go.

836
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
on their system. But, there we go.
 

837
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,110
on their system. But, there we go.
Okay. ES trying to find a bid off VWAP.

838
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
Okay. ES trying to find a bid off VWAP.
 

839
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,950
Okay. ES trying to find a bid off VWAP.
SPY's lost his VWAP. So I'd be watching

840
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
SPY's lost his VWAP. So I'd be watching
 

841
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,950
SPY's lost his VWAP. So I'd be watching
SPY for a back test which will be around

842
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
SPY for a back test which will be around
 

843
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,070
SPY for a back test which will be around
the 8470s. So as long as 85, same level

844
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
the 8470s. So as long as 85, same level
 

845
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,830
the 8470s. So as long as 85, same level
as last week, folks on the spiders. If

846
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
as last week, folks on the spiders. If
 

847
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,789
as last week, folks on the spiders. If
85 stays heavy, we rotate to 82. If you

848
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
85 stays heavy, we rotate to 82. If you
 

849
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,750
85 stays heavy, we rotate to 82. If you
lose that, we rotate to 80. QQQ just

850
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
lose that, we rotate to 80. QQQ just
 

851
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,470
lose that, we rotate to 80. QQQ just
coming back up to its VWAP as well. The

852
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
coming back up to its VWAP as well. The
 

853
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,230
coming back up to its VWAP as well. The
New York VW up. So I would be looking

854
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
New York VW up. So I would be looking
 

855
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,230
New York VW up. So I would be looking
now, there's two trades here. You would

856
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
now, there's two trades here. You would
 

857
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,430
now, there's two trades here. You would
be looking for them to sell this level

858
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
be looking for them to sell this level
 

859
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,190
be looking for them to sell this level
here for that rotation back down.

860
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
here for that rotation back down.
 

861
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,830
here for that rotation back down.
That's what they need to do, right? If

862
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:39,840
That's what they need to do, right? If
 

863
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,390
That's what they need to do, right? If
they reclaim that level, I would not be

864
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
they reclaim that level, I would not be
 

865
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,310
they reclaim that level, I would not be
sure. If they reclaim this level, they

866
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
sure. If they reclaim this level, they
 

867
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,909
sure. If they reclaim this level, they
will look to move back up to here. But

868
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
will look to move back up to here. But
 

869
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,270
will look to move back up to here. But
all the time we're under that, I'd be

870
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
all the time we're under that, I'd be
 

871
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,669
all the time we're under that, I'd be
looking short side or this move down

872
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
looking short side or this move down
 

873
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,470
looking short side or this move down
into here. TP1, TP2,

874
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
into here. TP1, TP2,
 

875
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,710
into here. TP1, TP2,
TP3 if you get lucky. Any reclaim of

876
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
TP3 if you get lucky. Any reclaim of
 

877
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,110
TP3 if you get lucky. Any reclaim of
that, no shorts. If they reclaim that,

878
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
that, no shorts. If they reclaim that,
 

879
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,149
that, no shorts. If they reclaim that,
no shorts. The one thing you would have

880
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
no shorts. The one thing you would have
 

881
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,990
no shorts. The one thing you would have
to watch because it's been a pain the

882
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
to watch because it's been a pain the
 

883
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,149
to watch because it's been a pain the
last few days is Tesla, right? has been

897
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,590
4.11% right now trying to push back
through 480. It's currently trading 477.

898
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
through 480. It's currently trading 477.
 

899
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,830
through 480. It's currently trading 477.
Rest of the market is either flat or

900
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
Rest of the market is either flat or
 

901
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,750
Rest of the market is either flat or
down other than video is like one and a

902
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
down other than video is like one and a
 

903
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:32,149
down other than video is like one and a
half% up.

904
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159

 

905
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,350

Okay.

906
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360

 

907
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,149

So, here's the retest of value and view.

908
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
So, here's the retest of value and view.
 

909
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,789
So, here's the retest of value and view.
And if they sell this, you can look for

910
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
And if they sell this, you can look for
 

911
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:48,230
And if they sell this, you can look for
a lower low.

912
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240

 

913
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,990

I would say you don't want them to

914
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
I would say you don't want them to
 

915
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,470
I would say you don't want them to
reclaim 70s,

916
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
reclaim 70s,
 

917
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,630
reclaim 70s,
right? In 70s, we had some sellers get

918
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
right? In 70s, we had some sellers get
 

919
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,390
right? In 70s, we had some sellers get
stuck there at 9:30 this morning. We've

920
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,400
stuck there at 9:30 this morning. We've
 

921
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,350
stuck there at 9:30 this morning. We've
broken down under them. They're

922
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
broken down under them. They're
 

923
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,390
broken down under them. They're
comfortably in the money. So, there you

924
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
comfortably in the money. So, there you
 

925
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,950
comfortably in the money. So, there you
go. There's the sell point into this

926
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
go. There's the sell point into this
 

927
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,190
go. There's the sell point into this
level. And you just want this to break

928
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
level. And you just want this to break
 

929
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,029
level. And you just want this to break
down now.

930
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:05,039
down now.
 

931
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,310
down now.
So you want to see some follow through.

932
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
So you want to see some follow through.
 

933
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,310
So you want to see some follow through.
And ideally Tesla stops pumping because

934
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
And ideally Tesla stops pumping because
 

935
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,510

hard. If you're looking for this move

00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
hard. If you're looking for this move
 

939
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,470
hard. If you're looking for this move
and Tesla keeps pumping, it's going to

940
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
and Tesla keeps pumping, it's going to
 

941
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,470
and Tesla keeps pumping, it's going to
make your life hard. Give you an idea of

942
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
make your life hard. Give you an idea of
 

943
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,310
make your life hard. Give you an idea of
what I'm talking about right now. This

944
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
what I'm talking about right now. This
 

945
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,549
what I'm talking about right now. This
thing is uh in a hurry again.

946
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
thing is uh in a hurry again.
 

947
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,510
thing is uh in a hurry again.
Straight up. All right. On Tesla, it's

948
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
Straight up. All right. On Tesla, it's
 

949
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,029
Straight up. All right. On Tesla, it's
going for that breakout we talked about

950
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
going for that breakout we talked about
 

951
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,789
going for that breakout we talked about
pre-market. So already taking this

952
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
pre-market. So already taking this
 

953
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,549
pre-market. So already taking this
liquidity now at 80. What's the next

954
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:28,559
liquidity now at 80. What's the next
 

955
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,990
liquidity now at 80. What's the next
level to go for? 88s. All right. So,

956
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
level to go for? 88s. All right. So,
 

957
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,269
level to go for? 88s. All right. So,
just be aware of that on Tesla. It's uh

958
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
just be aware of that on Tesla. It's uh
 

959
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,510
just be aware of that on Tesla. It's uh
if that's flying, it's obviously trying

960
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
if that's flying, it's obviously trying
 

961
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,430
if that's flying, it's obviously trying
to drag the cues up with it. That's the

962
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
to drag the cues up with it. That's the
 

963
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,029
to drag the cues up with it. That's the
only thing I'd be very very aware of.

964
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
only thing I'd be very very aware of.
 

965
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,710
only thing I'd be very very aware of.
Rest the market does not look like that.

966
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
Rest the market does not look like that.
 

967
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,990
Rest the market does not look like that.
It's a one stock doing the damage. You

968
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
It's a one stock doing the damage. You
 

969
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,590
It's a one stock doing the damage. You
are still rejecting previous day value

970
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
are still rejecting previous day value
 

971
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,909
are still rejecting previous day value
area high. So, I'd still be my bias

972
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
area high. So, I'd still be my bias
 

973
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,909
area high. So, I'd still be my bias
would remain short side right now all

974
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919
would remain short side right now all
 

975
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,590
would remain short side right now all
the time. You're protecting this kind of

976
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
the time. You're protecting this kind of
 

977
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,870
the time. You're protecting this kind of
area.

978
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880

 

979
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,630

I'm not trading today, folks. I want to

980
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm not trading today, folks. I want to
 

981
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,310
I'm not trading today, folks. I want to
make that clear. I'd love to be trading.

982
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
make that clear. I'd love to be trading.
 

983
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,070
make that clear. I'd love to be trading.
I cannot get into any of my accounts.

984
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
I cannot get into any of my accounts.
 

985
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,750
I cannot get into any of my accounts.
I've been booted out my accounts right

986
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
I've been booted out my accounts right
 

987
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,669
I've been booted out my accounts right
now. So, all I can do is call price

988
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
now. So, all I can do is call price
 

989
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,350
now. So, all I can do is call price
action for you right now, unfortunately.

990
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,360
action for you right now, unfortunately.
 

991
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,110
action for you right now, unfortunately.
Okay, really nice sell versus previous

992
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
Okay, really nice sell versus previous
 

993
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,110
Okay, really nice sell versus previous
day value area high there. So, you're

994
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
day value area high there. So, you're
 

995
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,510
day value area high there. So, you're
looking for a lower low. Just watch this

996
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
looking for a lower low. Just watch this
 

997
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,430
looking for a lower low. Just watch this
24-hour VW up, this green line. And if

998
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
24-hour VW up, this green line. And if
 

999
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,110
24-hour VW up, this green line. And if
you snap that, all right, your next

1000
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
you snap that, all right, your next
 

1001
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,230
you snap that, all right, your next
cover points are 35s down into 213. And

1002
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,240
cover points are 35s down into 213. And
 

1003
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,590
cover points are 35s down into 213. And
so you've got another 100 points down

1004
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
so you've got another 100 points down
 

1005
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,669
so you've got another 100 points down
here if you start losing. So you could

1006
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
here if you start losing. So you could
 

1007
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,990
here if you start losing. So you could
take a little partial into this if you

1008
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000
take a little partial into this if you
 

1009
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,230
take a little partial into this if you
want. And really I'd be targeting this

1010
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
want. And really I'd be targeting this
 

1011
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,669
want. And really I'd be targeting this
down here. But if you want to take a

1012
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:35,679
down here. But if you want to take a
 

1013
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,029
down here. But if you want to take a
partial into that because it's early on

1014
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
partial into that because it's early on
 

1015
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,390
partial into that because it's early on
a Monday, I wouldn't blame you. But

1016
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
a Monday, I wouldn't blame you. But
 

1017
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,310
a Monday, I wouldn't blame you. But
here's the lower low. Don't say I didn't

1018
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
here's the lower low. Don't say I didn't
 

1019
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,669
here's the lower low. Don't say I didn't
give this to you nice and early. I don't

1020
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
give this to you nice and early. I don't
 

1021
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,029
give this to you nice and early. I don't
want to hear anyone in chat saying when

1022
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
want to hear anyone in chat saying when
 

1023
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,630
want to hear anyone in chat saying when
does he enter? Blah blah blah. All that

1024
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
does he enter? Blah blah blah. All that
 

1025
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,390
does he enter? Blah blah blah. All that
nonsense. Literally laid that out for

1026
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
nonsense. Literally laid that out for
 

1027
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,230
nonsense. Literally laid that out for
you. There's a nice winner for you to

1028
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,240
you. There's a nice winner for you to
 

1029
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,310
you. There's a nice winner for you to
start the day. That's a 50 plus point

1030
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
start the day. That's a 50 plus point
 

1031
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,950
start the day. That's a 50 plus point
winner already. You're welcome.

1032
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960

 

1033
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,870

So, you should be smacking this right

1034
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
So, you should be smacking this right
 

1035
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,950
So, you should be smacking this right
now. And I want W's in chat. Here's your

1036
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
now. And I want W's in chat. Here's your
 

1037
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,710
now. And I want W's in chat. Here's your
VWAP. So, I would pay myself a little

1038
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
VWAP. So, I would pay myself a little
 

1039
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,549
VWAP. So, I would pay myself a little
bit here probably. And I would look to

1040
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
bit here probably. And I would look to
 

1041
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,950
bit here probably. And I would look to
see if they start to sell through this.

1042
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960
see if they start to sell through this.
 

1043
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,669
see if they start to sell through this.
And you should see that move down to

1044
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
And you should see that move down to
 

1045
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,390
And you should see that move down to
previous day point of control. Um,

1046
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
previous day point of control. Um,
 

1047
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,269
previous day point of control. Um,
Globex and PDC if they sell VWAP. So,

1048
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
Globex and PDC if they sell VWAP. So,
 

1049
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,789
Globex and PDC if they sell VWAP. So,
this is a key level here. The big

1050
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
this is a key level here. The big
 

1051
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,630
this is a key level here. The big
question is, do you see this snap down

1052
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
question is, do you see this snap down
 

1053
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,230
question is, do you see this snap down
into this? All right. So, make pay

1054
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,240
into this? All right. So, make pay
 

1055
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,830
into this? All right. So, make pay
yourself a little bit here. This is the

1056
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
yourself a little bit here. This is the
 

1057
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,269
yourself a little bit here. This is the
main target. If I got down into here,

1058
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:23,279
main target. If I got down into here,
 

1059
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,630
main target. If I got down into here,
I'd be taking a huge amount of my

1060
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
I'd be taking a huge amount of my
 

1061
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,269
I'd be taking a huge amount of my
position off.

1062
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:27,279
position off.
 

1063
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,789
position off.
All right, and there is your trade for

1064
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
All right, and there is your trade for
 

1065
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,470
All right, and there is your trade for
your Monday morning. All right, so you

1066
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
your Monday morning. All right, so you
 

1067
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,950
your Monday morning. All right, so you
should be up 50 plus points and you

1068
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
should be up 50 plus points and you
 

1069
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,029
should be up 50 plus points and you
might get 100 plus points here. And that

1070
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:35,039
might get 100 plus points here. And that
 

1071
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,950
might get 100 plus points here. And that
is all you need. This is why I'm a

1072
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960
is all you need. This is why I'm a
 

1073
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,870
is all you need. This is why I'm a
little bit upset that it's not letting

1074
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
little bit upset that it's not letting
 

1075
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,549
little bit upset that it's not letting
me trade here. It was a nice setup this

1076
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559
me trade here. It was a nice setup this
 

1077
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:50,070
me trade here. It was a nice setup this
morning.

1078
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
There you go, Johnny. Nice work. Nice
 

1089
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,029
There you go, Johnny. Nice work. Nice
work. Nice and easy, isn't it? It's nice

1090
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
work. Nice and easy, isn't it? It's nice
 

1091
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,710
work. Nice and easy, isn't it? It's nice
when the market behaves properly. It's

1092
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
when the market behaves properly. It's
 

1093
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,269
when the market behaves properly. It's
good.

1094
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
good.
 

1095
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,110
good.
Um, what I would say is you got some

1096
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
Um, what I would say is you got some
 

1097
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,510
Um, what I would say is you got some
sellers caught there under 290. So,

1098
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
sellers caught there under 290. So,
 

1099
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,269
sellers caught there under 290. So,
they're trying to aggressively bid this

1100
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
they're trying to aggressively bid this
 

1101
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,310
they're trying to aggressively bid this
back up at the moment. Um,

1102
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,320
back up at the moment. Um,
 

1103
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,310
back up at the moment. Um,
out the way so I can see the delta.

1104
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
out the way so I can see the delta.
 

1105
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,669
out the way so I can see the delta.
So, they're trying to flip to positive

1106
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
So, they're trying to flip to positive
 

1107
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,950
So, they're trying to flip to positive
delta. Uh, last sellers came in at 45.

1108
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960
delta. Uh, last sellers came in at 45.
 

1109
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,710
delta. Uh, last sellers came in at 45.
So, I'd say now really, you want to stay

1110
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:26,720
So, I'd say now really, you want to stay
 

1111
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,710
So, I'd say now really, you want to stay
heavy versus 45 if they're going to see

1112
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
heavy versus 45 if they're going to see
 

1113
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,470
heavy versus 45 if they're going to see
that continuation.

1114
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
that continuation.
 

1115
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,470
that continuation.
Tesla did peak above 480. So, I've got

1116
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
Tesla did peak above 480. So, I've got
 

1117
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,470
Tesla did peak above 480. So, I've got
my one eye on Tesla. It's still good to

1118
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
my one eye on Tesla. It's still good to
 

1119
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,029
my one eye on Tesla. It's still good to
move lower here. I'd be looking for

1120
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:37,039
move lower here. I'd be looking for
 

1121
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,029
move lower here. I'd be looking for
lower highs and lower lows for that

1122
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
lower highs and lower lows for that
 

1123
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,789
lower highs and lower lows for that
potential gap fill unless it starts to

1124
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:40,799
potential gap fill unless it starts to
 

1125
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,830
potential gap fill unless it starts to
reclaim everything. But, you should have

1126
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
reclaim everything. But, you should have
 

1127
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,230
reclaim everything. But, you should have
paid yourself some money.

1128
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,240

 

1129
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,510

You need this to start getting

1130
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:47,520
You need this to start getting
 

1131
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:58,630
You need this to start getting
aggressive beneath 300 really.

1132
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640

 

1133
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,230

Nice rejection of VW up there on ES.

1134
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240

 

1135
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,389

Looks good. Looks good. It's just Tesla

1136
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
Looks good. Looks good. It's just Tesla
 

1137
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,909
Looks good. Looks good. It's just Tesla
making this harder. Honestly, if Tesla

1138
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:09,919
making this harder. Honestly, if Tesla
 

1139
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,830
making this harder. Honestly, if Tesla
stops pumping,

1140
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840
stops pumping,
 

1141
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,669
stops pumping,
it's currently up $13 or $14 since the

1142
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679
it's currently up $13 or $14 since the
 

1143
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,029
it's currently up $13 or $14 since the
open.

1144
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039

 

1145
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,470

Honestly, I don't know how people trade

1146
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
Honestly, I don't know how people trade
 

1147
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,230
Honestly, I don't know how people trade
that. I must be so wild this week,

1148
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
that. I must be so wild this week,
 

1149
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,669
that. I must be so wild this week,
especially into OPEX because I know

1150
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
especially into OPEX because I know
 

1151
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,830
especially into OPEX because I know
everyone loves zero DTE on Tessa. My

1152
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:25,840
everyone loves zero DTE on Tessa. My
 

1153
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,909
everyone loves zero DTE on Tessa. My
Tesla breaking out new high day. This is

1154
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
Tesla breaking out new high day. This is
 

1155
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:37,269
Tesla breaking out new high day. This is
why Q's is not rolling over right now.

1156
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:37,279

 

1157
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,990

If Tesla loses a bid,

1158
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,000
If Tesla loses a bid,
 

1159
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,430
If Tesla loses a bid,
this thing will start puking. There you

1160
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,440
this thing will start puking. There you
 

1161
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,590
this thing will start puking. There you
go. Big rejection there into 81. Already

1162
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
go. Big rejection there into 81. Already
 

1163
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,230
go. Big rejection there into 81. Already
pulled back $3 in the last 10 seconds on

1164
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
pulled back $3 in the last 10 seconds on
 

1165
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,230
pulled back $3 in the last 10 seconds on
Tesla. Wild, wild move. Apple's breaking

1166
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
Tesla. Wild, wild move. Apple's breaking
 

1167
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,070
Tesla. Wild, wild move. Apple's breaking
the low. So, I just got an alert on

1168
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,080
the low. So, I just got an alert on
 

1169
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,830
the low. So, I just got an alert on
that. So, that's going to drag this mark

1170
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
that. So, that's going to drag this mark
 

1171
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,990
that. So, that's going to drag this mark
market down. Right. So, remember I set

1172
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
market down. Right. So, remember I set
 

1173
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,909
market down. Right. So, remember I set
an alert earlier on Apple. If if we

1174
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:57,919
an alert earlier on Apple. If if we
 

1175
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,310
an alert earlier on Apple. If if we
start losing this low on Apple. There

1176
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,320
start losing this low on Apple. There
 

1177
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,990
start losing this low on Apple. There
you go. It's starting to break this low

1178
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
you go. It's starting to break this low
 

1179
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,430
you go. It's starting to break this low
that we looked at pre-market, which is

1180
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
that we looked at pre-market, which is
 

1181
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,750
that we looked at pre-market, which is
why I set an alert right here. Right.

1182
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
why I set an alert right here. Right.
 

1183
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,590
why I set an alert right here. Right.
So, maybe Apple comes and trades into

1184
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
So, maybe Apple comes and trades into
 

1185
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,110
So, maybe Apple comes and trades into
here now. So, it needs to find a bid

1186
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
here now. So, it needs to find a bid
 

1187
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,549
here now. So, it needs to find a bid
here. If it doesn't, it trades to this

1188
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
here. If it doesn't, it trades to this
 

1189
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,149
here. If it doesn't, it trades to this
low side. Market will get heavy with it.

1190
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
low side. Market will get heavy with it.
 

1191
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,549
low side. Market will get heavy with it.
So, your shorts look good all the time

So, your shorts look good all the time
 

1193

So, your shorts look good all the time
that this is happening. You just want

that this is happening. You just want
 

1195
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,350
that this is happening. You just want
Tesla to do the same thing now and

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,360
Tesla to do the same thing now and
 

1197
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,950
Tesla to do the same thing now and
you'll have a really nice trade. You

you'll have a really nice trade. You
 

1199
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,549
you'll have a really nice trade. You
just need Tesla to start playing ball

1200
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559

1207
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,190

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
in my mind.
 

1209
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,149
in my mind.
You just need a new lower low. Right. So

to have a pullback here. This 5minute

1220
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
to have a pullback here. This 5minute
 

1221
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,870
to have a pullback here. This 5minute
candle is important. It's got another

1222
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
candle is important. It's got another
 

1223
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,549
candle is important. It's got another
one and a half plus minutes left in it

1224
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
one and a half plus minutes left in it
 

1225
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,870
one and a half plus minutes left in it
on Tesla. But

1226
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:54,880
on Tesla. But
 

1227
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,950
on Tesla. But
let's see if they roll Tesla. I think

1228
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960
let's see if they roll Tesla. I think
 

1229
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,830
let's see if they roll Tesla. I think
you're kind of going to come into this.

1230
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
you're kind of going to come into this.
 

1231
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,750
you're kind of going to come into this.
All depends what these zero DTE are

1232
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
All depends what these zero DTE are
 

1233
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:10,870
All depends what these zero DTE are
probably doing on Tesla. I'd say

1234
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880

 

1235
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,950

percent down, Meta 0.41% up, Nvidia

1396
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,000
percent down, Meta 0.41% up, Nvidia
 

1397
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,789
percent down, Meta 0.41% up, Nvidia
1.11% up, Tesla 4% up. So, that's the

1398
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:44,799
1.11% up, Tesla 4% up. So, that's the
 

1399
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,990
1.11% up, Tesla 4% up. So, that's the
problem right now. You've got a bit of a

1400
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
problem right now. You've got a bit of a
 

1401
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,909
problem right now. You've got a bit of a
mixed bag here.

1402
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919

 

1403
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,590

Spy is trying to find a bid here. I'd be

1404
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
Spy is trying to find a bid here. I'd be
 

1405
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,870
Spy is trying to find a bid here. I'd be
taking a little bit off the table. You

1406
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:52,880
taking a little bit off the table. You
 

1407
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,149
taking a little bit off the table. You
can always add back on if you haven't

1408
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:54,159
can always add back on if you haven't
 

1409
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,430
can always add back on if you haven't
paid yourself yet. You should have

1410
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,440
paid yourself yet. You should have
 

1411
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,110
paid yourself yet. You should have
already paid yourself, though. As long

1412
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,120
already paid yourself, though. As long
 

1413
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,710
already paid yourself, though. As long
as you don't trade back above, what did

1414
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:58,720
as you don't trade back above, what did
 

1415
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,630
as you don't trade back above, what did
I say? 92s. Yeah, I think 92s 90s to

1416
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
I say? 92s. Yeah, I think 92s 90s to
 

1417
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,870
I say? 92s. Yeah, I think 92s 90s to
300s is key. As long as it stays heavy

1418
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
300s is key. As long as it stays heavy
 

1419
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,470
300s is key. As long as it stays heavy
versus that, you've got gap fill

1420
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480
versus that, you've got gap fill
 

1421
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,470
versus that, you've got gap fill
potential. They reclaim that, I would be

1422
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:08,480
potential. They reclaim that, I would be
 

1423
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:25,270
potential. They reclaim that, I would be
out.

1424
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280

 

1425
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,109

Remember, we expected an inside bar

1426
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
Remember, we expected an inside bar
 

1427
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,069
Remember, we expected an inside bar
today. That's what we're getting.

1428
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:30,079
today. That's what we're getting.
 

1429
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,109
today. That's what we're getting.
It's meeting our expectations. If we're

1430
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
It's meeting our expectations. If we're
 

1431
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,550
It's meeting our expectations. If we're
very very efficient, we're going to come

1432
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:34,560
very very efficient, we're going to come
 

1433
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,470
very very efficient, we're going to come
down into this bright yellow line. All

1434
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:36,480
down into this bright yellow line. All
 

1435
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,310
down into this bright yellow line. All
right. If we want to do a full rotation,

1436
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
right. If we want to do a full rotation,
 

1437
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,589
right. If we want to do a full rotation,
we're going to come down into there. It

1438
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
we're going to come down into there. It
 

1439
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,829
we're going to come down into there. It
doesn't have to. Right. So, we're

1440
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
doesn't have to. Right. So, we're
 

1441
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,349
doesn't have to. Right. So, we're
probably at the midpoint. Previous day

1442
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:43,359
probably at the midpoint. Previous day
 

1443
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,990
probably at the midpoint. Previous day
point of control is uh we're coming into

1444
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
point of control is uh we're coming into
 

1445
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,750
point of control is uh we're coming into
the top side of that area. Now, to be

1446
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:47,760
the top side of that area. Now, to be
 

1447
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,790
the top side of that area. Now, to be
honest, if we go to like an hourly,

1448
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:52,800

 

1449
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,430

we think about where we got congested.

1450
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
we think about where we got congested.
 

1451
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,230
we think about where we got congested.
You got your 20-day here. All right. So

1452
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,240
You got your 20-day here. All right. So
 

1453
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,069
You got your 20-day here. All right. So
that's your return to mean your previous

1454
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
that's your return to mean your previous
 

1455
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,069
that's your return to mean your previous
day point of control and you've got it

1456
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:02,079
day point of control and you've got it
 

1457
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,990
day point of control and you've got it
like this. All right. So I'd say this

1458
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,000
like this. All right. So I'd say this
 

1459
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,390
like this. All right. So I'd say this
whole area is pretty thick. I would

1460
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
whole area is pretty thick. I would
 

1461
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,870
whole area is pretty thick. I would
expect the market to probably try and

1462
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
expect the market to probably try and
 

1463
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,630
expect the market to probably try and
get a bid from there unless they get

1464
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
get a bid from there unless they get
 

1465
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,310
get a bid from there unless they get
very very weak and they're like no we're

1466
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
very very weak and they're like no we're
 

1467
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,310
very very weak and they're like no we're
selling this big today. I'd expect the

1468
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,320
selling this big today. I'd expect the
 

1469
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,829
selling this big today. I'd expect the
market to try and find some sort of

1470
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:15,839
market to try and find some sort of
 

1471
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,990
market to try and find some sort of
balance in here. Remember I said rewind

1472
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,000
balance in here. Remember I said rewind
 

1473
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,270
balance in here. Remember I said rewind
to the beginning this is technically

1474
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,280
to the beginning this is technically
 

1475
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,630
to the beginning this is technically
naked because we're opening up on a

1476
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,640
naked because we're opening up on a
 

1477
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,470
naked because we're opening up on a
Monday. So, it might want to revisit the

1478
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,480
Monday. So, it might want to revisit the
 

1479
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,030
Monday. So, it might want to revisit the
naked PC and then go for a rotation back

1480
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
naked PC and then go for a rotation back
 

1481
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,430
naked PC and then go for a rotation back
up to 330, which might be taking most of

1482
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,440
up to 330, which might be taking most of
 

1483
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,190
up to 330, which might be taking most of
my position up as we trade into these

1484
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
my position up as we trade into these
 

1485
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:43,750
my position up as we trade into these
levels.

1486
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:43,760

 

1487
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,190

Lots of buying coming in here. They're

1488
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
Lots of buying coming in here. They're
 

1489
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,670
Lots of buying coming in here. They're
trying to flip delta.

1490
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
trying to flip delta.
 

1491
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,670
trying to flip delta.
Tesla's try trying again to get back

1492
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
Tesla's try trying again to get back
 

1493
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,069
Tesla's try trying again to get back
above its 480. See if they sell it

1494
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
above its 480. See if they sell it
 

1495
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,550
above its 480. See if they sell it
versus 480. Like I said, you're still

1496
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
versus 480. Like I said, you're still
 

1497
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,109
versus 480. Like I said, you're still
good. Sort of 92s to 300s as long as

1498
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
good. Sort of 92s to 300s as long as
 

1499
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,870
good. Sort of 92s to 300s as long as
they're selling versus that for your

1500
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:58,880
they're selling versus that for your
 

1501
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,310
they're selling versus that for your
runners. But if they reclaim that, I

1502
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,320
runners. But if they reclaim that, I
 

1503
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,750
runners. But if they reclaim that, I
would be out of it. You can always add

1504
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
would be out of it. You can always add
 

1505
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,470
would be out of it. You can always add
back in.

1506
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480

 

1507
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,270

Uh TJ, uh Dece um December contract

1508
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
Uh TJ, uh Dece um December contract
 

1509
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,710
Uh TJ, uh Dece um December contract
probably until tomorrow. Not enough

1510
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,720
probably until tomorrow. Not enough
 

1511
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,270
probably until tomorrow. Not enough
volume has flipped over yet. Probably

1512
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,280
volume has flipped over yet. Probably
 

1513
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,030
volume has flipped over yet. Probably
until tomorrow. I'd say normally between

1514
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,040
until tomorrow. I'd say normally between
 

1515
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,230
until tomorrow. I'd say normally between
Tuesday and Wednesday it will flip to

1516
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
Tuesday and Wednesday it will flip to
 

1517
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,750
Tuesday and Wednesday it will flip to
the new contract. the volume will be

1518
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
the new contract. the volume will be
 

1519
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,349
the new contract. the volume will be
bigger on the new contract. Yeah, it's

1520
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
bigger on the new contract. Yeah, it's
 

1521
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,870
bigger on the new contract. Yeah, it's
harder to read the tape for me this

1522
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:20,880
harder to read the tape for me this
 

1523
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,990
harder to read the tape for me this
week. Um because I'm currently watching

1524
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
week. Um because I'm currently watching
 

1525
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,470
week. Um because I'm currently watching
a December contract, so I'm going to see

1526
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,480
a December contract, so I'm going to see
 

1527
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,630
a December contract, so I'm going to see
like the levels will look thinner and

1528
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
like the levels will look thinner and
 

1529
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,230
like the levels will look thinner and
obviously if they're playing the March

1530
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
obviously if they're playing the March
 

1531
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,670
obviously if they're playing the March
contract, I can't see them. I can't look

1532
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
contract, I can't see them. I can't look
 

1533
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,589
contract, I can't see them. I can't look
at two things at once. All right, I'd

1534
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
at two things at once. All right, I'd
 

1535
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,829
at two things at once. All right, I'd
probably cut this now, folks. You can

1536
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
probably cut this now, folks. You can
 

1537
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,790
probably cut this now, folks. You can
always get back in.

1538
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
always get back in.
 

1539
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,710
always get back in.
And it's Tesla doing the damage, trying

1540
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:40,720
And it's Tesla doing the damage, trying
 

1541
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,109
And it's Tesla doing the damage, trying
to break out for a new high.

1542
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119
to break out for a new high.
 

1543
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,430
to break out for a new high.
Did they really just poke above

1544
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,440

 

1545
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,870

Yeah, I'd leave this alone for a minute

1546
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
Yeah, I'd leave this alone for a minute
 

1547
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,310
Yeah, I'd leave this alone for a minute
while they made their minds up here.

1548
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,320
while they made their minds up here.
 

1549
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,069
while they made their minds up here.
Tesla's going to be a pain for you. But

1550
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:54,079
Tesla's going to be a pain for you. But
 

1551
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,670
Tesla's going to be a pain for you. But
hopefully most of you made lots of money

1552
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
hopefully most of you made lots of money
 

1553
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,470
hopefully most of you made lots of money
on that.

1554
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
on that.
 

1555
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,630
on that.
Most of you made lots of money. So, it

1556
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
Most of you made lots of money. So, it
 

1557
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,310
Most of you made lots of money. So, it
is possible. They do a little look above

1558
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:02,320
is possible. They do a little look above
 

1559
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,829
is possible. They do a little look above
here. They just trapped some bulls there

1560
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:03,839
here. They just trapped some bulls there
 

1561
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,990
here. They just trapped some bulls there
on that last play. That was gross that

1562
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,000
on that last play. That was gross that
 

1563
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,470
on that last play. That was gross that
they poked through. What did I say? 92s

1564
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,480
they poked through. What did I say? 92s
 

1565
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,550
they poked through. What did I say? 92s
to 300. 92s

1566
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
to 300. 92s
 

1567
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,030
to 300. 92s
to 300. This kind of level here is where

1568
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,040
to 300. This kind of level here is where
 

1569
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,990
to 300. This kind of level here is where
I would have cut the trade.

1570
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
I would have cut the trade.
 

1571
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,150
I would have cut the trade.
If they get back up below this, this is

1572
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
If they get back up below this, this is
 

1573
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,349
If they get back up below this, this is
still possible. Like I said, you can

1574
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
still possible. Like I said, you can
 

1575
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,710
still possible. Like I said, you can
always get back in. That's how I think

1576
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
always get back in. That's how I think
 

1577
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,190
always get back in. That's how I think
about these things. Can always get back

1578
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
about these things. Can always get back
 

1579
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,030
about these things. Can always get back
in.

1580
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040

1581
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,870

I don't think this auction at the bottom

1582
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:28,880
I don't think this auction at the bottom
 

1583
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,270
I don't think this auction at the bottom
is finished. There the the low of day

1584
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280
is finished. There the the low of day
 

1585
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,510
is finished. There the the low of day
has buying on it, not selling. I don't

1586
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
has buying on it, not selling. I don't
 

1587
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,750
has buying on it, not selling. I don't
think we've finished selling. It just

1588
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:35,760
think we've finished selling. It just
 

1589
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,510
think we've finished selling. It just
needs Tesla to stop. There you go. That

1590
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
needs Tesla to stop. There you go. That
 

1591
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,430
needs Tesla to stop. There you go. That
little naughty poke above there.

1592
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,440
little naughty poke above there.
 

1593
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,870
little naughty poke above there.
Shouldn't have gone above 300 there.

1594
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:40,880
Shouldn't have gone above 300 there.
 

1595
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,190
Shouldn't have gone above 300 there.
They let it above. It should not have

1596
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,200
They let it above. It should not have
 

1597
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,829
They let it above. It should not have
done that. Got back above the old PC.

1598
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:47,839
done that. Got back above the old PC.
 

1599

00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
340 943 was 300. Yeah, I didn't want
 

1605
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,109
340 943 was 300. Yeah, I didn't want
them to revisit above that, but they

1606
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
them to revisit above that, but they
 

1607
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,829
them to revisit above that, but they
did.

1608
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:01,839
did.
 

1609
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,829
did.
Sells still look good here now as long

1610
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:03,839
Sells still look good here now as long
 

1611
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,430
Sells still look good here now as long
as they're rejecting these levels. So

1612
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,440
as they're rejecting these levels. So
 

1613
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,870
as they're rejecting these levels. So
now I would say you need it to stay

1614
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:06,880
now I would say you need it to stay
 

1615
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,670
now I would say you need it to stay

trade. If they reclaim that again, I

1620
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,200
trade. If they reclaim that again, I
 

1621
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,190
trade. If they reclaim that again, I
wouldn't touch it. But flow zone still

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,069
Right. Most of my position would be
covered here. I'd be runners down in

1700
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:52,079
covered here. I'd be runners down in
 

1701
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,430
covered here. I'd be runners down in
case we got into there, but I don't

1702
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:53,440
case we got into there, but I don't
 

1703
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,069
case we got into there, but I don't
necessarily expect it.

1704
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:56,079
necessarily expect it.
 

1705
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,069
necessarily expect it.
And that's it. That's your uh trades

1706
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
And that's it. That's your uh trades
 

1707
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,710
And that's it. That's your uh trades
done for the day. If you traded with me

1708
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
done for the day. If you traded with me
 

1709
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,750
done for the day. If you traded with me
this morning, you've traded for 23

1710
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:03,760
this morning, you've traded for 23
 

1711
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,349
this morning, you've traded for 23
minutes and entry one was versus this.

1712
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:07,359
minutes and entry one was versus this.
 

1713
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,630
minutes and entry one was versus this.
So 65 and we've covered some into view

1714
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:10,640
So 65 and we've covered some into view
 

1715
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,470
So 65 and we've covered some into view
up. So that was 65 points. We got

1716
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
up. So that was 65 points. We got
 

1717
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,750
up. So that was 65 points. We got
knocked out. You would have got back in.

1718
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:13,760
knocked out. You would have got back in.
 

1719
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,349
knocked out. You would have got back in.
You should be covering some in here

1720
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:15,359
You should be covering some in here
 

1721
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,829
You should be covering some in here
again and in here. And that's, you know,

1722
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:17,839
again and in here. And that's, you know,
 

1723
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,829
again and in here. And that's, you know,
I've probably netted you over well over

1724
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:19,839
I've probably netted you over well over
 

1725
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,630
I've probably netted you over well over
100 points, 150 points with thesis,

1726
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:22,640
100 points, 150 points with thesis,
 

1727
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,390
100 points, 150 points with thesis,
telling you what to do beforehand and

1728
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,400
telling you what to do beforehand and
 

1729
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,990
telling you what to do beforehand and
why. And that is what separates

1730
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,000
why. And that is what separates
 

1731
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,829
why. And that is what separates
me from guys where you're like, "When

1732
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:29,839
me from guys where you're like, "When
 

1733
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,910
me from guys where you're like, "When
does he enter? When does he do this? Did

1734
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:31,920
does he enter? When does he do this? Did
 

1735
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,829
does he enter? When does he do this? Did
I see you all this morning saying it?" I

1736
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:33,839
I see you all this morning saying it?" I
 

1737
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,230
I see you all this morning saying it?" I
told you when and why. I told you the

1738
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240
told you when and why. I told you the
 

1739
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,670
told you when and why. I told you the
exact reason why. And that's the

1740
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:37,680
exact reason why. And that's the
 

1741
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,589
exact reason why. And that's the
difference. You've got to learn to stand

1742
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
difference. You've got to learn to stand
 

1743
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,270
difference. You've got to learn to stand
on your own two feet. People, I will

1744
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,280
on your own two feet. People, I will
 

1745
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,950
on your own two feet. People, I will
teach you to fish. You want to turn up,

1746
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
teach you to fish. You want to turn up,
 

1747
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,870
teach you to fish. You want to turn up,
I'll teach you to fish. You want to

1748
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:44,880
I'll teach you to fish. You want to
 

1749
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,030
I'll teach you to fish. You want to
learn how I do it. You really want to

1750
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
learn how I do it. You really want to
 

1751
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,630
learn how I do it. You really want to
learn and you can't decipher it from

1752
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:48,640
learn and you can't decipher it from
 

1753
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,670
learn and you can't decipher it from
what I'm telling you here. Do the

1754
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
what I'm telling you here. Do the
 

1755
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,510
what I'm telling you here. Do the
course. Join the mentorship. Join join

1756
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,520
course. Join the mentorship. Join join
 

1757
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,390
course. Join the mentorship. Join join
the crew. Um,

1758
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,400
the crew. Um,
 

1759
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,230
the crew. Um,
I can't give it I can't explain it

1760
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,240
I can't give it I can't explain it
 

1761
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,589
I can't give it I can't explain it
better than this. I'm doing the best I

1762
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
better than this. I'm doing the best I
 

1763
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,270
better than this. I'm doing the best I
can. And remember, I'm getting nothing

1764
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,280
can. And remember, I'm getting nothing
 

1765
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,030
can. And remember, I'm getting nothing
out of this because I can't even trade

1766
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
out of this because I can't even trade
 

1767
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,710
out of this because I can't even trade
today. So frustrating.

1768
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:04,720
today. So frustrating.
 

1769
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,670
today. So frustrating.
So frustrating.

1770
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
So frustrating.
 

1771
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:16,870
So frustrating.
They still haven't emailed me back.

1772
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880

 

1773
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,109

Uh, Alvaro, at the end of the course, if

1774
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:19,119
Uh, Alvaro, at the end of the course, if
 

1775
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,550
Uh, Alvaro, at the end of the course, if
you scroll down towards the end of the

1776
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:20,560
you scroll down towards the end of the
 

1777
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,470
you scroll down towards the end of the
course, you'll see like there's a tab

1778
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,480
course, you'll see like there's a tab
 

1779
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,069
course, you'll see like there's a tab
that says Discord. It tells you what to

1780
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
that says Discord. It tells you what to
 

1781
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,309
that says Discord. It tells you what to
do.

1782
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319

 

1783
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,670

Thanks, Green.

1784
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680

 

1785
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,470

Yeah, exactly.

1786
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,480
Yeah, exactly.
 

1787
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,390
Yeah, exactly.
>> Give me your money.

1788
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,400

 

1789
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,790

Still got gap fill potential here. Still

1790
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
Still got gap fill potential here. Still
 

1791
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,550
Still got gap fill potential here. Still
got gap fill. That bright yellow line.

1792
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:44,560
got gap fill. That bright yellow line.
 

1793
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,750
got gap fill. That bright yellow line.
All right. So the orange line is

1794
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:45,760
All right. So the orange line is
 

1795
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,309
All right. So the orange line is
glowbacks. The yellow line is gap fill.

1796
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:48,319
glowbacks. The yellow line is gap fill.
 

1797
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,589
glowbacks. The yellow line is gap fill.
Looks like we're coming for gap fill.

1798
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:49,599
Looks like we're coming for gap fill.
 

1799
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,230
Looks like we're coming for gap fill.
And if we fail gap fill, right? Then I

1800
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
And if we fail gap fill, right? Then I
 

1801
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,829
And if we fail gap fill, right? Then I
think we're going to go here. Right. So

1802
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
think we're going to go here. Right. So
 

1803
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,910
think we're going to go here. Right. So
this is your cover point. And this is

1804
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:55,920
this is your cover point. And this is
 

1805
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,150
this is your cover point. And this is
runners. Previous day low value area low

1806
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,160
runners. Previous day low value area low
 

1807
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,069
runners. Previous day low value area low
is runners.

1808
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:00,079
is runners.
 

1809
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,990
is runners.
If we get expansion under there, I would

1810
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,000
If we get expansion under there, I would
 

1811
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,589
If we get expansion under there, I would
find that unlikely today. I'm going to

1812
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:03,599
find that unlikely today. I'm going to
 

1813
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,030
find that unlikely today. I'm going to
be honest. But we're not going to rule

1814
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,040
be honest. But we're not going to rule
 

1815
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,950
be honest. But we're not going to rule
it out. So if we do something like this,

1816
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
it out. So if we do something like this,
 

1817
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,630
it out. So if we do something like this,
we can look for an expansion model down

1818
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:08,640
we can look for an expansion model down
 

1819
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,069
we can look for an expansion model down
into this old naked point of control

1820
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,079
into this old naked point of control
 

1821
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,589
into this old naked point of control
that we talked about on Friday and

1822
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:11,599
that we talked about on Friday and
 

1823
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,589
that we talked about on Friday and
Thursday last week. All right. So, but

1824
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
Thursday last week. All right. So, but
 

1825
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,390
Thursday last week. All right. So, but
really I would imagine I would imagine

1826
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
really I would imagine I would imagine
 

1827
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,710
really I would imagine I would imagine
because we lack news today, we probably

1828
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
because we lack news today, we probably
 

1829
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,870
because we lack news today, we probably
do an inside day. So I'd imagine this is

1830
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
do an inside day. So I'd imagine this is
 

1831
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,990
do an inside day. So I'd imagine this is
a rotational day and at the moment it's

1832
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
a rotational day and at the moment it's
 

1833
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,390
a rotational day and at the moment it's
telling me we want to rotate because we

1834
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:26,400
telling me we want to rotate because we
 

1835
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,030
telling me we want to rotate because we
lost value area high and we are coming

1836
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
lost value area high and we are coming
 

1837
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,349
lost value area high and we are coming
to gap fill and point of control. We

1838
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:31,359
to gap fill and point of control. We
 

1839
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,510
to gap fill and point of control. We
might do a back test to this. We might

1840
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:33,520
might do a back test to this. We might
 

1841
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,270
might do a back test to this. We might
do something like this. Right. I'd

1842
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
do something like this. Right. I'd
 

1843
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,750
do something like this. Right. I'd
imagine we stay kind of within these

1844
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:37,760
imagine we stay kind of within these
 

1845
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,990
imagine we stay kind of within these
confines today. I can't imagine really

1846
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,000
confines today. I can't imagine really
 

1847
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,390
confines today. I can't imagine really
that we move outside of that unless they

1848
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
that we move outside of that unless they
 

1849
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,030
that we move outside of that unless they
go into panic and they, you know, they

1850
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,040
go into panic and they, you know, they
 

1851
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,030
go into panic and they, you know, they
start getting out of their moves before

1852
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,040
start getting out of their moves before
 

1853
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,069
start getting out of their moves before
the end of the week because they're

1854
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
the end of the week because they're
 

1855
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,069
the end of the week because they're
worried about that carry trade, which is

1856
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
worried about that carry trade, which is
 

1857
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,750
worried about that carry trade, which is
what I talked about in the newsletter. I

1858
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
what I talked about in the newsletter. I
 

1859
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,670
what I talked about in the newsletter. I
think that's the big red alarm this

1860
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
think that's the big red alarm this
 

1861
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,750
think that's the big red alarm this
week. Okay, gap fill almost there,

1862
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:57,760
week. Okay, gap fill almost there,
 

1863
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,589
week. Okay, gap fill almost there,
folks. So, technically your gap fills

1864
00:42:59,589 --> 00:42:59,599
folks. So, technically your gap fills
 

1865
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:08,309
folks. So, technically your gap fills
into 14 somewhere around there.

1866
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319

 

1867

channel is is full of it. It wasn't an

1876
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
channel is is full of it. It wasn't an
 

1877
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,670
channel is is full of it. It wasn't an
attack on you or anyone else.

1878
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
attack on you or anyone else.
 

1879
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,589
attack on you or anyone else.
It's just the big thing, the difference

1880
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
It's just the big thing, the difference
 

1881
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,990
It's just the big thing, the difference
between here and watching

1882
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,000
between here and watching
 

1883
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,950
between here and watching
some of my peers who might just be like,

1884
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
some of my peers who might just be like,
 

1885
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,550
some of my peers who might just be like,
you know, like Danny trades. Okay guys,

1892
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:34,640
will tell you what I would be looking at
 

1893
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,470
will tell you what I would be looking at

00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:36,480
and why.
 

1895
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,470
and why.
Okay, so gap fill coming coming up here.

1896
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:42,480

 

1897
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,030

[\h__\h] me. Why Why Ninja Trader did you do

1898
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
[\h__\h] me. Why Why Ninja Trader did you do
 

1899
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:54,550
[\h__\h] me. Why Why Ninja Trader did you do
this to me? We're in such an easy setup.

1900
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560

 

1901
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,430

Killing me. Killing me. All right, you

1902
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
Killing me. Killing me. All right, you
 

1903
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,670
Killing me. Killing me. All right, you
can see them. There's 182 lot. He's just

1904
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
can see them. There's 182 lot. He's just
 

1905
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,190
can see them. There's 182 lot. He's just
jumped up to front run this. So, he's

1906
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
jumped up to front run this. So, he's
 

1907
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,630
jumped up to front run this. So, he's
trying to absorb here. So they're trying

1908
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:02,640
trying to absorb here. So they're trying
 

1909
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,069
trying to absorb here. So they're trying
to just they're trying to cover their

1910
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
to just they're trying to cover their
 

1911
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,510
to just they're trying to cover their
positions into this gap fill. Someone

1912
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
positions into this gap fill. Someone
 

1913
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,710
positions into this gap fill. Someone
was worried he wouldn't get filled. So

1914
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:06,720
was worried he wouldn't get filled. So
 

1915
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,589
was worried he wouldn't get filled. So
he just jumped up from 12 to 20s to get

1916
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
he just jumped up from 12 to 20s to get
 

1917
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,550
he just jumped up from 12 to 20s to get
filled, which he's now filled. 180 lot,

1918
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
filled, which he's now filled. 180 lot,
 

1919
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,309
filled, which he's now filled. 180 lot,
180 lot, 180 lot. He's trying to get

1920
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
180 lot, 180 lot. He's trying to get
 

1921
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,829
180 lot, 180 lot. He's trying to get
filled. 181 lot. There you go. He's

1922
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
filled. 181 lot. There you go. He's
 

1923
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,190
filled. 181 lot. There you go. He's
filled. All right. So that's an

1924
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
filled. All right. So that's an
 

1925
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,030
filled. All right. So that's an
efficient market. We've now filled the

1926
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,040
efficient market. We've now filled the
 

1927
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,750
efficient market. We've now filled the
gap here. And the next level really is

1928
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:21,760
gap here. And the next level really is
 

1929
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,430
gap here. And the next level really is
this value rotation. So your runners

1930
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
this value rotation. So your runners
 

1931
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,430
this value rotation. So your runners
now, I would be out like 80% of my

1932
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
now, I would be out like 80% of my
 

1933
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,870
now, I would be out like 80% of my
position, I'll be honest. And I'd be

1934
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
position, I'll be honest. And I'd be
 

1935
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,829
position, I'll be honest. And I'd be
holding 20% for here. And I'd be

1936
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:29,839
holding 20% for here. And I'd be
 

1937
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,109
holding 20% for here. And I'd be
covering some as we get down into this.

1938
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:33,119
covering some as we get down into this.
 

1939
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,550
covering some as we get down into this.
And this will be the best move of the

1940
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,560
And this will be the best move of the
 

1941
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,630
And this will be the best move of the
day, folks. You have absolutely nailed

1942
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,640
day, folks. You have absolutely nailed
 

1943
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,790
day, folks. You have absolutely nailed
this. It's a beautiful move. I mean, if

1944
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
this. It's a beautiful move. I mean, if
 

1945
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,990
this. It's a beautiful move. I mean, if
you didn't get knocked I would have got

1946
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,000
you didn't get knocked I would have got
 

1947
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,030
you didn't get knocked I would have got
knocked out. I'm telling you, I would

1948
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,040
knocked out. I'm telling you, I would
 

1949
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,390
knocked out. I'm telling you, I would
have got knocked out and had to

1950
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:42,400
have got knocked out and had to
 

1951
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,710
have got knocked out and had to
re-enter. But if you didn't, there's 150

Yeah, ex exactly Indie.
 

1961
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,349
Yeah, ex exactly Indie.
Um the differences uh this time in my

1962
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
Um the differences uh this time in my
 

1963
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,589
Um the differences uh this time in my
mind is we are so

1964
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
mind is we are so
 

1965
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,030
mind is we are so
if if you go from January and you look

1966
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,040
if if you go from January and you look
 

1967
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,349
if if you go from January and you look
at what the market's done since then,

1968
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
at what the market's done since then,
 

1969
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,550
at what the market's done since then,
we're so overleveraged. Um and if you

1970
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
we're so overleveraged. Um and if you
 

1971
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,710
we're so overleveraged. Um and if you
look at growth names and tech stocks, I

1972
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
look at growth names and tech stocks, I
 

1973
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,670
look at growth names and tech stocks, I
think I talked about it in the

1974
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
think I talked about it in the
 

1975
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,990
think I talked about it in the
newsletter. Um my opinion is Asia in are

1976
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,000
newsletter. Um my opinion is Asia in are
 

1977
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,510
newsletter. Um my opinion is Asia in are
in big leverage products. There's a

1978
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520
in big leverage products. There's a
 

1979
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,670
in big leverage products. There's a
reason crypto started freaking out,

1980
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
reason crypto started freaking out,
 

1981
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,030
reason crypto started freaking out,
right? Other than the fact we've gone

1982
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
right? Other than the fact we've gone
 

1983
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,790
right? Other than the fact we've gone
through the cycle, right? We're in

1984
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:36,800
through the cycle, right? We're in
 

1985
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,589
through the cycle, right? We're in
liquidation mode. There's a reason

1986
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
liquidation mode. There's a reason
 

1987
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,910
liquidation mode. There's a reason
everyone's really worried about AI that

1988
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:41,920
everyone's really worried about AI that
 

1989
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,710
everyone's really worried about AI that
the valuations are massive. Um it's very

1990
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:44,720
the valuations are massive. Um it's very
 

1991
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,470
the valuations are massive. Um it's very
speculative. It's it's probably going to

1992
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480
speculative. It's it's probably going to
 

1993
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,550
speculative. It's it's probably going to
work out the speculation, but when we

1994
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:48,560
work out the speculation, but when we
 

1995
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,910
work out the speculation, but when we
get things like um Japan increase the

1996
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:51,920
get things like um Japan increase the
 

1997
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,190
get things like um Japan increase the
rates, they're going to have to derisk

1998
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
rates, they're going to have to derisk
 

1999
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,910
rates, they're going to have to derisk
their risk on US assets and then you get

2000
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:55,920
their risk on US assets and then you get
 

2001
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,829
their risk on US assets and then you get
a liquidity crunch because you get a

2002
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
a liquidity crunch because you get a
 

2003
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,309
a liquidity crunch because you get a
race. You get a race to sell. So if we

2004
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:00,319
race. You get a race to sell. So if we
 

2005
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,309
race. You get a race to sell. So if we
if we've seen weakness since Friday,

2006
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:02,319
if we've seen weakness since Friday,
 

2007
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,309
if we've seen weakness since Friday,
which we have, we've seen like the

2008
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319
which we have, we've seen like the
 

2009
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,470
which we have, we've seen like the
Oracle and um AVGO scares. Okay? So

2010
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,480
Oracle and um AVGO scares. Okay? So
 

2011
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,829
Oracle and um AVGO scares. Okay? So
everyone started like, okay, I'm going

2012
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:09,839
everyone started like, okay, I'm going
 

2013
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,670
everyone started like, okay, I'm going
to start taking profit. We've had a

2014
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
to start taking profit. We've had a
 

2015
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,349
to start taking profit. We've had a
massive year. We need to start locking

2016
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:13,359
massive year. We need to start locking
 

2017
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,950
massive year. We need to start locking
profit because if we don't lock in

2018
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:14,960
profit because if we don't lock in
 

2019
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,829
profit because if we don't lock in
profit now and that Japan trade comes in

2020
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
profit now and that Japan trade comes in
 

2021
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,670
profit now and that Japan trade comes in
when it's 1:00 a.m. in the morning and

2022
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
when it's 1:00 a.m. in the morning and
 

2023
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,430
when it's 1:00 a.m. in the morning and
everyone's asleep and we wake up to a

2024
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,440
everyone's asleep and we wake up to a
 

2025
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,670
everyone's asleep and we wake up to a
market and gap down, uh, it's going to

2026
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
market and gap down, uh, it's going to
 

2027
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,990
market and gap down, uh, it's going to
be a rush then for everyone in profit to

2028
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,000
be a rush then for everyone in profit to
 

2029
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,829
be a rush then for everyone in profit to
be like sell sell. You're just going to

2030
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
be like sell sell. You're just going to
 

2031
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,589
be like sell sell. You're just going to
see waterfall, waterfall, waterfall and

2032
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:29,599
see waterfall, waterfall, waterfall and
 

2033
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,829
see waterfall, waterfall, waterfall and
then you get liquidity problems and not

2034
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:31,839
then you get liquidity problems and not
 

2035
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,589
then you get liquidity problems and not
just liquidity problems on the day like

2036
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
just liquidity problems on the day like
 

2037
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,190
just liquidity problems on the day like
multiple days.

2038
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,200

 

2039
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,630

Okay, Spy is trying to just complete it

2040
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640
Okay, Spy is trying to just complete it
 

2041
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,150
Okay, Spy is trying to just complete it
gap fill here as well. It's very very

2042
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:40,160
gap fill here as well. It's very very
 

2043
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,750
gap fill here as well. It's very very
close. 80 82 or just under 82 will be

2044
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
close. 80 82 or just under 82 will be
 

2045
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,550
close. 80 82 or just under 82 will be
gap for 8176. So it's hitting those 82s

2046
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
gap for 8176. So it's hitting those 82s
 

2047
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,910
gap for 8176. So it's hitting those 82s
now. Remember this is gamma level on

2048
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:47,920
now. Remember this is gamma level on
 

2049
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,589
now. Remember this is gamma level on
spy.

2050
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:49,599
spy.
 

2051
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,190
spy.
And if we stay heavy, we probably trade

2052
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
And if we stay heavy, we probably trade
 

2053
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,990
And if we stay heavy, we probably trade
the 80s on spy. So really nice. So now

2054
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,000
the 80s on spy. So really nice. So now
 

2055
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,589
the 80s on spy. So really nice. So now
you should be out 80% of your position

2056
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:55,599
you should be out 80% of your position
 

2057
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,430
you should be out 80% of your position
now. The only thing we're looking at now

2058
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:57,440
now. The only thing we're looking at now
 

2059
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,270
now. The only thing we're looking at now
is previous day value area low and

2060
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,280
is previous day value area low and
 

2061
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,190
is previous day value area low and
previous day low. So previous day value

2062
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
previous day low. So previous day value
 

2063
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,270
previous day low. So previous day value
low, previous day low. I would say 20%

2064
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,280
low, previous day low. I would say 20%
 

2065
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,510
low, previous day low. I would say 20%
of your position left for this move into

2066
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:05,520
of your position left for this move into
 

2067
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,349
of your position left for this move into
here. I would be covering almost all of

2068
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
here. I would be covering almost all of
 

2069
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,109
here. I would be covering almost all of
my position here. just holding a tiny

2070
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:09,119
my position here. just holding a tiny
 

2071
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,349
my position here. just holding a tiny
runner in case just in case it wants to

2072
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,359
runner in case just in case it wants to
 

2073
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,710
runner in case just in case it wants to
come back down into this naked point of

2074
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:12,720
come back down into this naked point of
 

2075
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,069
come back down into this naked point of
control today. I would find that

2076
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
control today. I would find that
 

2077
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,390
control today. I would find that
unlikely, but if it does it today when

2078
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
unlikely, but if it does it today when
 

2079
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,710
unlikely, but if it does it today when
I've been able to unable to trade, I can

2080
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
I've been able to unable to trade, I can
 

2081
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,309

very pissed off if it chooses to do this

2088
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,520
very pissed off if it chooses to do this
 

2089
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,750
very pissed off if it chooses to do this
trade. The one day where I'm not being

2090
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,760

in the props either. So, it's all
 

2213

00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:09,200
seeing more weakness come in here. They
 

2217
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,670
seeing more weakness come in here. They
want to sell this through. VIX is like

2218
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:11,680
want to sell this through. VIX is like
 

2219
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,510
want to sell this through. VIX is like
starting to spike now. It's through

starting to spike now. It's through
 

2221
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,430
starting to spike now. It's through
1650s. It's starting to break out. Next

2222
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
1650s. It's starting to break out. Next
 

2223
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,030
1650s. It's starting to break out. Next
level on VIX I'd be looking at is the

2224
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:17,040
level on VIX I'd be looking at is the
 

2225
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,630
level on VIX I'd be looking at is the
17s. This is getting very, very heavy.

2226
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:18,640
17s. This is getting very, very heavy.

here. Anything below this on the day is
 

2233
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,109
here. Anything below this on the day is
a bonus. I would not read short here.

2234
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:27,119
a bonus. I would not read short here.
 

2235

a bonus. I would not read short here.
The only way I would read short if I was

you now is if we break below all this
 

2239
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,270
you now is if we break below all this
and we do like a multileg here and build

and we do like a multileg here and build
 

2241
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,630
and we do like a multileg here and build
and build and build and then look for

00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:34,640
and build and build and then look for
 

2243
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,790

that snap. I really hope they don't do
 

2245
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,670

that today. Alex will be a very upset
 

2247
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:48,790

2269
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,790

00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:14,960
need. And that's the way you need to see
 

2273
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,190
need. And that's the way you need to see
the market. Like, remember, we came to

2274
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:17,200
the market. Like, remember, we came to
 

2275
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,870
the market. Like, remember, we came to
the market today and we thought, well,

2276
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:18,880
the market today and we thought, well,
 

2277
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,230
the market today and we thought, well,
we we might have a queen queen setup.

2278
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,240
we we might have a queen queen setup.
 

2279
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,910
we we might have a queen queen setup.
All right. If we're playing Texas

2280
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:23,920
All right. If we're playing Texas
 

2281
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,190
All right. If we're playing Texas
holder, we might have a queen queen

2282
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
holder, we might have a queen queen
 

2283
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,950
holder, we might have a queen queen
setup. We failed the New York open. High

2284
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:26,960
setup. We failed the New York open. High
 

2285
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,790
setup. We failed the New York open. High
day was New York open. We traded

2286
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:28,800
day was New York open. We traded
 

2287
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,030
day was New York open. We traded
underneath. We back tested previous day

2288
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:31,040
underneath. We back tested previous day
 

2289
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,549
underneath. We back tested previous day
value area high. This is what I was

2290
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:32,559
value area high. This is what I was
 

2291
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,549
value area high. This is what I was
talking about this up here. Once we see

2292
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:34,559
talking about this up here. Once we see
 

2293
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,630
talking about this up here. Once we see
this, this is confirmation. All right. M

2294
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
this, this is confirmation. All right. M
 

2295
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,190
this, this is confirmation. All right. M
maybe maybe king king. Maybe we can say

2296
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,200
maybe maybe king king. Maybe we can say
 

2297
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,510
maybe maybe king king. Maybe we can say
king king. All right. Maybe we move the

2298
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
king king. All right. Maybe we move the
 

2299
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,190
king king. All right. Maybe we move the
new hand is a king king. So it's like

2300
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,200
new hand is a king king. So it's like
 

2301
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,349
new hand is a king king. So it's like
it's unlikely market's going to get an

2302
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:45,359
it's unlikely market's going to get an
 

2303
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,870
it's unlikely market's going to get an
ace ace and beat us at this point.

2304
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
ace ace and beat us at this point.
 

2305
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,710
ace ace and beat us at this point.
Right. So we get king king. We're like

2306
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,720
Right. So we get king king. We're like
 

2307
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,910
Right. So we get king king. We're like
okay well let's see the flop. Okay. the

2308
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
okay well let's see the flop. Okay. the
 

2309
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,230
okay well let's see the flop. Okay. the
flop comes in and it's like a two, a

2310
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
flop comes in and it's like a two, a
 

2311
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,670
flop comes in and it's like a two, a
four, and an eight. And we're like,

2312
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:55,680
four, and an eight. And we're like,
 

2313
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,589
four, and an eight. And we're like,
well, we feel pretty [\h__\h] good about

2314
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
well, we feel pretty [\h__\h] good about
 

2315
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,670
well, we feel pretty [\h__\h] good about
that. And now we're like, we're not all

2316
00:51:59,670 --> 00:51:59,680
that. And now we're like, we're not all
 

2317
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,270
that. And now we're like, we're not all
in, but we're like, we we'll take that.

2318
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
in, but we're like, we we'll take that.
 

2319
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,349
in, but we're like, we we'll take that.
Thanks very much. We've made our money.

2320
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:03,359
Thanks very much. We've made our money.
 

2321
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,430
Thanks very much. We've made our money.
Everyone on the table gave us their

2322
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:05,440
Everyone on the table gave us their
 

2323
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,470
Everyone on the table gave us their
money. Now, we just wait, right? We wait

2324
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:08,480
money. Now, we just wait, right? We wait
 

2325
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,510
money. Now, we just wait, right? We wait
to see how many idiots want to give us

2326
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
to see how many idiots want to give us
 

2327
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,990
to see how many idiots want to give us
more money. But we've made

2328
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,000
more money. But we've made
 

2329
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,470
more money. But we've made
80 plus% of our money. All right? And

2330
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
80 plus% of our money. All right? And
 

2331
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,069
80 plus% of our money. All right? And
you should have hit your daily goals on

2332
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:18,079
you should have hit your daily goals on
 

2333
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,030
you should have hit your daily goals on
these breakdowns. Look at the

2334
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:19,040
these breakdowns. Look at the
 

2335
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,630
these breakdowns. Look at the
continuation. just bare flat, bare flat,

2336
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
continuation. just bare flat, bare flat,
 

2337
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,230
continuation. just bare flat, bare flat,
bare flat, bare flat. The only one that

2338
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:22,240
bare flat, bare flat. The only one that
 

2339
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,069
bare flat, bare flat. The only one that
annoyed me was it this guy here that

2340
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:24,079
annoyed me was it this guy here that
 

2341
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,950
annoyed me was it this guy here that
picked over 90 to 300.

2342
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:26,960
picked over 90 to 300.
 

2343
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,790
picked over 90 to 300.
I know structurally it was fine, but I

2344
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:28,800
I know structurally it was fine, but I
 

2345
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,190
I know structurally it was fine, but I
was watching basically in here where

2346
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
was watching basically in here where
 

2347
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,549
was watching basically in here where
everyone was trapped. What you didn't

2348
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:32,559
everyone was trapped. What you didn't
 

2349
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,430
everyone was trapped. What you didn't
want them to do was let these guys out.

2350
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:35,440
want them to do was let these guys out.
 

2351
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,109
want them to do was let these guys out.
They kind of let them out and then

2352
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
They kind of let them out and then
 

2353
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,670
They kind of let them out and then
resold it. So, you can see the reaction

2354
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:39,680
resold it. So, you can see the reaction
 

2355
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,230
resold it. So, you can see the reaction
here now as we trade back into previous

2356
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240
here now as we trade back into previous
 

2357
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,349
here now as we trade back into previous
day point of control. I'm going to put

2358
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:43,359
day point of control. I'm going to put
 

2359
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,950
day point of control. I'm going to put
some volume on here for the current day

2360
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:44,960
some volume on here for the current day
 

2361
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,430
some volume on here for the current day
now. We've been open a while, right?

2362
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:47,440
now. We've been open a while, right?
 

2363
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,069
now. We've been open a while, right?
We're retesting value. This area is key

2364
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:50,079
We're retesting value. This area is key
 

2365
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,910
We're retesting value. This area is key
now for sentiment. All right. This area,

2366
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:51,920
now for sentiment. All right. This area,
 

2367
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,510
now for sentiment. All right. This area,
this is value area low on the current

2368
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
this is value area low on the current
 

2369
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,430
this is value area low on the current
session, previous day point of control.

2370
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
session, previous day point of control.
 

2371
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,630
session, previous day point of control.
Right? If they hold this, they might

2372
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
Right? If they hold this, they might
 

2373
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,710
Right? If they hold this, they might
rotate. If they reclaim this, then the

2374
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:58,720
rotate. If they reclaim this, then the
 

2375
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,950
rotate. If they reclaim this, then the
rotation back upside's possible with VWA

2376
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:00,960
rotation back upside's possible with VWA
 

2377
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,190
rotation back upside's possible with VWA
up and previous day value area high. So,

2378
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:03,200
up and previous day value area high. So,
 

2379
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,750
up and previous day value area high. So,
I would say your money's been made. Your

2380
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:05,760
I would say your money's been made. Your
 

2381
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,270
I would say your money's been made. Your
money should have been made here this

2382
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,280
money should have been made here this
 

2383
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:15,990
money should have been made here this
morning.

2384
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000

 

2385
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,430

You turned 62 on Friday. Happy birthday.

2386
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,440
You turned 62 on Friday. Happy birthday.
 

2387
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,190
You turned 62 on Friday. Happy birthday.
Happy happy belated, my friend.

2388
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
Happy happy belated, my friend.
 

2389
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,430
Happy happy belated, my friend.
One good trade is all you need. Alex,

2390
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:25,440
One good trade is all you need. Alex,
 

2391
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,150
One good trade is all you need. Alex,
what is a good way of differentiating a

2392
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
what is a good way of differentiating a
 

2393
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,190
what is a good way of differentiating a
stop run from an actual move? Uh, for

2394
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
stop run from an actual move? Uh, for
 

2395
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,790
stop run from an actual move? Uh, for
me, it's it's it's like it's never how

2396
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:34,800
me, it's it's it's like it's never how
 

2397
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,109
me, it's it's it's like it's never how
can I put this? It's a question of

2398
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:37,119
can I put this? It's a question of
 

2399
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,309
can I put this? It's a question of
liquidity and what we do afterwards. All

2400
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
liquidity and what we do afterwards. All
 

2401
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,230
liquidity and what we do afterwards. All
right. So it's we can always have levels

2402
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,240
right. So it's we can always have levels
 

2403
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,710
right. So it's we can always have levels
on a chart, right? Every level we look

2404
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,720
on a chart, right? Every level we look
 

2405
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,630
on a chart, right? Every level we look
at is pretty much near enough always a

2406
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
at is pretty much near enough always a
 

2407
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,870
at is pretty much near enough always a
horizontal level. Otherwise, it's a

2408
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:50,880
horizontal level. Otherwise, it's a
 

2409
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,430
horizontal level. Otherwise, it's a
trend line. What we do afterwards is

2410
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:53,440
trend line. What we do afterwards is
 

2411
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,950
trend line. What we do afterwards is
important. So we've built all this

2412
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
important. So we've built all this
 

2413
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,150
important. So we've built all this
liquidity here. All right, if we just

2414
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:58,160
liquidity here. All right, if we just
 

2415
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,710
liquidity here. All right, if we just
poke up and have no reaction, not not

2416
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:00,720
poke up and have no reaction, not not
 

2417
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,390
poke up and have no reaction, not not
able to base, all right, then that can

2418
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
able to base, all right, then that can
 

2419
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,589
able to base, all right, then that can
be a stop run and a rotation. However,

2420
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:05,599
be a stop run and a rotation. However,
 

2421
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,750
be a stop run and a rotation. However,
if we start getting up and we start to

2422
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:07,760
if we start getting up and we start to
 

2423
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,910
if we start getting up and we start to
base, all right, and then we start doing

2424
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:09,920
base, all right, and then we start doing
 

2425
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,990
base, all right, and then we start doing
that, that will be a reversal back into

2426
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:14,000
that, that will be a reversal back into
 

2427
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,030
that, that will be a reversal back into
or into here for example. Same as when

2428
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:17,040
or into here for example. Same as when
 

2429
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,230
or into here for example. Same as when
we talked about this morning,

2430
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:20,240
we talked about this morning,
 

2431
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,510
we talked about this morning,
right? If you think about what the stop

2432
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:21,520
right? If you think about what the stop
 

2433
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,390
right? If you think about what the stop
run was this morning, it was shorts

2434
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:24,400
run was this morning, it was shorts
 

2435
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,790
run was this morning, it was shorts
leaning on this and buyers breaking this

2436
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:26,800
leaning on this and buyers breaking this
 

2437
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,030
leaning on this and buyers breaking this
out, right? And we went, yeah, yeah,

2438
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
out, right? And we went, yeah, yeah,
 

2439
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,470
out, right? And we went, yeah, yeah,
yeah, we're going to go high. No, we're

2440
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:30,480
yeah, we're going to go high. No, we're
 

2441
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,549
yeah, we're going to go high. No, we're
not. All right, that's the stop run. The

2442
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
not. All right, that's the stop run. The
 

2443
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,109
not. All right, that's the stop run. The
difference there being did we base

2444
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
difference there being did we base
 

2445
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,069
difference there being did we base
above? For me, it's always like are we

2446
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
above? For me, it's always like are we
 

2447
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,390
above? For me, it's always like are we
breaking a retest or are we all the

2448
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:40,400
breaking a retest or are we all the
 

2449
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,150
breaking a retest or are we all the
market does let me just move up here. If

2450
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,160
market does let me just move up here. If
 

2451
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,750
market does let me just move up here. If
we where can I draw it? If we just think

2452
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:45,760
we where can I draw it? If we just think
 

2453
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,589
we where can I draw it? If we just think
about basics,

2454
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:47,599
about basics,
 

2455
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,510
about basics,
right? If this is support and this is

2456
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:49,520
right? If this is support and this is
 

2457
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,990
right? If this is support and this is
resistance, right? If the market does

2458
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,000
resistance, right? If the market does
 

2459
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,390
resistance, right? If the market does
this, right, it's a fail breakout. If

2460
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:54,400
this, right, it's a fail breakout. If
 

2461
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,670
this, right, it's a fail breakout. If
the market does this, right, then it's

2462
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:57,680
the market does this, right, then it's
 

2463
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,829
the market does this, right, then it's
not a stop run. That's a stop run.

2464
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
not a stop run. That's a stop run.
 

2465
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,069
not a stop run. That's a stop run.
That's a continuation, right? Do we hold

2466
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:02,079
That's a continuation, right? Do we hold
 

2467
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,390
That's a continuation, right? Do we hold
the level? And think about this as like

2468
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:04,400
the level? And think about this as like
 

2469
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,990
the level? And think about this as like
blocks, right? They're not necessarily

2470
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
blocks, right? They're not necessarily
 

2471
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,309
blocks, right? They're not necessarily
tiny little thin lines. Do we hold a

2472
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
tiny little thin lines. Do we hold a
 

2473
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,549
tiny little thin lines. Do we hold a
level or do we just poke through it and

2474
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:10,559
level or do we just poke through it and
 

2475
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,430
level or do we just poke through it and
instantly reject? And then what happens

2476
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
instantly reject? And then what happens
 

2477
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,109
instantly reject? And then what happens
in here becomes important on the

2478
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:15,119
in here becomes important on the
 

2479
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,230
in here becomes important on the
footprint. Right? For example, these

2480
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:18,240
footprint. Right? For example, these
 

2481
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,309
footprint. Right? For example, these
last 1 2 3 4 five candles. Buyers,

2482
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
last 1 2 3 4 five candles. Buyers,
 

2483
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,390
last 1 2 3 4 five candles. Buyers,
at least on that last candle, buyers,

2484
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:24,400
at least on that last candle, buyers,
 

2485
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,150
at least on that last candle, buyers,
there's a lot of buying activity here

2486
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,160
there's a lot of buying activity here
 

2487
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,230
there's a lot of buying activity here
and at the very top of this. And we're

2488
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:30,240
and at the very top of this. And we're
 

2489
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,910
and at the very top of this. And we're
rejecting this level. Remember what we

2490
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
rejecting this level. Remember what we
 

2491
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,470
rejecting this level. Remember what we
just said? If we reject this level here,

2492
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,480
just said? If we reject this level here,
 

2493
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,549
just said? If we reject this level here,
there is potential continuation trade

2494
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:36,559
there is potential continuation trade
 

2495
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,470
there is potential continuation trade
lower. It's value area low on the day

2496
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480
lower. It's value area low on the day
 

2497
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,309
lower. It's value area low on the day
and its previous point of control. If we

2498
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:40,319
and its previous point of control. If we
 

2499
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,950
and its previous point of control. If we
reject this, this can happen. If we get

2500
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,960
reject this, this can happen. If we get
 

2501
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,230
reject this, this can happen. If we get
above this, this can happen. This is why

2502
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240
above this, this can happen. This is why
 

2503
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,270
above this, this can happen. This is why
for me, I would wait. If I wanted to be

2504
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
for me, I would wait. If I wanted to be
 

2505
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,309
for me, I would wait. If I wanted to be
long today, I would wait to see a firm

2506
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
long today, I would wait to see a firm
 

2507
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,470
long today, I would wait to see a firm
reclaim of this. And ideally, it will

2508
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:54,480
reclaim of this. And ideally, it will
 

2509
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,750
reclaim of this. And ideally, it will
happen after we do that. You want them

2510
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
happen after we do that. You want them
 

2511
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,910
happen after we do that. You want them
to stop run this first. At the moment,

2512
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920
to stop run this first. At the moment,
 

2513
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:14,549
to stop run this first. At the moment,
we're short bias.

2514
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:14,559

 

2515
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,069

Heavy selling here. Not getting their

2516
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
Heavy selling here. Not getting their
 

2517
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,030
Heavy selling here. Not getting their
way right now. All right. From 98 to 91,

2518
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,040
way right now. All right. From 98 to 91,
 

2519
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,270
way right now. All right. From 98 to 91,
they just tried to heavily sell this.

2520
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
they just tried to heavily sell this.
 

2521
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,430
they just tried to heavily sell this.
But just be aware of this level.

2522
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
But just be aware of this level.
 

2523
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,870
But just be aware of this level.
No worries, Ero.

2524
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
No worries, Ero.
 

2525
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,630
No worries, Ero.
So, if you look at Spy, Spy is trying to

2526
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:32,640
So, if you look at Spy, Spy is trying to
 

2527
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,549
So, if you look at Spy, Spy is trying to
reclaim.

2528
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:34,559
reclaim.
 

2529
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,750
reclaim.
Um, it's it's uh PDC. It's just hanging

2530
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
Um, it's it's uh PDC. It's just hanging
 

2531
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,710
Um, it's it's uh PDC. It's just hanging
around at PDC. Tesla drifted back down

2532
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:40,720
around at PDC. Tesla drifted back down
 

2533
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,589
around at PDC. Tesla drifted back down
into uh VWAP, went under VWAP, back over

2534
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:43,599
into uh VWAP, went under VWAP, back over
 

2535
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,349
into uh VWAP, went under VWAP, back over
VWAP. It's trying to build a fiveminute

2536
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:45,359
VWAP. It's trying to build a fiveminute
 

2537
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,030
VWAP. It's trying to build a fiveminute
flag. Tesla looks just like Friday.

2538
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,040
flag. Tesla looks just like Friday.
 

2539
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,109
flag. Tesla looks just like Friday.
Honestly, it looks identical to Friday.

2540
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:49,119
Honestly, it looks identical to Friday.
 

2541
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,349
Honestly, it looks identical to Friday.
Uh VIX rejected, right? We talked about

2542
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
Uh VIX rejected, right? We talked about
 

2543
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,750
Uh VIX rejected, right? We talked about
VIX maybe trying to get back 317. All

2544
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,760
VIX maybe trying to get back 317. All
 

2545
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,470
VIX maybe trying to get back 317. All
right, it drifted up into it. It's uh

2546
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
right, it drifted up into it. It's uh
 

2547
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,150
right, it drifted up into it. It's uh
got sold into there. So, we need to be

2548
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
got sold into there. So, we need to be
 

2549
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,349
got sold into there. So, we need to be
aware of that. It's still trying to

2550
00:56:59,349 --> 00:56:59,359
aware of that. It's still trying to
 

2551
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,190
aware of that. It's still trying to
base. Can still do a 5minute flag. It

2552
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,200
base. Can still do a 5minute flag. It
 

2553
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,670
base. Can still do a 5minute flag. It
filled a little imbalance, but I'd say

2554
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:03,680
filled a little imbalance, but I'd say
 

2555
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,750
filled a little imbalance, but I'd say
we're going into like balance for a

2556
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:05,760
we're going into like balance for a
 

2557
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,109
we're going into like balance for a
couple minutes while we make our

2558
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
couple minutes while we make our
 

2559
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,950
couple minutes while we make our
decision. There is still lowhanging

2560
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960
decision. There is still lowhanging
 

2561
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,510
decision. There is still lowhanging
fruit lower previous day value low,

2562
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
fruit lower previous day value low,
 

2563
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,349
fruit lower previous day value low,
previous day low. As long as we stay

2564
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:13,359
previous day low. As long as we stay
 

2565
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,270
previous day low. As long as we stay
heavy versus this level like we talked

2566
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:15,280
heavy versus this level like we talked
 

2567
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,069
heavy versus this level like we talked
about and we can see a continuation into

2568
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
about and we can see a continuation into
 

2569
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,990
about and we can see a continuation into
this. So, if you're still, some of you

2570
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
this. So, if you're still, some of you
 

2571
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,309
this. So, if you're still, some of you
might still be in this looking for

2572
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:22,319
might still be in this looking for
 

2573
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,510
might still be in this looking for
these. If we break down under here,

2574
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:25,520
these. If we break down under here,
 

2575
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,190
these. If we break down under here,
well, I'll be very very very upset

2576
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
well, I'll be very very very upset
 

2577
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,710
well, I'll be very very very upset
because it means we will be coming for

2578
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
because it means we will be coming for
 

2579
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,510
because it means we will be coming for
that old weekly naked PC underneath us

2580
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:33,520
that old weekly naked PC underneath us
 

2581
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,630
that old weekly naked PC underneath us
into uh 24,900s

2582
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640

 

2583
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,470

and I'll be upset because I can't trade

2584
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
and I'll be upset because I can't trade
 

2585
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,990
and I'll be upset because I can't trade
today and this is the trade I've been

2586
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:42,000
today and this is the trade I've been
 

2587
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,470
today and this is the trade I've been
waiting for and that will just as we'd

2588
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
waiting for and that will just as we'd
 

2589
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,309
waiting for and that will just as we'd
say in the UK that would be sod sod's

2590
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:46,319
say in the UK that would be sod sod's
 

2591
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,829
say in the UK that would be sod sod's
law. All right, here's the trade into

2592
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:47,839
law. All right, here's the trade into
 

2593
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,109
law. All right, here's the trade into
value.

2594
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119

 

2595
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,150

trading into value here.

2596
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:54,160
trading into value here.
 

2597
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,589
trading into value here.
So, this is your TP.

2598
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
So, this is your TP.
 

2599
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,589
So, this is your TP.
So, here and here. And then runners,

2600
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:01,599
So, here and here. And then runners,
 

2601
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,069
So, here and here. And then runners,
if you do this, I'll be upset, but I

2602
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
if you do this, I'll be upset, but I
 

2603
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,069
if you do this, I'll be upset, but I
would say I'd be out 90% of my position

2604
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
would say I'd be out 90% of my position
 

2605
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,030
would say I'd be out 90% of my position
into this.

2606
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:09,040
into this.
 

2607
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,470
into this.
90% of my position would be out now.

2608
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,480

 

2609
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,630

Uh, it's anchored volume profile, so

2610
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:16,640
Uh, it's anchored volume profile, so
 

2611
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,069
Uh, it's anchored volume profile, so
it's not visible. This is anchored

2612
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:18,079
it's not visible. This is anchored
 

2613
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,910
it's not visible. This is anchored
volume profile from 9:30. It doesn't

2614
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
volume profile from 9:30. It doesn't
 

2615
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,430
volume profile from 9:30. It doesn't
change when I move, right? It doesn't

2616
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:21,440
change when I move, right? It doesn't
 

2617
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,030

It's not a visible range. It's anchored

2618
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
It's not a visible range. It's anchored
 

2619
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,829
It's not a visible range. It's anchored
to the 930. So, for me, just call it the

2620
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:25,839
to the 930. So, for me, just call it the
 

2621
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:38,549
to the 930. So, for me, just call it the
New York print. New York print.

2622
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:38,559

 

2623
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,950

Why do I get the feeling?

2624
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:40,960
Why do I get the feeling?
 

2625
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,710
Why do I get the feeling?
Why do I have this nasty, nasty, nasty

2626
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
Why do I have this nasty, nasty, nasty
 

2627
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,710
Why do I have this nasty, nasty, nasty
feeling we're going to trade into 24,930

2628
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
feeling we're going to trade into 24,930
 

2629
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,910
feeling we're going to trade into 24,930
today?

2630
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:53,920

 

2631
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:06,309

Better not. We better not.

2632
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:06,319

 

2633
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:07,670

Do I think it would hit previous day

2634
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:07,680
Do I think it would hit previous day
 

2635
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,589
Do I think it would hit previous day
low? Um, I really don't know, mate. I

2636
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:09,599
low? Um, I really don't know, mate. I

don't know.

2638
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
don't know.
 

2639
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,270
don't know.
Um, if they protect it, they're going to

2640
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:13,280
Um, if they protect it, they're going to
 

2641
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,030
Um, if they protect it, they're going to
protect it where we are. Right? If they

2642
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,040
protect it where we are. Right? If they
 

2643
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,549
protect it where we are. Right? If they
protect it, they're going to protect it

2644
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559
protect it, they're going to protect it
 

2645
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,589
protect it, they're going to protect it
from here. If we look at this,

2646
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:21,599
from here. If we look at this,
 

2647
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,750
from here. If we look at this,
all right, we went higher low, higher

2648
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:23,760
all right, we went higher low, higher
 

2649
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,630
all right, we went higher low, higher
low. We had excess under here. All

2650
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:26,640
low. We had excess under here. All
 

2651
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,109
low. We had excess under here. All
right. If they're going to take that,

2652
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:29,119
right. If they're going to take that,
 

2653
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,470
right. If they're going to take that,
then they're going to really want it.

2654
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:30,480
then they're going to really want it.
 

2655
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,829
then they're going to really want it.
Means they're going to want this move.

00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,870
All I know is that it's it is possible.
I wouldn't rule it out, right? I

00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:50,880
I wouldn't rule it out, right? I
 

2675

2707
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,630
I don't think it needs to. Um
I don't think it needs to based on what

2708
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:34,640
I don't think it needs to based on what
 

2709
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:43,430
I don't think it needs to based on what
we've done, but

2710
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440

 

2711
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,390

say in the newsletter this week? I don't
 

2717
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,230
say in the newsletter this week? I don't
know if we even got high enough to back

2718
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
know if we even got high enough to back
 

2719
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,390
know if we even got high enough to back
test the levels.

2720
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
test the levels.
 

2721
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,589
test the levels.
Um,

2722
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599

 

2723
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:14,309

where is my newsletter?

2724
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:14,319

Bears bearish playbook is relatively

2730
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:27,280
Bears bearish playbook is relatively
 

2731
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,109
Bears bearish playbook is relatively
straightforward. Bears must aggressively

2732
01:01:29,109 --> 01:01:29,119
straightforward. Bears must aggressively
 

2733
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,349
straightforward. Bears must aggressively
defend 25380 to 25475. Where did we open

2734
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
defend 25380 to 25475. Where did we open
 

2735
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,430
defend 25380 to 25475. Where did we open
up this morning?

2736
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:37,440

 

2737
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,069

There's the defend

2738
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:40,079
There's the defend
 

2739
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,589
There's the defend
of 380. All right. Bears must

2740
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:43,599
of 380. All right. Bears must
 

2741
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,069
of 380. All right. Bears must
aggressively defend 380. Their initial

2742
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:48,079
aggressively defend 380. Their initial
 

2743
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,190
aggressively defend 380. Their initial
objective is to break down to 25145

2744
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
objective is to break down to 25145
 

2745
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,950
objective is to break down to 25145
which will open the door to attack

2746
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:52,960
which will open the door to attack
 

2747
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:58,150
which will open the door to attack
24930. A sustained close below that will

2748
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,160
24930. A sustained close below that will
 

2749
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,910
24930. A sustained close below that will
level would firmly shift momentum in

2750
01:01:59,910 --> 01:01:59,920
level would firmly shift momentum in
 

2751
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,750
level would firmly shift momentum in
favor of bears setting up a move towards

shift in the broader market. I'm not
 

2771
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,069
shift in the broader market. I'm not
expecting that, but

2772
01:02:24,069 --> 01:02:24,079
expecting that, but
 

2773
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:27,030
expecting that, but
what was the target?

2774
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,040
what was the target?
 

2775
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,710

2787
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,030
Saturday morning. We're about to hit 45.
So,

2788
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:45,040
So,
 

2789
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,470
So,
I don't know what to say, folks.

2790
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:48,480
I don't know what to say, folks.
 

2791
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,069
I don't know what to say, folks.
Even if you don't do the course, you

01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:50,079
Even if you don't do the course, you
 

2793
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,950
Even if you don't do the course, you
don't turn up here, it's it's staring

2794
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:52,960
don't turn up here, it's it's staring
 

2795
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,430
don't turn up here, it's it's staring
you in the eyes. I spend countless hours

2796
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:55,440
you in the eyes. I spend countless hours
 

2797
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:04,710
you in the eyes. I spend countless hours
doing that for everyone.

2798
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,720

 

2799
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,270

So, job one of the newsletter just got

2800
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:07,280
So, job one of the newsletter just got
 

2801
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,190
So, job one of the newsletter just got
tagged. All right, we've hit 45. We've

2802
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:09,200
tagged. All right, we've hit 45. We've
 

2803
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,270
tagged. All right, we've hit 45. We've
come under it.

2804
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,280
come under it.
 

2805
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,069
come under it.
So, if you're a long trader, if you're

2806
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:14,079
So, if you're a long trader, if you're
 

2807
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,390
So, if you're a long trader, if you're
uber bullish in this market, I'm not

2808
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
uber bullish in this market, I'm not
 

2809
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,910
uber bullish in this market, I'm not
uber bullish in this market, but if you

2810
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:17,920
uber bullish in this market, but if you
 

2811
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,670
uber bullish in this market, but if you
are, what would you want to see? You'd

2812
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:19,680
are, what would you want to see? You'd
 

2813
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,750
are, what would you want to see? You'd
want to see something like this. All

2814
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
want to see something like this. All
 

2815
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,589
want to see something like this. All
right. And you'd need to I would not be

2816
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
right. And you'd need to I would not be
 

2817
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,630
right. And you'd need to I would not be
long until you regain stuff. All right.

2818
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:26,640
long until you regain stuff. All right.
 

2819
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,750
long until you regain stuff. All right.
Are we due a push? Yeah, probably. All

2820
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:29,760
Are we due a push? Yeah, probably. All
 

2821
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,349
Are we due a push? Yeah, probably. All
right. We've built a lot of liquidity

2822
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:31,359
right. We've built a lot of liquidity
 

2823
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,309
right. We've built a lot of liquidity
here. This is a very strong trend. All

2824
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:34,319
here. This is a very strong trend. All
 

2825
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:35,990
here. This is a very strong trend. All
right. Maybe it drifts under here and

2826
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
right. Maybe it drifts under here and
 

2827
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,510
right. Maybe it drifts under here and
then reclaims and then comes up into

2828
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:37,520
then reclaims and then comes up into
 

2829
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,910
then reclaims and then comes up into
here and then fails. This feels like

2830
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:39,920
here and then fails. This feels like
 

2831
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,950
here and then fails. This feels like
Friday, folks. If we look at Friday,

2832
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:42,960
Friday, folks. If we look at Friday,
 

2833
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,390
Friday, folks. If we look at Friday,
it's kind of similar. We just had to

2834
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,400
it's kind of similar. We just had to
 

2835
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,430
it's kind of similar. We just had to
wait to come out of the range. All

2836
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,440
wait to come out of the range. All
 

2837
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,190
wait to come out of the range. All
right. So, once we left the range,

2838
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,200
right. So, once we left the range,
 

2839
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,710
right. So, once we left the range,
right,

2840
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:52,720
right,
 

2841
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,309
right,
it was just melt time, wasn't it? And

2842
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:54,319
it was just melt time, wasn't it? And
 

2843
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:55,990
it was just melt time, wasn't it? And
then we get one of these, which probably

2844
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:56,000
then we get one of these, which probably
 

2845
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,230
then we get one of these, which probably
gets sold into. So, I would be thinking

2846
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:58,240
gets sold into. So, I would be thinking
 

2847
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,950
gets sold into. So, I would be thinking
about the same sort of scenario here.

2848
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:00,960
about the same sort of scenario here.
 

2849
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,870
about the same sort of scenario here.
I'd be very, very bearish overall. For

2850
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:02,880
I'd be very, very bearish overall. For
 

2851
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,309
I'd be very, very bearish overall. For
me personally, I wouldn't be taking

2852
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:04,319
me personally, I wouldn't be taking
 

2853
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,710
me personally, I wouldn't be taking
longs because we're outside of range.

2854
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
longs because we're outside of range.
 

2855
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,710
longs because we're outside of range.
But if you are adamant on taking the

2856
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:08,720
But if you are adamant on taking the
 

2857
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,230
But if you are adamant on taking the
longs today, I'd be looking for a failed

2858
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,240
longs today, I'd be looking for a failed
 

2859
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,829
longs today, I'd be looking for a failed
breakdown. Ideally, at this point, it

2860
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:11,839
breakdown. Ideally, at this point, it
 

2861
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:14,630
breakdown. Ideally, at this point, it
takes previous day low, right? Ideally,

2862
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:14,640
takes previous day low, right? Ideally,
 

2863
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,430
takes previous day low, right? Ideally,
you do something like this. And where

2864
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
you do something like this. And where
 

2865
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,309
you do something like this. And where
would I be long? I'd want really to

2866
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:20,319
would I be long? I'd want really to
 

2867
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,109
would I be long? I'd want really to
reclaim current day. Um, but you can see

2868
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:23,119
reclaim current day. Um, but you can see
 

2869
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:25,029
reclaim current day. Um, but you can see
all the covering into value is starting

2870
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,039
all the covering into value is starting
 

2871
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,990
all the covering into value is starting
to happen. So, you should be out so much

2872
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,000
to happen. So, you should be out so much
 

2873
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,430
to happen. So, you should be out so much
of your position now. Anything beyond

2874
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
of your position now. Anything beyond
 

2875
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,510
of your position now. Anything beyond
this is a absolute gift. Like I always

2876
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:31,520
this is a absolute gift. Like I always
 

2877
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,309
this is a absolute gift. Like I always
talk about, it's a gift.

2878
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:36,319

 

2879
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:40,150

I cannot cannot cannot believe they've

2880
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:40,160
I cannot cannot cannot believe they've
 

2881
01:04:40,160 --> 01:06:01,910
I cannot cannot cannot believe they've
done this to me on this day.

2882
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:01,920

 

2883
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,829

No, it won't. It won't. I can't even get

2884
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:03,839
No, it won't. It won't. I can't even get
 

2885
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,750
No, it won't. It won't. I can't even get
into my trailer v, guys. It's on It's on

2888
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:08,319
a loop.
 

2889
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,870
a loop.
Oh, I might be in.

2890
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:12,880

 

2891
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:25,910

Have they just let me in?

2892
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:25,920

 

2893
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,950

You up there are playing [\h__\h] games

2898
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:37,599

 

2899
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,549

You're being cruel.

2900
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:40,559
You're being cruel.
 

2901
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,029
You're being cruel.

They just let me in after we attacked

2904
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:48,319
They just let me in after we attacked
 

2905
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,270
They just let me in after we attacked
previous day. If that's a sign to never

2906
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:51,280
previous day. If that's a sign to never
 

2907

are taking a piss up there, whichever

2912
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:57,119
are taking a piss up there, whichever
 

2913
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,510
are taking a piss up there, whichever
one of you it is.

2914
01:06:59,510 --> 01:06:59,520
one of you it is.
 

2915
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,430
one of you it is.
Oh,

2916
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,440
Oh,
 

2917
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,589
Oh,
you've just got to laugh, man. Like,

2918
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:05,599
you've just got to laugh, man. Like,
 

2919
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,829
you've just got to laugh, man. Like,
you've got to laugh at life in the face

2920
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:07,839
you've got to laugh at life in the face
 

2921
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,470
you've got to laugh at life in the face
sometimes. It's just

2922
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:10,480
sometimes. It's just
 

2923
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,950
sometimes. It's just
[\h__\h] seriously

2924
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:14,960

 

2925
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,230

It's all you can do, right?

2926
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
It's all you can do, right?
 

2927
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,589
It's all you can do, right?
Always look on the bright side of life.

2928
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:21,599
Always look on the bright side of life.
 

2929
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,230
Always look on the bright side of life.
All right, targets are hit there. Right,

2930
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:24,240
All right, targets are hit there. Right,
 

2931
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,430
All right, targets are hit there. Right,
that's your previous day low. You've

2932
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:25,440
that's your previous day low. You've
 

2933
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,950
that's your previous day low. You've
just Well, it's trying to shift point of

2934
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:26,960
just Well, it's trying to shift point of
 

2935
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,390
just Well, it's trying to shift point of
control down here. So, we're going to

2936
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
control down here. So, we're going to
 

2937
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,829
control down here. So, we're going to
build out a lot of volume down here.

2938
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:29,839
build out a lot of volume down here.
 

2939
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:33,670
build out a lot of volume down here.
Now, I would be out of 90% of my shorts

2940
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:33,680
Now, I would be out of 90% of my shorts
 

2941
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,990
Now, I would be out of 90% of my shorts
now. Okay, because if we're going to go

2942
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,000
now. Okay, because if we're going to go
 

2943
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,510
now. Okay, because if we're going to go
if we're going to go rotation, we're

2944
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:37,520
if we're going to go rotation, we're
 

2945
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,270
if we're going to go rotation, we're
going to do it from here or hereabouts.

2946
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:39,280
going to do it from here or hereabouts.
 

2947
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,109
going to do it from here or hereabouts.
All right, so let's have a look. There

2948
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:41,119
All right, so let's have a look. There
 

2949
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,349
All right, so let's have a look. There
was an excess on that low short side. So

2950
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
was an excess on that low short side. So
 

2951
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,349
was an excess on that low short side. So
that's the one thing I don't like. We

2952
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
that's the one thing I don't like. We
 

2953
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,430
that's the one thing I don't like. We
have flipped uh to a bullish bias. Oh,

2954
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
have flipped uh to a bullish bias. Oh,
 

2955
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,430
have flipped uh to a bullish bias. Oh,
there was on Ninja Trader. Okay, we have

2956
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
there was on Ninja Trader. Okay, we have
 

2957
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,990
there was on Ninja Trader. Okay, we have
167 caught at the bottom there. So maybe

2958
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,000
167 caught at the bottom there. So maybe
 

2959
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,069
167 caught at the bottom there. So maybe
m may maybe the rotation might start. I

2960
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:54,079
m may maybe the rotation might start. I
 

2961
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,789
m may maybe the rotation might start. I
don't love the excess here. I would like

2962
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:56,799
don't love the excess here. I would like
 

2963
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,349
don't love the excess here. I would like
to see like a little bit more down into

2964
01:07:59,349 --> 01:07:59,359
to see like a little bit more down into
 

2965
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,510
to see like a little bit more down into
this a little bit more sellside delta.

2966
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:01,520
this a little bit more sellside delta.
 

2967
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,710
this a little bit more sellside delta.
But if we look at bookmap, there was 167

2968
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:04,720
But if we look at bookmap, there was 167
 

2969
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,710
But if we look at bookmap, there was 167
lot at that low court. We're starting to

2970
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:06,720
lot at that low court. We're starting to
 

2971
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,470
lot at that low court. We're starting to
reclaim value already. Remember I talked

2972
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:08,480
reclaim value already. Remember I talked
 

2973
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,829
reclaim value already. Remember I talked
about this earlier. Look how we've just

2974
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:09,839
about this earlier. Look how we've just
 

2975
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:11,589
about this earlier. Look how we've just
shifted value lower. So, if we're going

2976
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:11,599
shifted value lower. So, if we're going
 

2977
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:16,309
shifted value lower. So, if we're going
to go into a uh a range rotational day,

2978
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:16,319
to go into a uh a range rotational day,
 

2979
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,229
to go into a uh a range rotational day,
it will happen around here. All right.

2980
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
it will happen around here. All right.
 

2981
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:19,510
it will happen around here. All right.
So, if they're going to sell it, they're

2982
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:19,520
So, if they're going to sell it, they're
 

2983
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,870
So, if they're going to sell it, they're
going to need to do this. If they do

2984
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:20,880
going to need to do this. If they do
 

2985
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,070
going to need to do this. If they do
something like this or something like

2986
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,080
something like this or something like
 

2987
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,030
something like this or something like
they're doing, they're starting to

2988
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
they're doing, they're starting to
 

2989
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,669
they're doing, they're starting to
rebuild here, then I would expect into

2990
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:25,679
rebuild here, then I would expect into
 

2991
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,269
rebuild here, then I would expect into
previous day point control. By the time

2992
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
previous day point control. By the time
 

2993
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,709
previous day point control. By the time
we get there, it probably be VWOP. That

2994
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:28,719
we get there, it probably be VWOP. That
 

2995
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,470
we get there, it probably be VWOP. That
would be the rotation. I wouldn't be

2996
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:30,480
would be the rotation. I wouldn't be
 

2997
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,550
would be the rotation. I wouldn't be
long. I want to make this clear. If

2998
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:32,560
long. I want to make this clear. If
 

2999
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,990
long. I want to make this clear. If
you've joined me enough times, I hate

3000
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
you've joined me enough times, I hate
 

3001
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,749
you've joined me enough times, I hate
playing rotations. I don't like playing

3002
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:35,759
playing rotations. I don't like playing
 

3003
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,829
playing rotations. I don't like playing
reversals. We're outside of range. But

3004
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
reversals. We're outside of range. But
 

3005
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,229
reversals. We're outside of range. But
if they are going to do it today, they

3006
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:40,239
if they are going to do it today, they
 

3007
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,470
if they are going to do it today, they
will need a failed breakdown, a reclaim

3008
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
will need a failed breakdown, a reclaim
 

3009
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,789
will need a failed breakdown, a reclaim
of value, and a trade back inside. It's

3010
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:44,799
of value, and a trade back inside. It's
 

3011
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,430
of value, and a trade back inside. It's
probably due in the next 20 minutes. If

3012
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:47,440
probably due in the next 20 minutes. If
 

3013
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,630
probably due in the next 20 minutes. If
they're going to do it, if they stay

3014
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
they're going to do it, if they stay
 

3015
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,110
they're going to do it, if they stay
heavy outside of previous day low, then

3016
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,120
heavy outside of previous day low, then
 

3017
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,189
heavy outside of previous day low, then
this has been my target for months down

3018
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:53,199
this has been my target for months down
 

3019
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,269
this has been my target for months down
here. If you're asking why, it's an old

3020
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:55,279
here. If you're asking why, it's an old
 

3021
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,030
here. If you're asking why, it's an old
naked point of control. It's been left

3022
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,040
naked point of control. It's been left
 

3023
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,349
naked point of control. It's been left
there now for Oh, let's have a look

3024
01:08:59,349 --> 01:08:59,359
there now for Oh, let's have a look
 

3025
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,749
there now for Oh, let's have a look
together. Right. It's been left there

3026
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:01,759
together. Right. It's been left there
 

3027
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,349
together. Right. It's been left there
since

3028
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:03,359
since
 

3029
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,229
since
the 24th of November. All right. So,

3030
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
the 24th of November. All right. So,
 

3031
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:08,870
the 24th of November. All right. So,
this is where we last found balance,

3032
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
this is where we last found balance,
 

3033
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,030
this is where we last found balance,
right? This is a failed break above into

3034
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,040
right? This is a failed break above into
 

3035
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,189
right? This is a failed break above into
a twoe balance range where we're leaving

3036
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:15,199
a twoe balance range where we're leaving
 

3037
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,030
a twoe balance range where we're leaving
this balance. We didn't even have the

3038
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,040
this balance. We didn't even have the
 

3039
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,110
this balance. We didn't even have the
power to back test it today and we're

3040
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:19,120
power to back test it today and we're
 

3041
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,789
power to back test it today and we're
starting to get weak. This would be my

3042
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:20,799
starting to get weak. This would be my
 

3043
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,269
starting to get weak. This would be my
ultimate cover point. All right. I would

3044
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:23,279
ultimate cover point. All right. I would
 

3045
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,269
ultimate cover point. All right. I would
expect higher time frame bulls if they

3046
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
expect higher time frame bulls if they
 

3047
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,269
expect higher time frame bulls if they
if they have ambush ambitions of saving

3048
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:27,279
if they have ambush ambitions of saving
 

3049
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,070
if they have ambush ambitions of saving
the market market higher time frame. If

3050
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:30,080
the market market higher time frame. If
 

3051
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,910
the market market higher time frame. If
they have ambitions of saving the market

3052
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:31,920
they have ambitions of saving the market
 

3053
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,910
they have ambitions of saving the market
higher time frame, I would imagine they

3054
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:33,920
higher time frame, I would imagine they
 

3055
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,550
higher time frame, I would imagine they
will come in there somewhere in here.

3056
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:36,560
will come in there somewhere in here.
 

3057
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,910
will come in there somewhere in here.
They might not have ambitions to do it,

3058
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:37,920
They might not have ambitions to do it,
 

3059
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,990
They might not have ambitions to do it,
but it would be a strong cover point for

3060
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:40,000
but it would be a strong cover point for
 

3061
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,470
but it would be a strong cover point for

3095
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,709
down. Second five minutes fails to
reclaim what? 85 gamma level. From there

3096
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
reclaim what? 85 gamma level. From there
 

3097
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,870

back into 82. We reject it. We're now at
 

3103
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,470
back into 82. We reject it. We're now at
80s. We lose 80s. I don't think there's

01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,070
80s. We lose 80s. I don't think there's
a whole lot below. This is what I was

3106
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,080
a whole lot below. This is what I was
 

3107
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,950
a whole lot below. This is what I was
saying last week. All the exposure were

3108
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:38,960
saying last week. All the exposure were
 

3109
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,790
saying last week. All the exposure were
cool walls higher. There weren't many

3110
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:40,800
cool walls higher. There weren't many
 

3111
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,030
cool walls higher. There weren't many
put walls. This thing can start going

01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:43,040
put walls. This thing can start going
 

3113
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,070

3153
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,510

24930 is like an order block or supply

3154
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:53,520
24930 is like an order block or supply
 

3155
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,950
24930 is like an order block or supply
zone from a couple weeks ago. Yeah, it's

3156
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:54,960
zone from a couple weeks ago. Yeah, it's
 

3157
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,910
zone from a couple weeks ago. Yeah, it's
just it was the most traded level. All

01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:57,920
just it was the most traded level. All
 

3159
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,910
just it was the most traded level. All
right. It was the most traded level. So,

3160
01:11:59,910 --> 01:11:59,920
right. It was the most traded level. So,
 

3161
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,750
right. It was the most traded level. So,
it's deemed fair value. So, if you look

3162
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:01,760
it's deemed fair value. So, if you look
 

3163
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,990
it's deemed fair value. So, if you look
at uh the week starting Monday the 17th,

3164
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,000
at uh the week starting Monday the 17th,
 

3165
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,830
at uh the week starting Monday the 17th,
it was a value area high. All right,

3166
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
it was a value area high. All right,
 

3167
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,990
it was a value area high. All right,
that's where we had to break out from.

3168
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,000
that's where we had to break out from.
 

3169
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,830
that's where we had to break out from.
We failed to we broke out and we failed.

3170
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:11,840
We failed to we broke out and we failed.
 

3171
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,990
We failed to we broke out and we failed.
We came back under and then we retested

3172
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:14,000
We came back under and then we retested
 

3173
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,950
We came back under and then we retested
it on Monday the 24th and we built out

3174
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:16,960
it on Monday the 24th and we built out
 

3175
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,390
it on Monday the 24th and we built out
so much volume there that it's

3176
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:18,400
so much volume there that it's
 

3177
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,149
so much volume there that it's
considered fair value. So, that is this

3178
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:20,159
considered fair value. So, that is this
 

3179
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,990
considered fair value. So, that is this

3315
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,910

always does about a one 1,000 day bull
 

3317
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,910
always does about a one 1,000 day bull
run. We finished that bull run this

01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:17,920
run. We finished that bull run this
 

3319
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,149

for that when I was saying, you know, I
expect Bitcoin to start going into a

01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,120
expect Bitcoin to start going into a
 

3325
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,310
expect Bitcoin to start going into a
sell to 70s and if it cracks 70s, it can

3326
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
sell to 70s and if it cracks 70s, it can
 

3327
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,430
sell to 70s and if it cracks 70s, it can
do a 70 plus% sell. It normally does

3328
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:29,440
do a 70 plus% sell. It normally does
 

3329
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,070
do a 70 plus% sell. It normally does
that after its bull run, especially if

3330
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
that after its bull run, especially if
 

3331
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,390
that after its bull run, especially if
this market front like follows it. We're

hike after 1989 has contributed. Yeah,
 

3369
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:29,669
hike after 1989 has contributed. Yeah,
exactly. Sometimes up to 35%.

3370
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:29,679

 

3371
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,870

But the the main thing is is how

3372
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:32,880
But the the main thing is is how
 

3373
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,669
But the the main thing is is how
leveraged we are. Um I'll try and show

3374
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:35,679
leveraged we are. Um I'll try and show
 

3375
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,430
leveraged we are. Um I'll try and show
you what I mean. Guys, you know the

3376
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,440
you what I mean. Guys, you know the
 

3377
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,950
you what I mean. Guys, you know the
levels, right? If you're still hopefully

3378
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
levels, right? If you're still hopefully
 

3379
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,149
levels, right? If you're still hopefully
some of you are still managing your

3380
01:16:40,149 --> 01:16:40,159
some of you are still managing your
 

3381
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,149
some of you are still managing your
short, watch this volume built out here.

3382
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:42,159
short, watch this volume built out here.
 

3383
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:44,709
short, watch this volume built out here.
If you're short, you do not want it to

3384
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:44,719
If you're short, you do not want it to
 

3385
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:46,790
If you're short, you do not want it to
trade back above this. This low volume

3386
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:46,800
trade back above this. This low volume
 

3387
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,189
trade back above this. This low volume
node must act as resistance. If you

3388
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:49,199
node must act as resistance. If you
 

3389
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,430
node must act as resistance. If you
reclaim this, you must be out of your

3390
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440
reclaim this, you must be out of your
 

3391
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,070
reclaim this, you must be out of your
shorts. All right? If you if you poke in

3392
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,080
shorts. All right? If you if you poke in
 

3393
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,470
shorts. All right? If you if you poke in
and and they sell against it, fine. The

3394
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:56,480
and and they sell against it, fine. The
 

3395
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,590
and and they sell against it, fine. The
level I'm going to put this on your

3396
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,600
level I'm going to put this on your
 

3397
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,030
level I'm going to put this on your
chart so that we can see the exact

3398
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
chart so that we can see the exact
 

3399
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,189
chart so that we can see the exact
level. The level I'd be aiming for is

3400
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:01,199
level. The level I'd be aiming for is
 

3401
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,229
level. The level I'd be aiming for is
right here. This line here. All right.

3402
01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:04,239
right here. This line here. All right.
 

3403
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:05,669
right here. This line here. All right.
Runners are into that. That is the

3404
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679
Runners are into that. That is the
 

3405
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,590
Runners are into that. That is the
dreamboat level. I would expect

3406
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:09,600
dreamboat level. I would expect
 

3407
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,470
dreamboat level. I would expect
if higher time frame bulls are going to

3408
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
if higher time frame bulls are going to
 

3409
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,310
if higher time frame bulls are going to
come back in this market, this is a

3410
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,320
come back in this market, this is a
 

3411
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,550
come back in this market, this is a
level where I would expect this market

3412
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
level where I would expect this market
 

3413
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,149
level where I would expect this market
to try and make a higher low. All right,

3414
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
to try and make a higher low. All right,
 

3415
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:20,070
to try and make a higher low. All right,
if we think about this just for a second

3416
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
if we think about this just for a second
 

3417
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,790
if we think about this just for a second
so you can understand this,

3418
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:22,800
so you can understand this,
 

3419
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,669
so you can understand this,
this was a low volume drive.

3420
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:27,679
this was a low volume drive.
 

3421
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,709
this was a low volume drive.
All right, through the holiday season.

3422
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
All right, through the holiday season.
 

3423
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,950
All right, through the holiday season.
Look, we're almost lining up to 50%. All

3424
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:32,960
Look, we're almost lining up to 50%. All
 

3425
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,430
Look, we're almost lining up to 50%. All
right, it's looking pretty good, right?

3426
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,440
right, it's looking pretty good, right?
 

3427
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,229
right, it's looking pretty good, right?
If I was going to be a bull my first

3428
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:38,239
If I was going to be a bull my first
 

3429
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:40,310
If I was going to be a bull my first
attempt on a on a higher time frame, I'm

3430
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
attempt on a on a higher time frame, I'm
 

3431
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,630
attempt on a on a higher time frame, I'm
talking about institutional money. This

3432
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:42,640
talking about institutional money. This
 

3433
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,750
talking about institutional money. This
is a level I'd buy off then here. If we

3434
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:45,760
is a level I'd buy off then here. If we
 

3435
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,030
is a level I'd buy off then here. If we
failed this, I'd be I'd be out. I'm

3436
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:49,040
failed this, I'd be I'd be out. I'm
 

3437
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,470
failed this, I'd be I'd be out. I'm
talking about if I was an institutional

3438
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,480
talking about if I was an institutional
 

3439
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,709
talking about if I was an institutional
buyer, I'd be looking for a trade into

3440
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:52,719
buyer, I'd be looking for a trade into
 

3441
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:55,350
buyer, I'd be looking for a trade into
here and a return back up there or a

3442
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:55,360
here and a return back up there or a
 

3443
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,790
here and a return back up there or a
trade into here and a return back up

3444
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:56,800
trade into here and a return back up
 

3445
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,070
trade into here and a return back up
there. So, this is why I would be

3446
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:58,080
there. So, this is why I would be
 

3447
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,550
there. So, this is why I would be
covering my shorts into this position

3448
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:00,560
covering my shorts into this position
 

3449
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,790
covering my shorts into this position
and potentially higher time frame bulls

3450
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800
and potentially higher time frame bulls
 

3451
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,870
and potentially higher time frame bulls
will want to step in there. potentially.

3452
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:04,880
will want to step in there. potentially.
 

3453
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,110
will want to step in there. potentially.
It doesn't. Remember, we have to wait to

3454
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,120
It doesn't. Remember, we have to wait to
 

3455
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,709
It doesn't. Remember, we have to wait to
see if they step in. How are we going to

3456
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
see if they step in. How are we going to
 

3457
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:09,830
see if they step in. How are we going to
wait to see that? We're going to have to

3458
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:09,840
wait to see that? We're going to have to
 

3459
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,390
wait to see that? We're going to have to
see some form of trap level. Okay, look

3460
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
see some form of trap level. Okay, look
 

3461
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,709
see some form of trap level. Okay, look
at this. So, this is the revisit into

3462
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:14,719
at this. So, this is the revisit into
 

3463
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,550
at this. So, this is the revisit into
here. If they reclaim this, I'd be fully

3464
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:16,560
here. If they reclaim this, I'd be fully
 

3465
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,189
here. If they reclaim this, I'd be fully
out. All right. If they reclaim this, I

3466
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:19,199
out. All right. If they reclaim this, I
 

3467
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,870
out. All right. If they reclaim this, I
would be fully out if I was you. If they

3468
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
would be fully out if I was you. If they
 

3469
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,270
would be fully out if I was you. If they
start reclaiming value area low, if they

3470
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,280
start reclaiming value area low, if they
 

3471
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,830
start reclaiming value area low, if they
start basing above 90 or 88, that's

3472
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:25,840
start basing above 90 or 88, that's
 

3473
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,830
start basing above 90 or 88, that's
where they came flying in there. We do

3474
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:27,840
where they came flying in there. We do
 

3475
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,350
where they came flying in there. We do
have a good auction here where we've

3476
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:29,360
have a good auction here where we've
 

3477
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,510
have a good auction here where we've
left lots of shorts trapped in these

3478
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:31,520
left lots of shorts trapped in these
 

3479
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,510
left lots of shorts trapped in these
lows now. So this is looking much much

3480
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:33,520
lows now. So this is looking much much
 

3481
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,030
lows now. So this is looking much much
better for a potential relief rally. So

3482
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:37,040
better for a potential relief rally. So
 

3483
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,070
better for a potential relief rally. So
I would say if they dip and hold 85s,

3484
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,080
I would say if they dip and hold 85s,
 

3485
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,750
I would say if they dip and hold 85s,
bulls will take control of this. I

3486
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:41,760
bulls will take control of this. I
 

3487
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,350
bulls will take control of this. I
wouldn't be long in this personally. I

3488
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:43,360
wouldn't be long in this personally. I
 

3489
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,350
wouldn't be long in this personally. I
cannot make that clear enough. But for

3490
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:45,360
cannot make that clear enough. But for
 

3491
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,430
cannot make that clear enough. But for
those of you who like playing reversals,

3492
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
those of you who like playing reversals,
 

3493
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,870
those of you who like playing reversals,
that would be your first thing to see.

3494
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:48,880
that would be your first thing to see.
 

3495
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,669
that would be your first thing to see.
You'd want a dip and hold of 90 and 85

3496
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
You'd want a dip and hold of 90 and 85
 

3497
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,189
You'd want a dip and hold of 90 and 85
and then you'd want a reclaim of value

3498
01:18:53,189 --> 01:18:53,199
and then you'd want a reclaim of value
 

3499
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,510
and then you'd want a reclaim of value
area low on the day and previous days

3500
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:55,520
area low on the day and previous days
 

3501
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,510
area low on the day and previous days
value area low. And if you get that, you

3502
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:57,520
value area low. And if you get that, you
 

3503
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,990
value area low. And if you get that, you
might well see some squeeze relief. So

3504
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,000
might well see some squeeze relief. So
 

3505
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,590
might well see some squeeze relief. So
here they're going back up towards value

3506
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,600
here they're going back up towards value
 

3507
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,830
here they're going back up towards value
area low from yesterday from today sorry

3508
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:03,840
area low from yesterday from today sorry
 

3509
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,110
area low from yesterday from today sorry
and this is yesterday and if they

3510
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,120
and this is yesterday and if they
 

3511
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,669
and this is yesterday and if they
reclaim this we have washed remember

3512
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
reclaim this we have washed remember
 

3513
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,270
reclaim this we have washed remember
this has been a straight trend this has

3514
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:09,280
this has been a straight trend this has
 

3515
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,310
this has been a straight trend this has
been walked down all right they can come

3516
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:12,320
been walked down all right they can come
 

3517
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,390
been walked down all right they can come
back into at least this node and then

3518
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:14,400
back into at least this node and then
 

3519
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,630

3520
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:16,640
possibly up into this low volume node
 

3521
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,310
possibly up into this low volume node
right this is possible this trade here

3522

is possible you should be out shorts now
 

3525
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,229
is possible you should be out shorts now

in my opinion I would be out of shorts
 

3527
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,990
in my opinion I would be out of shorts
now personally that's how I would trade

3528
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
now personally that's how I would trade
 

3529
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,590
now personally that's how I would trade
this you're starting to uh

3530
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:27,600
this you're starting to uh
 

3531
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,830
this you're starting to uh
potentially repair some of this. And

3532
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:29,840
potentially repair some of this. And
 

3533
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,430
potentially repair some of this. And
really, if you got this short, you're

3534
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
really, if you got this short, you're
 

3535
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,270
really, if you got this short, you're
not missing too much more down here. I'd

3536
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:33,280
not missing too much more down here. I'd
 

3537
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,110
not missing too much more down here. I'd
be pretty happy with what I got. All

3538
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:35,120
be pretty happy with what I got. All
 

3539
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,350
be pretty happy with what I got. All
right, I guess

3540
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:37,360
right, I guess
 

3541
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,189
right, I guess
if they hold this, I'd be out. That's

3542
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:39,199
if they hold this, I'd be out. That's
 

3543
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,550
if they hold this, I'd be out. That's
what I'd be saying to myself.

3544
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
what I'd be saying to myself.
 

3545
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,910
what I'd be saying to myself.
Hopefully that makes sense. This is

3546
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:43,920
Hopefully that makes sense. This is
 

3547
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,709
Hopefully that makes sense. This is
using volume, order flow, and even flow

3548
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
using volume, order flow, and even flow
 

3549
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,110
using volume, order flow, and even flow
zones. Personally, I wouldn't be long in

3550
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:49,120
zones. Personally, I wouldn't be long in
 

3551

3706
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:08,320
and back test this level towards these
 

3707
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,070
and back test this level towards these
90s that I talked about. They need to

3708
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
90s that I talked about. They need to
 

3709
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,310
90s that I talked about. They need to
hold this if uh these bulls have a

3710
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:12,320
hold this if uh these bulls have a
 

3711
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,310
hold this if uh these bulls have a
chance of repricing.

3712
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320

 

3713

back so much. You'll hear it in some of
 

3717
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,070
back so much. You'll hear it in some of
the early modules. I'm like,

3718
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,080
the early modules. I'm like,
 

3719
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,830
the early modules. I'm like,
so I might redo some of them now. My

3720
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840
so I might redo some of them now. My
 

3721
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,709
so I might redo some of them now. My
voice has come back.

3722

voice has come back.
 

3723
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,950
voice has come back.
Yes. And I will add modules, Richard.

3724
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:30,960
Yes. And I will add modules, Richard.
 

3725
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,070
Yes. And I will add modules, Richard.
Like like today,

3726
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
Like like today,
 

3727
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,990
Like like today,
I would have loved to have recorded this

3728
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:36,000
I would have loved to have recorded this
 

3729
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,390
I would have loved to have recorded this
trade, but uh I'll go back and and

3730
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:38,400
trade, but uh I'll go back and and
 

3731
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,470
trade, but uh I'll go back and and
record the record why this trade worked

3732
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:40,480
record the record why this trade worked
 

3733
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,910
record the record why this trade worked
and put it in and then I'll just quote

3734
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
and put it in and then I'll just quote
 

3735
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,189
and put it in and then I'll just quote
because you can see that I would have

3736
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:43,199
because you can see that I would have
 

3737
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,189
because you can see that I would have
traded this live if I had access to my

3738
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:45,199
traded this live if I had access to my
 

3739
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,270
traded this live if I had access to my
Ninja Trader this morning. Okay, so it's

3740
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280
Ninja Trader this morning. Okay, so it's
 

3741
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,990
Ninja Trader this morning. Okay, so it's
a good hold of 90s kind of area so far.

3742
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:50,000
a good hold of 90s kind of area so far.
 

3743
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,629
a good hold of 90s kind of area so far.
So there's going to be a battle here.

3744
01:23:52,629 --> 01:23:52,639
So there's going to be a battle here.
 

3745
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,550
So there's going to be a battle here.
SPY didn't quite take previous day low

3746
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:54,560
SPY didn't quite take previous day low
 

3747
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:59,030
SPY didn't quite take previous day low
yet. We did take it on NQ. The rotation

3748
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,040
yet. We did take it on NQ. The rotation
 

3749
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,310
yet. We did take it on NQ. The rotation
now is starting to take place. They've

3750
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:00,320
now is starting to take place. They've
 

3751
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,470
now is starting to take place. They've
repriced this lower this low volume

3752
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:02,480
repriced this lower this low volume
 

3753
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,550
repriced this lower this low volume
node. This is the area bulls will want

3754
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:04,560
node. This is the area bulls will want
 

3755
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,550
node. This is the area bulls will want
to defend to leave this seller trapped.

3756
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
to defend to leave this seller trapped.
 

3757
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,229
to defend to leave this seller trapped.
Right? So if bulls successfully do that,

3758
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
Right? So if bulls successfully do that,
 

3759
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,149
Right? So if bulls successfully do that,
they need to get back above previous

3760
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159
they need to get back above previous
 

3761
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:12,070
they need to get back above previous
day's value area low for squeeze relief.

3762
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:12,080
day's value area low for squeeze relief.
 

3763
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,750
day's value area low for squeeze relief.
That could be a twole that they might

3764
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:13,760
That could be a twole that they might
 

3765
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,149
That could be a twole that they might
well sell back into. That is just like

3766
01:24:16,149 --> 01:24:16,159
well sell back into. That is just like
 

3767
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,229
well sell back into. That is just like
Friday. If you remember Friday, I talked

3768
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:18,239
Friday. If you remember Friday, I talked
 

3769
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,229
Friday. If you remember Friday, I talked
about how personally I would leave the

3770
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:20,239
about how personally I would leave the
 

3771
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,790
about how personally I would leave the
bullish play alone, right, and wait for

3772
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:22,800
bullish play alone, right, and wait for
 

3773
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,070
bullish play alone, right, and wait for
it to peak out. And in Discord, we took

3774
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:26,080
it to peak out. And in Discord, we took
 

3775
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,510
it to peak out. And in Discord, we took
that move. So that's a really good hold

3776
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
that move. So that's a really good hold
 

3777
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,110
that move. So that's a really good hold
of this volume node we just talked

3778
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,120
of this volume node we just talked
 

3779
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,550
of this volume node we just talked
about. So those of you who are desperate

3780
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560
about. So those of you who are desperate
 

3781
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,470
about. So those of you who are desperate
to play the bullish side, this is the

3782
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:32,480
to play the bullish side, this is the
 

3783
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,629
to play the bullish side, this is the
level, right? So this is the level bulls

3784
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:34,639
level, right? So this is the level bulls
 

3785
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,149
level, right? So this is the level bulls
are trying to defend right now. This

3786
01:24:36,149 --> 01:24:36,159
are trying to defend right now. This
 

3787
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,990
are trying to defend right now. This
level right here.

3788
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:40,000

 

3789
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,350

Again, this is all playing out in

3790
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
Again, this is all playing out in
 

3791
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,910
Again, this is all playing out in
retime. Bulls must defend this level.

3792
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:43,920
retime. Bulls must defend this level.
 

3793
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,550
retime. Bulls must defend this level.
And I would say really they need to

3794
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:46,560
And I would say really they need to
 

3795
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,110
And I would say really they need to
reclaim this guy, right? Because if they

3796
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:49,120
reclaim this guy, right? Because if they
 

3797
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,870
reclaim this guy, right? Because if they
do that, that will be a look below and

3798
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:50,880
do that, that will be a look below and
 

3799
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,350
do that, that will be a look below and
fail and we can trade up. That will be

3800
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,360
fail and we can trade up. That will be
 

3801
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,790
fail and we can trade up. That will be
exactly the same as this morning. That's

3802
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:54,800
exactly the same as this morning. That's
 

3803
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,470
exactly the same as this morning. That's
a look above and fail. That's a look

3804
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:56,480
a look above and fail. That's a look
 

3805
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,790
a look above and fail. That's a look
below and fail. We can repric into here.

3806
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
below and fail. We can repric into here.
 

3807
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,470
below and fail. We can repric into here.
It's very, very possible that they can

3808
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:00,480
It's very, very possible that they can
 

3809
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,189
It's very, very possible that they can
do that today. I would love them to do

3810
01:25:03,189 --> 01:25:03,199
do that today. I would love them to do
 

3811
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,750
do that today. I would love them to do
that today and leave that area that I

3812
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:05,760
that today and leave that area that I
 

3813
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,430
that today and leave that area that I
want to trade into for another day. It

3814
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:07,440
want to trade into for another day. It
 

3815
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,430
want to trade into for another day. It
would be fantastic

3816
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:09,440
would be fantastic
 

3817
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,669
would be fantastic
cuz I think I'm probably a bit too

3818
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:11,679
cuz I think I'm probably a bit too
 

3819
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,910
cuz I think I'm probably a bit too
emotional and tilty to trade now at this

3820
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:13,920
emotional and tilty to trade now at this
 

3821
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,590
emotional and tilty to trade now at this
point having missed what if I missed

3822
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:15,600
point having missed what if I missed
 

3823
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,229
point having missed what if I missed
like two 300 points out of this.

3824
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:20,239
like two 300 points out of this.
 

3825
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:21,669
like two 300 points out of this.
Optimal entry would have been around

3826
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
Optimal entry would have been around
 

3827
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:26,470
Optimal entry would have been around
here. Let's be realistic.

3828
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:26,480

Yeah, I've missed 300 points. Yeah, I

probably can't trade today out of
 

3833
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:37,590
probably can't trade today out of
discipline.

3834
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600

3859
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,590
walks out and it looks like he's walking
after her and he just slams the door and

01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:11,600
after her and he just slams the door and
 

3861
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,390

3865
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:24,870
that's the trader right there. You're
distracting me. It'll [\h__\h] away.

3866
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:24,880

 

3867
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,189

Just one day should show my dom. The

3868
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:27,199
Just one day should show my dom. The
 

3869
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:48,070
Just one day should show my dom. The
dom's up here. The dom's up here.

3870
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:48,080

 

3871
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,430

I don't know whether to shut it down,

3872
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:49,440
I don't know whether to shut it down,
 

3873
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:59,830
I don't know whether to shut it down,
honestly.

3874
01:26:59,830 --> 01:26:59,840

 

3875
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,110

Don't think we're done with short. It's

3876
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:01,120
Don't think we're done with short. It's
 

3877
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,550
Don't think we're done with short. It's
very possible we're not. Like I said,

3878
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:02,560
very possible we're not. Like I said,
 

3879
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,629
very possible we're not. Like I said,
this is the magnet

3880
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:04,639
this is the magnet
 

3881
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,709
this is the magnet
for me. Like I said, bulls would need to

3882
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:06,719
for me. Like I said, bulls would need to
 

3883
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,149
for me. Like I said, bulls would need to
defend this and they would need to

3884
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159
defend this and they would need to
 

3885
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:11,030
defend this and they would need to
reclaim this. I don't I don't play

3886
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,040
reclaim this. I don't I don't play
 

3887
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,390
reclaim this. I don't I don't play
these. These are counter trends against

3888
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
these. These are counter trends against
 

3889
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,629
these. These are counter trends against
like the higher time frame. I'm like

3890
01:27:16,629 --> 01:27:16,639
like the higher time frame. I'm like
 

3891
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:19,350
like the higher time frame. I'm like
just like Friday. Friday.

3892
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:19,360
just like Friday. Friday.
 

3893
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,550
just like Friday. Friday.
All right. I didn't play

3894
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:22,560
All right. I didn't play
 

3895
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,470
All right. I didn't play
this trade here. I ignored all this, but

3896
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:26,480
this trade here. I ignored all this, but
 

3897
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,350
this trade here. I ignored all this, but
I did play this, right? We did play that

3898
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:29,360
I did play this, right? We did play that
 

3899
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,229
I did play this, right? We did play that
breakdown on Friday.

3900
01:27:32,229 --> 01:27:32,239
breakdown on Friday.
 

3901
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,550
breakdown on Friday.
Oh, don't do that. There we go. I need

3902
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
Oh, don't do that. There we go. I need
 

3903
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:40,790
Oh, don't do that. There we go. I need
that a little bit.

3904
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:40,800

 

3905
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,709

You can see like the bulls are trying to

3906
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:42,719
You can see like the bulls are trying to
 

3907
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:45,430
You can see like the bulls are trying to
defend this volume area. We do have

3908
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:45,440
defend this volume area. We do have
 

3909
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,110
defend this volume area. We do have
sellers track. If you look at bookmap

3910
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,120
sellers track. If you look at bookmap
 

3911
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,709
sellers track. If you look at bookmap
right now, you see this guy down here,

3912
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:48,719
right now, you see this guy down here,
 

3913
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,830
right now, you see this guy down here,
281 lot like trapped at the bottom. That

3914
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:51,840
281 lot like trapped at the bottom. That
 

3915
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,830
281 lot like trapped at the bottom. That
is the sign that an auction might have

3916
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:53,840
is the sign that an auction might have
 

3917
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,709
is the sign that an auction might have
possibly finished. Okay, so it not

3918
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:56,719
possibly finished. Okay, so it not
 

3919
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,229
possibly finished. Okay, so it not
guaranteed,

3920
01:27:58,229 --> 01:27:58,239
guaranteed,
 

3921
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:01,110
guaranteed,
but if I get you on to bookmat,

3922
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:01,120
but if I get you on to bookmat,
 

3923
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,709
but if I get you on to bookmat,
right, auctions finished when the last

3924
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:02,719
right, auctions finished when the last
 

3925
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,229
right, auctions finished when the last
seller has sold. Well, there's a big

3926
01:28:04,229 --> 01:28:04,239
seller has sold. Well, there's a big
 

3927
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,629
seller has sold. Well, there's a big
seller down here has sold so far. So,

3928
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
seller down here has sold so far. So,
 

3929
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,790
seller down here has sold so far. So,
you can see if we just analyze this

3930
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:08,800
you can see if we just analyze this
 

3931
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,830
you can see if we just analyze this
right now,

3932
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:11,840
right now,
 

3933
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,390
right now,
right, late shorts are caught here. We

3934
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:14,400
right, late shorts are caught here. We
 

3935
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,910
right, late shorts are caught here. We
are holding price above that. All the

3936
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:15,920
are holding price above that. All the
 

3937
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,350
are holding price above that. All the
time we hold price above that, there's

3938
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,360
time we hold price above that, there's
 

3939
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,149
time we hold price above that, there's
potential relief. And where can we get

3940
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:20,159
potential relief. And where can we get
 

3941
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,750
potential relief. And where can we get
relief to? I'm trying to look where the

3942
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:21,760
relief to? I'm trying to look where the
 

3943
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,750
relief to? I'm trying to look where the
big big guys came in. So I'd be looking

3944
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:23,760
big big guys came in. So I'd be looking
 

3945
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,229
big big guys came in. So I'd be looking
for relief to sort of 75 to 200 and

3946
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:26,239
for relief to sort of 75 to 200 and
 

3947
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:30,470
for relief to sort of 75 to 200 and
above. Hopefully that makes sense.

3948
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
above. Hopefully that makes sense.
 

3949
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,149
above. Hopefully that makes sense.
It's a big if button maybe if you're

3950
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:32,159
It's a big if button maybe if you're
 

3951
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:33,270
It's a big if button maybe if you're
going to take this. But that's that's

3952
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,280
going to take this. But that's that's
 

3953
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,510
going to take this. But that's that's
what they're looking to do. Uh if they

3954
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:35,520
what they're looking to do. Uh if they
 

3955
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,510
what they're looking to do. Uh if they
get back inside previous day's value,

get back inside previous day's value,
 

3957
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,189
get back inside previous day's value,
that will be the key trigger. Can they

3958
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:39,199
that will be the key trigger. Can they
 

3959
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:46,470
that will be the key trigger. Can they
get back inside previous days value?

3960
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:46,480

3984
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:12,639
and normally what you'll find is if
 

3985
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,149
and normally what you'll find is if
they're

3986
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:14,159
they're
 

3987
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:18,149
they're
on a subscription ba subscription basis

3988
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
on a subscription ba subscription basis
 

3989
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,470
on a subscription ba subscription basis
or even if they're free, you get lots of

3990
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
or even if they're free, you get lots of
 

3991
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,990
or even if they're free, you get lots of
traders arguing because they're seeing

3992
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:22,000
traders arguing because they're seeing
 

3993
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,110
traders arguing because they're seeing
different things, trading different

3994
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:23,120
different things, trading different
 

3995
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,590
different things, trading different
ways. What I've tried to do is create a

3996
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:25,600
ways. What I've tried to do is create a
 

3997
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,830
ways. What I've tried to do is create a
small community of people who are

3998
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
small community of people who are
 

3999
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,590
small community of people who are
trading the same way, looking for the

4000
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:29,600
trading the same way, looking for the
 

4001
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,430
trading the same way, looking for the
same thing, because I think from a

4002
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:31,440
same thing, because I think from a
 

4003
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,510
same thing, because I think from a
longevity point of view, that will

4004
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
longevity point of view, that will
 

4005
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,070
longevity point of view, that will
create a good ethos and good support

4006
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,080
create a good ethos and good support
 

4007
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,510
create a good ethos and good support
system. If you think about if you were

4008
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:37,520
system. If you think about if you were
 

4009
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,990
system. If you think about if you were
actually going to trade at a prop firm,

4010
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:40,000
actually going to trade at a prop firm,
 

4011
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,669
actually going to trade at a prop firm,
you would have a risk manager and you

4012
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:41,679
you would have a risk manager and you
 

4013
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,110
you would have a risk manager and you
would have like a sort of trade desk

4014
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
would have like a sort of trade desk
 

4015
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,709
would have like a sort of trade desk
leader who would sort of get you in and

4016
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:44,719
leader who would sort of get you in and
 

4017
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:46,870
leader who would sort of get you in and
out of trades. Everyone would be trading

4018
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:46,880
out of trades. Everyone would be trading
 

4019
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,629
out of trades. Everyone would be trading
in the same direction unless you had one

4020
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:48,639
in the same direction unless you had one
 

4021
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,470
in the same direction unless you had one
guy hedging against them all. You would

4022
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:50,480
guy hedging against them all. You would
 

4023
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,950
guy hedging against them all. You would
not have them all arguing, I'm taking

4024
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960
not have them all arguing, I'm taking
 

4025
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,550
not have them all arguing, I'm taking
this, I'm doing this, I'm doing this,

4026
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:54,560
this, I'm doing this, I'm doing this,
 

4027
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,750
this, I'm doing this, I'm doing this,
I'm putting you off this trade, blah

4028
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:55,760
I'm putting you off this trade, blah
 

4029
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:56,950
I'm putting you off this trade, blah
blah blah. And that's what I'm trying to

4030
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:56,960
blah blah. And that's what I'm trying to
 

4031
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,510
blah blah. And that's what I'm trying to
avoid. Okay, where would I say big

4032
01:29:59,510 --> 01:29:59,520
avoid. Okay, where would I say big
 

4033
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,470
avoid. Okay, where would I say big
sellers above came in at 150s. So I'd be

4034
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:02,480
sellers above came in at 150s. So I'd be
 

4035
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,830
sellers above came in at 150s. So I'd be
watching that level. or if they start

4036
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
watching that level. or if they start
 

4037
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,310
watching that level. or if they start
reclaiming that then maybe we go back

4038
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:06,320
reclaiming that then maybe we go back
 

4039
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,990
reclaiming that then maybe we go back
into value. So we're going to poke up

4040
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:08,000
into value. So we're going to poke up
 

4041
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,830
into value. So we're going to poke up
into previous day value like I talked

4042
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840
into previous day value like I talked
 

4043
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,229
into previous day value like I talked
about. So this blue box just held like I

4044
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:12,239
about. So this blue box just held like I
 

4045
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,790
about. So this blue box just held like I
said potential rotation to here. They

4046
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,800
said potential rotation to here. They
 

4047
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,550
said potential rotation to here. They
will need to find acceptance in here for

4048
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:16,560
will need to find acceptance in here for
 

4049
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,070
will need to find acceptance in here for
a squeeze. Otherwise this can be a

4050
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:18,080
a squeeze. Otherwise this can be a
 

4051
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,870
a squeeze. Otherwise this can be a
two-leg which is resold into right. So

4052
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:20,880
two-leg which is resold into right. So
 

4053
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,270
two-leg which is resold into right. So
this is counter trend relief and how we

4054
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280
this is counter trend relief and how we
 

4055
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,590
this is counter trend relief and how we
act into and around here becomes key. So

4056
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:25,600
act into and around here becomes key. So
 

4057
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,950
act into and around here becomes key. So
you can see the key levels.

4058
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:28,960
you can see the key levels.
 

4059
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,790
you can see the key levels.
You have to manage how you want to trade

4060
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:30,800
You have to manage how you want to trade
 

4061
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,310
You have to manage how you want to trade
this. Do you want to lean on this short

4062
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:32,320
this. Do you want to lean on this short
 

4063
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,070
this. Do you want to lean on this short
when it's finished peeking out? Or are

4064
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:34,080
when it's finished peeking out? Or are
 

4065
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,910
when it's finished peeking out? Or are
you the trader that's looking for a

4066
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:35,920
you the trader that's looking for a
 

4067
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,149
you the trader that's looking for a
failed breakout

4068
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:38,159
failed breakout
 

4069
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:40,070
failed breakout
outside of value? Are you looking for

4070
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,080
outside of value? Are you looking for
 

4071
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,030
outside of value? Are you looking for
this into here? Or are you looking for

4072
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:43,040
this into here? Or are you looking for
 

4073
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,950
this into here? Or are you looking for
something like this all the way back

4074
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:44,960
something like this all the way back
 

4075
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,070
something like this all the way back
down? That's what you have to think

4076
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
down? That's what you have to think
 

4077
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:53,350
down? That's what you have to think
about. Both of those are possible.

4078
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360

 

4079
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,750

Yeah, I see that. It's It's dirty on the

4080
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:55,760
Yeah, I see that. It's It's dirty on the
 

4081
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,189
Yeah, I see that. It's It's dirty on the
It's annoying, isn't it? Divergence

4082
01:30:57,189 --> 01:30:57,199
It's annoying, isn't it? Divergence
 

4083
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:00,310
It's annoying, isn't it? Divergence
playing out there.

4084
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,320
playing out there.
 

4085
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,390
playing out there.
Oh, thanks. Sucks. I already trade

4086
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:02,400
Oh, thanks. Sucks. I already trade
 

4087
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,990
Oh, thanks. Sucks. I already trade
pretty much the same. Not buying the

4088
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:04,000
pretty much the same. Not buying the
 

4089
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,110
pretty much the same. Not buying the
course. Yeah. So, sorry, Johnny. Sorry.

4090
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:07,120
course. Yeah. So, sorry, Johnny. Sorry.
 

4091
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,310
course. Yeah. So, sorry, Johnny. Sorry.
Like, I get it. I like I totally get it.

4092
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:10,320
Like, I get it. I like I totally get it.
 

4093
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,470
Like, I get it. I like I totally get it.
It I wouldn't spend if I was you, I

4094
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:12,480
It I wouldn't spend if I was you, I
 

4095
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,350
It I wouldn't spend if I was you, I
wouldn't buy the course either. Like,

4096
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:15,360
wouldn't buy the course either. Like,
 

4097
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,750
wouldn't buy the course either. Like,
um, but I will be here every day and

4098
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
um, but I will be here every day and
 

4099
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,430
um, but I will be here every day and
most of those guys are here every day.

4100
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
most of those guys are here every day.
 

4101
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,149
most of those guys are here every day.
So, you know, you get three hours with

4102
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:22,159
So, you know, you get three hours with
 

4103
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:26,709
So, you know, you get three hours with
me and it won't cost you anything.

4104
01:31:26,709 --> 01:31:26,719

 

4105
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:29,590

But I to I I totally

4106
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:29,600
But I to I I totally
 

4107
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,669
But I to I I totally
I totally understand. I would be exactly

4108
01:31:31,669 --> 01:31:31,679
I totally understand. I would be exactly
 

4109
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:33,030
I totally understand. I would be exactly
the same. And I spent when I was

4110
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:33,040
the same. And I spent when I was
 

4111
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,030
the same. And I spent when I was
learning, I spent

4112
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:35,040
learning, I spent
 

4113
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,189
learning, I spent
thousands and thousands and thousands on

4114
01:31:37,189 --> 01:31:37,199
thousands and thousands and thousands on
 

4115
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,550
thousands and thousands and thousands on
garbage courses and garbage uh discords

4116
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
garbage courses and garbage uh discords
 

4117
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,270
garbage courses and garbage uh discords
and stuff like that whereas 150 a day or

4118
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,280
and stuff like that whereas 150 a day or
 

4119
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,990
and stuff like that whereas 150 a day or
a day a month or 300 a month and it was

4120
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:46,000
a day a month or 300 a month and it was
 

4121
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,709
a day a month or 300 a month and it was
just shite. Um so I've tried to do the

4122
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:48,719
just shite. Um so I've tried to do the
 

4123
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,110
just shite. Um so I've tried to do the
opposite of that. So here's the relief.

4124
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:51,120
opposite of that. So here's the relief.
 

4125
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,790
opposite of that. So here's the relief.
Okay. So maybe even if you didn't take

4126
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:52,800
Okay. So maybe even if you didn't take
 

4127
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,790
Okay. So maybe even if you didn't take
this, maybe this is helping you see this

4128
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:54,800
this, maybe this is helping you see this
 

4129
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,430
this, maybe this is helping you see this
in the future. We had excess on this low

4130
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
in the future. We had excess on this low
 

4131
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,430
in the future. We had excess on this low
like we talked about. They protected

4132
01:31:59,430 --> 01:31:59,440
like we talked about. They protected
 

4133
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,430
like we talked about. They protected
this which meant leaving these sellers

4134
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
this which meant leaving these sellers
 

4135
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,830
this which meant leaving these sellers
stuck. We have a strong trend down on

4136
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:03,840
stuck. We have a strong trend down on

review what's happened. Let's just take
 

4349
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,109
review what's happened. Let's just take
this this off to start with. All right,

4350
01:36:47,109 --> 01:36:47,119
this this off to start with. All right,
 

4351
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:51,109
this this off to start with. All right,
let's just review just based on value.

4352
01:36:51,109 --> 01:36:51,119
let's just review just based on value.
 

4353
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:54,709
let's just review just based on value.
All right, this is your pre-market high

4354
01:36:54,709 --> 01:36:54,719
All right, this is your pre-market high
 

4355

All right, this is your pre-market high
in this morning push. What happens?

4356
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:56,719
in this morning push. What happens?
 

4357
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:59,030
in this morning push. What happens?
Right, amateur bulls come flying in. So,

4358
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,040
Right, amateur bulls come flying in. So,
 

4359
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,390
Right, amateur bulls come flying in. So,
you've got people short against this and

4360
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,400
you've got people short against this and
 

4361
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,270
you've got people short against this and
breakout bulls in here, right? But this

4362
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:05,280
breakout bulls in here, right? But this
 

4363
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,910
breakout bulls in here, right? But this
is expensive. This is premium. So they

4364
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:07,920
is expensive. This is premium. So they
 

4365
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,750
is expensive. This is premium. So they
chase the market higher and the shorts

4366
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:09,760
chase the market higher and the shorts
 

4367
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,350
chase the market higher and the shorts
get popped. So what do we have here? We

4368
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,360
get popped. So what do we have here? We
 

4369
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,790
get popped. So what do we have here? We
have market buy orders because if you're

4370
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:14,800
have market buy orders because if you're
 

4371
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,629
have market buy orders because if you're
a breakout buyer, you're a market buy

4372
01:37:16,629 --> 01:37:16,639
a breakout buyer, you're a market buy
 

4373
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:18,550
a breakout buyer, you're a market buy
order. If you're a short seller and you

4374
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:18,560
order. If you're a short seller and you
 

4375
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,310
order. If you're a short seller and you
get stopped out, you're a market buy

4376
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:20,320
get stopped out, you're a market buy
 

4377
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,510
get stopped out, you're a market buy
order. That gets paired off with

4378
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:23,520
order. That gets paired off with
 

4379
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,830
order. That gets paired off with
selling. If we look at Well, we can just

4380
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:25,840
selling. If we look at Well, we can just
 

4381
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,629
selling. If we look at Well, we can just
probably do it in here.

4382
01:37:28,629 --> 01:37:28,639
probably do it in here.
 

4383
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:31,990
probably do it in here.
Move this over. If we look at the

4384
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:32,000
Move this over. If we look at the
 

4385
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:40,629
Move this over. If we look at the
opening drive this morning,

4386
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:40,639

 

4387
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:43,510

we got to go into one minute 5 minute.

4388
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:43,520
we got to go into one minute 5 minute.
 

4389
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,070
we got to go into one minute 5 minute.
Let's have a little look.

4390
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,080

 

4391
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:54,149

Maybe at the right place up here. We go.

4392
01:37:54,149 --> 01:37:54,159

 

4393
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,950

Right, we leave

4394
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:56,960
Right, we leave
 

4395
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,390
Right, we leave
pre-market. There was a buy side

4396
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400
pre-market. There was a buy side
 

4397
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,350
pre-market. There was a buy side
imbalance. We repair that and sellers

4398
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:01,360
imbalance. We repair that and sellers
 

4399
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,350
imbalance. We repair that and sellers
hold the market. Buyers come in big

4400
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
hold the market. Buyers come in big
 

4401
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,750
hold the market. Buyers come in big
here. 84

4402
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:05,760
here. 84
 

4403
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,430
here. 84
to 71. Do we ever let these buyers out?

4404
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:09,440
to 71. Do we ever let these buyers out?
 

4405
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,270
to 71. Do we ever let these buyers out?
No. The next candle doesn't let them

4406
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,280
No. The next candle doesn't let them
 

4407
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,790
No. The next candle doesn't let them
out. That is your failure. You can

4408
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:12,800
out. That is your failure. You can
 

4409
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:13,990
out. That is your failure. You can
probably see it even more in a one

4410
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:14,000
probably see it even more in a one
 

4411
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,990
probably see it even more in a one
minute. It's going to play bull. Here we

4412
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
minute. It's going to play bull. Here we
 

4413
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,709
minute. It's going to play bull. Here we
go. Zoom right in.

4414
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:20,719

 

4415
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,510

All right. So, early participants

4416
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:23,520
All right. So, early participants
 

4417
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,109
All right. So, early participants
get caught. This is actually an unusual

4418
01:38:25,109 --> 01:38:25,119
get caught. This is actually an unusual
 

4419
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,350
get caught. This is actually an unusual
auction at the high to be honest. But

4420
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:27,360
auction at the high to be honest. But
 

4421
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,790
auction at the high to be honest. But
you can see it's these guys that get

4422
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:28,800
you can see it's these guys that get
 

4423
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,510
you can see it's these guys that get
caught 401 to 405 and then this candle

4424
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,520
caught 401 to 405 and then this candle
 

4425
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,790
caught 401 to 405 and then this candle
here 95 to 80s and I was concerned about

4426
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:34,800
here 95 to 80s and I was concerned about
 

4427
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,790
here 95 to 80s and I was concerned about
these sellers being stuck. Right? So

4428
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:36,800
these sellers being stuck. Right? So
 

4429
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,629
these sellers being stuck. Right? So
these became a level which we had to

4430
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
these became a level which we had to
 

4431
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:42,149
these became a level which we had to
watch closely but once they resold this

4432
01:38:42,149 --> 01:38:42,159
watch closely but once they resold this
 

4433
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:44,390
watch closely but once they resold this
you can see here aggressive buyers

4434
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:44,400
you can see here aggressive buyers
 

4435
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,669
you can see here aggressive buyers
stepping in the market at at uh 936

4436
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:47,679
stepping in the market at at uh 936
 

4437
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,109
stepping in the market at at uh 936
trying to get back through these strong

4438
01:38:49,109 --> 01:38:49,119
trying to get back through these strong
 

4439
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:50,470
trying to get back through these strong
sellers failed which means there's

4440
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,480
sellers failed which means there's
 

4441
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,390
sellers failed which means there's
passive selling here and since then all

4442
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:52,400
passive selling here and since then all
 

4443
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:53,910
passive selling here and since then all
we've done is go lower. So what have we

4444
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:53,920
we've done is go lower. So what have we
 

4445
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,310
we've done is go lower. So what have we
done? Failed breakout.

4446
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:56,320
done? Failed breakout.
 

4447
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,430
done? Failed breakout.
Failed breakout. Trapping liquidity.

4448
01:38:59,430 --> 01:38:59,440
Failed breakout. Trapping liquidity.
 

4449
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,910
Failed breakout. Trapping liquidity.
Where have we attacked the other side?

4450
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:01,920
Where have we attacked the other side?
 

4451
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,590
Where have we attacked the other side?
If we look at the auction at the low

4452
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
If we look at the auction at the low
 

4453
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,270
If we look at the auction at the low
who got caught at the lows

4454
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
who got caught at the lows
 

4455
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,350
who got caught at the lows
sellers. All right. And someone

4456
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:11,360
sellers. All right. And someone
 

4457
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,950
sellers. All right. And someone
somewhere in here was a previous day

4458
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:12,960
somewhere in here was a previous day
 

4459
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,830
somewhere in here was a previous day
low. Uh

4460
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:17,840

 

4461
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,070

what was previous day low? Put this back

4462
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,080
what was previous day low? Put this back
 

4463
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:24,070
what was previous day low? Put this back
on.

4464
01:39:24,070 --> 01:39:24,080

 

4465
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:28,070

Right. 119. So 119. Remember 119. Was

4466
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
Right. 119. So 119. Remember 119. Was
 

4467
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,790
Right. 119. So 119. Remember 119. Was
that right?

4468
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:30,800
that right?
 

4469
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,790
that right?
2516.

4470
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:32,800
2516.
 

4471
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,470
2516.
I've got to move this over. That's why

4472
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,480
I've got to move this over. That's why
 

4473
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,750
I've got to move this over. That's why
this is a problem. It's the old

4474
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:35,760
this is a problem. It's the old
 

4475
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,950
this is a problem. It's the old
contract.

4476
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:38,960

 

4477
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:45,990

Okay. Right here. 116

4478
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:46,000

 

4479
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,430

2518 20.

4480
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:49,440
2518 20.
 

4481
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:53,270
2518 20.
This is not moved.

4482
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,280

 

4483
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:57,750

188

4484
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:57,760

 

4485
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,229

here. This guy here. Okay. So,

4486
01:40:00,229 --> 01:40:00,239
here. This guy here. Okay. So,
 

4487
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:03,590
here. This guy here. Okay. So,
everything that happened beneath that

4488
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:03,600
everything that happened beneath that
 

4489
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:09,189
everything that happened beneath that
had the potential to catch sellers

4490
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:09,199

 

4491
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:12,149

and we leave sellers caught here, but

4492
01:40:12,149 --> 01:40:12,159
and we leave sellers caught here, but
 

4493
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:15,830
and we leave sellers caught here, but
mainly here. And the delta flips from

4494
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840
mainly here. And the delta flips from
 

4495
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,430
mainly here. And the delta flips from
here to positive. You can see all this

4496
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:17,440
here to positive. You can see all this
 

4497
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,189
here to positive. You can see all this
aggressive buying. Okay. Now we know

4498
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:19,199
aggressive buying. Okay. Now we know
 

4499
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,430
aggressive buying. Okay. Now we know
sellers are caught down here. Then we

4500
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:21,440
sellers are caught down here. Then we
 

4501
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,350
sellers are caught down here. Then we
reclaim sellers tried to sell underneath

4502
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:23,360
reclaim sellers tried to sell underneath
 

4503
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,870
reclaim sellers tried to sell underneath
previous day low again. So sellers

4504
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:24,880
previous day low again. So sellers
 

4505
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,510
previous day low again. So sellers
caught here and here. That is exactly

4506
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:27,520
caught here and here. That is exactly
 

4507
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,870
caught here and here. That is exactly
what we're talking about and we auction

4508
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:28,880
what we're talking about and we auction
 

4509
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,390
what we're talking about and we auction
away from them. So how we act here

4510
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:30,400
away from them. So how we act here
 

4511
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,709
away from them. So how we act here
coming back into it will set the tone

4512
01:40:32,709 --> 01:40:32,719
coming back into it will set the tone
 

4513
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,629
coming back into it will set the tone
and sentiment for the remainder of the

4514
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:34,639
and sentiment for the remainder of the
 

4515
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:36,709
and sentiment for the remainder of the
day. Now the one thing I would say here

4516
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
day. Now the one thing I would say here
 

4517
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,470
day. Now the one thing I would say here
is this is looking like Friday

4518
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,480
is this is looking like Friday
 

4519
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,590
is this is looking like Friday
two leg. How we act here now becomes

4520
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:43,600
two leg. How we act here now becomes
 

4521
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,510
two leg. How we act here now becomes
important. Look at the node. Look at

4522
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:45,520
important. Look at the node. Look at
 

4523
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,510
important. Look at the node. Look at
VWAP. We repric. We've done the damage.

4524
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:47,520
VWAP. We repric. We've done the damage.
 

4525
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,229
VWAP. We repric. We've done the damage.
If they start failing value here, they

4526
01:40:50,229 --> 01:40:50,239
If they start failing value here, they
 

4527
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:52,390
If they start failing value here, they
can come backside back down to this.

4528
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:52,400
can come backside back down to this.
 

4529
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,550
can come backside back down to this.
It's possible, right? Because this is

4530
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,560
It's possible, right? Because this is
 

4531
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,709
It's possible, right? Because this is
your second leg. We've failed VW up.

4532
01:40:56,709 --> 01:40:56,719
your second leg. We've failed VW up.
 

4533
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:58,390
your second leg. We've failed VW up.
We've failed point of control. Now we've

4534
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:58,400
We've failed point of control. Now we've
 

4535
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,910
We've failed point of control. Now we've
built out a shelf. If if they sell

4536
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:01,920
built out a shelf. If if they sell
 

4537
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,669
built out a shelf. If if they sell
versus sort of 50, 60, 70, 80, maybe

4538
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:05,679
versus sort of 50, 60, 70, 80, maybe
 

4539
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,590
versus sort of 50, 60, 70, 80, maybe
even 200. If they sell versus this,

4540
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:07,600
even 200. If they sell versus this,
 

4541
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,510
even 200. If they sell versus this,
that's a backside move. I would not be

4542
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:09,520
that's a backside move. I would not be
 

4543
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,510
that's a backside move. I would not be
long now until they show that they want

4544
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:11,520
long now until they show that they want
 

4545
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,910
long now until they show that they want
to reclaim that because the main trend

4546
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:13,920
to reclaim that because the main trend
 

4547
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,990
to reclaim that because the main trend
is lower. But what I would say is we've

4548
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:16,000
is lower. But what I would say is we've
 

4549
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,669
is lower. But what I would say is we've
taken liquidity both sides. This is

4550
01:41:17,669 --> 01:41:17,679
taken liquidity both sides. This is
 

4551
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:21,430
taken liquidity both sides. This is
where I become uninterested.

4552
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:21,440

 

4553
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,350

Hopefully that makes sense. Hopefully me

4554
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:23,360
Hopefully that makes sense. Hopefully me
 

4555
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,350
Hopefully that makes sense. Hopefully me
sort of talking you through that. But

4556
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:25,360
sort of talking you through that. But
 

4557
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,350
sort of talking you through that. But
that is the game of liquidity. Take

4558
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:27,360
that is the game of liquidity. Take
 

4559
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,430
that is the game of liquidity. Take
liquidity from the high. Take liquidity

4560
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:29,440
liquidity from the high. Take liquidity
 

4561
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,629
liquidity from the high. Take liquidity
from the low. Trap liquidity here. Make

4562
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:32,639
from the low. Trap liquidity here. Make
 

4563
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,709
from the low. Trap liquidity here. Make
sellers come in versus this. All right.

4564
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:34,719
sellers come in versus this. All right.
 

4565
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,790
sellers come in versus this. All right.
If if bulls can hold above this, they

4566
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:36,800
If if bulls can hold above this, they
 

4567
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,550
If if bulls can hold above this, they
need to rotate and get above this. If

4568
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:38,560
need to rotate and get above this. If
 

4569
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,910
need to rotate and get above this. If
they're going to sell this, they're

4570
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:39,920
they're going to sell this, they're
 

4571
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,669
they're going to sell this, they're
going to trap versus this. They need a

4572
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:41,679
going to trap versus this. They need a
 

4573
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,910
going to trap versus this. They need a
continuation underneath these lows. and

4574
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:43,920
continuation underneath these lows. and
 

4575
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,109
continuation underneath these lows. and
they're going to need to let out these

4576
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:45,119
they're going to need to let out these
 

4577
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,109
they're going to need to let out these
sellers who are stuck. Your lowhanging

4578
01:41:47,109 --> 01:41:47,119
sellers who are stuck. Your lowhanging
 

4579
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,350
sellers who are stuck. Your lowhanging
fruit sell has gone. The easy money sell

4580
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:49,360
fruit sell has gone. The easy money sell
 

4581
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,350
fruit sell has gone. The easy money sell
has gone. This is why I'm like probably

4582
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:51,360
has gone. This is why I'm like probably
 

4583
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,109
has gone. This is why I'm like probably
can't trade for the rest of the day. Can

4584
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:53,119
can't trade for the rest of the day. Can
 

4585
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:55,830
can't trade for the rest of the day. Can
we come down here?

4586
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
we come down here?
 

4587
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,510
we come down here?
Possible.

4588
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:57,520
Possible.
 

4589
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,109
Possible.
But I'd almost like this to build out

4590
01:41:59,109 --> 01:41:59,119
But I'd almost like this to build out
 

4591
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,270
But I'd almost like this to build out
more liquidity for a little bit, trap

4592
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:01,280
more liquidity for a little bit, trap
 

4593
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,669
more liquidity for a little bit, trap
lots more people in, and then use them,

4594
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679
lots more people in, and then use them,
 

4595
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,750
lots more people in, and then use them,
which is just like Friday. If we go back

4596
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:05,760
which is just like Friday. If we go back
 

4597
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:13,270
which is just like Friday. If we go back
to Friday, it was the same game.

4598
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:13,280

 

4599
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,109

I think about Friday. Difference with

4600
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:15,119
I think about Friday. Difference with
 

4601
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,189
I think about Friday. Difference with
Friday is we actually caused compression

4602
01:42:17,189 --> 01:42:17,199
Friday is we actually caused compression
 

4603
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:18,950
Friday is we actually caused compression
at the low. This is what we've done with

4604
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:18,960
at the low. This is what we've done with
 

4605
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,189
at the low. This is what we've done with
the whole trend today.

4606
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:21,199
the whole trend today.
 

4607
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:24,390
the whole trend today.
All right. Relief second leg peak out

4608
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:24,400
All right. Relief second leg peak out
 

4609
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:33,030
All right. Relief second leg peak out
into key area backside and repric.

4610
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:33,040

 

4611
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,950

Only thing in my head I thought I think

4612
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
Only thing in my head I thought I think
 

4613
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,470
Only thing in my head I thought I think
today would be an inside day. So I've

4614
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:36,480
today would be an inside day. So I've
 

4615
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,990
today would be an inside day. So I've
got this kind of like niggling thing in

4616
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:38,000
got this kind of like niggling thing in
 

4617
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,629
got this kind of like niggling thing in
the back of my head being like maybe

4618
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:40,639
the back of my head being like maybe
 

4619
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:42,950
the back of my head being like maybe
they hold

4620
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:42,960
they hold
 

4621

Let's see. Can go both sides now. Uh ES
 

4623
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:48,790
Let's see. Can go both sides now. Uh ES
just failed VWAP. All right. ES just fa

4624
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:48,800
just failed VWAP. All right. ES just fa
 

4625

01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:55,440
gamma level. Uh if anyone can have a
 

4631
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,350
gamma level. Uh if anyone can have a
look if anyone's got the gamma levels

4632
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,360
look if anyone's got the gamma levels
 

4633
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,149
look if anyone's got the gamma levels
up. What are the put walls below? I

4634
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:00,159
up. What are the put walls below? I
 

4635
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:03,830
up. What are the put walls below? I
would imagine 80 7875. But is there

4636
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:03,840
would imagine 80 7875. But is there
 

4637
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,070
would imagine 80 7875. But is there
anything standing out huge so far on

4638
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:06,080
anything standing out huge so far on
 

4639
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,149
anything standing out huge so far on
this Monday morning? Uh we've got OPEX

Time on the chart says the only way to

01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:24,800
Time on the chart says the only way to
 

4645
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,590
Time on the chart says the only way to
digest what you learn then it's down to

digest what you learn then it's down to

mentally being able to control the FOMO.

mentally being able to control the FOMO.
Absolutely. When I learn agree,

Coup's corners in the Discord.

4662
01:43:55,109 --> 01:43:55,119
Coup's corners in the Discord.
 

4663
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:59,990
Coup's corners in the Discord.
It's a It's part of the Discord.

4664
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:00,000

 

4665
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,629

Gold's indecisive.

4666
01:44:02,629 --> 01:44:02,639
Gold's indecisive.
 

4667
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:05,430
Gold's indecisive.
Well, gold would be the hedge for what's

4668
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,440
Well, gold would be the hedge for what's
 

4669
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:09,830
Well, gold would be the hedge for what's
probably going to happen this week.

4670
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:09,840

 

4671
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:14,790

Back end of the week. It's It's fine.

4672
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
Back end of the week. It's It's fine.
 

4673
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,709
Back end of the week. It's It's fine.
It's fine. Look, all the time gold's

4674
01:44:16,709 --> 01:44:16,719
It's fine. Look, all the time gold's
 

4675
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:21,910
It's fine. Look, all the time gold's
basing above here.

4676
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:21,920

 

4677
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,629

It's fine, right? High time frame. It

4678
01:44:24,629 --> 01:44:24,639
It's fine, right? High time frame. It
 

4679
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:26,070
It's fine, right? High time frame. It
wants to come and take these out. So if

4680
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:26,080
wants to come and take these out. So if
 

4681
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:28,070
wants to come and take these out. So if
it keep peaking and holds and peaks and

4682
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:28,080
it keep peaking and holds and peaks and
 

4683
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:30,149
it keep peaking and holds and peaks and
holds and peaks and holds, these are the

4684
01:44:30,149 --> 01:44:30,159
holds and peaks and holds, these are the
 

4685
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:31,270
holds and peaks and holds, these are the
levels. All right, it's going to be

4686
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:31,280
levels. All right, it's going to be
 

4687
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,189
levels. All right, it's going to be
boxed in here. Once it goes for a break,

4688
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:33,199
boxed in here. Once it goes for a break,
 

4689
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,350
boxed in here. Once it goes for a break,
it will swipe these. If it loses this,

4690
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:35,360
it will swipe these. If it loses this,
 

4691
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,109
it will swipe these. If it loses this,
yes, it will come back downside. But

4692
01:44:37,109 --> 01:44:37,119
yes, it will come back downside. But
 

4693
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:38,790
yes, it will come back downside. But
it's it's a catch-up trade to silver

4694
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:38,800
it's it's a catch-up trade to silver
 

4695
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:42,310
it's it's a catch-up trade to silver
right now. But if they sell, all right,

4696
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:42,320
right now. But if they sell, all right,
 

4697
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:48,950
right now. But if they sell, all right,
if they sell uh NQ and SPY, etc., etc.,

4698
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:48,960
if they sell uh NQ and SPY, etc., etc.,
 

4699
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,750
if they sell uh NQ and SPY, etc., etc.,
uh because of the JPY carry or the JP

4700
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:51,760
uh because of the JPY carry or the JP
 

4701
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,070
uh because of the JPY carry or the JP
carry then I expect this will probably

4702
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,080
carry then I expect this will probably
 

4703
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,590
carry then I expect this will probably
happen here because this would be the

4704
01:44:55,590 --> 01:44:55,600
happen here because this would be the
 

4705
01:44:55,600 --> 01:45:00,470
happen here because this would be the
hedge versus USD

4706
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480

 

4707
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,709

big ifs and buts and maybe we won't we

4708
01:45:02,709 --> 01:45:02,719
big ifs and buts and maybe we won't we
 

4709
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:27,590
big ifs and buts and maybe we won't we
won't know until Friday and Sunday

4710
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:27,600

 

4711
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,669

Alex, am I on Trading View Pro? My

4712
01:45:29,669 --> 01:45:29,679
Alex, am I on Trading View Pro? My
 

4713
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,350
Alex, am I on Trading View Pro? My
volume footprint looks like nothing as

4714
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:31,360
volume footprint looks like nothing as
 

4715
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,550
volume footprint looks like nothing as
detailed as you. Uh, I am. It would just

4716
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:34,560
detailed as you. Uh, I am. It would just
 

4717
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,149
detailed as you. Uh, I am. It would just
be how you set it up though. If if

4718
01:45:36,149 --> 01:45:36,159
be how you set it up though. If if
 

4719
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:38,390
be how you set it up though. If if
you've got access to footprint, do you

4720
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:38,400
you've got access to footprint, do you
 

4721
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,590
you've got access to footprint, do you
have access to the footprint chart?

4722
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:39,600
have access to the footprint chart?
 

4723
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,669
have access to the footprint chart?
Like, can it load? And then it's just

4724
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:41,679
Like, can it load? And then it's just
 

4725
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,229
Like, can it load? And then it's just
depends how you set it up. I have mine

4726
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
depends how you set it up. I have mine
 

4727
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:47,030
depends how you set it up. I have mine
set for uh delta.

4728
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:47,040
set for uh delta.
 

4729
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,590
set for uh delta.
So,

4730
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:49,600
So,
 

4731
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,870
So,
right. So, I'm looking at row size to

4732
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:52,880
right. So, I'm looking at row size to
 

4733
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,790
right. So, I'm looking at row size to
display profile and delta. That's how I

4734
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:54,800
display profile and delta. That's how I
 

4735
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:58,950
display profile and delta. That's how I
have mine set up.

4736
01:45:58,950 --> 01:45:58,960

 

4737
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,590

So, bold trying to step in here. We have

4738
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:01,600
So, bold trying to step in here. We have
 

4739
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,830
So, bold trying to step in here. We have
offside delta at the low of day. We're

4740
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:03,840
offside delta at the low of day. We're
 

4741
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,430
offside delta at the low of day. We're
now just trading around that previous

4742
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,440
now just trading around that previous
 

4743
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,149
now just trading around that previous
day value area low. The big question is

4744
01:46:08,149 --> 01:46:08,159
day value area low. The big question is
 

4745
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:11,350
day value area low. The big question is
can bulls all right find acceptance back

4746
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:11,360
can bulls all right find acceptance back
 

4747
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,590
can bulls all right find acceptance back
into value. All right. If we can't find

4748
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:13,600
into value. All right. If we can't find
 

4749
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,430
into value. All right. If we can't find
acceptance outside of previous day

4750
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:15,440
acceptance outside of previous day
 

4751
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,510
acceptance outside of previous day
value, we probably come back into value.

4752
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:17,520
value, we probably come back into value.
 

4753
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,270
value, we probably come back into value.
Where were the playboy? Well, previous

4754
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,280
Where were the playboy? Well, previous
 

4755
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,430
Where were the playboy? Well, previous
day point of control will be where they

4756
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:21,440
day point of control will be where they
 

4757
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,510
day point of control will be where they
want to test. If we get back above that,

4758
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:23,520
want to test. If we get back above that,
 

4759
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,030
want to test. If we get back above that,
then we're going to go right back up

4760
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:25,040
then we're going to go right back up
 

4761
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,950
then we're going to go right back up
here. If we fail this, then we retest

4762
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:26,960
here. If we fail this, then we retest
 

4763
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,550
here. If we fail this, then we retest
value again. If they fail that low of

4764
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:28,560
value again. If they fail that low of
 

4765
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,310
value again. If they fail that low of
day again, fail that old point of

4766
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:30,320
day again, fail that old point of
 

4767
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,709
day again, fail that old point of
control again. We're into a rotational

4768
01:46:32,709 --> 01:46:32,719
control again. We're into a rotational
 

4769
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:35,750
control again. We're into a rotational
market uh to build out liquidity because

4770
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:35,760
market uh to build out liquidity because
 

4771
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,750
market uh to build out liquidity because
we've done the main rotation. Remember

4772
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:37,760
we've done the main rotation. Remember
 

4773
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,310
we've done the main rotation. Remember
here to here was the main rotation. Now

4774
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:40,320
here to here was the main rotation. Now
 

4775
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,669
here to here was the main rotation. Now
they have to build liquidity to make

4776
01:46:41,669 --> 01:46:41,679
they have to build liquidity to make
 

4777
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:48,470
they have to build liquidity to make
their mind up.

4778
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:48,480

 

4779
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,470

Yeah. So lifetime dogee it would just be

4780
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:50,480
Yeah. So lifetime dogee it would just be
 

4781
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,470
Yeah. So lifetime dogee it would just be
in the settings my friend. So just open

4782
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:52,480
in the settings my friend. So just open
 

4783
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,590
in the settings my friend. So just open
it up. I would I changed mine to manual

4784
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:55,600
it up. I would I changed mine to manual
 

4785
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:00,229
it up. I would I changed mine to manual
uh two tick row size um profile chart

4786
01:47:00,229 --> 01:47:00,239
uh two tick row size um profile chart
 

4787
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:01,990
uh two tick row size um profile chart
and delta. But it all depends what you

4788
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,000
and delta. But it all depends what you
 

4789
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,669
and delta. But it all depends what you
want to look at. Everyone's everyone's

4790
01:47:03,669 --> 01:47:03,679
want to look at. Everyone's everyone's
 

4791
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:06,070
want to look at. Everyone's everyone's
different. All I ever care about really

4792
01:47:06,070 --> 01:47:06,080
different. All I ever care about really
 

4793
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,669
different. All I ever care about really
when when I'm looking at footprint

4794
01:47:07,669 --> 01:47:07,679
when when I'm looking at footprint
 

4795
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:09,430
when when I'm looking at footprint
charts is the delta. Uh if you're using

4796
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,440
charts is the delta. Uh if you're using
 

4797
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,870
charts is the delta. Uh if you're using
it on a 5, 10, 15, 30 minute chart, it

4798
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:12,880
it on a 5, 10, 15, 30 minute chart, it
 

4799
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,229
it on a 5, 10, 15, 30 minute chart, it
might be worth having the volume on

4800
01:47:14,229 --> 01:47:14,239
might be worth having the volume on
 

4801
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:17,350
might be worth having the volume on
there as well

4802
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:17,360
there as well
 

4803
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,790
there as well
because then you can see the shapes of

4804
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:18,800
because then you can see the shapes of
 

4805
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,030
because then you can see the shapes of
the profile. All right, sellers buyers

4806
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:21,040

So failed look below previous day value

4858
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,080
So failed look below previous day value
 

4859
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,070
So failed look below previous day value
area low right now. Reclaiming previous

4860
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:28,080
area low right now. Reclaiming previous
 

4861
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:31,830
area low right now. Reclaiming previous
day value area low. Previous day low. Uh

4862
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:31,840
day value area low. Previous day low. Uh
 

4863
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:34,310
day value area low. Previous day low. Uh
current point control on the session.

4864
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:34,320
current point control on the session.
 

4865
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,709
current point control on the session.
You might well see a drift up into here.

4866
01:54:36,709 --> 01:54:36,719
You might well see a drift up into here.
 

4867
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:38,229
You might well see a drift up into here.
All right. So maybe second leg comes up

4868
01:54:38,229 --> 01:54:38,239
All right. So maybe second leg comes up
 

4869
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:39,830
All right. So maybe second leg comes up
into here. And what they do here becomes

4870
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:39,840
into here. And what they do here becomes
 

4871
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,950
into here. And what they do here becomes
important for sentiment of the rest of

4872
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:40,960
important for sentiment of the rest of
 

4873
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,070
important for sentiment of the rest of
the day because if they're going to go

4874
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:42,080
the day because if they're going to go
 

4875
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,070
the day because if they're going to go
rotation, they're going to need to sell

4876
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:44,080
rotation, they're going to need to sell
 

4877
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,470
rotation, they're going to need to sell
this back down. If they fail to hold

4878
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:46,480
this back down. If they fail to hold
 

4879
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:47,990
this back down. If they fail to hold
sellers, okay, sellers have done a

4880
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,000
sellers, okay, sellers have done a
 

4881
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,270
sellers, okay, sellers have done a
really good job today. Remember, all low

really good job today. Remember, all low
 

4883
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,390
really good job today. Remember, all low
hanging fruit's gone. That's why I've

4884
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:50,400
hanging fruit's gone. That's why I've
 

4885
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,629
hanging fruit's gone. That's why I've
become less interested. If they're going

4886
01:54:52,629 --> 01:54:52,639
become less interested. If they're going
 

4887
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,390
become less interested. If they're going
to offer a sell, it needs to be here. If

4888
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:54,400
to offer a sell, it needs to be here. If
 

4889
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,750
to offer a sell, it needs to be here. If
they can't offer that sell, we're going

4890
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:55,760
they can't offer that sell, we're going
 

4891
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,270
they can't offer that sell, we're going
to come right back up to previous day

4892
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:57,280
to come right back up to previous day
 

4893
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:00,070
to come right back up to previous day
value area high. Uh

4894
01:55:00,070 --> 01:55:00,080
value area high. Uh
 

4895
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:03,030
value area high. Uh
so, those are the rotations.

4896
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:03,040
so, those are the rotations.
 

4897
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,109

01:55:30,229 --> 01:55:30,239
Are any of you guys in long in this? Did
 

4917
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:31,990
Are any of you guys in long in this? Did
any of you guys take either long from

4918
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:32,000
any of you guys take either long from
 

4919
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,910
any of you guys take either long from
the blue box or long from previous day

4920
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:33,920
the blue box or long from previous day
 

4921
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,470
the blue box or long from previous day
low reclaim or any of that? It's not a

4922
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:36,480
low reclaim or any of that? It's not a
 

4923
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,950
low reclaim or any of that? It's not a
trade I like, but it's a valid trade

4924
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:38,960
trade I like, but it's a valid trade
 

4925
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,109
trade I like, but it's a valid trade
setup. Just because I don't like it

4926
01:55:41,109 --> 01:55:41,119
setup. Just because I don't like it
 

4927
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:47,189
setup. Just because I don't like it
means doesn't mean it's not valid.

4928
01:55:47,189 --> 01:55:47,199

 

4929
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:53,030

Thanks guys. I appreciate it. It's

4930
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:53,040

 

4931
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,030

Yeah, I won't talk about it on here. I

4932
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:55,040
Yeah, I won't talk about it on here. I
 

4933
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,629
Yeah, I won't talk about it on here. I
don't want to get emotional. It's a lot,

4934
01:55:56,629 --> 01:55:56,639
don't want to get emotional. It's a lot,
 

4935
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:59,350
don't want to get emotional. It's a lot,
but uh it's not

4936
01:55:59,350 --> 01:55:59,360
but uh it's not
 

4937
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,350
but uh it's not
it's not looking too bad at the moment,

4938
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:01,360
it's not looking too bad at the moment,
 

4939
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:03,910
it's not looking too bad at the moment,
which is good.

4940
01:56:03,910 --> 01:56:03,920
which is good.
 

4941
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:06,550
which is good.
I wish it was uh something as small as

4942
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:06,560
I wish it was uh something as small as
 

4943
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:17,910
I wish it was uh something as small as
that.

4944
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:17,920

 

4945
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,950

At what point on the day does value area

4946
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:20,960
At what point on the day does value area
 

4947
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,390
At what point on the day does value area
high low become more important than

4948
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:22,400
high low become more important than
 

4949
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,669
high low become more important than
yesterday? Oh, you mean current days

4950
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:23,679
yesterday? Oh, you mean current days
 

4951
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:28,390
yesterday? Oh, you mean current days
building? Um, I'd say really from now

4952
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:28,400
building? Um, I'd say really from now
 

4953
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:31,109
building? Um, I'd say really from now
10:30 in, but you know, it doesn't mean

4954
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:31,119
10:30 in, but you know, it doesn't mean
 

4955
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:34,149
10:30 in, but you know, it doesn't mean
we can't repric. Like we can see we've

4956
01:56:34,149 --> 01:56:34,159
we can't repric. Like we can see we've
 

4957
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:38,070
we can't repric. Like we can see we've
left volume above

4958
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:38,080
left volume above
 

4959
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,830
left volume above
um

4960
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:39,840
um
 

4961
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:42,229
um
every level is valid. Every level is

4962
01:56:42,229 --> 01:56:42,239
every level is valid. Every level is
 

4963
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:43,830
every level is valid. Every level is
valid. What I'd be thinking about is

4964
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:43,840
valid. What I'd be thinking about is
 

4965
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,669
valid. What I'd be thinking about is
like

4966
01:56:45,669 --> 01:56:45,679
like
 

4967
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:47,270
like
have we expanded lower? Have we hit

4968
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:47,280
have we expanded lower? Have we hit
 

4969
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,189
have we expanded lower? Have we hit
this? No. So it's possible we might want

4970
01:56:49,189 --> 01:56:49,199
this? No. So it's possible we might want
 

4971
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:51,350
this? No. So it's possible we might want
to go back for that. Have we let left

4972
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:51,360
to go back for that. Have we let left
 

4973
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,189
to go back for that. Have we let left
left sellers trapped down there? Yes, we

4974
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
left sellers trapped down there? Yes, we
 

4975
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:55,669
left sellers trapped down there? Yes, we
have. So maybe they finished ex

4976
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:55,679
have. So maybe they finished ex
 

4977
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:58,149
have. So maybe they finished ex
expansion down today. Have we reclaimed

4978
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
expansion down today. Have we reclaimed
 

4979
01:56:58,159 --> 01:56:59,750
expansion down today. Have we reclaimed
current value? Yes, we have. All right.

4980
01:56:59,750 --> 01:56:59,760
current value? Yes, we have. All right.
 

4981
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,270
current value? Yes, we have. All right.
So was there a long back up here?

4982
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:01,280
So was there a long back up here?
 

4983
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,870
So was there a long back up here?
Possible. Yes. Was there a long here

4984
01:57:02,870 --> 01:57:02,880
Possible. Yes. Was there a long here
 

4985
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,310
Possible. Yes. Was there a long here
possible? Yes. Like I said, both of

4986
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:04,320
possible? Yes. Like I said, both of
 

4987
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,310
possible? Yes. Like I said, both of
these were valid trades. They're not

4988
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,320
these were valid trades. They're not
 

4989
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,910
these were valid trades. They're not
trades I would take, but they are valid

4990
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:07,920
trades I would take, but they are valid
 

4991
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,830
trades I would take, but they are valid
trades. What I'd be looking at now is

4992
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:09,840
trades. What I'd be looking at now is
 

4993
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,830
trades. What I'd be looking at now is
look how thin it gets above this little

4994
01:57:11,830 --> 01:57:11,840
look how thin it gets above this little
 

4995
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,990
look how thin it gets above this little
shelf here, right? So, if they're able

4996
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:14,000
shelf here, right? So, if they're able
 

4997
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,229
shelf here, right? So, if they're able
to pop this shelf, we can probably come

4998
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:16,239
to pop this shelf, we can probably come
 

4999
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:17,589
to pop this shelf, we can probably come
straight up into this level here.

5000
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:17,599
straight up into this level here.
 

5001
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,270
straight up into this level here.
Remember, that's previous day close,

5002
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:19,280
Remember, that's previous day close,
 

5003
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,189
Remember, that's previous day close,
GlobeEx, previous day point of control.

5004
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:21,199
GlobeEx, previous day point of control.
 

5005
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:24,390
GlobeEx, previous day point of control.
So, big big big if butts and ws. I

5006
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:24,400
So, big big big if butts and ws. I
 

5007
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:26,470
So, big big big if butts and ws. I
wouldn't imagine bears will want them to

5008
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:26,480
wouldn't imagine bears will want them to
 

5009
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,870
wouldn't imagine bears will want them to
be allowed to rotate above these areas.

5010
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:28,880
be allowed to rotate above these areas.
 

5011
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,310
be allowed to rotate above these areas.
All right. So, I'd imagine they're

5012
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:30,320
All right. So, I'd imagine they're
 

5013
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,070
All right. So, I'd imagine they're
allowing some relief. If we even think

5014
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:32,080
allowing some relief. If we even think
 

5015
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,990
allowing some relief. If we even think
about this New York session, we're

5016
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:34,000
about this New York session, we're
 

5017
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,830
about this New York session, we're
probably what, 30 or something? 33s.

5018
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:37,840
probably what, 30 or something? 33s.
 

5019
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:41,430
probably what, 30 or something? 33s.
There you go. So, 38. So, if we're going

5020
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:41,440
There you go. So, 38. So, if we're going
 

5021
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:44,550
There you go. So, 38. So, if we're going
to allow 50% retracement, if they're

5022
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:44,560
to allow 50% retracement, if they're
 

5023
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,070
to allow 50% retracement, if they're
going to allow 50% retracement,

5024
01:57:46,070 --> 01:57:46,080
going to allow 50% retracement,
 

5025
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,990
going to allow 50% retracement,
remember, walk down, walk down, walk

5026
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:48,000
remember, walk down, walk down, walk
 

5027
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,750
remember, walk down, walk down, walk
down, walk down, walk down, walk down,

5028
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:49,760
down, walk down, walk down, walk down,
 

5029
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,310
down, walk down, walk down, walk down,
big expansion trap, higher low, higher

5030
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:52,320
big expansion trap, higher low, higher
 

5031
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:55,030
big expansion trap, higher low, higher
high, higher low. How we act in here for

5032
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:55,040
high, higher low. How we act in here for
 

5033
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:58,709
high, higher low. How we act in here for
me and in here becomes key, right? So, I

5034
01:57:58,709 --> 01:57:58,719
me and in here becomes key, right? So, I
 

5035
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:00,629
me and in here becomes key, right? So, I
I don't trade the longs on stuff like

5036
01:58:00,629 --> 01:58:00,639
I don't trade the longs on stuff like
 

5037
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:01,990
I don't trade the longs on stuff like
this. Doesn't mean you can't. I'd be

5038
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:02,000
this. Doesn't mean you can't. I'd be
 

5039
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,390
this. Doesn't mean you can't. I'd be
waiting now to see I don't like this.

5040
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:04,400
waiting now to see I don't like this.
 

5041
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:07,589
waiting now to see I don't like this.
So, I'd want to see it peak above, fail,

5042
01:58:07,589 --> 01:58:07,599
So, I'd want to see it peak above, fail,
 

5043
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:10,950
So, I'd want to see it peak above, fail,
come under, stay heavy, ro like rotate,

5044
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:10,960
come under, stay heavy, ro like rotate,
 

5045
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,669
come under, stay heavy, ro like rotate,
and I'd be covering here, here, here,

5046
01:58:13,669 --> 01:58:13,679
and I'd be covering here, here, here,
 

5047
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:15,750
and I'd be covering here, here, here,
here, here, and holding for a runner. My

5048
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:15,760
here, here, and holding for a runner. My
 

5049
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,790
here, here, and holding for a runner. My
expectation is not now how it was

5050
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:18,800
expectation is not now how it was
 

5051
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,669
expectation is not now how it was
earlier because now I know

5052
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:21,679
earlier because now I know
 

5053
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:23,750
earlier because now I know
in here we have lots of trap sellers.

5054
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:23,760
in here we have lots of trap sellers.
 

5055
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:24,950
in here we have lots of trap sellers.
Whereas when we were walking down

5056
01:58:24,950 --> 01:58:24,960
Whereas when we were walking down
 

5057
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:27,510
Whereas when we were walking down
before, we didn't have that. Now we have

5058
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:27,520
before, we didn't have that. Now we have
 

5059
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,030
before, we didn't have that. Now we have
trap sellers which means what? We have

5060
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:29,040
trap sellers which means what? We have
 

5061
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,790
trap sellers which means what? We have
demand. We have a support structure. So

5062
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:30,800
demand. We have a support structure. So
 

5063
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,470
demand. We have a support structure. So
if we're going to play for a

5064
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:32,480
if we're going to play for a
 

5065
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:33,830
if we're going to play for a
continuation, we're going to respect

5066
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:33,840
continuation, we're going to respect
 

5067
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:37,430
continuation, we're going to respect
that just like Friday. It's guys, it's

5068
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:37,440
that just like Friday. It's guys, it's
 

5069
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:40,310
that just like Friday. It's guys, it's
carbon copy from Friday. This is why

5070
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:40,320
carbon copy from Friday. This is why
 

5071
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,149
carbon copy from Friday. This is why
learn to see these things the same way.

5072
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:42,159
learn to see these things the same way.
 

5073
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:44,149
learn to see these things the same way.
Where is Friday? Mr. Friday. Here it

5074
01:58:44,149 --> 01:58:44,159
Where is Friday? Mr. Friday. Here it
 

5075
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:46,629
Where is Friday? Mr. Friday. Here it
goes. Right. So the relief took a while

5076
01:58:46,629 --> 01:58:46,639
goes. Right. So the relief took a while
 

5077
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:48,470
goes. Right. So the relief took a while
on Friday.

5078
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,480
on Friday.
 

5079
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,470
on Friday.
There's the little blowoff top. All

5080
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:50,480
There's the little blowoff top. All
 

5081
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:52,709
There's the little blowoff top. All
right. On volume. And then we failed to

5082
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:52,719
right. On volume. And then we failed to
 

5083
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:54,390
right. On volume. And then we failed to
print it back above. There's the lower

5084
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:54,400
print it back above. There's the lower
 

5085
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,030
print it back above. There's the lower
high. And we cover into these points. We

5086
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:57,040
high. And we cover into these points. We
 

5087
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,709
high. And we cover into these points. We
respect these points. And if we get

5088
01:58:58,709 --> 01:58:58,719
respect these points. And if we get
 

5089
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:01,030
respect these points. And if we get
lower, it's great. But we always respect

5090
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:01,040
lower, it's great. But we always respect
 

5091
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:29,030
lower, it's great. But we always respect
those levels.

5092
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:29,040

 

5093
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,870

I agree with you Johnny. That's that's

5094
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:30,880
I agree with you Johnny. That's that's
 

5095
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:33,750
I agree with you Johnny. That's that's
exactly how I feel my friend. That's how

5096
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:33,760
exactly how I feel my friend. That's how
 

5097
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,189
exactly how I feel my friend. That's how
I feel. I that's why I don't play the

5098
01:59:35,189 --> 01:59:35,199
I feel. I that's why I don't play the
 

5099
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:37,430
I feel. I that's why I don't play the
counter trend because the main if we

5100
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:37,440
counter trend because the main if we
 

5101
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,430
counter trend because the main if we
look at VWOP

5102
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:39,440
look at VWOP
 

5103
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,870
look at VWOP
VWOP trading downside, right? VWOPS are

5104
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:42,880
VWOP trading downside, right? VWOPS are
 

5105
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:45,830
VWOP trading downside, right? VWOPS are
down, EMAs are down, higher time frame

5106
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:45,840
down, EMAs are down, higher time frame
 

5107
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,910
down, EMAs are down, higher time frame
are down, point of control is here. I'm

5108
01:59:47,910 --> 01:59:47,920
are down, point of control is here. I'm
 

5109
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:49,510
are down, point of control is here. I'm
with you, my friend. I don't trade these

5110
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520
with you, my friend. I don't trade these
 

5111
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,109
with you, my friend. I don't trade these
trades, but it doesn't mean they're not

5112
01:59:51,109 --> 01:59:51,119
trades, but it doesn't mean they're not
 

5113
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:53,109
trades, but it doesn't mean they're not
valid setups. It's just it is not I

5114
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:53,119
valid setups. It's just it is not I
 

5115
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:56,229
valid setups. It's just it is not I
would rather let this peak out and trade

5116
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:56,239
would rather let this peak out and trade
 

5117
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,790
would rather let this peak out and trade
that. I'm exactly with you, my friend.

5118
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:58,800
that. I'm exactly with you, my friend.
 

5119
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:01,830
that. I'm exactly with you, my friend.
That's that is my preference. But if it

5120
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:01,840
That's that is my preference. But if it
 

5121
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,149
That's that is my preference. But if it
peaks out and it doesn't want to let go,

5122
02:00:04,149 --> 02:00:04,159
peaks out and it doesn't want to let go,
 

5123
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:06,149
peaks out and it doesn't want to let go,
you know, we can't rule out that move up

5124
02:00:06,149 --> 02:00:06,159
you know, we can't rule out that move up
 

5125
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:07,990
you know, we can't rule out that move up
there. But, uh, it all depends what the

5126
02:00:07,990 --> 02:00:08,000
there. But, uh, it all depends what the
 

5127
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,229
there. But, uh, it all depends what the
Q's do today on the MAG. So, let's give

5128
02:00:10,229 --> 02:00:10,239
Q's do today on the MAG. So, let's give
 

5129
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:11,510
Q's do today on the MAG. So, let's give
you a little readout on the MAG. So,

5130
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:11,520
you a little readout on the MAG. So,
 

5131
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,390
you a little readout on the MAG. So,
Tesla right now

5132
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:14,400
Tesla right now
 

5133
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,990
Tesla right now
3.83% up, Nvidia 1.28% 28% up. Meta

5134
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:18,000
3.83% up, Nvidia 1.28% 28% up. Meta
 

5135
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,070
3.83% up, Nvidia 1.28% 28% up. Meta
0.36% up. And then you've got the

5136
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:20,080
0.36% up. And then you've got the
 

5137
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,030
0.36% up. And then you've got the
weakness. So Microsoft 1% down. Google

5138
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:23,040
weakness. So Microsoft 1% down. Google
 

5139
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,910
weakness. So Microsoft 1% down. Google
uh 3/4 of a percent down. Amazon 1.16%

5140
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:25,920
uh 3/4 of a percent down. Amazon 1.16%
 

5141
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:28,950
uh 3/4 of a percent down. Amazon 1.16%
down. Apple 1 and a half% down. So mixed

5142
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:28,960
down. Apple 1 and a half% down. So mixed
 

5143
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:33,109
down. Apple 1 and a half% down. So mixed
bag. If we look beyond that, AVGO 4.09%

5144
02:00:33,109 --> 02:00:33,119
bag. If we look beyond that, AVGO 4.09%
 

5145
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:36,310
bag. If we look beyond that, AVGO 4.09%
down. Oracle 3% down. Um all those sort

5146
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:36,320
down. Oracle 3% down. Um all those sort
 

5147
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:39,189
down. Oracle 3% down. Um all those sort
of I would say B and C list high gamma

5148
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:39,199
of I would say B and C list high gamma
 

5149
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:40,790
of I would say B and C list high gamma
exposure names they all got clobbered

5150
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:40,800
exposure names they all got clobbered
 

5151
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:45,510
exposure names they all got clobbered
this morning. So RGTI 7 7.24% down. NVTS

5152
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:45,520
this morning. So RGTI 7 7.24% down. NVTS
 

5153
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,589
this morning. So RGTI 7 7.24% down. NVTS
5.82%. 82% down all those sort of chip

5154
02:00:47,589 --> 02:00:47,599
5.82%. 82% down all those sort of chip
 

5155
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:52,950
5.82%. 82% down all those sort of chip
name AI names and NQ 6.16% down 8.20%

5156
02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:52,960
name AI names and NQ 6.16% down 8.20%
 

5157
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,830
name AI names and NQ 6.16% down 8.20%
20% down, you know, so Netflix 1.19%

5158
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:57,840
20% down, you know, so Netflix 1.19%
 

5159
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,910
20% down, you know, so Netflix 1.19%
down. So the the bigger spectrum right

5160
02:00:59,910 --> 02:00:59,920
down. So the the bigger spectrum right
 

5161
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,470
down. So the the bigger spectrum right
now is not in a buy. I am I am in

5162
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:02,480
now is not in a buy. I am I am in
 

5163
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:05,589
now is not in a buy. I am I am in
absolutely agreement with you, Johnny.

5164
02:01:05,589 --> 02:01:05,599
absolutely agreement with you, Johnny.
 

5165
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:07,750
absolutely agreement with you, Johnny.
But I try and the difference is how I

5166
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:07,760
But I try and the difference is how I
 

5167
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,189
But I try and the difference is how I
trade and how I teach. I have to be

5168
02:01:09,189 --> 02:01:09,199
trade and how I teach. I have to be
 

5169
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,030
trade and how I teach. I have to be
aware that some of you will like playing

5170
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:11,040
aware that some of you will like playing
 

5171
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,709
aware that some of you will like playing
these rotations. Some of you will be

5172
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:12,719
these rotations. Some of you will be
 

5173
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:14,790
these rotations. Some of you will be
looking for a scalp off this. This this

5174
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:14,800
looking for a scalp off this. This this
 

5175
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,990
looking for a scalp off this. This this
like we talked about, it's a valid

5176
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:16,000
like we talked about, it's a valid
 

5177
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,350
like we talked about, it's a valid
trade. It's not a trade I would take,

5178
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:17,360
trade. It's not a trade I would take,
 

5179
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:24,070
trade. It's not a trade I would take,
but it is a valid trade.

5180
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:24,080

 

5181
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:27,109

dead eyee. What am I looking at? Uh any

5182
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:27,119
dead eyee. What am I looking at? Uh any
 

5183
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:30,709
dead eyee. What am I looking at? Uh any
form of

5184
02:01:30,709 --> 02:01:30,719
form of
 

5185
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:33,990
form of
bookmap, delta, footprint, like anything

5186
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:34,000
bookmap, delta, footprint, like anything
 

5187
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,189
bookmap, delta, footprint, like anything
like that. However you want to view it,

5188
02:01:37,189 --> 02:01:37,199
like that. However you want to view it,
 

5189
02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:38,790
like that. However you want to view it,
whatever you feel comfortable with. I

5190
02:01:38,790 --> 02:01:38,800
whatever you feel comfortable with. I
 

5191
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,189
whatever you feel comfortable with. I
use all of them.

5192
02:01:41,189 --> 02:01:41,199
use all of them.
 

5193
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:44,629
use all of them.
It's like we talked about footprint.

5194
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:44,639
It's like we talked about footprint.
 

5195
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:46,870
It's like we talked about footprint.
If we look at the lows, right, sellers

5196
02:01:46,870 --> 02:01:46,880
If we look at the lows, right, sellers
 

5197
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,950
If we look at the lows, right, sellers
are at the lows,

5198
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:48,960
are at the lows,
 

5199
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,030
are at the lows,
right? So, they're stuck. So, that's why

5200
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:51,040
right? So, they're stuck. So, that's why
 

5201
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:53,990
right? So, they're stuck. So, that's why
we reversed off that level.

5202
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,000
we reversed off that level.
 

5203
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,229
we reversed off that level.
And like I said, if you if you rewind

5204
02:01:56,229 --> 02:01:56,239
And like I said, if you if you rewind
 

5205
02:01:56,239 --> 02:01:58,149
And like I said, if you if you rewind
the tape, I said, as long as they put in

5206
02:01:58,149 --> 02:01:58,159
the tape, I said, as long as they put in
 

5207
02:01:58,159 --> 02:02:00,470
the tape, I said, as long as they put in
a higher low versus here, they're going

5208
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:00,480
a higher low versus here, they're going
 

5209
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,229
a higher low versus here, they're going
to be okay. All right. So, they

5210
02:02:02,229 --> 02:02:02,239
to be okay. All right. So, they
 

5211
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:03,910
to be okay. All right. So, they
protected these guys. These guys are

5212
02:02:03,910 --> 02:02:03,920
protected these guys. These guys are
 

5213
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,430
protected these guys. These guys are
stuck. And now they've left these guys

5214
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:05,440
stuck. And now they've left these guys
 

5215
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,350
stuck. And now they've left these guys
stuck. All right. So, everyone beneath

5216
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:07,360
stuck. All right. So, everyone beneath
 

5217
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,950
stuck. All right. So, everyone beneath
this who's a seller is now stuck and

5218
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:08,960
this who's a seller is now stuck and
 

5219
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:10,470
this who's a seller is now stuck and
you're seeing relief to the upside

5220
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:10,480
you're seeing relief to the upside
 

5221
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,550
you're seeing relief to the upside
because of it. Right? But you don't have

5222
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:12,560
because of it. Right? But you don't have
 

5223
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:13,830
because of it. Right? But you don't have
to view that on there. You can see it on

5224
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:13,840
to view that on there. You can see it on
 

5225
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:16,550
to view that on there. You can see it on
bookmap as well. Like it it's like

5226
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:16,560
bookmap as well. Like it it's like
 

5227
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,229
bookmap as well. Like it it's like
horses for courses, right? However you

5228
02:02:18,229 --> 02:02:18,239
horses for courses, right? However you
 

5229
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:19,669
horses for courses, right? However you
want to see it. Like we went over. If

5230
02:02:19,669 --> 02:02:19,679
want to see it. Like we went over. If
 

5231
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,350
want to see it. Like we went over. If
you look at bookmap, look at this big

5232
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:21,360
you look at bookmap, look at this big
 

5233
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:24,229
you look at bookmap, look at this big
seller at the low of day. 226 lot, 220

5234
02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:24,239
seller at the low of day. 226 lot, 220
 

5235
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:27,109
seller at the low of day. 226 lot, 220
lot here, 286 lot here, 24 lot there.

5236
02:02:27,109 --> 02:02:27,119
lot here, 286 lot here, 24 lot there.
 

5237
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:30,070
lot here, 286 lot here, 24 lot there.
Above him, 242 lot. All these guys are

5238
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:30,080
Above him, 242 lot. All these guys are
 

5239
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,790
Above him, 242 lot. All these guys are
now stuck. Right underneath here is all

5240
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:32,800
now stuck. Right underneath here is all
 

5241
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,310
now stuck. Right underneath here is all
sell side. We look at all these

5242
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:34,320
sell side. We look at all these
 

5243
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:35,830
sell side. We look at all these
aggressive sellers. They're all stuck.

5244
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:35,840
aggressive sellers. They're all stuck.
 

5245
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,430
aggressive sellers. They're all stuck.
So, we're lifting. We're going to come

5246
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:37,440
So, we're lifting. We're going to come
 

5247
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,910
So, we're lifting. We're going to come
to this VWAP now.

5248
02:02:39,910 --> 02:02:39,920
to this VWAP now.
 

5249
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,790
to this VWAP now.
Right. So, it's just it's it's totally

5250
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:42,800
Right. So, it's just it's it's totally
 

5251
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,229
Right. So, it's just it's it's totally
up to you how you view it. I mean, you

5252
02:02:44,229 --> 02:02:44,239
up to you how you view it. I mean, you
 

5253
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:45,589
up to you how you view it. I mean, you
don't have to use any of this. If you if

5254
02:02:45,589 --> 02:02:45,599
don't have to use any of this. If you if
 

5255
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:48,470
don't have to use any of this. If you if
you

5256
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,480
you
 

5257
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:52,229
you
Um trying to think how to explain this.

5258
02:02:52,229 --> 02:02:52,239
Um trying to think how to explain this.
 

5259
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:54,709
Um trying to think how to explain this.
If you just like candlesticks, all

5260
02:02:54,709 --> 02:02:54,719
If you just like candlesticks, all
 

5261
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:56,790
If you just like candlesticks, all
right, then you can think about this in

5262
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:56,800
right, then you can think about this in
 

5263
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,149
right, then you can think about this in
terms of structure, right? If you don't

5264
02:02:58,149 --> 02:02:58,159
terms of structure, right? If you don't
 

5265
02:02:58,159 --> 02:03:00,149
terms of structure, right? If you don't
want to be uber accurate and you're just

5266
02:03:00,149 --> 02:03:00,159
want to be uber accurate and you're just
 

5267
02:03:00,159 --> 02:03:02,629
want to be uber accurate and you're just
like, well, you know, there is your

5268
02:03:02,629 --> 02:03:02,639
like, well, you know, there is your
 

5269
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:04,870
like, well, you know, there is your
displacement, there is a failed break

5270
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:04,880
displacement, there is a failed break
 

5271
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,950
displacement, there is a failed break
below, there's a hold, we break through

5272
02:03:06,950 --> 02:03:06,960
below, there's a hold, we break through
 

5273
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,310
below, there's a hold, we break through
that displacement, all right, we're

5274
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:08,320
that displacement, all right, we're
 

5275
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:10,629
that displacement, all right, we're
going upside, right? That's the relief.

5276
02:03:10,629 --> 02:03:10,639
going upside, right? That's the relief.
 

5277
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:12,950
going upside, right? That's the relief.
That's another way of viewing it.

5278
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:12,960
That's another way of viewing it.
 

5279
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:15,430
That's another way of viewing it.
I like to have like real data inside of

5280
02:03:15,430 --> 02:03:15,440
I like to have like real data inside of
 

5281
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,510
I like to have like real data inside of
this rather than guessing based on

5282
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:17,520
this rather than guessing based on
 

5283
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:20,229
this rather than guessing based on
candles than

5284
02:03:20,229 --> 02:03:20,239
candles than
 

5285
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:21,430
candles than
historically. I've always looked at

5286
02:03:21,430 --> 02:03:21,440
historically. I've always looked at
 

5287
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,430
historically. I've always looked at
bitmap, right? I've only used footprint

5288
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:23,440
bitmap, right? I've only used footprint
 

5289
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:24,790
bitmap, right? I've only used footprint
more recently. I'm actually really

5290
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:24,800
more recently. I'm actually really
 

5291
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,109
more recently. I'm actually really
enjoying it because I find it arguably

5292
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:27,119
enjoying it because I find it arguably
 

5293
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:29,750
enjoying it because I find it arguably
even easier to read than bookm

5294
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:29,760
even easier to read than bookm
 

5295
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,990
even easier to read than bookm
uh

5296
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:34,000

 

5297
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,589

but it's the same theory. I'm always

5298
02:03:35,589 --> 02:03:35,599
but it's the same theory. I'm always
 

5299
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:37,910
but it's the same theory. I'm always
looking the same stuff. We're seeing big

5300
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:37,920
looking the same stuff. We're seeing big
 

5301
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:39,350
looking the same stuff. We're seeing big
buying coming in at the moment and if

5302
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:39,360
buying coming in at the moment and if
 

5303
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:40,629
buying coming in at the moment and if
they can't get through these levels,

5304
02:03:40,629 --> 02:03:40,639
they can't get through these levels,
 

5305
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:41,830
they can't get through these levels,
they're going to get themselves caught.

5306
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:41,840
they're going to get themselves caught.
 

5307
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:45,270
they're going to get themselves caught.
We see on bookmap 175 lot 56 lot more

5308
02:03:45,270 --> 02:03:45,280
We see on bookmap 175 lot 56 lot more
 

5309
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,629
We see on bookmap 175 lot 56 lot more
coming in here and if they don't get

5310
02:03:46,629 --> 02:03:46,639
coming in here and if they don't get
 

5311
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:48,070
coming in here and if they don't get
this breakout and push above they will

5312
02:03:48,070 --> 02:03:48,080
this breakout and push above they will
 

5313
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:49,189
this breakout and push above they will
get themselves caught and we will

5314
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:49,199
get themselves caught and we will
 

5315
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:51,830
get themselves caught and we will
probably wash back down to 175. So

5316
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:51,840
probably wash back down to 175. So
 

5317
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,430
probably wash back down to 175. So
they're trying aggressively aggressively

5318
02:03:53,430 --> 02:03:53,440
they're trying aggressively aggressively
 

5319
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:54,870
they're trying aggressively aggressively
aggressively to step in. We've got this

5320
02:03:54,870 --> 02:03:54,880
aggressively to step in. We've got this
 

5321
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:56,790
aggressively to step in. We've got this
shelf hedge. Remember we said we we're

5322
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:56,800
shelf hedge. Remember we said we we're
 

5323
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,709
shelf hedge. Remember we said we we're
thin above this. If you rewind the tape

5324
02:03:58,709 --> 02:03:58,719
thin above this. If you rewind the tape
 

5325
02:03:58,719 --> 02:03:59,990
thin above this. If you rewind the tape
only like probably three or four

5326
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:00,000
only like probably three or four
 

5327
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,270
only like probably three or four
minutes. So we're thin above this. A

5328
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:01,280
minutes. So we're thin above this. A
 

5329
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,109
minutes. So we're thin above this. A
break here will probably cause a squeeze

5330
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:03,119
break here will probably cause a squeeze
 

5331
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:04,629
break here will probably cause a squeeze
out up here because look at the

5332
02:04:04,629 --> 02:04:04,639
out up here because look at the
 

5333
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:06,390
out up here because look at the
difference. There's your volume build

5334
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:06,400
difference. There's your volume build
 

5335
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:09,189
difference. There's your volume build
out, right? Sellers needed to defend

5336
02:04:09,189 --> 02:04:09,199
out, right? Sellers needed to defend
 

5337
02:04:09,199 --> 02:04:11,189
out, right? Sellers needed to defend
this edge. you can see it and they

5338
02:04:11,189 --> 02:04:11,199
this edge. you can see it and they
 

5339
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:13,030
this edge. you can see it and they
didn't. So, we're going to get a lift

5340
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:13,040
didn't. So, we're going to get a lift
 

5341
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,030
didn't. So, we're going to get a lift
off here and a squeeze. Now, if we lift

5342
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:15,040
off here and a squeeze. Now, if we lift
 

5343
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,870
off here and a squeeze. Now, if we lift
and we fell back into that, that might

5344
02:04:16,870 --> 02:04:16,880
and we fell back into that, that might
 

5345
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,270
and we fell back into that, that might
offer the short back down. Maybe maybe

5346
02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:19,280
offer the short back down. Maybe maybe
 

5347
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,629
offer the short back down. Maybe maybe
they don't want to do it today because

5348
02:04:20,629 --> 02:04:20,639
they don't want to do it today because
 

5349
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:23,350
they don't want to do it today because
we've hit most our targets today. My

5350
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:23,360
we've hit most our targets today. My
 

5351
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,189
we've hit most our targets today. My
ambition today or my thought process

5352
02:04:25,189 --> 02:04:25,199
ambition today or my thought process
 

5353
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:27,430
ambition today or my thought process
today, go back to the very very

5354
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:27,440
today, go back to the very very
 

5355
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:31,510
today, go back to the very very
beginning like 9:15 today uh New York

5356
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:31,520
beginning like 9:15 today uh New York
 

5357
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,589
beginning like 9:15 today uh New York
time 9:15. What did we talk about?

5358
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:33,599
time 9:15. What did we talk about?
 

5359
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:35,350
time 9:15. What did we talk about?
Where's my daily? We talked about

5360
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:35,360
Where's my daily? We talked about
 

5361
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:37,430
Where's my daily? We talked about
probability of having an inside bar.

5362
02:04:37,430 --> 02:04:37,440
probability of having an inside bar.
 

5363
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,189
probability of having an inside bar.
We've looked we've looked underneath.

5364
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:39,199
We've looked we've looked underneath.
 

5365
02:04:39,199 --> 02:04:41,030
We've looked we've looked underneath.
We're coming back to this shelf. Look at

5366
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:41,040
We're coming back to this shelf. Look at
 

5367
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,430
We're coming back to this shelf. Look at
this. We're coming back to this shelf,

5368
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:43,440
this. We're coming back to this shelf,
 

5369
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,430
this. We're coming back to this shelf,
right? Can they lift all the way up

5370
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:45,440
right? Can they lift all the way up
 

5371
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,189
right? Can they lift all the way up
here? I doubt it. I think we're just

5372
02:04:47,189 --> 02:04:47,199
here? I doubt it. I think we're just
 

5373
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:49,669
here? I doubt it. I think we're just
going to sit in here today.

5374
02:04:49,669 --> 02:04:49,679
going to sit in here today.
 

5375
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:51,189
going to sit in here today.
I think ultimately we're going to come

5376
02:04:51,189 --> 02:04:51,199
I think ultimately we're going to come
 

5377
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:53,990
I think ultimately we're going to come
down here. I don't think it's going to

5378
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:54,000
down here. I don't think it's going to
 

5379
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,589
down here. I don't think it's going to
be today. I could be wrong. Could

5380
02:04:55,589 --> 02:04:55,599
be today. I could be wrong. Could
 

5381
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:57,189
be today. I could be wrong. Could
absolutely be wrong. I thought we'd stay

5382
02:04:57,189 --> 02:04:57,199
absolutely be wrong. I thought we'd stay
 

5383
02:04:57,199 --> 02:04:58,470
absolutely be wrong. I thought we'd stay
inside today. We've already gone

5384
02:04:58,470 --> 02:04:58,480
inside today. We've already gone
 

5385
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:00,310
inside today. We've already gone
outside, but we're back in. So, let's

5386
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:00,320
outside, but we're back in. So, let's
 

5387
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,870
outside, but we're back in. So, let's
look below and fail

5388
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:02,880
look below and fail
 

5389
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,870
look below and fail
for now. For now, it's early in the day.

5390
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:04,880
for now. For now, it's early in the day.
 

5391
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:06,390
for now. For now, it's early in the day.
Things can change. How we close today

5392
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:06,400
Things can change. How we close today
 

5393
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,910
Things can change. How we close today
becomes important. Here's the lift,

5394
02:05:07,910 --> 02:05:07,920
becomes important. Here's the lift,
 

5395
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:09,030
becomes important. Here's the lift,
then. All

5396
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:09,040
then. All
 

5397
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,629
then. All
right. So, previous day point of control

5398
02:05:10,629 --> 02:05:10,639
right. So, previous day point of control
 

5399
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:12,310
right. So, previous day point of control
here, current value area high on the day

5400
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:12,320
here, current value area high on the day
 

5401
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,669
here, current value area high on the day
here. So, bulls done a good job of

5402
02:05:13,669 --> 02:05:13,679
here. So, bulls done a good job of
 

5403
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:15,270
here. So, bulls done a good job of
getting up here. If I was a bull, I'd be

5404
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,280
getting up here. If I was a bull, I'd be
 

5405
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:30,070
getting up here. If I was a bull, I'd be
starting to take profits into this area.

5406
02:05:30,070 --> 02:05:30,080

 

5407
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:32,070

Lots of bulls trying to get this move to

5408
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:32,080
Lots of bulls trying to get this move to
 

5409
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:34,310
Lots of bulls trying to get this move to
300. I would be, if I was a bull, I

5410
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:34,320
300. I would be, if I was a bull, I
 

5411
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,910
300. I would be, if I was a bull, I
wouldn't be adding here, but they are

5412
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:35,920
wouldn't be adding here, but they are
 

5413
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,350
wouldn't be adding here, but they are
still trying to add and get this squeeze

5414
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:37,360
still trying to add and get this squeeze
 

5415
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,990
still trying to add and get this squeeze
out. a big buying delta. And if there's

5416
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:40,000
out. a big buying delta. And if there's
 

5417
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,550
out. a big buying delta. And if there's
a passive selling here, well, they'll

5418
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:42,560
a passive selling here, well, they'll
 

5419
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:45,109
a passive selling here, well, they'll
get themselves caught, right? And then

5420
02:05:45,109 --> 02:05:45,119
get themselves caught, right? And then
 

5421
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:46,310
get themselves caught, right? And then
you see starting to get themselves

5422
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:46,320
you see starting to get themselves
 

5423
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:49,589
you see starting to get themselves
caught already into this level.

5424
02:05:49,589 --> 02:05:49,599
caught already into this level.
 

5425
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:51,350
caught already into this level.
Didn't quite make value area high, which

5426
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:51,360
Didn't quite make value area high, which
 

5427
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,669
Didn't quite make value area high, which
is 42. So, previous day point of control

5428
02:05:53,669 --> 02:05:53,679
is 42. So, previous day point of control
 

5429
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:56,790
is 42. So, previous day point of control
was 40. Value area high is 42s. This is

5430
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:56,800
was 40. Value area high is 42s. This is
 

5431
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,229
was 40. Value area high is 42s. This is
what they're trying to get to. This

5432
02:05:58,229 --> 02:05:58,239
what they're trying to get to. This
 

5433
02:05:58,239 --> 02:06:00,229
what they're trying to get to. This
right here,

5434
02:06:00,229 --> 02:06:00,239
right here,
 

5435
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:02,870
right here,
right? This kind of area right here is

5436
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:02,880
right? This kind of area right here is
 

5437
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,629
right? This kind of area right here is
where they're trying to get to. And then

5438
02:06:04,629 --> 02:06:04,639
where they're trying to get to. And then
 

5439
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:07,270
where they're trying to get to. And then
how we act beyond that becomes

5440
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:07,280
how we act beyond that becomes
 

5441
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,950
how we act beyond that becomes
important.

5442
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:08,960
important.
 

5443
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,470
important.
Right? So you can see the rotation now

5444
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:10,480
Right? So you can see the rotation now
 

5445
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,709
Right? So you can see the rotation now
has been developed.

5446
02:06:12,709 --> 02:06:12,719
has been developed.
 

5447
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:14,629
has been developed.
Right? There's value on the day. Someone

5448
02:06:14,629 --> 02:06:14,639
Right? There's value on the day. Someone
 

5449
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:16,790
Right? There's value on the day. Someone
asked when do I pay attention to value?

5450
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:16,800
asked when do I pay attention to value?
 

5451
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:28,870
asked when do I pay attention to value?
Now. Now I'm paying attention to value.

5452
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:28,880

 

5453
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,709

You think we drift up to repric? Yeah. I

5454
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
You think we drift up to repric? Yeah. I
 

5455
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:38,069
You think we drift up to repric? Yeah. I
mean, very good chance even on.

5456
02:06:38,069 --> 02:06:38,079

 

5457
02:06:38,079 --> 02:06:39,750

Sorry, I'm just looking at the hourly.

5458
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:39,760
Sorry, I'm just looking at the hourly.
 

5459
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:43,830
Sorry, I'm just looking at the hourly.
Give me a second.

5460
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:43,840

 

5461
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:46,550

Yeah, I mean three 300s, 305s, even

5462
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:46,560
Yeah, I mean three 300s, 305s, even
 

5463
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,069
Yeah, I mean three 300s, 305s, even
where we broke down from that shelves

5464
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:48,079
where we broke down from that shelves
 

5465
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:50,310
where we broke down from that shelves
320s. It's possible, but you know, it

5466
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:50,320
320s. It's possible, but you know, it
 

5467
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,470
320s. It's possible, but you know, it
gets worse and worse for shorts here.

5468
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:52,480
gets worse and worse for shorts here.
 

5469
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:54,629
gets worse and worse for shorts here.
The more they allow this to lift, the

5470
02:06:54,629 --> 02:06:54,639
The more they allow this to lift, the
 

5471
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:56,870
The more they allow this to lift, the
more it looks like, are we going to do

5472
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:56,880
more it looks like, are we going to do
 

5473
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:01,189
more it looks like, are we going to do
that move we talked about originally?

5474
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:01,199
that move we talked about originally?
 

5475
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:03,990
that move we talked about originally?
Look above. Look below. Is that

5476
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:04,000
Look above. Look below. Is that
 

5477
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,149
Look above. Look below. Is that
possible? Yes. I would say it has to do

5478
02:07:06,149 --> 02:07:06,159
possible? Yes. I would say it has to do
 

5479
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:09,030
possible? Yes. I would say it has to do
this to allow that to be possible. This

5480
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:09,040
this to allow that to be possible. This
 

5481
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:11,589
this to allow that to be possible. This
can still be

5482
02:07:11,589 --> 02:07:11,599
can still be
 

5483
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:13,189
can still be
or at least back into there. Maybe they

5484
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:13,199
or at least back into there. Maybe they
 

5485
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:14,550
or at least back into there. Maybe they
can catch a bid if they fail that back

5486
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:14,560
can catch a bid if they fail that back
 

5487
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:17,270
can catch a bid if they fail that back
down. But I think we just tra we rotate

5488
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:17,280
down. But I think we just tra we rotate
 

5489
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:18,790
down. But I think we just tra we rotate
now for the day. We've done the damage.

5490
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:18,800
now for the day. We've done the damage.
 

5491
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,390
now for the day. We've done the damage.
I think we probably see a rotation.

5492
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:20,400
I think we probably see a rotation.
 

5493
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,910
I think we probably see a rotation.
We've just repriced an old imbalance

5494
02:07:21,910 --> 02:07:21,920
We've just repriced an old imbalance
 

5495
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:31,350
We've just repriced an old imbalance
here up into 55s.

5496
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:31,360

 

5497
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:33,669

So, I'd watch point control now. If they

5498
02:07:33,669 --> 02:07:33,679
So, I'd watch point control now. If they
 

5499
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:36,950
So, I'd watch point control now. If they
start to get heavy underneath that,

5500
02:07:36,950 --> 02:07:36,960
start to get heavy underneath that,
 

5501
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,669
start to get heavy underneath that,
you might see uh this like aggressively

5502
02:07:39,669 --> 02:07:39,679
you might see uh this like aggressively
 

5503
02:07:39,679 --> 02:07:41,350
you might see uh this like aggressively
rotate back and forwards. There's lots

5504
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:41,360
rotate back and forwards. There's lots
 

5505
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:43,109
rotate back and forwards. There's lots
of big buying and lots of being selling

5506
02:07:43,109 --> 02:07:43,119
of big buying and lots of being selling
 

5507
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:45,510
of big buying and lots of being selling
in the last minute up here. So, buyers

5508
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:45,520
in the last minute up here. So, buyers
 

5509
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:48,550
in the last minute up here. So, buyers
right now 35 37 sellers right now 31.

5510
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:48,560
right now 35 37 sellers right now 31.
 

5511
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:49,990
right now 35 37 sellers right now 31.
They're all sort of positioned quite

5512
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:50,000
They're all sort of positioned quite
 

5513
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,990
They're all sort of positioned quite
tight. If we expand through here, we

5514
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,000
tight. If we expand through here, we
 

5515
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,350
tight. If we expand through here, we
kind of get a bit thin up into 70s.

5516
02:07:55,350 --> 02:07:55,360
kind of get a bit thin up into 70s.
 

5517
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,589
kind of get a bit thin up into 70s.
There was a buyer caught offside this

5518
02:07:57,589 --> 02:07:57,599
There was a buyer caught offside this
 

5519
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:16,790
There was a buyer caught offside this
morning at 10 at 9:47 up into 72s.

5520
02:08:16,790 --> 02:08:16,800

 

5521
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,790

Why is Tesla lifting so? It's just a

5522
02:08:18,790 --> 02:08:18,800
Why is Tesla lifting so? It's just a
 

5523
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:21,270
Why is Tesla lifting so? It's just a
technical breakout and people have been

5524
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:21,280
technical breakout and people have been
 

5525
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:23,430
technical breakout and people have been
too short biased on Tesla and not

5526
02:08:23,430 --> 02:08:23,440
too short biased on Tesla and not
 

5527
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,109
too short biased on Tesla and not
trading the technicals. The technicals

5528
02:08:25,109 --> 02:08:25,119
trading the technicals. The technicals
 

5529
02:08:25,119 --> 02:08:27,109
trading the technicals. The technicals
are staying higher. I'm sure there's

5530
02:08:27,109 --> 02:08:27,119
are staying higher. I'm sure there's
 

5531
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:29,510
are staying higher. I'm sure there's
some ridiculous gamma exposure on it for

5532
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:29,520
some ridiculous gamma exposure on it for
 

5533
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:32,310
some ridiculous gamma exposure on it for
OPEX. Remember, it's OPEX this week. I'm

sure there's some ridiculous,

5536
02:08:33,589 --> 02:08:33,599

5537
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:35,350
sure there's some ridiculous,
ridiculous, ridiculous levels it's got

5538
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:35,360
ridiculous, ridiculous levels it's got
 

5539
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:37,669
ridiculous, ridiculous levels it's got
to go and take out to make sure one side

5540
02:08:37,669 --> 02:08:37,679
to go and take out to make sure one side
 

5541
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:46,709
to go and take out to make sure one side
loses.

5542
02:08:46,709 --> 02:08:46,719

 

5543
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:52,470

No worries, mate.

5544
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:52,480

 

5545
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:55,270

So, into this red box.

5546
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,280
So, into this red box.
 

5547
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,950
So, into this red box.
Can they get over this red box? This

5548
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:56,960
Can they get over this red box? This
 

5549
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:59,430
Can they get over this red box? This
previous day point control. So, this is

5550
02:08:59,430 --> 02:08:59,440
previous day point control. So, this is
 

5551
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,830
previous day point control. So, this is
fair value from Friday. We're now

5552
02:09:01,830 --> 02:09:01,840
fair value from Friday. We're now
 

5553
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:08,550
fair value from Friday. We're now
trading at fair value from Friday.

5554
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:08,560

 

5555
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:11,669

And if they lift through here,

5556
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:11,679
And if they lift through here,
 

5557
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:13,430
And if they lift through here,
can't rule out all the way up back up to

5558
02:09:13,430 --> 02:09:13,440
can't rule out all the way up back up to
 

5559
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:14,950
can't rule out all the way up back up to
there. Cannot rule it out for a range

5560
02:09:14,950 --> 02:09:14,960
there. Cannot rule it out for a range
 

5561
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:18,470
there. Cannot rule it out for a range
rotation day. It's possible.

5562
02:09:18,470 --> 02:09:18,480
rotation day. It's possible.
 

5563
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:20,629
rotation day. It's possible.
It's possible. Not guaranteed because we

5564
02:09:20,629 --> 02:09:20,639
It's possible. Not guaranteed because we
 

5565
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:23,030
It's possible. Not guaranteed because we
can also fail back under here. Rotate

5566
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:23,040
can also fail back under here. Rotate
 

5567
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:27,109
can also fail back under here. Rotate
right back down. I have no no real bias

5568
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:27,119
right back down. I have no no real bias
 

5569
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:28,709
right back down. I have no no real bias
at this point. We've done the damage. I

5570
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:28,719
at this point. We've done the damage. I
 

5571
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:33,430
at this point. We've done the damage. I
would say the big damage has been done.

5572
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:33,440

 

5573
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,669

I would like to see them get stuck, but

5574
02:09:35,669 --> 02:09:35,679
I would like to see them get stuck, but
 

5575
02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:38,390
I would like to see them get stuck, but
uh we see we did definitely catch some

5576
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:38,400
uh we see we did definitely catch some
 

5577
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:45,669
uh we see we did definitely catch some
buyers up here.

5578
02:09:45,669 --> 02:09:45,679

 

5579
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:51,109

Sort of above 40.

5580
02:09:51,109 --> 02:09:51,119

 

5581
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:53,430

If BW holds her, I think we can hit a

5582
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:53,440
If BW holds her, I think we can hit a
 

5583
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:57,589
If BW holds her, I think we can hit a
new high of day.

5584
02:09:57,589 --> 02:09:57,599

 

5585
02:09:57,599 --> 02:09:59,430

I think it's asking a lot to go for a

5586
02:09:59,430 --> 02:09:59,440
I think it's asking a lot to go for a

high of day.

5588
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:01,520
high of day.
 

5589
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:03,430
high of day.

I think you'll probably see it like
stall out soon.

5592
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:06,880
stall out soon.
 

5593
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,709
stall out soon.
I think this is a multi-legg pushup. I

is something like this and then just
like sort of this for the day. I

5600
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:13,840
like sort of this for the day. I

leash and just watching her run around.
 

5827
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:51,030
leash and just watching her run around.
So, so nice.

5828
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:51,040
So, so nice.
 

5829
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,189
So, so nice.
We don't deserve them. Honestly, we

5830
02:15:53,189 --> 02:15:53,199
We don't deserve them. Honestly, we
 

5831
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:55,990
We don't deserve them. Honestly, we
don't deserve them. Best creatures ever.

5832
02:15:55,990 --> 02:15:56,000
don't deserve them. Best creatures ever.
 

5833
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,189
don't deserve them. Best creatures ever.
Okay. Drift higher in effect.

5834
02:15:59,189 --> 02:15:59,199
Okay. Drift higher in effect.
 

5835
02:15:59,199 --> 02:16:00,950
Okay. Drift higher in effect.
How do you make it smaller? Uh, it' be

5836
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:00,960
How do you make it smaller? Uh, it' be
 

5837
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:03,350
How do you make it smaller? Uh, it' be
in your row size.

5838
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:03,360
in your row size.
 

5839
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:07,030
in your row size.
Uh, it' be here. So, I'd either go tick

5840
02:16:07,030 --> 02:16:07,040
Uh, it' be here. So, I'd either go tick
 

5841
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,270
Uh, it' be here. So, I'd either go tick
ticks per row I'd do to two or if you do

5842
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:09,280
ticks per row I'd do to two or if you do
 

5843
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:10,870
ticks per row I'd do to two or if you do
number rows I'd do it to a thousand.

5844
02:16:10,870 --> 02:16:10,880
number rows I'd do it to a thousand.
 

5845
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:14,709
number rows I'd do it to a thousand.
It's up to you how you do it.

5846
02:16:14,709 --> 02:16:14,719
It's up to you how you do it.
 

5847
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:16,390
It's up to you how you do it.
But the reason I've been doing two is

5848
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:16,400
But the reason I've been doing two is
 

5849
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:17,830
But the reason I've been doing two is
because I have my footprint set to the

5850
02:16:17,830 --> 02:16:17,840
because I have my footprint set to the
 

5851
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:22,310
because I have my footprint set to the
same thing.

5852
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:22,320

 

5853
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:23,990

Okay, some buyers potentially getting

5854
02:16:23,990 --> 02:16:24,000
Okay, some buyers potentially getting
 

5855
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,510
Okay, some buyers potentially getting
stuck here. You might see a wash coming

5856
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:25,520
stuck here. You might see a wash coming
 

5857
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:29,030
stuck here. You might see a wash coming
in here. Can they take control? So, a

5858
02:16:29,030 --> 02:16:29,040
in here. Can they take control? So, a
 

5859
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,510
in here. Can they take control? So, a
look above value and fail. Previous day

5860
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:31,520
look above value and fail. Previous day
 

5861
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:33,349
look above value and fail. Previous day
point, this area here is the contested

5862
02:16:33,349 --> 02:16:33,359
point, this area here is the contested
 

5863
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:36,389
point, this area here is the contested
area. I like how we act here becomes

5864
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:36,399
area. I like how we act here becomes
 

5865
02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:38,070
area. I like how we act here becomes
key. Are they going to keep drifting? In

5866
02:16:38,070 --> 02:16:38,080
key. Are they going to keep drifting? In
 

5867
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:39,349
key. Are they going to keep drifting? In
which case, there's no short. If they

5868
02:16:39,349 --> 02:16:39,359
which case, there's no short. If they
 

5869
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:41,190
which case, there's no short. If they
get stuck here, I think there's a short

5870
02:16:41,190 --> 02:16:41,200
get stuck here, I think there's a short
 

5871
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:42,790
get stuck here, I think there's a short
down to 200. So, I think there's a

5872
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:42,800
down to 200. So, I think there's a
 

5873
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:44,389
down to 200. So, I think there's a
potential. Well, it's only 30 points,

5874
02:16:44,389 --> 02:16:44,399
potential. Well, it's only 30 points,
 

5875
02:16:44,399 --> 02:16:47,429
potential. Well, it's only 30 points,
but if they get stuck, it's potential.

5876
02:16:47,429 --> 02:16:47,439
but if they get stuck, it's potential.
 

5877
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:49,830
but if they get stuck, it's potential.
If they hold this, they can drift. Even

5878
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:49,840
If they hold this, they can drift. Even
 

5879
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:51,509
If they hold this, they can drift. Even
if they come back down here, they can

5880
02:16:51,509 --> 02:16:51,519
if they come back down here, they can
 

5881
02:16:51,519 --> 02:16:53,429
if they come back down here, they can
still do this later. But they're

5882
02:16:53,429 --> 02:16:53,439
still do this later. But they're
 

5883
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:55,030
still do this later. But they're
building this right now. I would imagine

5884
02:16:55,030 --> 02:16:55,040
building this right now. I would imagine
 

5885
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:56,230
building this right now. I would imagine
they're going to wash them at some

5886
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:56,240
they're going to wash them at some
 

5887
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:57,990
they're going to wash them at some
point. We got to wait for them to let go

5888
02:16:57,990 --> 02:16:58,000
point. We got to wait for them to let go
 

5889
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,790
point. We got to wait for them to let go
of 30. I don't like how we've built out

5890
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:00,800
of 30. I don't like how we've built out
 

5891
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,589
of 30. I don't like how we've built out
two nodes here instead of one. Never

5892
02:17:03,589 --> 02:17:03,599
two nodes here instead of one. Never
 

5893
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:06,790
two nodes here instead of one. Never
like seeing that.

5894
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:06,800
like seeing that.
 

5895
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:13,030
like seeing that.
That's gross.

5896
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:13,040

 

5897
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:15,110

Yeah. Yeah. Uh it's not an indicator.

5898
02:17:15,110 --> 02:17:15,120
Yeah. Yeah. Uh it's not an indicator.
 

5899
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:19,030
Yeah. Yeah. Uh it's not an indicator.
It's just a tool. Um it is in is it this

5900
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:19,040
It's just a tool. Um it is in is it this
 

5901
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,750
It's just a tool. Um it is in is it this
one? No, this one. Yeah. So if you go to

5902
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:21,760
one? No, this one. Yeah. So if you go to
 

5903
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,790
one? No, this one. Yeah. So if you go to
projections. So 1 2 3 four fifth one

5904
02:17:24,790 --> 02:17:24,800
projections. So 1 2 3 four fifth one
 

5905
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:27,429
projections. So 1 2 3 four fifth one
down projections and then volume base

5906
02:17:27,429 --> 02:17:27,439
down projections and then volume base
 

5907
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:28,709
down projections and then volume base
and you'll see anchored view up. Here's

5908
02:17:28,709 --> 02:17:28,719
and you'll see anchored view up. Here's
 

5909
02:17:28,719 --> 02:17:30,309
and you'll see anchored view up. Here's
the sell guys. This is we're getting

5910
02:17:30,309 --> 02:17:30,319
the sell guys. This is we're getting
 

5911
02:17:30,319 --> 02:17:32,309
the sell guys. This is we're getting
into an interesting area here. How they

5912
02:17:32,309 --> 02:17:32,319
into an interesting area here. How they
 

5913
02:17:32,319 --> 02:17:33,910
into an interesting area here. How they
act here like I talked about will become

5914
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:33,920
act here like I talked about will become
 

5915
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,349
act here like I talked about will become
important. Right? Buyers will want to

5916
02:17:35,349 --> 02:17:35,359
important. Right? Buyers will want to
 

5917
02:17:35,359 --> 02:17:36,870
important. Right? Buyers will want to
defend this. If they can't defend it, I

5918
02:17:36,870 --> 02:17:36,880
defend this. If they can't defend it, I
 

5919
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:38,870
defend this. If they can't defend it, I
think there's potentially a wash down

5920
02:17:38,870 --> 02:17:38,880
think there's potentially a wash down
 

5921
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:40,870
think there's potentially a wash down
into sort of 200. So, I'm watching this

5922
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:40,880
into sort of 200. So, I'm watching this
 

5923
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:48,709
into sort of 200. So, I'm watching this
area here.

5924
02:17:48,709 --> 02:17:48,719

 

5925
02:17:48,719 --> 02:17:50,469

Which indicator you using to show your

5926
02:17:50,469 --> 02:17:50,479
Which indicator you using to show your
 

5927
02:17:50,479 --> 02:17:52,150
Which indicator you using to show your
breakout high and lows? What you mean

5928
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,160
breakout high and lows? What you mean
 

5929
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:53,669
breakout high and lows? What you mean
breakout high and lows? I don't know

5930
02:17:53,669 --> 02:17:53,679
breakout high and lows? I don't know
 

5931
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:56,230
breakout high and lows? I don't know
what you're talking about. Sorry, mate.

5932
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:56,240
what you're talking about. Sorry, mate.
 

5933
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:57,750
what you're talking about. Sorry, mate.
Let me know what you mean and and I'll

5934
02:17:57,750 --> 02:17:57,760
Let me know what you mean and and I'll
 

5935
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,270
Let me know what you mean and and I'll
try and explain. I'm not sure what you

5936
02:17:59,270 --> 02:17:59,280
try and explain. I'm not sure what you
 

5937
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:00,950
try and explain. I'm not sure what you
mean. I'm sorry. I've misunderstood

5938
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:00,960
mean. I'm sorry. I've misunderstood
 

5939
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:04,150
mean. I'm sorry. I've misunderstood
that. Back into the little ledge here.

5940
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:04,160
that. Back into the little ledge here.
 

5941
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,990
that. Back into the little ledge here.
If they start letting go of this, I'm

5942
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:06,000
If they start letting go of this, I'm
 

5943
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,549
If they start letting go of this, I'm
interested in a breakdown sell all the

5944
02:18:08,549 --> 02:18:08,559
interested in a breakdown sell all the
 

5945
02:18:08,559 --> 02:18:12,629
interested in a breakdown sell all the
way back down into 196 here.

5946
02:18:12,629 --> 02:18:12,639
way back down into 196 here.
 

5947
02:18:12,639 --> 02:18:13,990
way back down into 196 here.
We're just testing the edge of this

5948
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,000
We're just testing the edge of this
 

5949
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,589
We're just testing the edge of this
little range we just talked about. They

5950
02:18:15,589 --> 02:18:15,599
little range we just talked about. They
 

5951
02:18:15,599 --> 02:18:16,950
little range we just talked about. They
would need to leave this range, which

5952
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:16,960
would need to leave this range, which
 

5953
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,629
would need to leave this range, which
they are now starting to try and do.

5954
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:18,639
they are now starting to try and do.
 

5955
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:20,549
they are now starting to try and do.
Back to volume point control on the day

5956
02:18:20,549 --> 02:18:20,559
Back to volume point control on the day
 

5957
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:24,389
Back to volume point control on the day
here.

5958
02:18:24,389 --> 02:18:24,399

 

5959
02:18:24,399 --> 02:18:26,150

So, we're going to try and find dips.

5960
02:18:26,150 --> 02:18:26,160
So, we're going to try and find dips.
 

5961
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,990
So, we're going to try and find dips.
Are we at 22s? I don't think so. Don't

5962
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:28,000
Are we at 22s? I don't think so. Don't
 

5963
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,910
Are we at 22s? I don't think so. Don't
think you are. I think you're probably

5964
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:29,920
think you are. I think you're probably
 

5965
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,349
think you are. I think you're probably
going to get yourself caught here, Mr.

5966
02:18:31,349 --> 02:18:31,359
going to get yourself caught here, Mr.
 

5967
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:33,830
going to get yourself caught here, Mr.
Buyer. Here you go. See you later. I'm

5968
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:33,840
Buyer. Here you go. See you later. I'm
 

5969
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:35,669
Buyer. Here you go. See you later. I'm
in this. Can we get follow through? I

5970
02:18:35,669 --> 02:18:35,679
in this. Can we get follow through? I
 

5971
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:38,389
in this. Can we get follow through? I
want to see continuation under 22s.

5972
02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:38,399
want to see continuation under 22s.
 

5973
02:18:38,399 --> 02:18:42,709
want to see continuation under 22s.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

5974
02:18:42,709 --> 02:18:42,719
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
 

5975
02:18:42,719 --> 02:18:45,110
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Thank you. Covered a little bit there on

5976
02:18:45,110 --> 02:18:45,120
Thank you. Covered a little bit there on
 

5977
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:46,389
Thank you. Covered a little bit there on
that last little wash. There's a buyer

5978
02:18:46,389 --> 02:18:46,399
that last little wash. There's a buyer
 

5979
02:18:46,399 --> 02:18:47,990
that last little wash. There's a buyer
trying to step in here. Seller getting

5980
02:18:47,990 --> 02:18:48,000
trying to step in here. Seller getting
 

5981
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:49,910
trying to step in here. Seller getting
himself caught there. I think we can

5982
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:49,920
himself caught there. I think we can
 

5983
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,589
himself caught there. I think we can
wash down into this shelf. I'm just

5984
02:18:51,589 --> 02:18:51,599
wash down into this shelf. I'm just
 

5985
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:53,990
wash down into this shelf. I'm just
careful because we're at PDC. So, I'm

5986
02:18:53,990 --> 02:18:54,000
careful because we're at PDC. So, I'm
 

5987
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,309
careful because we're at PDC. So, I'm
short from here. Covered some into here.

5988
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:56,319
short from here. Covered some into here.
 

5989
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:57,830
short from here. Covered some into here.
I want to see if we can get down into

5990
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:57,840
I want to see if we can get down into
 

5991
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:59,589
I want to see if we can get down into
this guy here. Like I talked about

5992
02:18:59,589 --> 02:18:59,599
this guy here. Like I talked about
 

5993
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:01,030
this guy here. Like I talked about
again, I gave you this beforehand. Once

5994
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:01,040
again, I gave you this beforehand. Once
 

5995
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:03,990
again, I gave you this beforehand. Once
we leave this, I think we can retrace

5996
02:19:03,990 --> 02:19:04,000
we leave this, I think we can retrace
 

5997
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,709
we leave this, I think we can retrace
back into here. Here we go. Cover a bit

5998
02:19:06,709 --> 02:19:06,719
back into here. Here we go. Cover a bit
 

5999
02:19:06,719 --> 02:19:08,150
back into here. Here we go. Cover a bit
more here because they're getting a bit

6000
02:19:08,150 --> 02:19:08,160
more here because they're getting a bit
 

6001
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:10,230
more here because they're getting a bit
aggressive here for my liking. Come on,

6002
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:10,240
aggressive here for my liking. Come on,
 

6003
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:13,669
aggressive here for my liking. Come on,
baby.

6004
02:19:13,669 --> 02:19:13,679

 

6005
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:15,910

Finally. At least I got something today,

6006
02:19:15,910 --> 02:19:15,920
Finally. At least I got something today,
 

6007
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:17,990
Finally. At least I got something today,
[\h__\h]

6008
02:19:17,990 --> 02:19:18,000
[\h__\h]
 

6009
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,070
[\h__\h]
Pardon my French. Okay, so we're

6010
02:19:20,070 --> 02:19:20,080
Pardon my French. Okay, so we're
 

6011
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:22,230
Pardon my French. Okay, so we're
watching this node here. I don't really

6012
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:22,240
watching this node here. I don't really
 

6013
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,150
watching this node here. I don't really
expect it to sell beneath beneath this

6014
02:19:24,150 --> 02:19:24,160
expect it to sell beneath beneath this
 

6015
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:25,750
expect it to sell beneath beneath this
level. So, I've taken a big chunk off

6016
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:25,760
level. So, I've taken a big chunk off
 

6017
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:27,270
level. So, I've taken a big chunk off
because I'm playing this pullback. I

6018
02:19:27,270 --> 02:19:27,280
because I'm playing this pullback. I
 

6019
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:29,429
because I'm playing this pullback. I
don't know if buyers step back in here.

6020
02:19:29,429 --> 02:19:29,439
don't know if buyers step back in here.
 

6021
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:31,110
don't know if buyers step back in here.
So, like we talked about, once we see

6022
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,120
So, like we talked about, once we see
 

6023
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:33,990
So, like we talked about, once we see
this, I'm trying to play the pro trend.

6024
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:34,000
this, I'm trying to play the pro trend.
 

6025
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,230
this, I'm trying to play the pro trend.
I don't know if if they do this, I can

6026
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:36,240
I don't know if if they do this, I can
 

6027
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:39,030
I don't know if if they do this, I can
add back in, but I'm protecting

6028
02:19:39,030 --> 02:19:39,040
add back in, but I'm protecting
 

6029
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:40,950
add back in, but I'm protecting
liquidity that we built air or I'm

6030
02:19:40,950 --> 02:19:40,960
liquidity that we built air or I'm
 

6031
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:42,870
liquidity that we built air or I'm
protecting myself against liquidity we

6032
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:42,880
protecting myself against liquidity we
 

6033
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:45,110
protecting myself against liquidity we
built earlier because maybe like we

6034
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:45,120
built earlier because maybe like we
 

6035
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:48,950
built earlier because maybe like we
talked about, they do this, this wash,

6036
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:48,960
talked about, they do this, this wash,
 

6037
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:50,790
talked about, they do this, this wash,
reclaim this, and go higher. I don't

6038
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:50,800
reclaim this, and go higher. I don't
 

6039
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,870
reclaim this, and go higher. I don't
know. I know both are possible. So, I'm

6040
02:19:52,870 --> 02:19:52,880
know. I know both are possible. So, I'm
 

6041
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:54,950
know. I know both are possible. So, I'm
positioned and I'm paying myself. Here

6042
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:54,960
positioned and I'm paying myself. Here
 

6043
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:57,190
positioned and I'm paying myself. Here
we go.

6044
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:57,200
we go.
 

6045
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,110
we go.
There's an imbalance here into 200. Here

6046
02:19:59,110 --> 02:19:59,120
There's an imbalance here into 200. Here
 

6047
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,230
There's an imbalance here into 200. Here
we go. Here we go. I don't want to see

6048
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:00,240
we go. Here we go. I don't want to see
 

6049
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:02,070
we go. Here we go. I don't want to see
them defend this. We're going to get

6050
02:20:02,070 --> 02:20:02,080
them defend this. We're going to get
 

6051
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:03,910
them defend this. We're going to get
continuation. We've got to stay heavy

6052
02:20:03,910 --> 02:20:03,920
continuation. We've got to stay heavy
 

6053
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:09,270
continuation. We've got to stay heavy
under this.

6054
02:20:09,270 --> 02:20:09,280

 

6055
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:11,670

This is the shelf. I've taken most of my

6056
02:20:11,670 --> 02:20:11,680
This is the shelf. I've taken most of my
 

6057
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:15,030
This is the shelf. I've taken most of my
position off now, folks.

6058
02:20:15,030 --> 02:20:15,040
position off now, folks.
 

6059
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:17,349
position off now, folks.
I don't know if they defend it. And if I

6060
02:20:17,349 --> 02:20:17,359
I don't know if they defend it. And if I
 

6061
02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:19,110
I don't know if they defend it. And if I
if I was a bull and I was going to take

6062
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:19,120
if I was a bull and I was going to take
 

6063
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:21,270
if I was a bull and I was going to take
us back to previous day value high, I'd

6064
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:21,280
us back to previous day value high, I'd
 

6065
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:22,630
us back to previous day value high, I'd
want to defend this level. So, I'm going

6066
02:20:22,630 --> 02:20:22,640
want to defend this level. So, I'm going
 

6067
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:26,070
want to defend this level. So, I'm going
to respect them. Delta sellside delta is

6068
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:26,080
to respect them. Delta sellside delta is
 

6069
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:28,870
to respect them. Delta sellside delta is
down at 84. into here would be amazing.

6070
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:28,880
down at 84. into here would be amazing.
 

6071
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:31,990
down at 84. into here would be amazing.
Here's 94s. Can we get to 84s? Can we

6072
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:32,000
Here's 94s. Can we get to 84s? Can we
 

6073
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,750
Here's 94s. Can we get to 84s? Can we
get to 84s?

6074
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:33,760

Eyes are trying and failing right now.

6078
02:20:44,950 --> 02:20:44,960
Eyes are trying and failing right now.

02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:17,030

These lot up here are just playing games

6096
02:21:17,030 --> 02:21:17,040
These lot up here are just playing games
 

6097

These lot up here are just playing games

6098
02:21:23,429 --> 02:21:23,439

 

6099
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:26,469

Come on. You feel me? At 84s. If we come

Come on. You feel me? At 84s. If we come
 

6101
02:21:26,479 --> 02:21:31,510
Come on. You feel me? At 84s. If we come
84s now, I think we wash harder. So,

There's delta right there. That's why

6108
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:37,920
There's delta right there. That's why
 

6109
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:39,750
There's delta right there. That's why
we're Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Tiny tiny tiny

All right. But this was the main trade.

6114
02:21:44,070 --> 02:21:44,080
All right. But this was the main trade.
 

6115
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:45,349
All right. But this was the main trade.
Well, the main trade. The trade I

02:21:45,349 --> 02:21:45,359
Well, the main trade. The trade I
 

6117
02:21:45,359 --> 02:21:47,190
Well, the main trade. The trade I
played. Once we leave this volume, we

6118
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:47,200
played. Once we leave this volume, we
 

6119
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:48,870
played. Once we leave this volume, we
leave these guys trapped. If you rewind,

6120
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:48,880
leave these guys trapped. If you rewind,
 

6121
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:50,309
leave these guys trapped. If you rewind,
we talked about this. This is just like

6122
02:21:50,309 --> 02:21:50,319
we talked about this. This is just like
 

6123
02:21:50,319 --> 02:21:52,309
we talked about this. This is just like
Friday, folks. Right. We built this

6124
02:21:52,309 --> 02:21:52,319
Friday, folks. Right. We built this
 

6125
02:21:52,319 --> 02:21:54,389
Friday, folks. Right. We built this
liquidity. These balls are now trapped.

6126
02:21:54,389 --> 02:21:54,399
liquidity. These balls are now trapped.
 

6127
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:55,830
liquidity. These balls are now trapped.
We're coming back down into this shelf.

6128
02:21:55,830 --> 02:21:55,840
We're coming back down into this shelf.
 

6129
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,429
We're coming back down into this shelf.
Bulls might defend this. So I'm down to

6130
02:21:57,429 --> 02:21:57,439
Bulls might defend this. So I'm down to
 

6131
02:21:57,439 --> 02:21:59,990
Bulls might defend this. So I'm down to
like tiny size. How we act here? Like if

6132
02:21:59,990 --> 02:22:00,000
like tiny size. How we act here? Like if
 

6133
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,070
like tiny size. How we act here? Like if
we reject this and do this, then we can

6134
02:22:02,070 --> 02:22:02,080
we reject this and do this, then we can
 

6135
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:03,830
we reject this and do this, then we can
add back on any reclaim of this. Then

6136
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:03,840
add back on any reclaim of this. Then
 

6137
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:05,190
add back on any reclaim of this. Then
there's no more shorts for the day. All

6138
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:05,200
there's no more shorts for the day. All
 

6139
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:08,389
there's no more shorts for the day. All
right. So this is why I think I forgot

6140
02:22:08,389 --> 02:22:08,399
right. So this is why I think I forgot
 

6141
02:22:08,399 --> 02:22:10,550
right. So this is why I think I forgot
his name. Was it Jonathan Johnny? I

6142
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:10,560
his name. Was it Jonathan Johnny? I
 

6143
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:12,070
his name. Was it Jonathan Johnny? I
think we were in alignment. We ignore

6144
02:22:12,070 --> 02:22:12,080
think we were in alignment. We ignore
 

6145
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:14,870
think we were in alignment. We ignore
this and you know I wait to see this

6146
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:14,880
this and you know I wait to see this
 

6147
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:17,429
this and you know I wait to see this
pattern here. Previous day point control

6148
02:22:17,429 --> 02:22:17,439
pattern here. Previous day point control
 

6149
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:19,670
pattern here. Previous day point control
value area high. We played back inside.

6150
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:19,680
value area high. We played back inside.
 

6151
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,270
value area high. We played back inside.
This is point control. We cover some

6152
02:22:21,270 --> 02:22:21,280
This is point control. We cover some
 

6153
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:23,670
This is point control. We cover some
well most of it here. Um we see if we

6154
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:23,680
well most of it here. Um we see if we
 

6155
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:25,670
well most of it here. Um we see if we
respect this. If bulls respect that then

6156
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:25,680
respect this. If bulls respect that then
 

6157
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:27,270
respect this. If bulls respect that then
I'm done with shorts. If we sell through

6158
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:27,280
I'm done with shorts. If we sell through
 

6159
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:29,349
I'm done with shorts. If we sell through
this then we do have potential

6160
02:22:29,349 --> 02:22:29,359
this then we do have potential
 

6161
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:35,830
this then we do have potential
continuation down into these 930s.

6162
02:22:35,830 --> 02:22:35,840

 

6163
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:39,270

Really good. Really good.

6164
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:39,280
Really good. Really good.
 

6165
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:41,110
Really good. Really good.
So the next level I'm watching 170. I

6166
02:22:41,110 --> 02:22:41,120
So the next level I'm watching 170. I
 

6167
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:42,550
So the next level I'm watching 170. I
haven't got enough size to cover anymore

6168
02:22:42,550 --> 02:22:42,560
haven't got enough size to cover anymore
 

6169
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:44,150
haven't got enough size to cover anymore
now. So we just have to wait and see if

6170
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,160
now. So we just have to wait and see if
 

6171
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,990
now. So we just have to wait and see if
we keep watching and just move stop down

6172
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:46,000
we keep watching and just move stop down
 

6173
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,790
we keep watching and just move stop down
with it.

6174
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:48,800
with it.
 

6175
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:51,270
with it.
Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.

6176
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:51,280
Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
 

6177
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:54,870
Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Beautiful.

6178
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:54,880

 

6179
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:58,070

Beautiful.

6180
02:22:58,070 --> 02:22:58,080

 

6181
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:00,309

Let's go.

6182
02:23:00,309 --> 02:23:00,319
Let's go.
 

6183
02:23:00,319 --> 02:23:01,910
Let's go.
Okay. Cover point here. I would say if

6184
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:01,920
Okay. Cover point here. I would say if
 

6185
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:05,750
Okay. Cover point here. I would say if
you haven't taken any yet,

6186
02:23:05,750 --> 02:23:05,760

 

6187
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,830

if bulls don't defend this, then we're

6188
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:07,840
if bulls don't defend this, then we're
 

6189
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:09,349
if bulls don't defend this, then we're
not back inside yesterday's range and we

6190
02:23:09,349 --> 02:23:09,359
not back inside yesterday's range and we
 

6191
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:12,870
not back inside yesterday's range and we
can look for expansion again.

6192
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:12,880
can look for expansion again.
 

6193
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:14,630
can look for expansion again.
I'd be majority out here. We can always

6194
02:23:14,630 --> 02:23:14,640
I'd be majority out here. We can always
 

6195
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:16,150
I'd be majority out here. We can always
read adding back in, right? Can always

6196
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,160
read adding back in, right? Can always
 

6197
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:32,150
read adding back in, right? Can always
add back in if it confirms.

6198
02:23:32,150 --> 02:23:32,160

 

6199
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:33,590

uh watching bookmap here. This was the

6200
02:23:33,590 --> 02:23:33,600
uh watching bookmap here. This was the
 

6201
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,030
uh watching bookmap here. This was the
level I've got that white line. This is

6202
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:35,040
level I've got that white line. This is
 

6203
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,630
level I've got that white line. This is
where they got trapped earlier. Okay.

6204
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:36,640
where they got trapped earlier. Okay.
 

6205
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:38,389
where they got trapped earlier. Okay.
So, just be aware of this. Remember, we

6206
02:23:38,389 --> 02:23:38,399
So, just be aware of this. Remember, we
 

6207
02:23:38,399 --> 02:23:39,750
So, just be aware of this. Remember, we
talked about this earlier. All sellers

6208
02:23:39,750 --> 02:23:39,760
talked about this earlier. All sellers
 

6209
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:42,150
talked about this earlier. All sellers
are caught under here. So, I would say

6210
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:42,160
are caught under here. So, I would say
 

6211
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:44,630
are caught under here. So, I would say
you want to be majority out here because

6212
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:44,640
you want to be majority out here because
 

6213
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,630
you want to be majority out here because
we know underneath this horizontal line

6214
02:23:46,630 --> 02:23:46,640
we know underneath this horizontal line
 

6215
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:48,309
we know underneath this horizontal line
I gave you earlier is where all the

6216
02:23:48,309 --> 02:23:48,319
I gave you earlier is where all the
 

6217
02:23:48,319 --> 02:23:49,910
I gave you earlier is where all the
sellers got caught. All right, so they

6218
02:23:49,910 --> 02:23:49,920
sellers got caught. All right, so they
 

6219
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:51,910
sellers got caught. All right, so they
might well defend this line here. We

6220
02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:51,920
might well defend this line here. We
 

6221
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:54,150
might well defend this line here. We
don't know. All right, we can only do

6222
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:54,160
don't know. All right, we can only do
 

6223
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:56,309
don't know. All right, we can only do
what we see on the chart. We don't know

6224
02:23:56,309 --> 02:23:56,319
what we see on the chart. We don't know
 

6225
02:23:56,319 --> 02:23:57,750
what we see on the chart. We don't know
if they're going to be able to defend

6226
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:57,760
if they're going to be able to defend
 

6227
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:59,349
if they're going to be able to defend
this, but what I would say is I would

6228
02:23:59,349 --> 02:23:59,359
this, but what I would say is I would
 

6229
02:23:59,359 --> 02:24:01,030
this, but what I would say is I would
not be a new money short under this

6230
02:24:01,030 --> 02:24:01,040
not be a new money short under this
 

6231
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:07,670
not be a new money short under this
level. I'd be covering into this level.

6232
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:07,680

 

6233
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,110

And hopefully some of you have caught

6234
02:24:09,110 --> 02:24:09,120
And hopefully some of you have caught
 

6235
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:10,950
And hopefully some of you have caught
this with me. I'm down. I haven't got

6236
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:10,960
this with me. I'm down. I haven't got
 

6237
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:18,070
this with me. I'm down. I haven't got
enough sides on here to do any damage.

6238
02:24:18,070 --> 02:24:18,080

 

6239
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:19,510

I want to see this flush now. Otherwise,

6240
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,520
I want to see this flush now. Otherwise,
 

6241
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:23,990
I want to see this flush now. Otherwise,
I'm going to take it off.

6242
02:24:23,990 --> 02:24:24,000

 

6243
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,510

You got to give me a reflush. Otherwise,

6244
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:25,520
You got to give me a reflush. Otherwise,
 

6245
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:28,469
You got to give me a reflush. Otherwise,
I'm covering all here.

6246
02:24:28,469 --> 02:24:28,479
I'm covering all here.
 

6247
02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:30,389
I'm covering all here.
Don't want it to print back above 57.

6248
02:24:30,389 --> 02:24:30,399
Don't want it to print back above 57.
 

6249
02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:31,510
Don't want it to print back above 57.
That's where they just tried to sell

6250
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:31,520
That's where they just tried to sell
 

6251
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:32,790
That's where they just tried to sell
that last candle. If they print back

6252
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:32,800
that last candle. If they print back
 

6253
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:35,670
that last candle. If they print back
above 57, I'm just going to cut it all.

6254
02:24:35,670 --> 02:24:35,680
above 57, I'm just going to cut it all.
 

6255
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:37,830
above 57, I'm just going to cut it all.
Yeah, I'm out. Out there. I can always

6256
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:37,840
Yeah, I'm out. Out there. I can always

02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:39,910
Yeah, I'm out. Out there. I can always
jump back in.

6258
02:24:39,910 --> 02:24:39,920
jump back in.
 

6259
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:42,150
jump back in.
So, a smaller trade, but a decent trade.

6260
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:42,160
So, a smaller trade, but a decent trade.
 

6261
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:47,349
So, a smaller trade, but a decent trade.
Decent trade that

6262
02:24:47,349 --> 02:24:47,359

 

6263
02:24:47,359 --> 02:24:50,550

short bias until it proves otherwise to

6268
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:55,520
short bias until it proves otherwise to
 

6269
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:58,070
short bias until it proves otherwise to
me.

6270
02:24:58,070 --> 02:24:58,080
me.
 

6271
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:00,630
me.

probably two two bangers short side
 

6279
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:09,190
probably two two bangers short side
today. Okay, I gave you the long if you

really really wanted it, but like I
talked about, I I don't like those

6284
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:13,120
talked about, I I don't like those
 

6285
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,030
talked about, I I don't like those
longs. I think they're very risky. Much

6286
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:15,040
longs. I think they're very risky. Much
 

6287
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:17,590
longs. I think they're very risky. Much
easier to stay protrend. All right, much

6288
02:25:17,590 --> 02:25:17,600
easier to stay protrend. All right, much
 

6289
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:19,670
easier to stay protrend. All right, much
easier to trade this, isn't it? When we

6290
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:19,680
easier to trade this, isn't it? When we
 

6291
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,670
easier to trade this, isn't it? When we
trap volume into the key level, there's

6292
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:21,680
trap volume into the key level, there's
 

6293
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:23,349
trap volume into the key level, there's
the red box. There's your lower time

6294
02:25:23,349 --> 02:25:23,359
the red box. There's your lower time
 

6295
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:25,270
the red box. There's your lower time
frame algo. All right, Mr. lower time

6296
02:25:25,270 --> 02:25:25,280
frame algo. All right, Mr. lower time
 

6297
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:27,270
frame algo. All right, Mr. lower time
frame algo. There's all the buyers being

6298
02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:27,280
frame algo. There's all the buyers being
 

6299
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:28,870
frame algo. There's all the buyers being
like, we're going to go back to highs.

6300
02:25:28,870 --> 02:25:28,880
like, we're going to go back to highs.
 

6301
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:31,110
like, we're going to go back to highs.
And there's me going, [\h__\h] you. All

6302
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:31,120
And there's me going, [\h__\h] you. All
 

6303
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:33,429
And there's me going, [\h__\h] you. All
right, so just play what's in front of

6304
02:25:33,429 --> 02:25:33,439
right, so just play what's in front of
 

6305
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:34,630
right, so just play what's in front of
you. All right, you don't want to be

6306
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:34,640
you. All right, you don't want to be
 

6307
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:36,950
you. All right, you don't want to be
long up here above this, right? They

6308
02:25:36,950 --> 02:25:36,960
long up here above this, right? They
 

6309
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:38,550
long up here above this, right? They
would needed to base out and do it. They

6310
02:25:38,550 --> 02:25:38,560
would needed to base out and do it. They
 

6311
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:41,750
would needed to base out and do it. They
couldn't. This is the bull trap. This is

6312
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:41,760
couldn't. This is the bull trap. This is
 

6313
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:44,070
couldn't. This is the bull trap. This is
the EMAs. This is VWAP. This is losing

6314
02:25:44,070 --> 02:25:44,080
the EMAs. This is VWAP. This is losing
 

6315
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:46,710
the EMAs. This is VWAP. This is losing
everything. This is into shelf. If they

6316
02:25:46,710 --> 02:25:46,720
everything. This is into shelf. If they
 

6317
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:48,309
everything. This is into shelf. If they
puke this now after knocking Alex out

6318
02:25:48,309 --> 02:25:48,319
puke this now after knocking Alex out
 

6319
02:25:48,319 --> 02:25:50,150
puke this now after knocking Alex out
and come straight down to here, I'm

6320
02:25:50,150 --> 02:25:50,160
and come straight down to here, I'm
 

6321
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:51,190
and come straight down to here, I'm
going to have to find a way of getting

6322
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:51,200
going to have to find a way of getting
 

6323
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:53,349
going to have to find a way of getting
back involved. But we're back into range

6324
02:25:53,349 --> 02:25:53,359
back involved. But we're back into range
 

6325
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:55,270
back involved. But we're back into range
for the day.

6326
02:25:55,270 --> 02:25:55,280
for the day.
 

6327
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:57,110
for the day.
Remember, my thought process now is

6328
02:25:57,110 --> 02:25:57,120
Remember, my thought process now is
 

6329
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:58,710
Remember, my thought process now is
we'll probably just rotate in here,

6330
02:25:58,710 --> 02:25:58,720
we'll probably just rotate in here,
 

6331
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:01,270
we'll probably just rotate in here,
right? So, we rotated up, rotate to the

6332
02:26:01,270 --> 02:26:01,280
right? So, we rotated up, rotate to the
 

6333
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:03,190
right? So, we rotated up, rotate to the
midpoint. If we get stuck here, maybe we

6334
02:26:03,190 --> 02:26:03,200
midpoint. If we get stuck here, maybe we
 

6335
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:06,309
midpoint. If we get stuck here, maybe we
do this, maybe we do this. But I don't

6336
02:26:06,309 --> 02:26:06,319
do this, maybe we do this. But I don't
 

6337
02:26:06,319 --> 02:26:08,550
do this, maybe we do this. But I don't
can't really imagine we move outside of

6338
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:08,560
can't really imagine we move outside of
 

6339
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,030
can't really imagine we move outside of
this range now.

6340
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:11,040
this range now.
 

6341
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:12,469
this range now.
And if we are going to move outside of

6342
02:26:12,469 --> 02:26:12,479
And if we are going to move outside of
 

6343
02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:14,150
And if we are going to move outside of
that range, maybe we come down for that

6344
02:26:14,150 --> 02:26:14,160
that range, maybe we come down for that
 

6345
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,670
that range, maybe we come down for that
naked point of control. But I don't

6346
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:15,680
naked point of control. But I don't
 

6347
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,349
naked point of control. But I don't
really imagine we move outside of this

6348
02:26:17,349 --> 02:26:17,359
really imagine we move outside of this
 

6349
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:22,070
really imagine we move outside of this
range for the rest of the day.

6350
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:22,080

 

6351
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:27,429

Where was my entry? Uh, let me find it.

6352
02:26:27,429 --> 02:26:27,439
Where was my entry? Uh, let me find it.
 

6353
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:30,389
Where was my entry? Uh, let me find it.
I started entering underneath that cell.

6354
02:26:30,389 --> 02:26:30,399
I started entering underneath that cell.
 

6355
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:34,070
I started entering underneath that cell.
Delta 37's got a tiny tiny feeler on. I

6356
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:34,080
Delta 37's got a tiny tiny feeler on. I
 

6357
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:36,790
Delta 37's got a tiny tiny feeler on. I
entered hard at 28 once that big buyer

6358
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:36,800
entered hard at 28 once that big buyer
 

6359
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:38,790
entered hard at 28 once that big buyer
came in on the tape and got stuck. So

6360
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:38,800
came in on the tape and got stuck. So
 

6361
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,870
came in on the tape and got stuck. So
228

6362
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:40,880
228
 

6363
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,389
228
and then I started covering. I'd never

6364
02:26:42,389 --> 02:26:42,399
and then I started covering. I'd never
 

6365
02:26:42,399 --> 02:26:45,670
and then I started covering. I'd never
got I never got big size on

6366
02:26:45,670 --> 02:26:45,680
got I never got big size on
 

6367
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:47,349
got I never got big size on
cuz for me the low hanging fruit's gone

6368
02:26:47,349 --> 02:26:47,359
cuz for me the low hanging fruit's gone
 

6369
02:26:47,359 --> 02:26:55,990
cuz for me the low hanging fruit's gone
right

6370
02:26:55,990 --> 02:26:56,000

 

6371
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,990

trying to protect this note. That might

6372
02:26:57,990 --> 02:26:58,000
trying to protect this note. That might
 

6373
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,750
trying to protect this note. That might
be it. It might well be it for the day,

6374
02:26:59,750 --> 02:26:59,760
be it. It might well be it for the day,
 

6375
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,830
be it. It might well be it for the day,
folks. 20 minutes left. We'll have to

6376
02:27:01,830 --> 02:27:01,840
folks. 20 minutes left. We'll have to
 

6377
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:07,270
folks. 20 minutes left. We'll have to
see. Maybe you get backside, but

6378
02:27:07,270 --> 02:27:07,280

 

6379
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:08,630

they're going to make this tricky now.

6380
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:08,640
they're going to make this tricky now.
 

6381
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:10,630
they're going to make this tricky now.
So, if they fail this, maybe they offer

6382
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:10,640
So, if they fail this, maybe they offer
 

6383
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:12,309
So, if they fail this, maybe they offer
this, but it's much harder now because

6384
02:27:12,309 --> 02:27:12,319
this, but it's much harder now because
 

6385
02:27:12,319 --> 02:27:14,550
this, but it's much harder now because
they've built out this block. Whereas

6386
02:27:14,550 --> 02:27:14,560
they've built out this block. Whereas
 

6387
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:16,790
they've built out this block. Whereas
here was the first retest up here,

6388
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:16,800
here was the first retest up here,
 

6389
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:18,790
here was the first retest up here,
right? That's the first test. That's the

6390
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:18,800
right? That's the first test. That's the
 

6391
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:21,349
right? That's the first test. That's the
trap. That's the trade inside. Maybe

6392
02:27:21,349 --> 02:27:21,359
trap. That's the trade inside. Maybe
 

6393
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:23,990
trap. That's the trade inside. Maybe
they do this. Maybe they do this. I I

6394
02:27:23,990 --> 02:27:24,000
they do this. Maybe they do this. I I
 

6395
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,830
they do this. Maybe they do this. I I
think they just rotate now. For me,

6396
02:27:25,830 --> 02:27:25,840
think they just rotate now. For me,
 

6397
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,670
think they just rotate now. For me,
there's probably not another trade setup

6398
02:27:27,670 --> 02:27:27,680
there's probably not another trade setup
 

6399
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:29,510
there's probably not another trade setup
today. Unfortunately, the easy trade

6400
02:27:29,510 --> 02:27:29,520
today. Unfortunately, the easy trade
 

6401
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:31,110
today. Unfortunately, the easy trade
setup was that first one I gave you this

6402
02:27:31,110 --> 02:27:31,120
setup was that first one I gave you this
 

6403
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:35,110
setup was that first one I gave you this
morning. It was the failure above value.

6404
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:35,120
morning. It was the failure above value.
 

6405
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:37,750
morning. It was the failure above value.
That was your money trade. That is an

6406
02:27:37,750 --> 02:27:37,760
That was your money trade. That is an
 

6407
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:39,429
That was your money trade. That is an
okay trade. It's not bad. It's not as

6408
02:27:39,429 --> 02:27:39,439
okay trade. It's not bad. It's not as
 

6409
02:27:39,439 --> 02:27:41,190
okay trade. It's not bad. It's not as
good as this though, is it? But it's not

6410
02:27:41,190 --> 02:27:41,200
good as this though, is it? But it's not
 

6411
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:43,349
good as this though, is it? But it's not
bad. And think about this. Why did I not

6412
02:27:43,349 --> 02:27:43,359
bad. And think about this. Why did I not
 

6413
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:44,790
bad. And think about this. Why did I not
want to be long bias up there? What do

6414
02:27:44,790 --> 02:27:44,800
want to be long bias up there? What do
 

6415
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:47,670
want to be long bias up there? What do
we talk about the reprice on the fib?

6416
02:27:47,670 --> 02:27:47,680
we talk about the reprice on the fib?
 

6417
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:50,550
we talk about the reprice on the fib?
Right? Bang into the 61. Boom. Fail. You

6418
02:27:50,550 --> 02:27:50,560
Right? Bang into the 61. Boom. Fail. You
 

6419
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:53,590
Right? Bang into the 61. Boom. Fail. You
had 61 value area high. Big level to

02:27:53,590 --> 02:27:53,600
had 61 value area high. Big level to
 

6421
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:55,830
had 61 value area high. Big level to
come and test back into confluence for a

02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:57,670
come and test back into confluence for a
potential short. just had to wait for it

6424
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:57,680
potential short. just had to wait for it
 

6425
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:59,270
potential short. just had to wait for it
to break down. Fails the lower time

6426
02:27:59,270 --> 02:27:59,280
to break down. Fails the lower time
 

6427
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,030
to break down. Fails the lower time
frame algo. Traps the buyers at the

6428
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:01,040
frame algo. Traps the buyers at the
 

6429
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:03,110
frame algo. Traps the buyers at the
highs. We see the buyers get caught on

6430
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:03,120
highs. We see the buyers get caught on
 

6431
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,630
highs. We see the buyers get caught on
the footprint. We see them trapped up

6432
02:28:04,630 --> 02:28:04,640
the footprint. We see them trapped up
 

6433
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:07,110
the footprint. We see them trapped up
here. You see the shift in delta, right?

6434
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:07,120
here. You see the shift in delta, right?
 

6435
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:08,710
here. You see the shift in delta, right?
You see them get trapped up here. Here

6436
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:08,720
You see them get trapped up here. Here
 

6437
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:10,710
You see them get trapped up here. Here
you go. You see the buyers get trapped

6438
02:28:10,710 --> 02:28:10,720

6439
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:12,710
you go. You see the buyers get trapped
up here. Right? This is all aggressive

6440
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:12,720
up here. Right? This is all aggressive
 

6441
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:15,349
up here. Right? This is all aggressive
buying. We shift and they become sellers

6442
02:28:15,349 --> 02:28:15,359
buying. We shift and they become sellers
 

6443
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:16,790
buying. We shift and they become sellers
and sellers and they just got caught

6444
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:16,800
and sellers and they just got caught
 

6445
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:19,830
and sellers and they just got caught
again here into 70. Right? So if we get

6446
02:28:19,830 --> 02:28:19,840
again here into 70. Right? So if we get
 

6447
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:21,590
again here into 70. Right? So if we get
a breakdown here, you've just got a load

6448
02:28:21,590 --> 02:28:21,600
a breakdown here, you've just got a load
 

6449

6451
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:26,070

70s. We are trading into the level.
 

6453

remember where these trap sellers got
 

6455
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,750
remember where these trap sellers got
caught this morning, right? So, I just

02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:29,760
caught this morning, right? So, I just
 

6457
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:32,070
caught this morning, right? So, I just
be aware of this level, right? This is

6458
02:28:32,070 --> 02:28:32,080
be aware of this level, right? This is
 

6459
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:34,389

probably your balance until you find

6460
02:28:34,389 --> 02:28:34,399
probably your balance until you find
 

6461
02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:38,870
probably your balance until you find
acceptance beneath this.

6462

90s now, I'm going to have to find a way
of getting involved.

6470
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:47,600

 

6471
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:53,670

gave it to you. I can't click the button

6508
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:40,880
gave it to you. I can't click the button
 

6509
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:43,750
gave it to you. I can't click the button
for you.

6510
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:43,760
for you.
 

6511
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:47,670
for you.
No, no, no. I didn't say two different

6512
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:47,680
No, no, no. I didn't say two different
 

6513
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:49,429
No, no, no. I didn't say two different
things to cover myself. I said if we

6514
02:29:49,429 --> 02:29:49,439
things to cover myself. I said if we
 

6515
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:52,710
things to cover myself. I said if we
base above here, it's a long. If we fail

6516
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:52,720
base above here, it's a long. If we fail
 

6517
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,830
base above here, it's a long. If we fail
under here, it's a short. Because the

6518
02:29:55,830 --> 02:29:55,840
under here, it's a short. Because the
 

6519
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:58,710
under here, it's a short. Because the
market can always do two things. It's

6520
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,720
market can always do two things. It's
 

6521
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:04,070
market can always do two things. It's
what it does that matters.

6522
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:04,080

 

6523
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:11,670

[\h__\h] me, man.

6524
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:11,680

 

6525
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:24,230

Crazy.

6526
02:30:24,230 --> 02:30:24,240

 

6527
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:26,870

all day. I even had a discussion with

6528
02:30:26,870 --> 02:30:26,880
all day. I even had a discussion with
 

6529
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:28,870
all day. I even had a discussion with
Johnny. I think it's Johnny who might be

6530
02:30:28,870 --> 02:30:28,880
Johnny. I think it's Johnny who might be
 

6531
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:31,349
Johnny. I think it's Johnny who might be
new here. Johnny was saying he doesn't

6532
02:30:31,349 --> 02:30:31,359
new here. Johnny was saying he doesn't
 

6533
02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:33,590
new here. Johnny was saying he doesn't
like the longs. And I said, I know I

6534
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:33,600
like the longs. And I said, I know I
 

6535
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:34,950
like the longs. And I said, I know I
will call the longs, but I don't like

6536
02:30:34,950 --> 02:30:34,960
will call the longs, but I don't like
 

6537
02:30:34,960 --> 02:30:36,630
will call the longs, but I don't like
the longs. I'm going to wait for this to

6538
02:30:36,630 --> 02:30:36,640
the longs. I'm going to wait for this to
 

6539
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:38,870
the longs. I'm going to wait for this to
pee out. I think this is exactly the

6540
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:38,880
pee out. I think this is exactly the
 

6541
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,950
pee out. I think this is exactly the
same as Friday. I'd be looking for the

6542
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:40,960
same as Friday. I'd be looking for the
 

6543
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:43,429
same as Friday. I'd be looking for the
retracement just like Friday. I

6544
02:30:43,429 --> 02:30:43,439
retracement just like Friday. I
 

6545
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:45,349
retracement just like Friday. I
literally talked you through. I've shown

6546
02:30:45,349 --> 02:30:45,359
literally talked you through. I've shown
 

6547
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:48,710
literally talked you through. I've shown
you so many times.

6548
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:48,720
you so many times.
 

6549
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:50,309
you so many times.
I can tell when it's a newer trader

6550
02:30:50,309 --> 02:30:50,319
I can tell when it's a newer trader
 

6551
02:30:50,319 --> 02:30:52,389
I can tell when it's a newer trader
who's just like wants a signal. I even

6552
02:30:52,389 --> 02:30:52,399
who's just like wants a signal. I even
 

6553
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:53,910
who's just like wants a signal. I even
basically gave you the signal other than

6554
02:30:53,910 --> 02:30:53,920
basically gave you the signal other than
 

6555
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:55,910
basically gave you the signal other than
say saying to you, "Sell right now. Sell

6556
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:55,920
say saying to you, "Sell right now. Sell
 

6557
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,349
say saying to you, "Sell right now. Sell
right now. Sell right now." I gave you

6558
02:30:57,349 --> 02:30:57,359
right now. Sell right now." I gave you
 

6559
02:30:57,359 --> 02:31:14,630
right now. Sell right now." I gave you
everything.

6560
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:14,640

 

6561
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:16,550

It's upsetting, man, because I feel like

6562
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:16,560
It's upsetting, man, because I feel like
 

6563
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:19,670
It's upsetting, man, because I feel like
the amount of free education I've given

6564
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:19,680
the amount of free education I've given

the amount of free education I've given

02:31:26,630 --> 02:31:26,640
find in most courses. You will get
 

6569
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:28,550
find in most courses. You will get
charged thousands of dollars for what

6570
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:28,560
charged thousands of dollars for what
 

6571
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:31,750

I've given you in two hours here for
free. And I'm getting questioned. Like,

6574
02:31:33,670 --> 02:31:33,680
free. And I'm getting questioned. Like,
 

6575
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:35,429
free. And I'm getting questioned. Like,
it's

6576
02:31:35,429 --> 02:31:35,439
it's
 

6577
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:38,070
it's
it's bonkers. It's bonkers. But that's

6578
02:31:38,070 --> 02:31:38,080
it's bonkers. It's bonkers. But that's
 

6579
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:45,270
it's bonkers. It's bonkers. But that's
the internet.

6580
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:45,280

 

6581
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:47,750

That's the internet.

6582
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:47,760
That's the internet.
 

6583
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:49,429
That's the internet.
All right. Aggressive sellers trying to

6584
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
All right. Aggressive sellers trying to
 

6585
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:51,590
All right. Aggressive sellers trying to
step in here.

6586
02:31:51,590 --> 02:31:51,600
step in here.
 

6587
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:53,349
step in here.
I'd be very, very careful. Like I said,

6588
02:31:53,349 --> 02:31:53,359
I'd be very, very careful. Like I said,
 

6589
02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:55,110
I'd be very, very careful. Like I said,

6597
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:01,750
their move, they're going to get caught
again and it would be the second time. I

02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:01,760
again and it would be the second time. I

All right. Sellers got caught under here

6602
02:32:06,070 --> 02:32:06,080
All right. Sellers got caught under here
 

6603
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:07,990
All right. Sellers got caught under here
like we talked about. We've shown it.

6604
02:32:07,990 --> 02:32:08,000
like we talked about. We've shown it.

buyers just caugh caught up here. Here

6606
02:32:10,469 --> 02:32:10,479
buyers just caugh caught up here. Here
 

6607
02:32:10,479 --> 02:32:12,630
buyers just caugh caught up here. Here
is the edge of your day's rotation. It's

6608
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:12,640
is the edge of your day's rotation. It's
 

6609
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:14,389
is the edge of your day's rotation. It's
very possible that they rotate in here

6610
02:32:14,389 --> 02:32:14,399
very possible that they rotate in here
 

6611
02:32:14,399 --> 02:32:16,230
very possible that they rotate in here
for a bit. I don't know if they want to

6612
02:32:16,230 --> 02:32:16,240
for a bit. I don't know if they want to
 

6613
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:18,550
for a bit. I don't know if they want to
come down here or come back above here.

6614
02:32:18,550 --> 02:32:18,560
come down here or come back above here.
 

6615

come down here or come back above here.
The edge has gone for me. We've played

6616
02:32:21,030 --> 02:32:21,040
The edge has gone for me. We've played
 

6617
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:23,590
The edge has gone for me. We've played
the two trades. There's the first one.

6618
02:32:23,590 --> 02:32:23,600
the two trades. There's the first one.
 

6619
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:25,750
the two trades. There's the first one.
There's the retest. Like I said, I said

6620
02:32:25,750 --> 02:32:25,760
There's the retest. Like I said, I said
 

6621
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:28,309
There's the retest. Like I said, I said
a million times, if this happens, I will

6622
02:32:28,309 --> 02:32:28,319
a million times, if this happens, I will
 

6623
02:32:28,319 --> 02:32:29,910
a million times, if this happens, I will
respect the structure we've created. If

6624
02:32:29,910 --> 02:32:29,920
respect the structure we've created. If
 

6625
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:31,750
respect the structure we've created. If
this starts snapping without me, the

6626
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:31,760
this starts snapping without me, the
 

6627
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:33,349
this starts snapping without me, the
only other way I can get involved now is

6628
02:32:33,349 --> 02:32:33,359
only other way I can get involved now is
 

6629
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:35,429
only other way I can get involved now is
if we come under here and we back test

6630
02:32:35,429 --> 02:32:35,439
if we come under here and we back test
 

6631
02:32:35,439 --> 02:32:37,030
if we come under here and we back test

02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:38,230
this to stay heavy for this trade.
There's no other way of me getting

6634
02:32:38,230 --> 02:32:38,240
There's no other way of me getting
 

6635
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:40,710
There's no other way of me getting
involved right now.

6636
02:32:40,710 --> 02:32:40,720
involved right now.

I didn't get enough size from up here to

I didn't get enough size from up here to
 

6639
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:44,790
I didn't get enough size from up here to
hold it up, unfortunately. I'm being

6641
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:47,830
hold it up, unfortunately. I'm being
very careful because Ninja's been a pain

6642
02:32:47,830 --> 02:32:47,840
very careful because Ninja's been a pain
 

6643
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:51,349
very careful because Ninja's been a pain
with me this morning.

6644
02:32:51,349 --> 02:32:51,359
with me this morning.
 

6645
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:54,630

Yeah, one minute chart, my friend.

Yeah, one minute chart, my friend.
 

6647

Yeah, one minute chart, my friend.
I understand that I have two days I

6648
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:56,800
I understand that I have two days I
 

6649
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,950
I understand that I have two days I
stumbled on this channel and I'm and I'm

stumbled on this channel and I'm and I'm
 

6651
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:08,309
stumbled on this channel and I'm and I'm
effing learning. Nice, dude.

6652
02:33:08,309 --> 02:33:08,319

 

6653
02:33:08,319 --> 02:33:10,150

Yeah, I mean I can see validity both

6654
02:33:10,150 --> 02:33:10,160
Yeah, I mean I can see validity both
 

6655
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:11,910
Yeah, I mean I can see validity both
sides, but for me I wouldn't be long on

6656
02:33:11,910 --> 02:33:11,920
sides, but for me I wouldn't be long on
 

6657
02:33:11,920 --> 02:33:13,750
sides, but for me I wouldn't be long on
a day where we're leaving value, right?

6658
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:13,760
a day where we're leaving value, right?
 

6659
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:15,830
a day where we're leaving value, right?
Personally, I would not play the

6660
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:15,840
Personally, I would not play the
 

6661
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,510
Personally, I would not play the
retracement longs. We're leaving value

6662
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:17,520
retracement longs. We're leaving value
 

6663
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:20,790
retracement longs. We're leaving value
just like Friday. We're leaving value.

6664
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:20,800
just like Friday. We're leaving value.
 

6665
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:23,830
just like Friday. We're leaving value.
And the target for leaving value right

6666
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:23,840
And the target for leaving value right
 

6667
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:27,349
And the target for leaving value right
now is down here, right? Same target

6668
02:33:27,349 --> 02:33:27,359
now is down here, right? Same target
 

6669
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:30,070
now is down here, right? Same target
I've had for weeks. If they leave value,

6670
02:33:30,070 --> 02:33:30,080
I've had for weeks. If they leave value,
 

6671
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:31,670
I've had for weeks. If they leave value,
this is where we go. Let's just like

6672
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:31,680
this is where we go. Let's just like
 

6673
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,270
this is where we go. Let's just like

6677
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:40,790

Here is your two weeks balance range.

6678
02:33:40,790 --> 02:33:40,800
Here is your two weeks balance range.
 

6679
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:42,550
Here is your two weeks balance range.
Right? On Friday, we left value. On

6680
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:42,560
Right? On Friday, we left value. On
 

6681
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:44,070
Right? On Friday, we left value. On
Monday morning, we failed to get back

6682
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:44,080
Monday morning, we failed to get back
 

6683
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,870
Monday morning, we failed to get back
inside value. We are testing down. We

6684
02:33:46,870 --> 02:33:46,880
inside value. We are testing down. We
 

6685
02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:50,309
inside value. We are testing down. We
are looking at value created from here.

Right? This confluence area. This is

6688
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:52,240
Right? This confluence area. This is
 

6689
02:33:52,240 --> 02:33:53,750
Right? This confluence area. This is
where I think they're trying to get to.

6690
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:53,760
where I think they're trying to get to.
 

6691
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:56,309
where I think they're trying to get to.
I would be very careful about being long

6692
02:33:56,309 --> 02:33:56,319
I would be very careful about being long
 

6693
02:33:56,319 --> 02:33:59,030
I would be very careful about being long
biased today. It's not to say that you

6694
02:33:59,030 --> 02:33:59,040
biased today. It's not to say that you
 

6695
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,710
biased today. It's not to say that you
can't find a scalp for like that counter

6696
02:34:00,710 --> 02:34:00,720
can't find a scalp for like that counter
 

6697
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:03,030
can't find a scalp for like that counter
trend play, but I would be very very

6698
02:34:03,030 --> 02:34:03,040
trend play, but I would be very very
 

6699
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:05,590
trend play, but I would be very very
careful. It's probably the hardest trade

6700
02:34:05,590 --> 02:34:05,600
careful. It's probably the hardest trade
 

6701
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:07,670
careful. It's probably the hardest trade
in the book on the hardest environment

to do it in right now. You will have to

6704
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:10,000
to do it in right now. You will have to
 

6705
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,469
to do it in right now. You will have to
lean on lower time frame shorts being

6706
02:34:12,469 --> 02:34:12,479
lean on lower time frame shorts being
 

6707
02:34:12,479 --> 02:34:14,389
lean on lower time frame shorts being
stuck. You need to maintain these guys

6708
02:34:14,389 --> 02:34:14,399
stuck. You need to maintain these guys
 

6709
02:34:14,399 --> 02:34:17,190
stuck. You need to maintain these guys
stuck. If they become unstuck and you do

6710
02:34:17,190 --> 02:34:17,200
stuck. If they become unstuck and you do
 

6711
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:27,910
stuck. If they become unstuck and you do
this, this thing will absolutely puke.

6712
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:27,920

 

6713
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:30,309

I shorted

6714
02:34:30,309 --> 02:34:30,319
I shorted
 

6715
02:34:30,319 --> 02:34:33,670
I shorted
497 but got out way too early at 450.

6716
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:33,680
497 but got out way too early at 450.

02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:35,590
497 but got out way too early at 450.
That's still 50 points though, man. It's

6718
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:35,600
That's still 50 points though, man. It's
 

6719

That's still 50 points though, man. It's
Yeah, I mean it's still pretty good.

Yeah, I mean it's still pretty good.
 

6721
02:34:38,479 --> 02:34:40,389
Yeah, I mean it's still pretty good.
It's 50 points is pretty good. I would

6722
02:34:40,389 --> 02:34:40,399
It's 50 points is pretty good. I would
 

6723
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:44,630
It's 50 points is pretty good. I would
say pretty good. 49. What did you say

trading out. I don't really want to do
 

6733
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:56,790

02:35:05,110 --> 02:35:05,120
Is that new one? NQM.
 

6743
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:07,429
Is that new one? NQM.

6744
02:35:07,429 --> 02:35:07,439
ENQ.
 

6745
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:08,870
ENQ.

Someone help me out. What's the new
contract?

6748
02:35:10,630 --> 02:35:10,640

contract?
Why can't I get it? March. There we go.

6750
02:35:13,830 --> 02:35:13,840
Why can't I get it? March. There we go.
 

6751
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:15,590
Why can't I get it? March. There we go.
497.

6752
02:35:15,590 --> 02:35:15,600
497.
 

6753
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:21,270
497.
Yeah. Nice. Look like See, failed.

6754
02:35:21,270 --> 02:35:21,280

 

6755
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:22,950

All right. covered some. You covered

6756
02:35:22,950 --> 02:35:22,960
All right. covered some. You covered
 

6757
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:25,110
All right. covered some. You covered
into 50s.

6758
02:35:25,110 --> 02:35:25,120
into 50s.
 

6759
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:27,349
into 50s.
Yeah, you respected you respected that.

6760
02:35:27,349 --> 02:35:27,359
Yeah, you respected you respected that.
 

6761
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:29,110
Yeah, you respected you respected that.
I I don't hate that, dude. I think

6762
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:29,120
I I don't hate that, dude. I think
 

6763
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:36,150
I I don't hate that, dude. I think
that's a good trade. It's a good trade.

6764
02:35:36,150 --> 02:35:36,160

 

6765
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:37,750

Could you have held longer? Yeah, but

6766
02:35:37,750 --> 02:35:37,760
Could you have held longer? Yeah, but
 

6767
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:39,510
Could you have held longer? Yeah, but
you don't know whether they find a bid

6768
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:39,520
you don't know whether they find a bid
 

6769
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:41,910
you don't know whether they find a bid
here. Like, you'll be you got to cover

6770
02:35:41,910 --> 02:35:41,920
here. Like, you'll be you got to cover
 

6771
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:43,910
here. Like, you'll be you got to cover
at least like, you know, 50% into those

6772
02:35:43,910 --> 02:35:43,920
at least like, you know, 50% into those
 

6773
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:46,070
at least like, you know, 50% into those
levels. I I'm in agreement like this.

6774
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:46,080
levels. I I'm in agreement like this.
 

6775
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:48,150
levels. I I'm in agreement like this.
Like, like I said, maybe we build out

6776
02:35:48,150 --> 02:35:48,160
Like, like I said, maybe we build out
 

6777
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:51,190
Like, like I said, maybe we build out
here, they build enough out here. If we

6778
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:51,200
here, they build enough out here. If we
 

6779
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:52,950
here, they build enough out here. If we
hadn't done this earlier, this trade

6780
02:35:52,950 --> 02:35:52,960
hadn't done this earlier, this trade
 

6781
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,230
hadn't done this earlier, this trade
down to here would be easier because

6782
02:35:54,230 --> 02:35:54,240
down to here would be easier because
 

6783
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,750
down to here would be easier because
there wouldn't be shorts stuck in here.

6784
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:55,760
there wouldn't be shorts stuck in here.
 

6785
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:57,830
there wouldn't be shorts stuck in here.
But we have done this. So like I'm very

6786
02:35:57,830 --> 02:35:57,840
But we have done this. So like I'm very
 

6787
02:35:57,840 --> 02:35:59,510
But we have done this. So like I'm very
aware how many shorts are caught in

6788
02:35:59,510 --> 02:35:59,520
aware how many shorts are caught in
 

6789
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:01,349
aware how many shorts are caught in
here. Right?

6790
02:36:01,349 --> 02:36:01,359
here. Right?
 

6791
02:36:01,359 --> 02:36:08,389
here. Right?
These guys are offside.

6792
02:36:08,389 --> 02:36:08,399

 

6793
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:10,630

Right.

6794
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:10,640
Right.
 

6795
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:13,270
Right.
These guys are offside. They didn't get

6796
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:13,280
These guys are offside. They didn't get
 

6797
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:15,910
These guys are offside. They didn't get
their cover.

6798
02:36:15,910 --> 02:36:15,920
their cover.
 

6799
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:17,750
their cover.
These guys are offside. These guys are

6800
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:17,760
These guys are offside. These guys are
 

6801
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:19,670
These guys are offside. These guys are
offside. These guys are offside. These

6802
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:19,680
offside. These guys are offside. These
 

6803
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:22,389
offside. These guys are offside. These
guys are offside. So for me, if I was

6804
02:36:22,389 --> 02:36:22,399
guys are offside. So for me, if I was
 

6805
02:36:22,399 --> 02:36:23,910
guys are offside. So for me, if I was
going to pin this, I'd be looking at

6806
02:36:23,910 --> 02:36:23,920
going to pin this, I'd be looking at
 

6807
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:26,469
going to pin this, I'd be looking at
like the two levels. Can we find

6808
02:36:26,469 --> 02:36:26,479
like the two levels. Can we find
 

6809
02:36:26,479 --> 02:36:28,710
like the two levels. Can we find
acceptance?

6810
02:36:28,710 --> 02:36:28,720
acceptance?
 

6811
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:30,469
acceptance?
Let's do this like really thick so we

6812
02:36:30,469 --> 02:36:30,479
Let's do this like really thick so we
 

6813
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:33,990
Let's do this like really thick so we
can see it here and

6814
02:36:33,990 --> 02:36:34,000
can see it here and
 

6815
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,309
can see it here and
here. Somewhere around here, right? And

6816
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:36,319
here. Somewhere around here, right? And
 

6817
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:40,150
here. Somewhere around here, right? And
where are we trading into?

6818
02:36:40,150 --> 02:36:40,160

 

6819
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:41,590

All right. We're finding a bid there.

6820
02:36:41,590 --> 02:36:41,600
All right. We're finding a bid there.
 

6821
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:43,510
All right. We're finding a bid there.
It's because shorts are stuck there from

6822
02:36:43,510 --> 02:36:43,520
It's because shorts are stuck there from
 

6823
02:36:43,520 --> 02:36:45,750
It's because shorts are stuck there from
this morning. Right. So you can see in

6824
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:45,760
this morning. Right. So you can see in
 

6825
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:47,270
this morning. Right. So you can see in
this level is where shorts are stuck. So

6826
02:36:47,270 --> 02:36:47,280
this level is where shorts are stuck. So
 

6827
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:49,030
this level is where shorts are stuck. So
we're finding a bid here. So, I don't

6828
02:36:49,030 --> 02:36:49,040
we're finding a bid here. So, I don't
 

6829
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:50,550
we're finding a bid here. So, I don't
think your cover was that bad is what

6830
02:36:50,550 --> 02:36:50,560
think your cover was that bad is what
 

6831
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:53,270
think your cover was that bad is what
I'm trying to say. Like 50 points,

6832
02:36:53,270 --> 02:36:53,280
I'm trying to say. Like 50 points,
 

6833
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:56,230
I'm trying to say. Like 50 points,
decent move.

6834
02:36:56,230 --> 02:36:56,240
decent move.
 

6835
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:58,790
decent move.
Now, we're going to build out volume in

6836
02:36:58,790 --> 02:36:58,800
Now, we're going to build out volume in
 

6837
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:00,630
Now, we're going to build out volume in
this area here. And how we act here, you

6838
02:37:00,630 --> 02:37:00,640
this area here. And how we act here, you
 

6839
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:02,309
this area here. And how we act here, you
can see we've rotated here multiple

6840
02:37:02,309 --> 02:37:02,319
can see we've rotated here multiple
 

6841
02:37:02,319 --> 02:37:03,750
can see we've rotated here multiple
times earlier. We're going to rotate

6842
02:37:03,750 --> 02:37:03,760
times earlier. We're going to rotate
 

6843
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:05,910
times earlier. We're going to rotate
here multiple times again probably.

6844
02:37:05,910 --> 02:37:05,920
here multiple times again probably.
 

6845
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:07,750
here multiple times again probably.
Right? This is the difference between in

6846
02:37:07,750 --> 02:37:07,760
Right? This is the difference between in
 

6847
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:10,230
Right? This is the difference between in
a thin market. Once we break out of this

6848
02:37:10,230 --> 02:37:10,240
a thin market. Once we break out of this
 

6849
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:12,469
a thin market. Once we break out of this
earlier, straight up, we fail, we come

6850
02:37:12,469 --> 02:37:12,479
earlier, straight up, we fail, we come
 

6851
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:14,630
earlier, straight up, we fail, we come
back into volume. We can rotate here, we

6852
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:14,640
back into volume. We can rotate here, we
 

6853
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:16,389
back into volume. We can rotate here, we
can rotate here, and it can take a long

6854
02:37:16,389 --> 02:37:16,399
can rotate here, and it can take a long
 

6855
02:37:16,399 --> 02:37:17,830
can rotate here, and it can take a long
time now. And we're getting close to

6856
02:37:17,830 --> 02:37:17,840
time now. And we're getting close to
 

6857
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:24,950
time now. And we're getting close to
lunch.

6858
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:24,960

 

6859
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:27,349

Yeah, I'm still trading zed. I mean, I

6860
02:37:27,349 --> 02:37:27,359
Yeah, I'm still trading zed. I mean, I
 

6861
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:29,270
Yeah, I'm still trading zed. I mean, I
I'll have to check if enough uh volume's

6862
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:29,280
I'll have to check if enough uh volume's
 

6863
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:32,230
I'll have to check if enough uh volume's
moved over to the new one, but uh

6864
02:37:32,230 --> 02:37:32,240
moved over to the new one, but uh
 

6865
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:34,309
moved over to the new one, but uh
probably by tomorrow. It's normally by

6866
02:37:34,309 --> 02:37:34,319
probably by tomorrow. It's normally by
 

6867
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:36,389
probably by tomorrow. It's normally by
Tuesday, but we can have a little look.

6868
02:37:36,389 --> 02:37:36,399
Tuesday, but we can have a little look.
 

6869
02:37:36,399 --> 02:37:41,910
Tuesday, but we can have a little look.
Let me have a look. Get it up in here.

6870
02:37:41,910 --> 02:37:41,920

 

6871
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,349

Does this update in real time?

6872
02:37:43,349 --> 02:37:43,359
Does this update in real time?
 

6873
02:37:43,359 --> 02:37:51,349
Does this update in real time?
Hopefully, it does. All

6874
02:37:51,349 --> 02:37:51,359

 

6875
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:53,030

right. So, yeah. So, more people were

6876
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:53,040
right. So, yeah. So, more people were
 

6877
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:54,309
right. So, yeah. So, more people were
starting to tra trade the March

6878
02:37:54,309 --> 02:37:54,319
starting to tra trade the March
 

6879
02:37:54,319 --> 02:37:56,230
starting to tra trade the March
contract. So, total volume in December

6880
02:37:56,230 --> 02:37:56,240
contract. So, total volume in December
 

6881
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,870
contract. So, total volume in December
still 760,000,

6882
02:37:58,870 --> 02:37:58,880
still 760,000,
 

6883
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:00,309
still 760,000,
but you're starting to see like some

6884
02:38:00,309 --> 02:38:00,319
but you're starting to see like some
 

6885
02:38:00,319 --> 02:38:01,510
but you're starting to see like some
more volume coming in the March

6886
02:38:01,510 --> 02:38:01,520
more volume coming in the March
 

6887
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:03,429
more volume coming in the March
contract. So, probably by tomorrow, by

6888
02:38:03,429 --> 02:38:03,439
contract. So, probably by tomorrow, by
 

6889
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:04,950
contract. So, probably by tomorrow, by
end of day today, it's probably time to

6890
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:04,960
end of day today, it's probably time to
 

6891
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,950
end of day today, it's probably time to
roll over, but we I will check at the

6892
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:06,960
roll over, but we I will check at the
 

6893
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:15,270
roll over, but we I will check at the
end of play. Probably dump for the day.

6894
02:38:15,270 --> 02:38:15,280

 

6895
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:18,150

I don't use tick chart. I I I played

6896
02:38:18,150 --> 02:38:18,160
I don't use tick chart. I I I played
 

6897
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:21,990
I don't use tick chart. I I I played
around with it for a bit. Um but I've

6898
02:38:21,990 --> 02:38:22,000
around with it for a bit. Um but I've
 

6899
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:25,510
around with it for a bit. Um but I've
I've moved back off it. Um so I I I have

6900
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,520
I've moved back off it. Um so I I I have
 

6901
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:28,630
I've moved back off it. Um so I I I have
a 500 tick but I don't really use it if

6902
02:38:28,630 --> 02:38:28,640
a 500 tick but I don't really use it if
 

6903
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:31,830
a 500 tick but I don't really use it if
I'm honest. I just time is important to

6904
02:38:31,830 --> 02:38:31,840
I'm honest. I just time is important to
 

6905
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:33,670
I'm honest. I just time is important to
me. I know with most volume traders time

6906
02:38:33,670 --> 02:38:33,680
me. I know with most volume traders time
 

6907
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:35,349
me. I know with most volume traders time
won't be important. I I actually really

6908
02:38:35,349 --> 02:38:35,359
won't be important. I I actually really
 

6909
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:37,110
won't be important. I I actually really
care about those hourly exchanges and

6910
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:37,120
care about those hourly exchanges and
 

6911
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:39,030
care about those hourly exchanges and
4hour exchanges and even five minute

6912
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:39,040
4hour exchanges and even five minute
 

6913
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:42,230
4hour exchanges and even five minute
bars. Uh buyers just got caught again

6914
02:38:42,230 --> 02:38:42,240
bars. Uh buyers just got caught again
 

6915
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:45,590
bars. Uh buyers just got caught again
there above 60 62s again. They just came

6916
02:38:45,590 --> 02:38:45,600
there above 60 62s again. They just came
 

6917
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:48,870
there above 60 62s again. They just came
flying in there and got caught. Um

6918
02:38:48,870 --> 02:38:48,880
flying in there and got caught. Um
 

6919
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:50,150
flying in there and got caught. Um
I think you're just going to go into a

6920
02:38:50,150 --> 02:38:50,160
I think you're just going to go into a
 

6921
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:54,150
I think you're just going to go into a
bit of a rotation here for a bit.

6922
02:38:54,150 --> 02:38:54,160
bit of a rotation here for a bit.
 

6923
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:56,870
bit of a rotation here for a bit.
More than 40% more volume in the new

6924
02:38:56,870 --> 02:38:56,880
More than 40% more volume in the new
 

6925
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:59,349
More than 40% more volume in the new
more new contract. Yeah, like I said, we

6926
02:38:59,349 --> 02:38:59,359
more new contract. Yeah, like I said, we
 

6927
02:38:59,359 --> 02:39:00,710
more new contract. Yeah, like I said, we
just looked at it and we starting to

6928
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:00,720
just looked at it and we starting to
 

6929
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:05,510
just looked at it and we starting to
really push that new contract.

6930
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:05,520

 

6931
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:06,870

Trying to let these buyers out. They're

6932
02:39:06,870 --> 02:39:06,880
Trying to let these buyers out. They're
 

6933
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:09,590
Trying to let these buyers out. They're
going to retest big last big sell delta

6934
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:09,600
going to retest big last big sell delta
 

6935
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:14,309
going to retest big last big sell delta
was at 84s. All right, 84s. But I think

6936
02:39:14,309 --> 02:39:14,319
was at 84s. All right, 84s. But I think
 

6937
02:39:14,319 --> 02:39:15,910
was at 84s. All right, 84s. But I think
the edge is gone from the market. For

6938
02:39:15,910 --> 02:39:15,920
the edge is gone from the market. For
 

6939
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:17,190
the edge is gone from the market. For
me, I'd say the edge is gone at the

6940
02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:17,200
me, I'd say the edge is gone at the
 

6941
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:18,950
me, I'd say the edge is gone at the
moment unless they build out a lot a lot

6942
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:18,960
moment unless they build out a lot a lot
 

6943
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,710
moment unless they build out a lot a lot
more. I think the edge is probably gone

6944
02:39:20,710 --> 02:39:20,720
more. I think the edge is probably gone
 

6945
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:46,870
more. I think the edge is probably gone
now.

6946
02:39:46,870 --> 02:39:46,880

 

6947
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:49,190

Alex, this is Oaken. I've traded for

6948
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:49,200
Alex, this is Oaken. I've traded for
 

6949
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:50,950
Alex, this is Oaken. I've traded for
three years and your approach to

6950
02:39:50,950 --> 02:39:50,960
three years and your approach to
 

6951
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:52,710
three years and your approach to
combining market auction theory with

6952
02:39:52,710 --> 02:39:52,720
combining market auction theory with
 

6953
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:54,710
combining market auction theory with
volume profile is by far the best I've

6954
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:54,720
volume profile is by far the best I've
 

6955
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:56,950
volume profile is by far the best I've
seen. Thank you. You're welcome, dude.

6956
02:39:56,950 --> 02:39:56,960
seen. Thank you. You're welcome, dude.
 

6957
02:39:56,960 --> 02:39:59,349
seen. Thank you. You're welcome, dude.
Thanks for the good energy.

6958
02:39:59,349 --> 02:39:59,359
Thanks for the good energy.
 

6959
02:39:59,359 --> 02:40:03,190
Thanks for the good energy.
Thanks for the good energy.

6960
02:40:03,190 --> 02:40:03,200

 

6961
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:06,630

If we can below 377 PL day on the H

6962
02:40:06,630 --> 02:40:06,640
If we can below 377 PL day on the H
 

6963
02:40:06,640 --> 02:40:08,309
If we can below 377 PL day on the H
contract and test and break lower, I

6964
02:40:08,309 --> 02:40:08,319
contract and test and break lower, I
 

6965
02:40:08,319 --> 02:40:11,910
contract and test and break lower, I
like the downside.

6966
02:40:11,910 --> 02:40:11,920
like the downside.
 

6967
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:19,429
like the downside.
Kala, did I say that right? Kra,

6968
02:40:19,429 --> 02:40:19,439

 

6969
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:21,429

I mean, yeah,

6970
02:40:21,429 --> 02:40:21,439
I mean, yeah,
 

6971
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:24,070
I mean, yeah,
for me like I've maintained

6972
02:40:24,070 --> 02:40:24,080
for me like I've maintained
 

6973
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:26,389
for me like I've maintained
where this market wants to come to, I

6974
02:40:26,389 --> 02:40:26,399
where this market wants to come to, I
 

6975
02:40:26,399 --> 02:40:29,190
where this market wants to come to, I
think, is here. I've maintained that for

6976
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:29,200
think, is here. I've maintained that for
 

6977
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:32,070
think, is here. I've maintained that for
a long time, right? based on weeklies.

6978
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:32,080
a long time, right? based on weeklies.
 

6979
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:34,070
a long time, right? based on weeklies.
This is where it wants to come to. And

6980
02:40:34,070 --> 02:40:34,080
This is where it wants to come to. And
 

6981
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:35,510
This is where it wants to come to. And
where are we trading at on the daily

6982
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:35,520
where are we trading at on the daily
 

6983
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:38,469
where are we trading at on the daily
right now? Where's my daily chart gone?

6984
02:40:38,469 --> 02:40:38,479
right now? Where's my daily chart gone?
 

6985
02:40:38,479 --> 02:40:40,870
right now? Where's my daily chart gone?
We're just hovering around.

6986
02:40:40,870 --> 02:40:40,880
We're just hovering around.
 

6987
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:42,389
We're just hovering around.
It's really important you guys zoom out

6988
02:40:42,389 --> 02:40:42,399
It's really important you guys zoom out
 

6989
02:40:42,399 --> 02:40:45,349
It's really important you guys zoom out
a lot. Right. We're just hovering around

6990
02:40:45,349 --> 02:40:45,359
a lot. Right. We're just hovering around
 

6991
02:40:45,359 --> 02:40:46,790
a lot. Right. We're just hovering around
this high volume node which we've

6992
02:40:46,790 --> 02:40:46,800
this high volume node which we've
 

6993
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:49,110
this high volume node which we've
started creating. Right. And we're right

6994
02:40:49,110 --> 02:40:49,120
started creating. Right. And we're right
 

6995
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:51,270
started creating. Right. And we're right
at the mean. All right. So, this is

6996
02:40:51,270 --> 02:40:51,280
at the mean. All right. So, this is
 

6997
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:53,510
at the mean. All right. So, this is
zero. This is your zero line. Purple

6998
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:53,520
zero. This is your zero line. Purple
 

6999
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:55,750
zero. This is your zero line. Purple
20day. Two standard deviation. Two

We have this volume node here. And just

7004
02:41:00,550 --> 02:41:00,560
We have this volume node here. And just
 

7005
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:02,389
We have this volume node here. And just
above this,

7006
02:41:02,389 --> 02:41:02,399
above this,
 

7007
02:41:02,399 --> 02:41:04,550
above this,
well in this, all right, we have an

7008
02:41:04,550 --> 02:41:04,560
well in this, all right, we have an
 

7009
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:07,750
well in this, all right, we have an
untested point of control. All right, I

7010
02:41:07,750 --> 02:41:07,760
untested point of control. All right, I
 

7011
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:09,670
untested point of control. All right, I
think the market wants to come to here.

7012
02:41:09,670 --> 02:41:09,680
think the market wants to come to here.
 

7013
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:11,910
think the market wants to come to here.
I do doesn't need to do it today. I

7014
02:41:11,910 --> 02:41:11,920
I do doesn't need to do it today. I
 

7015
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:13,270
I do doesn't need to do it today. I
think the market does want to come to

7016
02:41:13,270 --> 02:41:13,280
think the market does want to come to
 

7017
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:15,270
think the market does want to come to
here. What I would say now is based on

7018
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:15,280
here. What I would say now is based on
 

7019
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:17,190
here. What I would say now is based on
this yearly volume profile, look how we

7020
02:41:17,190 --> 02:41:17,200
this yearly volume profile, look how we
 

7021
02:41:17,200 --> 02:41:18,950
this yearly volume profile, look how we
have built this low volume node out and

7022
02:41:18,950 --> 02:41:18,960
have built this low volume node out and
 

7023
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:21,110
have built this low volume node out and
we're starting to respect it. All right,

7024
02:41:21,110 --> 02:41:21,120
we're starting to respect it. All right,
 

7025
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:23,429
we're starting to respect it. All right,
if we keep rejecting this, then what are

7026
02:41:23,429 --> 02:41:23,439
if we keep rejecting this, then what are
 

7027
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:25,110
if we keep rejecting this, then what are
we saying? We're saying exactly what I

7028
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:25,120
we saying? We're saying exactly what I
 

7029
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:26,630
we saying? We're saying exactly what I
said last week on Friday. We're leaving

7030
02:41:26,630 --> 02:41:26,640
said last week on Friday. We're leaving
 

7031
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:28,070
said last week on Friday. We're leaving
these buyers trapped. So, we're leaving

7032
02:41:28,070 --> 02:41:28,080
these buyers trapped. So, we're leaving
 

7033
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:29,670
these buyers trapped. So, we're leaving
this balance range trapped. We're

7034
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:29,680
this balance range trapped. We're
 

7035
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:31,030
this balance range trapped. We're
leaving this balance range trapped,

7036
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:31,040
leaving this balance range trapped,
 

7037
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:32,790
leaving this balance range trapped,
which means we're probably going to move

7038
02:41:32,790 --> 02:41:32,800
which means we're probably going to move
 

7039
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:36,230
which means we're probably going to move
lower. Until we reclaim that, I think

7040
02:41:36,230 --> 02:41:36,240
lower. Until we reclaim that, I think
 

7041
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:37,990
lower. Until we reclaim that, I think
higher time frame bullish scenarios off

7042
02:41:37,990 --> 02:41:38,000
higher time frame bullish scenarios off
 

7043
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,830
higher time frame bullish scenarios off
the table. Yes, there's an argument to

7044
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:39,840
the table. Yes, there's an argument to
 

7045
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:43,190
the table. Yes, there's an argument to
play dips into 9:30 swing dips if they

7046
02:41:43,190 --> 02:41:43,200
play dips into 9:30 swing dips if they
 

7047
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:45,190
play dips into 9:30 swing dips if they
hold it. But,

7048
02:41:45,190 --> 02:41:45,200
hold it. But,
 

7049
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:47,270
hold it. But,
you know, if you play that dip and then

7050
02:41:47,270 --> 02:41:47,280
you know, if you play that dip and then
 

7051
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:50,550
you know, if you play that dip and then
Thursday, Friday, Sunday comes around

7052
02:41:50,550 --> 02:41:50,560
Thursday, Friday, Sunday comes around
 

7053
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:53,110
Thursday, Friday, Sunday comes around
and that happens,

7054
02:41:53,110 --> 02:41:53,120
and that happens,
 

7055
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:54,309
and that happens,
you're probably going to be waking up

7056
02:41:54,309 --> 02:41:54,319
you're probably going to be waking up
 

7057
02:41:54,319 --> 02:41:56,309
you're probably going to be waking up
down here. All right? So, just be aware

7058
02:41:56,309 --> 02:41:56,319
down here. All right? So, just be aware
 

7059
02:41:56,319 --> 02:42:02,870
down here. All right? So, just be aware
of that.

7060
02:42:02,870 --> 02:42:02,880

 

7061
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,190

Oh, I had it's not ended, guys. Sorry. I

7062
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:05,200
Oh, I had it's not ended, guys. Sorry. I
 

7063
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:07,750
Oh, I had it's not ended, guys. Sorry. I
didn't mean to click that.

7064
02:42:07,750 --> 02:42:07,760
didn't mean to click that.
 

7065
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:09,349
didn't mean to click that.
Scare a lot of you away. Right back to

7066
02:42:09,349 --> 02:42:09,359
Scare a lot of you away. Right back to
 

7067
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:10,790
Scare a lot of you away. Right back to
the top side of this gray box we just

7068
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:10,800
the top side of this gray box we just
 

7069
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:20,309
the top side of this gray box we just
put in.

7070
02:42:20,309 --> 02:42:20,319

 

7071
02:42:20,319 --> 02:42:21,990

Hey, Alex, do I need to change anything

7072
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:22,000
Hey, Alex, do I need to change anything
 

7073
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:23,670
Hey, Alex, do I need to change anything
on top step for the new contract or

7074
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:23,680
on top step for the new contract or
 

7075
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:25,590
on top step for the new contract or
would it automatically do it? Uh, dumb

7076
02:42:25,590 --> 02:42:25,600
would it automatically do it? Uh, dumb
 

7077
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:27,190
would it automatically do it? Uh, dumb
question. I don't know. Uh, I would

7078
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:27,200
question. I don't know. Uh, I would
 

7079
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:30,070
question. I don't know. Uh, I would
assume top set X will automatically roll

7080
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,080
assume top set X will automatically roll
 

7081
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:32,389
assume top set X will automatically roll
you. Um, I would assume it will

7082
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:32,399
you. Um, I would assume it will
 

7083
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:34,389
you. Um, I would assume it will
automatically roll you. So, I wouldn't I

7084
02:42:34,389 --> 02:42:34,399
automatically roll you. So, I wouldn't I
 

7085
02:42:34,399 --> 02:42:35,990
automatically roll you. So, I wouldn't I
wouldn't stress out. But if you want to

7086
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:36,000
wouldn't stress out. But if you want to
 

7087
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,830
wouldn't stress out. But if you want to
trade trade the new contract, you can

7088
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:37,840
trade trade the new contract, you can
 

7089
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:39,670
trade trade the new contract, you can
probably change it by yourself. I don't

7090
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:39,680
probably change it by yourself. I don't
 

7091
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:41,429
probably change it by yourself. I don't
trade on top set, so I couldn't tell

7092
02:42:41,429 --> 02:42:41,439
trade on top set, so I couldn't tell
 

7093
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:43,670
trade on top set, so I couldn't tell
you. Oh, look at the gray box. Oh, he

7094
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:43,680
you. Oh, look at the gray box. Oh, he
 

7095
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:45,030
you. Oh, look at the gray box. Oh, he
didn't tell us what to do. Oh, the gray

7096
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,040
didn't tell us what to do. Oh, the gray
 

7097
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:48,150
didn't tell us what to do. Oh, the gray
box. Oh,

7098
02:42:48,150 --> 02:42:48,160
box. Oh,
 

7099
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:50,469
box. Oh,
um, I'm sorry, but what is the bottom

7100
02:42:50,469 --> 02:42:50,479
um, I'm sorry, but what is the bottom
 

7101
02:42:50,479 --> 02:42:52,710
um, I'm sorry, but what is the bottom
volume indicator you have on your chart?

7102
02:42:52,710 --> 02:42:52,720
volume indicator you have on your chart?
 

7103
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:56,230
volume indicator you have on your chart?
Uh, this one here. This is delta. It's

7104
02:42:56,230 --> 02:42:56,240
Uh, this one here. This is delta. It's
 

7105
02:42:56,240 --> 02:43:00,230
Uh, this one here. This is delta. It's
volume delta.

7106
02:43:00,230 --> 02:43:00,240

 

7107
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:01,750

It's showing you delta inside each

7108
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:01,760
It's showing you delta inside each
 

7109
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:08,710
It's showing you delta inside each
candle.

7110
02:43:08,710 --> 02:43:08,720

 

7111
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:10,469

Do I have a bookmap stream on my

7112
02:43:10,469 --> 02:43:10,479
Do I have a bookmap stream on my
 

7113
02:43:10,479 --> 02:43:14,389
Do I have a bookmap stream on my
Discord? Uh, I don't.

7114
02:43:14,389 --> 02:43:14,399
Discord? Uh, I don't.
 

7115
02:43:14,399 --> 02:43:16,309
Discord? Uh, I don't.
I could leave it up the day, I guess, if

7116
02:43:16,309 --> 02:43:16,319
I could leave it up the day, I guess, if
 

7117
02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:17,590
I could leave it up the day, I guess, if
that would be useful for people. I've

7118
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:17,600
that would be useful for people. I've
 

7119
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:20,309
that would be useful for people. I've
never really thought about doing that.

7120
02:43:20,309 --> 02:43:20,319
never really thought about doing that.
 

7121
02:43:20,319 --> 02:43:22,070
never really thought about doing that.
No worries.

7122
02:43:22,070 --> 02:43:22,080
No worries.
 

7123
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:23,750
No worries.
And here's the rotation in that grain

7124
02:43:23,750 --> 02:43:23,760
And here's the rotation in that grain
 

7125
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:25,830
And here's the rotation in that grain
box. What did we say? I don't know.

7126
02:43:25,830 --> 02:43:25,840
box. What did we say? I don't know.
 

7127
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:26,950
box. What did we say? I don't know.
Maybe he didn't give you a big enough

7128
02:43:26,950 --> 02:43:26,960
Maybe he didn't give you a big enough
 

7129
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:28,469
Maybe he didn't give you a big enough
signal. There's the rotation for you

7130
02:43:28,469 --> 02:43:28,479
signal. There's the rotation for you
 

7131
02:43:28,479 --> 02:43:33,750
signal. There's the rotation for you
guys who love playing rotations.

7132
02:43:33,750 --> 02:43:33,760

 

7133
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:35,670

But you didn't hold my dick while I went

7134
02:43:35,670 --> 02:43:35,680
But you didn't hold my dick while I went
 

7135
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:44,469
But you didn't hold my dick while I went
for a pee pee.

7136
02:43:44,469 --> 02:43:44,479

 

7137
02:43:44,479 --> 02:43:48,389

Be nice, Alex. Don't be rude.

7138
02:43:48,389 --> 02:43:48,399
Be nice, Alex. Don't be rude.
 

7139
02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:57,110
Be nice, Alex. Don't be rude.
Don't be rude.

7140
02:43:57,110 --> 02:43:57,120

 

7141
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:00,469

Man, TJ, I'm with you. I am with you,

7142
02:44:00,469 --> 02:44:00,479
Man, TJ, I'm with you. I am with you,
 

7143
02:44:00,479 --> 02:44:02,630
Man, TJ, I'm with you. I am with you,
man.

7144
02:44:02,630 --> 02:44:02,640
man.
 

7145
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:07,590
man.
There's nothing I hate more. But

7146
02:44:07,590 --> 02:44:07,600
There's nothing I hate more. But
 

7147
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:10,710
There's nothing I hate more. But
I mean, if you like Edge to Edge, it's

7148
02:44:10,710 --> 02:44:10,720
I mean, if you like Edge to Edge, it's
 

7149
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:12,150
I mean, if you like Edge to Edge, it's
pretty good, isn't it? But there's

7150
02:44:12,150 --> 02:44:12,160
pretty good, isn't it? But there's
 

7151
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:14,630
pretty good, isn't it? But there's
nothing I hate more than a road, I am

7152
02:44:14,630 --> 02:44:14,640
nothing I hate more than a road, I am
 

7153
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:17,269
nothing I hate more than a road, I am
with you, buddy. I could not agree more.

7154
02:44:17,269 --> 02:44:17,279
with you, buddy. I could not agree more.
 

7155
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:24,309
with you, buddy. I could not agree more.
It's the opposite of what I like.

7156
02:44:24,309 --> 02:44:24,319

 

7157
02:44:24,319 --> 02:44:26,389

Looks like a head and shoulders. I mean,

7158
02:44:26,389 --> 02:44:26,399
Looks like a head and shoulders. I mean,
 

7159
02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:28,070
Looks like a head and shoulders. I mean,
yeah. I mean, if they build out enough

7160
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:28,080
yeah. I mean, if they build out enough
 

7161
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:29,910
yeah. I mean, if they build out enough
liquidity, you could argue it, but like

7162
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:29,920
liquidity, you could argue it, but like
 

7163
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:32,950
liquidity, you could argue it, but like
I said, all I'm saying is in here, this

7164
02:44:32,950 --> 02:44:32,960
I said, all I'm saying is in here, this
 

7165
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:34,630
I said, all I'm saying is in here, this
level here and this level here, they're

7166
02:44:34,630 --> 02:44:34,640
level here and this level here, they're
 

7167
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:37,030
level here and this level here, they're
short stuck. It really depends if they

7168
02:44:37,030 --> 02:44:37,040
short stuck. It really depends if they
 

7169
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:38,790
short stuck. It really depends if they
let them out. You're going to need to

7170
02:44:38,790 --> 02:44:38,800
let them out. You're going to need to
 

7171
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:40,950
let them out. You're going to need to
break away from here. And I think the

7172
02:44:40,950 --> 02:44:40,960
break away from here. And I think the
 

7173
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:42,710
break away from here. And I think the
better trade really if you want

7174
02:44:42,710 --> 02:44:42,720
better trade really if you want
 

7175
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:44,950
better trade really if you want
confirmation would be that. I think

7176
02:44:44,950 --> 02:44:44,960
confirmation would be that. I think
 

7177
02:44:44,960 --> 02:44:47,429
confirmation would be that. I think
playing in here is very, very risky. It

7178
02:44:47,429 --> 02:44:47,439
playing in here is very, very risky. It
 

7179
02:44:47,439 --> 02:44:49,510
playing in here is very, very risky. It
will rotate. It looked above. It will

7180
02:44:49,510 --> 02:44:49,520
will rotate. It looked above. It will
 

7181
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:53,190
will rotate. It looked above. It will
rotate. It needs to leave buyers trapped

7182
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:53,200
rotate. It needs to leave buyers trapped
 

7183
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:55,349
rotate. It needs to leave buyers trapped
and it needs to let these sellers out.

7184
02:44:55,349 --> 02:44:55,359
and it needs to let these sellers out.
 

7185
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:56,950
and it needs to let these sellers out.
The problem is now you've got to

7186
02:44:56,950 --> 02:44:56,960
The problem is now you've got to
 

7187
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,389
The problem is now you've got to
understand what the market's done this

7188
02:44:58,389 --> 02:44:58,399
understand what the market's done this
 

7189
02:44:58,399 --> 02:45:00,389
understand what the market's done this
morning. Sellers are trapped here and

7190
02:45:00,389 --> 02:45:00,399
morning. Sellers are trapped here and
 

7191
02:45:00,399 --> 02:45:02,710
morning. Sellers are trapped here and
here. Buyers are trapped here and people

7192
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:02,720
here. Buyers are trapped here and people
 

7193
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:04,309
here. Buyers are trapped here and people
here are in balance. All right, so

7194
02:45:04,309 --> 02:45:04,319
here are in balance. All right, so
 

7195
02:45:04,319 --> 02:45:05,670
here are in balance. All right, so
here's your edge where sellers are

7196
02:45:05,670 --> 02:45:05,680
here's your edge where sellers are
 

7197
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:07,269
here's your edge where sellers are
trapped. Here's where buyers are

7198
02:45:07,269 --> 02:45:07,279
trapped. Here's where buyers are
 

7199
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:09,590
trapped. Here's where buyers are
trapped. Here's the balance, right? You

7200
02:45:09,590 --> 02:45:09,600
trapped. Here's the balance, right? You
 

7201
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:11,590
trapped. Here's the balance, right? You
can see it. It stands out. All right,

7202
02:45:11,590 --> 02:45:11,600
can see it. It stands out. All right,
 

7203
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:13,190
can see it. It stands out. All right,
that's the balance. Until you leave

7204
02:45:13,190 --> 02:45:13,200
that's the balance. Until you leave
 

7205
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:15,269
that's the balance. Until you leave
balance, and I'd say leave where people

7206
02:45:15,269 --> 02:45:15,279
balance, and I'd say leave where people
 

7207
02:45:15,279 --> 02:45:16,870
balance, and I'd say leave where people
are trapped, you're just going to get

7208
02:45:16,870 --> 02:45:16,880
are trapped, you're just going to get
 

7209
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:18,630
are trapped, you're just going to get
rotations.

7210
02:45:18,630 --> 02:45:18,640
rotations.
 

7211
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:20,389
rotations.
Do you understand how the liquidity's

7212
02:45:20,389 --> 02:45:20,399
Do you understand how the liquidity's
 

7213
02:45:20,399 --> 02:45:21,750
Do you understand how the liquidity's
been built out? Because if you're just

7214
02:45:21,750 --> 02:45:21,760
been built out? Because if you're just
 

7215
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:23,510
been built out? Because if you're just
looking at that and you're going to play

7216
02:45:23,510 --> 02:45:23,520
looking at that and you're going to play
 

7217
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:25,110
looking at that and you're going to play
that, you might find yourself getting

7218
02:45:25,110 --> 02:45:25,120
that, you might find yourself getting
 

7219
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:27,429
that, you might find yourself getting
caught because these guys need to cover

7220
02:45:27,429 --> 02:45:27,439
caught because these guys need to cover
 

7221
02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:29,110
caught because these guys need to cover
to get relief. All right, if they're

7222
02:45:29,110 --> 02:45:29,120
to get relief. All right, if they're
 

7223
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:30,790
to get relief. All right, if they're
stuck and they dip down and they're

7224
02:45:30,790 --> 02:45:30,800
stuck and they dip down and they're
 

7225
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:31,990
stuck and they dip down and they're
like, "Thank [\h__\h] for that. I can get

7226
02:45:31,990 --> 02:45:32,000
like, "Thank [\h__\h] for that. I can get
 

7227

02:45:33,269 --> 02:45:33,279
out break even." You go straight back
 

7229
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:35,190
out break even." You go straight back
inside range. All right, this is the

7230
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:35,200
inside range. All right, this is the
 

7231
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:36,710
inside range. All right, this is the
problem. What's the lowhanging fruit?

7232
02:45:36,710 --> 02:45:36,720
problem. What's the lowhanging fruit?
 

7233
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:38,550
problem. What's the lowhanging fruit?
Previous day low. What's the other hang

7234
02:45:38,550 --> 02:45:38,560
Previous day low. What's the other hang
 

7235
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:39,990
Previous day low. What's the other hang
low hanging fruit? Previous day value

7236
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:40,000
low hanging fruit? Previous day value
 

7237
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,070
low hanging fruit? Previous day value
area low. Have we taken them? Yes. So,

7238
02:45:42,070 --> 02:45:42,080
area low. Have we taken them? Yes. So,
 

7239
02:45:42,080 --> 02:45:43,429
area low. Have we taken them? Yes. So,
if you're going to play short side, what

7240
02:45:43,429 --> 02:45:43,439
if you're going to play short side, what
 

7241
02:45:43,439 --> 02:45:45,269
if you're going to play short side, what
are you aiming for down here? The only

7242
02:45:45,269 --> 02:45:45,279
are you aiming for down here? The only
 

7243
02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:48,389
are you aiming for down here? The only
way to do that is this. In my mind, the

7244
02:45:48,389 --> 02:45:48,399
way to do that is this. In my mind, the
 

7245
02:45:48,399 --> 02:45:51,510
way to do that is this. In my mind, the
only way we get there safely is if we

7246
02:45:51,510 --> 02:45:51,520
only way we get there safely is if we
 

7247
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:54,389
only way we get there safely is if we
reject here. I need to know that all of

7248
02:45:54,389 --> 02:45:54,399
reject here. I need to know that all of
 

7249
02:45:54,399 --> 02:45:56,150
reject here. I need to know that all of
this becomes trapped if I really think

7250
02:45:56,150 --> 02:45:56,160
this becomes trapped if I really think
 

7251
02:45:56,160 --> 02:45:58,630
this becomes trapped if I really think
we're going to trade down to there.

7252
02:45:58,630 --> 02:45:58,640
we're going to trade down to there.
 

7253
02:45:58,640 --> 02:46:01,830
we're going to trade down to there.

02:46:16,150 --> 02:46:16,160
man, I've been there. It happens. The
 

7263
02:46:16,160 --> 02:46:18,550
man, I've been there. It happens. The
good thing is that the market's open 23

7264
02:46:18,550 --> 02:46:18,560
good thing is that the market's open 23

02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:15,990
Dr. Wall Street, I'm honestly surprised
you don't have a larger audience. It's

02:47:15,990 --> 02:47:16,000
you don't have a larger audience. It's
 

7319
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,150
you don't have a larger audience. It's
because I'm not

what's the right way of putting it? I
don't fit the demographic. I think if I

don't fit the demographic. I think if I
 

7327
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:32,469
don't fit the demographic. I think if I

02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,110
if we have trap trap participants in the
market

market
 

7363
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:21,030

that's where where I'm interested.

that's where where I'm interested.
 

7365

that's where where I'm interested.

them we play multi-time frame one way

7368
02:48:30,309 --> 02:48:30,319
them we play multi-time frame one way
 

7369
02:48:30,319 --> 02:48:32,389
them we play multi-time frame one way
same as we're getting today right can't

7370
02:48:32,389 --> 02:48:32,399
same as we're getting today right can't
 

7371
02:48:32,399 --> 02:48:33,910
same as we're getting today right can't
get back inside range we're going this

7372
02:48:33,910 --> 02:48:33,920
get back inside range we're going this
 

7373
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:36,710
get back inside range we're going this
way it's why I'm focused on shorts

7374
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:36,720
way it's why I'm focused on shorts
 

7375
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,630
way it's why I'm focused on shorts
okay if we come down here and we base

7376
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:38,640
okay if we come down here and we base
 

7377
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:40,790
okay if we come down here and we base
for a bit and then we leave volume here

7378
02:48:40,790 --> 02:48:40,800
for a bit and then we leave volume here
 

7379
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:43,349
for a bit and then we leave volume here
we can trade back upside into it then

7380
02:48:43,349 --> 02:48:43,359
we can trade back upside into it then
 

7381
02:48:43,359 --> 02:48:47,190
we can trade back upside into it then
it' be an A+ long um so yeah same as we

7382
02:48:47,190 --> 02:48:47,200
it' be an A+ long um so yeah same as we
 

7383
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:49,030
it' be an A+ long um so yeah same as we
played when we left the shorts at the

7384
02:48:49,030 --> 02:48:49,040
played when we left the shorts at the
 

7385
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:51,750
played when we left the shorts at the
highs same as here, right? This is was

7386
02:48:51,750 --> 02:48:51,760
highs same as here, right? This is was
 

7387
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:54,550
highs same as here, right? This is was
an A+ trade for us a few weeks ago.

7388
02:48:54,550 --> 02:48:54,560
an A+ trade for us a few weeks ago.
 

7389
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:56,550
an A+ trade for us a few weeks ago.
Volume's all trapped up here. We lean on

7390
02:48:56,550 --> 02:48:56,560
Volume's all trapped up here. We lean on
 

7391
02:48:56,560 --> 02:48:59,349
Volume's all trapped up here. We lean on
it short. We lean on it short, right? We

7392
02:48:59,349 --> 02:48:59,359
it short. We lean on it short, right? We
 

7393
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:05,190
it short. We lean on it short, right? We
leave these guys trapped,

7394
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:05,200

 

7395
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:06,870

right? Which is why if too many shorts

7396
02:49:06,870 --> 02:49:06,880
right? Which is why if too many shorts
 

7397
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:09,269
right? Which is why if too many shorts
come in, what would be really nice over

7398
02:49:09,269 --> 02:49:09,279
come in, what would be really nice over
 

7399
02:49:09,279 --> 02:49:10,790
come in, what would be really nice over
the next few weeks if they want to do

7400
02:49:10,790 --> 02:49:10,800
the next few weeks if they want to do
 

7401
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:12,790
the next few weeks if they want to do
the long, I don't know, but if they do,

7402
02:49:12,790 --> 02:49:12,800
the long, I don't know, but if they do,
 

7403
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:14,950
the long, I don't know, but if they do,
if they do something like this, be

7404
02:49:14,950 --> 02:49:14,960
if they do something like this, be
 

7405
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:16,790
if they do something like this, be
really nice. If we can leave shorts who

7406
02:49:16,790 --> 02:49:16,800
really nice. If we can leave shorts who
 

7407
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:19,030
really nice. If we can leave shorts who
are not respecting this, leave them

7408
02:49:19,030 --> 02:49:19,040
are not respecting this, leave them
 

7409
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:21,990
are not respecting this, leave them
trapped. we play the reversal back up.

7410
02:49:21,990 --> 02:49:22,000
trapped. we play the reversal back up.
 

7411
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,950
trapped. we play the reversal back up.
So that that's it. So the same on what

7412
02:49:24,950 --> 02:49:24,960
So that that's it. So the same on what
 

7413
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:27,590
So that that's it. So the same on what
would that look like if I come up? I got

7414
02:49:27,590 --> 02:49:27,600
would that look like if I come up? I got
 

7415
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:29,990
would that look like if I come up? I got
to come high. So like if I wanted to

7416
02:49:29,990 --> 02:49:30,000
to come high. So like if I wanted to
 

7417
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,550
to come high. So like if I wanted to
play the long, I'd want the higher time

7418
02:49:32,550 --> 02:49:32,560
play the long, I'd want the higher time
 

7419
02:49:32,560 --> 02:49:34,790
play the long, I'd want the higher time
frame to be doing this,

7420
02:49:34,790 --> 02:49:34,800
frame to be doing this,
 

7421
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:37,750
frame to be doing this,
right? And I'd want to play in here on a

7422
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:37,760
right? And I'd want to play in here on a
 

7423
02:49:37,760 --> 02:49:39,510
right? And I'd want to play in here on a
lower time frame, which would look like

7424
02:49:39,510 --> 02:49:39,520
lower time frame, which would look like
 

7425
02:49:39,520 --> 02:49:41,190
lower time frame, which would look like
something like this, and leaving shorts

7426
02:49:41,190 --> 02:49:41,200
something like this, and leaving shorts
 

7427
02:49:41,200 --> 02:49:42,950
something like this, and leaving shorts
exposed to go back upside. But I'd want

7428
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:42,960
exposed to go back upside. But I'd want
 

7429
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:45,429
exposed to go back upside. But I'd want
the pro trend to be up. At the moment

7430
02:49:45,429 --> 02:49:45,439
the pro trend to be up. At the moment
 

7431
02:49:45,439 --> 02:49:46,870
the pro trend to be up. At the moment
we're doing the opposite because the

7432
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:46,880
we're doing the opposite because the
 

7433
02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:49,429
we're doing the opposite because the
higher time frame is leaving volume

7434
02:49:49,429 --> 02:49:49,439
higher time frame is leaving volume
 

7435
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:51,030
higher time frame is leaving volume
trap. So the higher time frame is doing

7436
02:49:51,030 --> 02:49:51,040
trap. So the higher time frame is doing
 

7437
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:53,590
trap. So the higher time frame is doing
this, right? And I want to play against

7438
02:49:53,590 --> 02:49:53,600
this, right? And I want to play against
 

7439
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:56,230
this, right? And I want to play against
this in the lower time frame which would

7440
02:49:56,230 --> 02:49:56,240
this in the lower time frame which would
 

7441
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:59,110
this in the lower time frame which would
look like this. All right? And that's

7442
02:49:59,110 --> 02:49:59,120
look like this. All right? And that's
 

7443
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:01,349
look like this. All right? And that's
why I want to join the trend which has

7444
02:50:01,349 --> 02:50:01,359
why I want to join the trend which has
 

7445
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:03,110
why I want to join the trend which has
developed higher time frame. I want my

7446
02:50:03,110 --> 02:50:03,120
developed higher time frame. I want my
 

7447
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,950
developed higher time frame. I want my
lower time frame, higher time frame to

7448
02:50:04,950 --> 02:50:04,960
lower time frame, higher time frame to
 

7449
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:08,230
lower time frame, higher time frame to
be in alignment. Which is why you saw me

7450
02:50:08,230 --> 02:50:08,240
be in alignment. Which is why you saw me
 

7451
02:50:08,240 --> 02:50:10,950
be in alignment. Which is why you saw me
today say this is probable, but I won't

7452
02:50:10,950 --> 02:50:10,960
today say this is probable, but I won't
 

7453
02:50:10,960 --> 02:50:12,950
today say this is probable, but I won't
trade it. I'll let it peak out just like

7454
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:12,960
trade it. I'll let it peak out just like
 

7455
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:15,349
trade it. I'll let it peak out just like
Friday and play the downside because

7456
02:50:15,349 --> 02:50:15,359
Friday and play the downside because
 

7457
02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:18,070
Friday and play the downside because
this is where higher time frame wants to

7458
02:50:18,070 --> 02:50:18,080
this is where higher time frame wants to
 

7459
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:20,309
this is where higher time frame wants to
play. I want to play in line with the

7460
02:50:20,309 --> 02:50:20,319
play. I want to play in line with the
 

7461
02:50:20,319 --> 02:50:23,269
play. I want to play in line with the
funds. I want to find a whale in the

7462
02:50:23,269 --> 02:50:23,279
funds. I want to find a whale in the
 

7463
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:25,110
funds. I want to find a whale in the
market who wants to sell and I want to

7464
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:25,120
market who wants to sell and I want to
 

7465
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:35,830
market who wants to sell and I want to
get in his slipstream.

7466

and lots of confluence. So, I'm just
going to ask ask answer a few questions

7994
03:02:27,190 --> 03:02:27,200
going to ask ask answer a few questions
 

7995
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:36,070
going to ask ask answer a few questions
before I get off here. Um,

7996
03:02:36,070 --> 03:02:36,080

you don't already have it. All right. Or

8024
03:03:08,150 --> 03:03:08,160
you don't already have it. All right. Or
 

8025
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:10,469
you don't already have it. All right. Or
if you use something else you can have

8026
03:03:10,469 --> 03:03:10,479
if you use something else you can have
 

8027
03:03:10,479 --> 03:03:12,389
if you use something else you can have

8031
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:23,750

If you buy multiple challenges, is it

8032
03:03:23,750 --> 03:03:23,760
If you buy multiple challenges, is it
 

8033
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:25,349
If you buy multiple challenges, is it
better to pass them all at once or do

8034
03:03:25,349 --> 03:03:25,359
better to pass them all at once or do
 

8035
03:03:25,359 --> 03:03:26,870
better to pass them all at once or do
you trade them at once at a time? Um,

8036
03:03:26,870 --> 03:03:26,880
you trade them at once at a time? Um,
 

8037
03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:28,389
you trade them at once at a time? Um,
that really depends on your success

8038
03:03:28,389 --> 03:03:28,399
that really depends on your success
 

8039
03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:31,510
that really depends on your success
rate. Are you comfortable as a trader?

8040
03:03:31,510 --> 03:03:31,520
rate. Are you comfortable as a trader?
 

8041
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:33,269
rate. Are you comfortable as a trader?
How much of a rush are you in? Have you

8042
03:03:33,269 --> 03:03:33,279
How much of a rush are you in? Have you
 

8043
03:03:33,279 --> 03:03:37,429
How much of a rush are you in? Have you
got proven a proven uh ability to

8044
03:03:37,429 --> 03:03:37,439
got proven a proven uh ability to
 

8045
03:03:37,439 --> 03:03:38,950
got proven a proven uh ability to
pass accounts and trade well? If you

8046
03:03:38,950 --> 03:03:38,960
pass accounts and trade well? If you
 

8047
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:40,550
pass accounts and trade well? If you
know what you're doing, stack them

8048
03:03:40,550 --> 03:03:40,560
know what you're doing, stack them
 

8049
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:43,190
know what you're doing, stack them
together. If you know you're not fully

8050
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:43,200
together. If you know you're not fully
 

8051
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:45,670
together. If you know you're not fully
confident yet, one at a time. Why spend

8052
03:03:45,670 --> 03:03:45,680
confident yet, one at a time. Why spend
 

8053
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:47,990
confident yet, one at a time. Why spend
the money doing 20 in one go if you've

8054
03:03:47,990 --> 03:03:48,000
the money doing 20 in one go if you've
 

8055
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:49,429
the money doing 20 in one go if you've
not got a proven track record? Because

8056
03:03:49,429 --> 03:03:49,439
not got a proven track record? Because
 

8057
03:03:49,439 --> 03:03:51,670
not got a proven track record? Because
you don't want to blow 20 in one go. So,

8058
03:03:51,670 --> 03:03:51,680
you don't want to blow 20 in one go. So,
 

8059
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:54,070
you don't want to blow 20 in one go. So,
learn to pass one. Watch I've done a

8060
03:03:54,070 --> 03:03:54,080
learn to pass one. Watch I've done a
 

8061
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:56,309
learn to pass one. Watch I've done a
video on it. Pass one, get paid from

8062
03:03:56,309 --> 03:03:56,319
video on it. Pass one, get paid from
 

8063
03:03:56,319 --> 03:03:59,429
video on it. Pass one, get paid from
one, buy three more, get paid, do that,

8064
03:03:59,429 --> 03:03:59,439
one, buy three more, get paid, do that,
 

8065
03:03:59,439 --> 03:04:01,349
one, buy three more, get paid, do that,
buy two more, then buy five more, then

8066
03:04:01,349 --> 03:04:01,359
buy two more, then buy five more, then
 

8067
03:04:01,359 --> 03:04:02,550
buy two more, then buy five more, then
five more, then five. You don't need to

8068
03:04:02,550 --> 03:04:02,560
five more, then five. You don't need to
 

8069
03:04:02,560 --> 03:04:06,790
five more, then five. You don't need to
do it all together,

8070
03:04:06,790 --> 03:04:06,800

 

8071
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:10,309

right? So, manage manage your your own

8072
03:04:10,309 --> 03:04:10,319
right? So, manage manage your your own
 

8073
03:04:10,319 --> 03:04:12,550
right? So, manage manage your your own
risk. Your risk with prop firms,

8074
03:04:12,550 --> 03:04:12,560
risk. Your risk with prop firms,
 

8075
03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:14,230
risk. Your risk with prop firms,
remember, is what you invest in that

8076
03:04:14,230 --> 03:04:14,240
remember, is what you invest in that
 

8077
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:15,990
remember, is what you invest in that
account with how much you pay for it.

8078
03:04:15,990 --> 03:04:16,000
account with how much you pay for it.
 

8079
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:19,190
account with how much you pay for it.
So, if your pass rate is high, you're

8080
03:04:19,190 --> 03:04:19,200
So, if your pass rate is high, you're
 

8081
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:22,870
So, if your pass rate is high, you're
eliminating your risk factor.

8082
03:04:22,870 --> 03:04:22,880

 

8083
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:25,269

03:04:25,269 --> 03:04:25,279
Alex, does YouTube do commands you can
 

8085
03:04:25,279 --> 03:04:26,710
Alex, does YouTube do commands you can
type in chat? Like for example, if

8086

type in chat? Like for example, if
 

8087
03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:28,950
type in chat? Like for example, if
someone asks, "How do I get Discord? Can

8088
03:04:28,950 --> 03:04:28,960
someone asks, "How do I get Discord? Can
 

8089
03:04:28,960 --> 03:04:30,870
someone asks, "How do I get Discord? Can
you do a disc?" Oh, that's a good idea.

8090

I don't know. Um, that's a really good
idea, Adam.

8094
03:04:37,429 --> 03:04:37,439
