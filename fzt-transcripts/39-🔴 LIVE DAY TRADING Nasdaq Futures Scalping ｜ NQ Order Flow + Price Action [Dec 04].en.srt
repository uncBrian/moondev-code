All right, morning team. Sorry, running

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,070
slightly behind here.
Let's get ourselves set up for the day.

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
Let's get ourselves set up for the day.

Let's get ourselves set up for the day.
Uh daily looking like it wants to break

8
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
Uh daily looking like it wants to break
 

9
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,990
Uh daily looking like it wants to break
out.

10
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
out.
 

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,469
out.
Uh it doesn't look good. I'm going to be

12
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
Uh it doesn't look good. I'm going to be
 

13
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,510
Uh it doesn't look good. I'm going to be
honest with you guys. Right. still not

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
honest with you guys. Right. still not
 

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,830
honest with you guys. Right. still not
even past holiday volume. All right,

16
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
even past holiday volume. All right,
 

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,910
even past holiday volume. All right,
this week has been awful. There's no

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
this week has been awful. There's no
 

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,670
this week has been awful. There's no
doubt about it. Uh we can't call it

20
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
doubt about it. Uh we can't call it
 

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,510
doubt about it. Uh we can't call it
anything other than that. It's very very

22
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
anything other than that. It's very very
 

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,350
anything other than that. It's very very
low volume. Uh every pullback has held.

24
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
low volume. Uh every pullback has held.
 

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,350
low volume. Uh every pullback has held.
Hasn't taken out any liquidity. Hasn't

26
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
Hasn't taken out any liquidity. Hasn't
 

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,510
Hasn't taken out any liquidity. Hasn't
put in a firm higher low down here. Is

28
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
put in a firm higher low down here. Is
 

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,789
put in a firm higher low down here. Is
in a straight drift higher. And this is

30
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
in a straight drift higher. And this is
 

31
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,710
in a straight drift higher. And this is
a very very dangerous pattern. All

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
a very very dangerous pattern. All
 

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,389
a very very dangerous pattern. All
right, it's very very very dangerous.

34
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
right, it's very very very dangerous.
 

35
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,069
right, it's very very very dangerous.
There's no two ways about it. I don't

36
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
There's no two ways about it. I don't
 

37
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,230
There's no two ways about it. I don't
care what anyone's saying. It's very

38
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
care what anyone's saying. It's very
 

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,830
care what anyone's saying. It's very
dangerous. If you buy up here, maybe you

40
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
dangerous. If you buy up here, maybe you
 

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,990
dangerous. If you buy up here, maybe you
get lucky and you get the squeeze. Just

42
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
get lucky and you get the squeeze. Just
 

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,069
get lucky and you get the squeeze. Just
as much chance the door gets slammed on

44
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
as much chance the door gets slammed on
 

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,830
as much chance the door gets slammed on
your face because we haven't set a firm

46
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
your face because we haven't set a firm
 

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,910
your face because we haven't set a firm
higher low. All right, we we're not

48
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
higher low. All right, we we're not
 

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,830
higher low. All right, we we're not
setting if we think about how we like to

50
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
setting if we think about how we like to
 

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,110
setting if we think about how we like to
move with structure. All right, sweeping

52
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
move with structure. All right, sweeping
 

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,030
move with structure. All right, sweeping
lows, protecting lows. All right,

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
bottom, go with some pullbacks in
 

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,589
bottom, go with some pullbacks in
between. All right, that's nice bullish

60
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
between. All right, that's nice bullish
 

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,190

structure. These are nice bullish

62
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
structure. These are nice bullish
 

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,710

structure moves like big breakout, pull

64
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
structure moves like big breakout, pull
 

65
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,910
structure moves like big breakout, pull
back for multiple days, hold, build a

66
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
back for multiple days, hold, build a
 

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,430
back for multiple days, hold, build a
base, go. That's what we want to see as

68
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
base, go. That's what we want to see as
 

69
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,150
base, go. That's what we want to see as
a bull. All right, in a market. What we

70
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
a bull. All right, in a market. What we
 

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,630
a bull. All right, in a market. What we
don't want to see is a low volume drift

72
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
don't want to see is a low volume drift
 

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,949
don't want to see is a low volume drift
higher without ever coming back. I don't

74
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
higher without ever coming back. I don't
 

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,390
higher without ever coming back. I don't
care about this little white candle

76
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
care about this little white candle
 

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,949
care about this little white candle
here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Nine straight

78
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Nine straight
 

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,949
here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Nine straight
days without any notable pullback on

80
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
days without any notable pullback on
 

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,350
days without any notable pullback on
terrible volume. It's dangerous. It's

82
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
terrible volume. It's dangerous. It's
 

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,869
terrible volume. It's dangerous. It's
dangerous. It's as simple as that. I

84
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
dangerous. It's as simple as that. I
 

85
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,150
dangerous. It's as simple as that. I
don't care what you're trading, what

86
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
don't care what you're trading, what
 

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,630
don't care what you're trading, what
product it is. This is dangerous. If

88
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
product it is. This is dangerous. If
 

89
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,990
product it is. This is dangerous. If
you're going to buy now, you're buying

90
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
you're going to buy now, you're buying
 

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,830
you're going to buy now, you're buying
near this pivot. You're buying near

92
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
near this pivot. You're buying near
 

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,149
near this pivot. You're buying near
probably the target. And what's your

94
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
probably the target. And what's your
 

95
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,589
probably the target. And what's your
risk going to be? Probably all the way

96
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
risk going to be? Probably all the way
 

97
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,630
risk going to be? Probably all the way
down here. So, it's not ideal. So, all

98
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
down here. So, it's not ideal. So, all
 

99
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,990
down here. So, it's not ideal. So, all
we can do is trade what's in front of

100
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
we can do is trade what's in front of
 

101
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,830
we can do is trade what's in front of
us. The market's showing its hand at the

102
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
us. The market's showing its hand at the
 

103
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,630
us. The market's showing its hand at the
moment. It's just been well, a bit of a

104
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
moment. It's just been well, a bit of a
 

105
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,910
moment. It's just been well, a bit of a
bit of a knob the last few days, and

106
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
bit of a knob the last few days, and
 

107
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,350
bit of a knob the last few days, and
that's what we've got. So we can only

108
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
that's what we've got. So we can only
 

109
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,270
that's what we've got. So we can only
only trade what's in front of us. All

110
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
only trade what's in front of us. All
 

111
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,270
only trade what's in front of us. All
right. Hourly. Let's have a look. So

112
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
right. Hourly. Let's have a look. So
 

113
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,470
right. Hourly. Let's have a look. So
yesterday, double bottom into that big

114
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
yesterday, double bottom into that big
 

115
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,430
yesterday, double bottom into that big
spy gamma level down here. All right. No

116
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
spy gamma level down here. All right. No
 

117
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,110
spy gamma level down here. All right. No
sweep. Protected this block here. Found

118
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
sweep. Protected this block here. Found
 

119
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,309
sweep. Protected this block here. Found
a bid and just like slow grind all the

120
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
a bid and just like slow grind all the
 

121
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,270
a bid and just like slow grind all the
way back up sideways

122
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
way back up sideways
 

123
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,430
way back up sideways
overnight just like we did yesterday

124
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
overnight just like we did yesterday
 

125
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,030
overnight just like we did yesterday
overnight. Exactly the same pattern. So,

126
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
overnight. Exactly the same pattern. So,
 

127
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,869
overnight. Exactly the same pattern. So,
we've got liquidity there to use, but

128
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
we've got liquidity there to use, but
 

129
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,430
we've got liquidity there to use, but
unfortunately about 15 20 minutes ago,

130
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
unfortunately about 15 20 minutes ago,
 

131
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,030
unfortunately about 15 20 minutes ago,
it just decided it was going to do a 100

132
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
it just decided it was going to do a 100
 

133
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,589
it just decided it was going to do a 100
point move and hit TP1. So, you know,

134
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
point move and hit TP1. So, you know,
 

135
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,910
point move and hit TP1. So, you know,
this is what I mean. Like on on no

136
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
this is what I mean. Like on on no
 

137
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,070
this is what I mean. Like on on no
volume, off absolutely thin air, we've

138
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
volume, off absolutely thin air, we've
 

139
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,750
volume, off absolutely thin air, we've
just gone and done TP1. So, if you're

140
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
just gone and done TP1. So, if you're
 

141
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,429
just gone and done TP1. So, if you're
going to buy this now, you better know

142
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
going to buy this now, you better know
 

143
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,949
going to buy this now, you better know
that one of your low hanging fruits has

144
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
that one of your low hanging fruits has
 

145
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,229
that one of your low hanging fruits has
gone and the only thing left right now

146
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
gone and the only thing left right now
 

147
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,190
gone and the only thing left right now
is 833 to aim for. And that is the

148
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
is 833 to aim for. And that is the
 

149
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,949
is 833 to aim for. And that is the
problem with the market at the moment.

150
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
problem with the market at the moment.
 

151
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,509
problem with the market at the moment.
It's it's being very silly doing these

152
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
It's it's being very silly doing these
 

153
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,630
It's it's being very silly doing these
moves. It's probably because there's a

154
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
moves. It's probably because there's a
 

155
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,750
moves. It's probably because there's a
lot of shorts caught cuz everyone knows

156
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
lot of shorts caught cuz everyone knows
 

157
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,670
lot of shorts caught cuz everyone knows
this is not a healthy market moving this

158
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
this is not a healthy market moving this
 

159
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,590
this is not a healthy market moving this
way. But what they don't understand is

160
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
way. But what they don't understand is
 

161
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,909
way. But what they don't understand is
you can keep guessing short all you

162
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
you can keep guessing short all you
 

163
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,070
you can keep guessing short all you
want, but until there's a breakdown and

164
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
want, but until there's a breakdown and
 

165
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,310
want, but until there's a breakdown and
a retest, there's no reason for it to go

166
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
a retest, there's no reason for it to go
 

167
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,110
a retest, there's no reason for it to go
lower. So, you've probably got shorts

168
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
lower. So, you've probably got shorts
 

169
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,749
lower. So, you've probably got shorts
trying and trying and trying and trying

170
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
trying and trying and trying and trying
 

171
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,430
trying and trying and trying and trying
and getting blown out. All right, the

172
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
and getting blown out. All right, the
 

173
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,150
and getting blown out. All right, the
target's very clear. TP1's just got

174
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
target's very clear. TP1's just got
 

175
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,870
target's very clear. TP1's just got
taken, which is this pivot from uh the

176
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
taken, which is this pivot from uh the
 

177
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,510
taken, which is this pivot from uh the
13th of November. TP2 is probably this

178
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
13th of November. TP2 is probably this
 

179
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,990
13th of November. TP2 is probably this
double top up here 832 and then if you

180
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
double top up here 832 and then if you
 

181
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,870
double top up here 832 and then if you
get lucky the edge of this old balance

182
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
get lucky the edge of this old balance
 

183
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,710
get lucky the edge of this old balance
range right we talked about this

184
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
range right we talked about this
 

185
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,950
range right we talked about this
numerous times now there's a twoe

186
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
numerous times now there's a twoe
 

187
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,270
numerous times now there's a twoe
balance range here we're starting to get

188
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
balance range here we're starting to get
 

189
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,350
balance range here we're starting to get
through some of it the very edge of it

190
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
through some of it the very edge of it
 

191
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,270
through some of it the very edge of it
will be into sort of 8.91 you might as

192
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
will be into sort of 8.91 you might as
 

193
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,550
will be into sort of 8.91 you might as
well call it 900 once we get into 900 if

194
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
well call it 900 once we get into 900 if
 

195
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,230
well call it 900 once we get into 900 if
we base here we're going to go for

196
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
we base here we're going to go for
 

197
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,749
we base here we're going to go for
alltime highs this is where we have one

198
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
alltime highs this is where we have one
 

199
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,230
alltime highs this is where we have one
more week's balanced range right which

200
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
more week's balanced range right which
 

201
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,070
more week's balanced range right which
we've rejected from these are the buyers

202
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
we've rejected from these are the buyers
 

203
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,350
we've rejected from these are the buyers
that have bought the alltime high and

204
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
that have bought the alltime high and
 

205
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,830
that have bought the alltime high and
got caught. It seems to me like it's

206
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
got caught. It seems to me like it's
 

207
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,909
got caught. It seems to me like it's
adamant on going up there right now. So,

208
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
adamant on going up there right now. So,
 

209
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,590
adamant on going up there right now. So,
we can't ignore that. All right, we

210
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
we can't ignore that. All right, we
 

211
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,909
we can't ignore that. All right, we
cannot ignore that. So, you know, we're

212
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
cannot ignore that. So, you know, we're
 

213
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,870
cannot ignore that. So, you know, we're
bullish on pullbacks. If they hold uh

214
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
bullish on pullbacks. If they hold uh
 

215
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,749
bullish on pullbacks. If they hold uh
you want to be very careful, though.

216
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
you want to be very careful, though.
 

217
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,790
you want to be very careful, though.
If we don't hold the top of this or the

218
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
If we don't hold the top of this or the
 

219
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,270
If we don't hold the top of this or the
bottom of this, we will collapse. All

220
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
bottom of this, we will collapse. All
 

221
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,390
bottom of this, we will collapse. All
right. So, this area in here becomes

222
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
right. So, this area in here becomes
 

223
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,150
right. So, this area in here becomes
absolutely key for sentiment for the

224
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
absolutely key for sentiment for the
 

225
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,830
absolutely key for sentiment for the
rest of the day. Bulls have got to hold

226
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
rest of the day. Bulls have got to hold
 

227
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,990
rest of the day. Bulls have got to hold
this. If they want to go on parade, it's

228
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
this. If they want to go on parade, it's
 

229
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,150
this. If they want to go on parade, it's
very simple. They have to hold this blue

230
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
very simple. They have to hold this blue
 

231
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,550
very simple. They have to hold this blue
box. If they fail to hold that blue box,

232
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
box. If they fail to hold that blue box,
 

233
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,550
box. If they fail to hold that blue box,
all it means is we're either going back

234
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
all it means is we're either going back
 

235
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,110
all it means is we're either going back
into range in here, which would be very

236
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
into range in here, which would be very
 

237
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,710
into range in here, which would be very
bad after a breakout, or we're going to

238
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
bad after a breakout, or we're going to
 

239
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,310
bad after a breakout, or we're going to
lose that range and come back for these

240
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
lose that range and come back for these
 

241
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,830
lose that range and come back for these
double bottoms down here, which would be

242
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
double bottoms down here, which would be
 

243
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,670
double bottoms down here, which would be
a failed breakout, a look above and

244
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
a failed breakout, a look above and
 

245
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,510
a failed breakout, a look above and
fail. So, we want to be aware of that,

246
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
fail. So, we want to be aware of that,
 

247
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,550
fail. So, we want to be aware of that,
right? That's those are the things that

248
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
right? That's those are the things that
 

249
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,990
right? That's those are the things that
we're looking at basically. Why has that

250
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
we're looking at basically. Why has that
 

251
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,670
we're looking at basically. Why has that
gone red? We don't want that. There we

252
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
gone red? We don't want that. There we
 

253
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,029
gone red? We don't want that. There we
go.

254
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
go.
 

255
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,590
go.
Okay, let's move up and uh have a look

256
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
Okay, let's move up and uh have a look
 

257
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,029
Okay, let's move up and uh have a look
at what's going on elsewhere.

258
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039

 

259
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,309

Yes, same story. Me just zoom out on

260
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
Yes, same story. Me just zoom out on
 

261
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,029
Yes, same story. Me just zoom out on
this on a daily. Need to get Yeah, same

262
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
this on a daily. Need to get Yeah, same
 

263
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,309
this on a daily. Need to get Yeah, same
story. You can see what it's coming

264
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
story. You can see what it's coming
 

265
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,189
story. You can see what it's coming
into. We can move this up. I'd say this

266
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
into. We can move this up. I'd say this
 

267
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,590
into. We can move this up. I'd say this
is supply here right now. Starting to

268
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
is supply here right now. Starting to
 

269
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,830
is supply here right now. Starting to
get into it. Uh targets will be 93 and

270
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
get into it. Uh targets will be 93 and
 

271
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,830
get into it. Uh targets will be 93 and
basically the 900s through that alltime

272
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
basically the 900s through that alltime
 

273
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,749
basically the 900s through that alltime
highs. All right, that's what you're

274
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
highs. All right, that's what you're
 

275
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:43,189
highs. All right, that's what you're
looking at on ES these eyes in as well.

276
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199

 

277
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,309

I just want to see if there's any

278
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
I just want to see if there's any
 

279
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,590
I just want to see if there's any
divergence to the spiders.

280
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:49,600

 

281
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,749

Are we gapping up through that? All

282
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
Are we gapping up through that? All
 

283
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,990
Are we gapping up through that? All
right. I know 850 is a big gamma level

284
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
right. I know 850 is a big gamma level
 

285
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,110
right. I know 850 is a big gamma level
or it was yesterday on the spiders. Um,

286
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
or it was yesterday on the spiders. Um,
 

287
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,629
or it was yesterday on the spiders. Um,
so we're going to have to watch that.

288
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
so we're going to have to watch that.
 

289
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,390
so we're going to have to watch that.
Where's SPX? Here we go. All right. So,

290
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
Where's SPX? Here we go. All right. So,
 

291
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,469
Where's SPX? Here we go. All right. So,
85 big gamma level. We're through it so

292
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
85 big gamma level. We're through it so
 

293
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,150
85 big gamma level. We're through it so
far. If they hold 85, then you expect

294
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
far. If they hold 85, then you expect
 

295
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,510
far. If they hold 85, then you expect
them to come and take these out. So,

296
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
them to come and take these out. So,
 

297
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,749
them to come and take these out. So,
there are some slight divergence here

298
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
there are some slight divergence here
 

299
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,830
there are some slight divergence here
with the spy. So, it's looking to take

300
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
with the spy. So, it's looking to take
 

301
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,110
with the spy. So, it's looking to take
that liquidity. Let's just call it 86

302
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
that liquidity. Let's just call it 86
 

303
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,189
that liquidity. Let's just call it 86
and then 8660.

304
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
and then 8660.
 

305
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,830
and then 8660.
Any hold above 85 is very, very bullish.

306
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
Any hold above 85 is very, very bullish.
 

307
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,909
Any hold above 85 is very, very bullish.
If it fails to hold 85, this is the old

308
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
If it fails to hold 85, this is the old
 

309
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,670
If it fails to hold 85, this is the old
gamma level all the way down here at 80,

310
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
gamma level all the way down here at 80,
 

311
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,350
gamma level all the way down here at 80,
which we failed to close under. I would

312
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
which we failed to close under. I would
 

313
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,670
which we failed to close under. I would
say this market is not bearish. I'm

314
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
say this market is not bearish. I'm
 

315
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,189
say this market is not bearish. I'm
going to repeat this. It is not bearish

316
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
going to repeat this. It is not bearish
 

317
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,110
going to repeat this. It is not bearish
until it gets a close, a break, and a

318
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
until it gets a close, a break, and a
 

319
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,189
until it gets a close, a break, and a
retest of this to stay heavy. This is

320
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
retest of this to stay heavy. This is
 

321
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,870
retest of this to stay heavy. This is
bullish range rotation. It's uh adamant

322
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
bullish range rotation. It's uh adamant
 

323
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,110
bullish range rotation. It's uh adamant
and holding this for whatever reason the

324
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
and holding this for whatever reason the
 

325
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,790
and holding this for whatever reason the
dealers want to hold that level. So, it

326
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
dealers want to hold that level. So, it
 

327
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,629
dealers want to hold that level. So, it
is what it is. Market makers do not want

328
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
is what it is. Market makers do not want
 

329
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,589
is what it is. Market makers do not want
this market rolling under 680. And it's

330
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
this market rolling under 680. And it's
 

331
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,790
this market rolling under 680. And it's
probably because they need to get their

332
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
probably because they need to get their
 

333
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,309
probably because they need to get their
holiday bonus because they haven't made

334
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
holiday bonus because they haven't made
 

335
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,469
holiday bonus because they haven't made
any money. So, that's where we're at.

336
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
any money. So, that's where we're at.
 

337
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,070
any money. So, that's where we're at.
The queue, same story. All right. Tons

338
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
The queue, same story. All right. Tons
 

339
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:04,230
The queue, same story. All right. Tons
of liquidity sat right here on the cues.

340
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240

 

341
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,550

All right, that's your level.

342
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
All right, that's your level.
 

343
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,950
All right, that's your level.
Uh there will be gamma at 25, no doubt

344
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
Uh there will be gamma at 25, no doubt
 

345
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,430
Uh there will be gamma at 25, no doubt
about it. And then uh be looking for

346
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
about it. And then uh be looking for
 

347
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,150
about it. And then uh be looking for
mid 26 breakouts there on the cues.

348
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
mid 26 breakouts there on the cues.
 

349
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,990
mid 26 breakouts there on the cues.
Let's have a little look at Dixie still

350
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's have a little look at Dixie still
 

351
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,469
Let's have a little look at Dixie still
falling off a cliff.

352
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
falling off a cliff.
 

353
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,830
falling off a cliff.
So double top played out. Interesting. I

354
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
So double top played out. Interesting. I
 

355
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,710
So double top played out. Interesting. I
just want to before we get into the mag

356
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
just want to before we get into the mag
 

357
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,830
just want to before we get into the mag
30 year, this is the dangerous part for

358
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
30 year, this is the dangerous part for
 

359
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,230
30 year, this is the dangerous part for
me. This is starting to base above this

360
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
me. This is starting to base above this
 

361
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,670
me. This is starting to base above this
green box which I've been talking about

362
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
green box which I've been talking about
 

363
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,670
green box which I've been talking about
for months and months and months on end.

364
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
for months and months and months on end.
 

365
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,110
for months and months and months on end.
All right, you can see from April where

366
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
All right, you can see from April where
 

367
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,469
All right, you can see from April where
the pivot came watching this carefully

368
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
the pivot came watching this carefully
 

369
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,029
the pivot came watching this carefully
to see how we react here. 10 year as

370
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
to see how we react here. 10 year as
 

371
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,430
to see how we react here. 10 year as
well.

372
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
well.
 

373
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,590
well.
I'd be somewhat concerned if these start

374
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
I'd be somewhat concerned if these start
 

375
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,949
I'd be somewhat concerned if these start
breaking out. All right, let's look at

376
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
breaking out. All right, let's look at
 

377
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:58,310
breaking out. All right, let's look at
the mag.

378
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320

 

379
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,230

All right, flat on Apple. Building a

380
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
All right, flat on Apple. Building a
 

381
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,350
All right, flat on Apple. Building a
range.

382
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360

 

383
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,509

Nothing to do here, folks. Break out of

384
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
Nothing to do here, folks. Break out of
 

385
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,670
Nothing to do here, folks. Break out of
the high. Didn't hold the pull back.

386
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
the high. Didn't hold the pull back.
 

387
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,430
the high. Didn't hold the pull back.
Back into a range. If it breaks down

388
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
Back into a range. If it breaks down
 

389
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,910
Back into a range. If it breaks down
underneath. If Apple lose loses 212s,

390
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
underneath. If Apple lose loses 212s,
 

391
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,430
underneath. If Apple lose loses 212s,
then you'll see weakness. But right now,

392
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
then you'll see weakness. But right now,
 

393
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,230
then you'll see weakness. But right now,
it's just in a range, opening flat. Oh,

394
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
it's just in a range, opening flat. Oh,
 

395
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,710
it's just in a range, opening flat. Oh,
that was AMD. What's going on? There we

396
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
that was AMD. What's going on? There we
 

397
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,190
that was AMD. What's going on? There we
go. Apple. Okay. Worse. That's actually

398
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
go. Apple. Okay. Worse. That's actually
 

399
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,070
go. Apple. Okay. Worse. That's actually
worse. Okay. Opening up slightly gap

400
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
worse. Okay. Opening up slightly gap
 

401
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,070
worse. Okay. Opening up slightly gap
down. There's the breakout. There's the

402
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
down. There's the breakout. There's the
 

403
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,269
down. There's the breakout. There's the
pullback. Lost this range here into a

404
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
pullback. Lost this range here into a
 

405
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,509
pullback. Lost this range here into a
new base here. So, you're watching

406
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
new base here. So, you're watching
 

407
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,630
new base here. So, you're watching
Apple. Apple needs to hold 8350

408
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
Apple. Apple needs to hold 8350
 

409
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,310
Apple. Apple needs to hold 8350
to 82s. If it loses 82s, we're going to

410
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
to 82s. If it loses 82s, we're going to
 

411
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,750
to 82s. If it loses 82s, we're going to
see weakness in the market. So, I'm

412
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
see weakness in the market. So, I'm
 

413
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:52,470
see weakness in the market. So, I'm
going to set a price alert there.

414
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480

 

415
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,190

Amazon.

416
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
Amazon.
 

417
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,190
Amazon.
Same kind of story. It looks backside

418
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
Same kind of story. It looks backside
 

419
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,949
Same kind of story. It looks backside
now, doesn't it? Let's be honest. All

420
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
now, doesn't it? Let's be honest. All
 

421
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,870
now, doesn't it? Let's be honest. All
right. Big grind up. There's your

422
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
right. Big grind up. There's your
 

423
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,509
right. Big grind up. There's your
blowoff top. Fails to make a new high.

424
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
blowoff top. Fails to make a new high.
 

425
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,430
blowoff top. Fails to make a new high.
Has cracked underneath. That looks

426
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
Has cracked underneath. That looks
 

427
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,829
Has cracked underneath. That looks
backside to me, right? And so until

428
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
backside to me, right? And so until
 

429
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,829
backside to me, right? And so until
Amazon reclaims

430
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
Amazon reclaims
 

431
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,949
Amazon reclaims
uh 234, it is possible that it wants to

432
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
uh 234, it is possible that it wants to
 

433
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,269
uh 234, it is possible that it wants to
move deeper.

434
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
move deeper.
 

435
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,509
move deeper.
and try and see if it can find a bid

436
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
and try and see if it can find a bid
 

437
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,710
and try and see if it can find a bid
down here. I would say this is a bit

438
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
down here. I would say this is a bit
 

439
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,949
down here. I would say this is a bit
like the cues, right? Just a ridiculous

440
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
like the cues, right? Just a ridiculous
 

441
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,550
like the cues, right? Just a ridiculous
push without coming and back testing

442
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
push without coming and back testing
 

443
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,829
push without coming and back testing
anything. And this is what happens. You

444
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
anything. And this is what happens. You
 

445
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,990
anything. And this is what happens. You
leave a blowoff top and you have to come

446
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
leave a blowoff top and you have to come
 

447
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,389
leave a blowoff top and you have to come
back and check to see if you can put in

448
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
back and check to see if you can put in
 

449
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,110
back and check to see if you can put in
a higher low on a higher time frame. So

450
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
a higher low on a higher time frame. So
 

451
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,630
a higher low on a higher time frame. So
that's what I'd be watching. Maybe it

452
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
that's what I'd be watching. Maybe it
 

453
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,069
that's what I'd be watching. Maybe it
catches a bid in front of it and maybe

454
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
catches a bid in front of it and maybe
 

455
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,470
catches a bid in front of it and maybe
they do like a two-legg and go, but

456
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
they do like a two-legg and go, but
 

457
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,710
they do like a two-legg and go, but
right now I'd be saying it's bullish all

458
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
right now I'd be saying it's bullish all
 

459
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,590
right now I'd be saying it's bullish all
the time. It can stay above 28, but I'd

460
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
the time. It can stay above 28, but I'd
 

461
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,509
the time. It can stay above 28, but I'd
let this rotate back to it. If any of

462
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
let this rotate back to it. If any of
 

463
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,389
let this rotate back to it. If any of
you are looking to be long on Amazon,

464
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
you are looking to be long on Amazon,
 

465
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,150
you are looking to be long on Amazon,
Google

466
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160

 

467
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,389

gap up there on Google starting to turn

468
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
gap up there on Google starting to turn
 

469
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,949
gap up there on Google starting to turn
the corner a little bit.

470
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
the corner a little bit.
 

471
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,470
the corner a little bit.
You can see this is potential

472
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
You can see this is potential
 

473
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,389
You can see this is potential
continuation here. If we can hold above

474
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
continuation here. If we can hold above
 

475
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,949
continuation here. If we can hold above
18s, it's got a move up there. Meta came

476
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
18s, it's got a move up there. Meta came
 

477
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,590
18s, it's got a move up there. Meta came
out positive news this morning and that

478
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
out positive news this morning and that
 

479
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,750
out positive news this morning and that
is a bit of a squeeze. I'm bit annoyed

480
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
is a bit of a squeeze. I'm bit annoyed
 

481
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,110
is a bit of a squeeze. I'm bit annoyed
I'm not sized in more in this

482
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
I'm not sized in more in this
 

483
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,030
I'm not sized in more in this
That is frustrating. I'm long from the

484
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
That is frustrating. I'm long from the
 

485
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,110
That is frustrating. I'm long from the
80s,

486
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
80s,
 

487
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,870
80s,
so it's not bad. I'm up uh 80 bucks, but

488
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
so it's not bad. I'm up uh 80 bucks, but
 

489
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,550
so it's not bad. I'm up uh 80 bucks, but
uh I'm not sized in. I'm up more than 80

490
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
uh I'm not sized in. I'm up more than 80
 

491
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,069
uh I'm not sized in. I'm up more than 80
bucks. Okay, we're into the old gap. I

492
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
bucks. Okay, we're into the old gap. I
 

493
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,430
bucks. Okay, we're into the old gap. I
might need to be thinking about taking

494
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
might need to be thinking about taking
 

495
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,470
might need to be thinking about taking
some profit soon. Wow, I'm up 100 bucks

496
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
some profit soon. Wow, I'm up 100 bucks
 

497
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,269
some profit soon. Wow, I'm up 100 bucks
on that a share. Okay,

498
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
on that a share. Okay,
 

499
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,710
on that a share. Okay,
I got there quicker than I thought. All

500
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
I got there quicker than I thought. All
 

501
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,030
I got there quicker than I thought. All
right, into the old gap here. So, I see

502
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
right, into the old gap here. So, I see
 

503
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,710
right, into the old gap here. So, I see
I'll probably sell some of Meta in here

504
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
I'll probably sell some of Meta in here
 

505
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,590
I'll probably sell some of Meta in here
and I'll see if we can close this gap.

506
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600

 

507
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,110

That's a nice move this morning. Okay,

508
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
That's a nice move this morning. Okay,
 

509
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,790
That's a nice move this morning. Okay,
that's what got the market moving then.

510
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
that's what got the market moving then.
 

511
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,230
that's what got the market moving then.
All right, big gap up in Meta. Let's see

512
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
All right, big gap up in Meta. Let's see
 

513
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,910
All right, big gap up in Meta. Let's see
if it can hold into its old gap. Uh

514
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
if it can hold into its old gap. Uh
 

515
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,829
if it can hold into its old gap. Uh
Microsoft,

516
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
Microsoft,
 

517
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,670
Microsoft,
that's in no man's land. Nothing to do

518
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
that's in no man's land. Nothing to do
 

519
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,430
that's in no man's land. Nothing to do
there after yesterday. Needs to break

520
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
there after yesterday. Needs to break
 

521
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,790
there after yesterday. Needs to break
out of that range for anything to

522
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
out of that range for anything to
 

523
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,550
out of that range for anything to
happen. Nvidia is trying to get going,

524
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
happen. Nvidia is trying to get going,
 

525
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,190
happen. Nvidia is trying to get going,
but uh it's weak. All right, we compare

526
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
but uh it's weak. All right, we compare
 

527
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,310
but uh it's weak. All right, we compare
this to the rest of the mag.

528
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
this to the rest of the mag.
 

529
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,870
this to the rest of the mag.
There's your pin high over the 200s.

530
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
There's your pin high over the 200s.
 

531
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,430
There's your pin high over the 200s.
Can't sustain a bid. Pulls back into the

532
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
Can't sustain a bid. Pulls back into the
 

533
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,790
Can't sustain a bid. Pulls back into the
bottom side of the range. Tried to

534
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
bottom side of the range. Tried to
 

535
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,470
bottom side of the range. Tried to
reclaim it. Rejects. Bottom side of the

536
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
reclaim it. Rejects. Bottom side of the
 

537
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,629
reclaim it. Rejects. Bottom side of the
range. Tried to reclaim it. Rejects.

538
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
range. Tried to reclaim it. Rejects.
 

539
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,550
range. Tried to reclaim it. Rejects.
Breaks down under the range. Now just

540
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
Breaks down under the range. Now just
 

541
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,710
Breaks down under the range. Now just
trading sideways. All right. So really,

542
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
trading sideways. All right. So really,
 

543
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,509
trading sideways. All right. So really,
it's got to get back above sort of 95s.

544
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
it's got to get back above sort of 95s.
 

545
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,430
it's got to get back above sort of 95s.
If it can't do that, then there is a

546
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
If it can't do that, then there is a
 

547
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,190
If it can't do that, then there is a
range going to be created here. And if

548
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
range going to be created here. And if
 

549
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,550
range going to be created here. And if
we start losing this, you're going to

550
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
we start losing this, you're going to
 

551
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,389
we start losing this, you're going to
have all the balls up here trapped and

552
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
have all the balls up here trapped and
 

553
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,069
have all the balls up here trapped and
there's a breakdown. So bulls really

554
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
there's a breakdown. So bulls really
 

555
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,790
there's a breakdown. So bulls really
need to see a reclaim of 95s and 200s.

556
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
need to see a reclaim of 95s and 200s.
 

557
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,190
need to see a reclaim of 95s and 200s.
Failing to do that, I'd be somewhat

558
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
Failing to do that, I'd be somewhat
 

559
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,790
Failing to do that, I'd be somewhat
concerned because you're seeing relative

560
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
concerned because you're seeing relative
 

561
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,470
concerned because you're seeing relative
weakness in this name, right? So I

562
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
weakness in this name, right? So I
 

563
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,550
weakness in this name, right? So I
wouldn't be a new money buyer here. Like

564
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
wouldn't be a new money buyer here. Like
 

565
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,670
wouldn't be a new money buyer here. Like
if we start losing some of these levels,

566
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
if we start losing some of these levels,
 

567
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,470
if we start losing some of these levels,
there's a wash down before it gets uh

568
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
there's a wash down before it gets uh
 

569
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,990
there's a wash down before it gets uh
taken back up. But let's just see. I

570
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
taken back up. But let's just see. I
 

571
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,110
taken back up. But let's just see. I
don't know what the market wants to do

572
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
don't know what the market wants to do
 

573
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,470
don't know what the market wants to do
with this, but it's definitely weaker

574
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
with this, but it's definitely weaker
 

575
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,990
with this, but it's definitely weaker
than all the other names right now.

576
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
than all the other names right now.
 

577
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,030
than all the other names right now.
Tesla's still squeezing. It's on quite

578
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
Tesla's still squeezing. It's on quite
 

579
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,949
Tesla's still squeezing. It's on quite
the run right now. It's impressive out

580
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
the run right now. It's impressive out
 

581
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,509
the run right now. It's impressive out
of that pivot low. All right. So, it

582
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
of that pivot low. All right. So, it
 

583
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,910
of that pivot low. All right. So, it
failed to make a new high, breakdown,

584
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
failed to make a new high, breakdown,
 

585
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,550
failed to make a new high, breakdown,
double bottom, importantly reclaimed the

586
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
double bottom, importantly reclaimed the
 

587
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,389
double bottom, importantly reclaimed the
range. That's the big difference. And

588
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
range. That's the big difference. And
 

589
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,870
range. That's the big difference. And
squeezing back. So, it should it should

590
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
squeezing back. So, it should it should
 

591
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,310
squeezing back. So, it should it should
come all the way back to the top side of

592
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
come all the way back to the top side of
 

593
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,069
come all the way back to the top side of
the range now because this is a failed

594
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
the range now because this is a failed
 

595
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,790
the range now because this is a failed
look below and it should in theory it

596
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
look below and it should in theory it
 

597
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,710
look below and it should in theory it
might take some time, but it should try

598
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
might take some time, but it should try
 

599
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,230
might take some time, but it should try
and get back up to the top side of that

600
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
and get back up to the top side of that
 

601
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,069
and get back up to the top side of that
range. So, Tesla looking pretty bullish

602
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
range. So, Tesla looking pretty bullish
 

603
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,069
range. So, Tesla looking pretty bullish
there. I'm going to say pretty

604
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
there. I'm going to say pretty
 

605
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,590
there. I'm going to say pretty
impressive on a squeeze out. Let's have

606
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
impressive on a squeeze out. Let's have
 

607
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,949
impressive on a squeeze out. Let's have
a look at the mag. Equally weighted

608
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
a look at the mag. Equally weighted
 

609
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,670
a look at the mag. Equally weighted
overall. Yeah, meta doing the damage and

610
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
overall. Yeah, meta doing the damage and
 

611
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,629
overall. Yeah, meta doing the damage and
in a squeeze out.

612
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
in a squeeze out.
 

613
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,069
in a squeeze out.
All right, so most of them opening up

614
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
All right, so most of them opening up
 

615
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,550
All right, so most of them opening up
flat.

616
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
flat.
 

617
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,230
flat.
Most opening up flat. There's not a

618
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
Most opening up flat. There's not a
 

619
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,350
Most opening up flat. There's not a
whole lot to do here. I'm going to be

620
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
whole lot to do here. I'm going to be
 

621
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,470
whole lot to do here. I'm going to be
honest, folks. We've um want to be

622
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
honest, folks. We've um want to be
 

623
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,190
honest, folks. We've um want to be
bullish, but they're not giving us much

624
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,200
bullish, but they're not giving us much
 

625
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,949
bullish, but they're not giving us much
of a location to play with.

626
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959

 

627
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,590

So, we want to see

628
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
So, we want to see
 

629
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,949
So, we want to see
I'm going to do this as a gray box

630
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
I'm going to do this as a gray box
 

631
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,470
I'm going to do this as a gray box
because I don't want to get uber bullish

632
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
because I don't want to get uber bullish
 

633
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,470
because I don't want to get uber bullish
here. Right, we've taken the liquidity.

634
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
here. Right, we've taken the liquidity.
 

635
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,069
here. Right, we've taken the liquidity.
This red line was that first liquidity

636
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
This red line was that first liquidity
 

637
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,990
This red line was that first liquidity
that I was looking for. Those in Discord

638
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
that I was looking for. Those in Discord
 

639
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,750
that I was looking for. Those in Discord
would have seen that yesterday. So, this

640
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
would have seen that yesterday. So, this
 

641
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,030
would have seen that yesterday. So, this
level has been taken. The only thing

642
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
level has been taken. The only thing
 

643
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,590
level has been taken. The only thing
left to aim for now is about 100 points

644
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
left to aim for now is about 100 points
 

645
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,150
left to aim for now is about 100 points
higher. That's what we'd be aiming for

646
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
higher. That's what we'd be aiming for
 

647
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,389
higher. That's what we'd be aiming for
if we're going to get going. So, we want

648
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
if we're going to get going. So, we want
 

649
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,110
if we're going to get going. So, we want
to see do we hold previous days value

650
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
to see do we hold previous days value
 

651
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,910
to see do we hold previous days value
area high for that rotation. If we fail

652
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
area high for that rotation. If we fail
 

653
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,509
area high for that rotation. If we fail
to hold that value, we're going to check

654
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
to hold that value, we're going to check
 

655
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,350
to hold that value, we're going to check
PC. If we fail PC, we're going to check

656
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
PC. If we fail PC, we're going to check
 

657
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,870
PC. If we fail PC, we're going to check
previous day value area low. If we come

658
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
previous day value area low. If we come
 

659
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,949
previous day value area low. If we come
to previous day value area low, we've

660
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
to previous day value area low, we've
 

661
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,550
to previous day value area low, we've
just lost the top side of that range

662
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
just lost the top side of that range
 

663
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,910
just lost the top side of that range
again. And then you're going to expect

664
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
again. And then you're going to expect
 

665
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,110
again. And then you're going to expect
it to come all the way down here. This

666
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
it to come all the way down here. This
 

667
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,750
it to come all the way down here. This
is why I want to be cautious. It's a

668
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
is why I want to be cautious. It's a
 

669
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,310
is why I want to be cautious. It's a
every day this week has been in balance

670
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
every day this week has been in balance
 

671
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,470
every day this week has been in balance
up where we are now. Right? So, they

672
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
up where we are now. Right? So, they
 

673
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,990
up where we are now. Right? So, they
need to hold a breakout above it.

674
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
need to hold a breakout above it.
 

675
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,069
need to hold a breakout above it.
Really, they need to be holding 80s.

676
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
Really, they need to be holding 80s.
 

677
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,350
Really, they need to be holding 80s.
It's as simple as that. If they don't

678
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
It's as simple as that. If they don't
 

679
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,509
It's as simple as that. If they don't
hold 80s, we go back into the death chop

680
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
hold 80s, we go back into the death chop
 

681
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,829
hold 80s, we go back into the death chop
range. Right? can see it here is uh

682
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
range. Right? can see it here is uh
 

683
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,990
range. Right? can see it here is uh
Tuesday here's Wednesday and we're

All right. Back into previous date value
 

715
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,110
All right. Back into previous date value
area high.

716
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
area high.
 

717
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,430

They've got a website outage at Apex.

they've got an outage.
Okay. So, already through previous day

728
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
Okay. So, already through previous day
 

729
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,870
Okay. So, already through previous day
value area high, not holding the top of

730
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
value area high, not holding the top of
 

731
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,389
value area high, not holding the top of
that range. That's not what I would want

732
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
that range. That's not what I would want
 

733
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,069
that range. That's not what I would want
to see if I was a bull. In fact, that's

734
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
to see if I was a bull. In fact, that's
 

735
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,150
to see if I was a bull. In fact, that's
quite the opposite. All right. Based on

736
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
quite the opposite. All right. Based on
 

737
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,069
quite the opposite. All right. Based on
Ninja Trader, however, value I've got

738
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
Ninja Trader, however, value I've got
 

739
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,550
Ninja Trader, however, value I've got
previous day value area high down at 60.

740
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
previous day value area high down at 60.
 

741
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,310
previous day value area high down at 60.
So, I'm going to respect that. That's

742
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
So, I'm going to respect that. That's
 

743
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,910
So, I'm going to respect that. That's
what Ninja Trader is saying to me. No,

744
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
what Ninja Trader is saying to me. No,
 

745
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,310
what Ninja Trader is saying to me. No,
it's not. That's wrong.

746
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
it's not. That's wrong.
 

747
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,150
it's not. That's wrong.
That is wrong. Move it up. It is at 80.

748
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
That is wrong. Move it up. It is at 80.
 

749
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,910
That is wrong. Move it up. It is at 80.
And just adjust these slightly. Give me

750
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
And just adjust these slightly. Give me
 

751
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,350
And just adjust these slightly. Give me
a second, folks.

752
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
a second, folks.
 

753
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,509
a second, folks.
Okay, so it's lost previous day's value

754
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
Okay, so it's lost previous day's value
 

755
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,990
Okay, so it's lost previous day's value
high. Back into yesterday's range. This

756
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
high. Back into yesterday's range. This
 

757
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,350
high. Back into yesterday's range. This
is the range I don't want to play in.

758
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
is the range I don't want to play in.
 

759
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,670
is the range I don't want to play in.
This gray box. I've got no interest in

760
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
This gray box. I've got no interest in
 

761
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,829
This gray box. I've got no interest in
trading in this gray box. Let's just

762
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
trading in this gray box. Let's just
 

763
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,189
trading in this gray box. Let's just
wait and see. Let's see what the mag's

764
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
wait and see. Let's see what the mag's
 

765
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,030
wait and see. Let's see what the mag's
doing.

766

773
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,550

I'll be watching these 85s on SPY which

774
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
I'll be watching these 85s on SPY which
 

775
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,389
I'll be watching these 85s on SPY which
they're currently holding. So that's

776
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
they're currently holding. So that's
 

777
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,550
they're currently holding. So that's
your overunder.

778
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
your overunder.
 

779
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,310
your overunder.
That's your overunder on spy. Back to

on this market and on the spiders

on this market and on the spiders
back that whole move.

786
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120

 

787
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,029

Looks like a fail breakout to me so far.

788
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039

 

789
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,429

Look at that. That whole move gone back.

790
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
Look at that. That whole move gone back.
 

791
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,029
Look at that. That whole move gone back.
So dumb. This is what I mean. It's a

792
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
So dumb. This is what I mean. It's a
 

793
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,189
So dumb. This is what I mean. It's a
dumb market right now. Very stupid

794
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
dumb market right now. Very stupid
 

795
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,510
dumb market right now. Very stupid
market how it's moving. There's no

796
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
market how it's moving. There's no
 

797
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,829
market how it's moving. There's no
volume. No one in control of this

798
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
volume. No one in control of this
 

799
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,150
volume. No one in control of this
market. It's just a bit of a whipsaw.

800
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
market. It's just a bit of a whipsaw.
 

801
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,070
market. It's just a bit of a whipsaw.
So I've lost interest the last week or

802
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
So I've lost interest the last week or
 

803
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,590
So I've lost interest the last week or
two in this market. I think it's very

804
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
two in this market. I think it's very
 

805
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,830
two in this market. I think it's very
very dangerous.

806
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
very dangerous.
 

807
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,350
very dangerous.
Fact that we took that liquidity

808
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
Fact that we took that liquidity
 

809
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,070
Fact that we took that liquidity
pre-market. Where's my mouse? All right.

810
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
pre-market. Where's my mouse? All right.
 

811
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,350
pre-market. Where's my mouse? All right.
The fact that we took this liquidity

812
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
The fact that we took this liquidity
 

813
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,430
The fact that we took this liquidity
premarket and bulls did not just hold

814
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
premarket and bulls did not just hold
 

815
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,870
premarket and bulls did not just hold
this is a big no no. All right. Here's

816
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
this is a big no no. All right. Here's
 

817
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,470
this is a big no no. All right. Here's
previous day point of control. If we

818
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
previous day point of control. If we
 

819
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,870
previous day point of control. If we
come back here and we fail this level,

820
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
come back here and we fail this level,
 

821
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,029
come back here and we fail this level,
then a rotation back down to here is

822
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
then a rotation back down to here is
 

823
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,310
then a rotation back down to here is
very, very possible. And if we lose

824
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
very, very possible. And if we lose
 

825
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,669
very, very possible. And if we lose
that, then we might as well go and take

826
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
that, then we might as well go and take
 

827
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,990
that, then we might as well go and take
that double bottom from yesterday. So

828
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
that double bottom from yesterday. So
 

829
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,230
that double bottom from yesterday. So
bulls really need to reclaim previous

830
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
bulls really need to reclaim previous
 

831
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,150
bulls really need to reclaim previous
day value. All right, that's what they

832
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
day value. All right, that's what they
 

833
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,430
day value. All right, that's what they
need to reclaim. They need to get back

834
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
need to reclaim. They need to get back
 

835
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,190
need to reclaim. They need to get back
above previous day value area high.

836
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200
above previous day value area high.
 

837
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,190
above previous day value area high.

back down to the bottom side of this
 

867
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,230
back down to the bottom side of this

open to fail breakouts because there's

878
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919

885
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,630
yesterday's value area low. Just like
that. One, two, three, four, five

that. One, two, three, four, five
 

887
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,789
that. One, two, three, four, five
minutes in, we've done a failed breakout

888
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
minutes in, we've done a failed breakout
 

889
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,029
minutes in, we've done a failed breakout
and gone all the way down to the

890
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
and gone all the way down to the
 

891
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,549

previous day's value area low after
 

893
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,110
previous day's value area low after
opening up above it. That is not a good

894
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,120
opening up above it. That is not a good
 

895
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,590
opening up above it. That is not a good
look, folks. It's a really bad look for

the market. It's really, really, really
bad. It's not what you want to see if

900
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
bad. It's not what you want to see if
 

901
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,950
bad. It's not what you want to see if
you're a bull. And we are going to take

902
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
you're a bull. And we are going to take
 

903
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,789
you're a bull. And we are going to take
out previous day value area low. And if

904
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
out previous day value area low. And if
 

905
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,390
out previous day value area low. And if
they sell previous day value area low,

906
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
they sell previous day value area low,
 

907
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,830
they sell previous day value area low,
you best believe we're going to come all

908
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
you best believe we're going to come all
 

909
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,190
you best believe we're going to come all
the way down for this double bottom

910
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
the way down for this double bottom
 

911
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,270
the way down for this double bottom
yesterday where we've got a ton of

912
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
yesterday where we've got a ton of
 

913
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,590
yesterday where we've got a ton of
liquidity.

914
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
liquidity.
 

915
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,950
liquidity.
So, this is basically the same thing

916
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
So, this is basically the same thing
 

917
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,789
So, this is basically the same thing
we've seen the last two days. Uh,

918
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
we've seen the last two days. Uh,
 

919
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,549
we've seen the last two days. Uh,
morning wash.

920
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559

 

921
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,070

Let's see if they bid off previous day

922
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
Let's see if they bid off previous day
 

923
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,909
Let's see if they bid off previous day
value area low now.

924
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:19,919

 

925
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,150

Every part of me wanted to take shorts,

926
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,160
Every part of me wanted to take shorts,
 

927
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,909
Every part of me wanted to take shorts,
but I can't. I'm not going to. I've told

928
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
but I can't. I'm not going to. I've told
 

929
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,230
but I can't. I'm not going to. I've told
myself I'm not fighting this trend, but

930
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
myself I'm not fighting this trend, but
 

931
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,230
myself I'm not fighting this trend, but
uh

932
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
uh
 

933
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,909
uh
just see. All they want to do is trap

934
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
just see. All they want to do is trap
 

935
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,430
just see. All they want to do is trap
participants both sides right now.

936
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
participants both sides right now.
 

937
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,029
participants both sides right now.
Okay. So, let's see how we act when we

938
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
Okay. So, let's see how we act when we
 

939
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,669
Okay. So, let's see how we act when we
get back up here. Current point control

940
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
get back up here. Current point control
 

941
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,630
get back up here. Current point control
day point control 640. That's probably

942
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
day point control 640. That's probably
 

943
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,630
day point control 640. That's probably
your

944
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
your
 

945
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,630
your
control bar, so to speak, or your

946
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
control bar, so to speak, or your
 

947
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,310
control bar, so to speak, or your
control point right under that more

948
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
control point right under that more
 

949
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,149
control point right under that more
damage can be done. But right now, all

950
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
damage can be done. But right now, all
 

951
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,630
damage can be done. But right now, all
we're doing is trading inside of the

952
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,640
we're doing is trading inside of the
 

953
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,390
we're doing is trading inside of the
chop, aren't we? Because this blue to

954
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
chop, aren't we? Because this blue to
 

955
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,310
chop, aren't we? Because this blue to
blue is yesterday's chop and the day

956
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
blue is yesterday's chop and the day
 

957
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,870
blue is yesterday's chop and the day
before's chop and the day before's chop.

958
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880
before's chop and the day before's chop.
 

959
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,990
before's chop and the day before's chop.
So, you're watching 650s now. and see if

960
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
So, you're watching 650s now. and see if
 

961
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,669
So, you're watching 650s now. and see if
they sell 650s or if they reclaim 650s

962
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
they sell 650s or if they reclaim 650s
 

963
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,510
they sell 650s or if they reclaim 650s
and reclaim 680s, then we're going to go

964
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
and reclaim 680s, then we're going to go
 

965
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,029
and reclaim 680s, then we're going to go
for new highs. And this will just be a

966
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
for new highs. And this will just be a
 

967
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,789
for new highs. And this will just be a
wash that gets absorbed just like

968
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
wash that gets absorbed just like
 

969
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,630
wash that gets absorbed just like
yesterday.

970
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
yesterday.
 

971
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,149
yesterday.
Let's see. So, Apple's gone red,

972
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
Let's see. So, Apple's gone red,
 

973
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,870
Let's see. So, Apple's gone red,
Amazon's gone red, Google's gone red.

974
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
Amazon's gone red, Google's gone red.
 

975
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,669
Amazon's gone red, Google's gone red.
You imagine there is some form of follow

976
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
You imagine there is some form of follow
 

977
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,310
You imagine there is some form of follow
through here to the downside at some

978
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
through here to the downside at some
 

979
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,190
through here to the downside at some
point, but uh who knows?

980
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
point, but uh who knows?
 

981
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,789
point, but uh who knows?
We all know what this market's been like

982
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
We all know what this market's been like
 

983
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,549
We all know what this market's been like
recently. sell the morning and then

984
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
recently. sell the morning and then
 

985
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,789
recently. sell the morning and then
squeeze all the way back up. Is it going

986
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
squeeze all the way back up. Is it going
 

987
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,430
squeeze all the way back up. Is it going
to do the same again?

988
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:34,440
to do the same again?
 

989
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,110
to do the same again?
[Laughter]

990
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
[Laughter]
 

991
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,789
[Laughter]
Very, very possible, isn't it? All

992
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
Very, very possible, isn't it? All
 

993
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,230
Very, very possible, isn't it? All
right, so here's the test towards that

994
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
right, so here's the test towards that
 

995
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,029
right, so here's the test towards that
640, 650. This is the area. If they

996
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
640, 650. This is the area. If they
 

997
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,310
640, 650. This is the area. If they
reclaim this, they're probably going to

998
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
reclaim this, they're probably going to
 

999
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,630
reclaim this, they're probably going to
go straight back for the highs again.

1000
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640

 

1001
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,350

Just an absolutely stupid market at the

1002
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
Just an absolutely stupid market at the
 

1003
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,950
Just an absolutely stupid market at the
moment. If you think it's anything other

1004
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
moment. If you think it's anything other
 

1005
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,470
moment. If you think it's anything other
than that, then I don't know what to

1006
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
than that, then I don't know what to
 

1007
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,149
than that, then I don't know what to
tell you. This market is just dumb,

1008
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
tell you. This market is just dumb,
 

1009
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,350
tell you. This market is just dumb,
dumb, dumb, dumb.

1010
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
dumb, dumb, dumb.
 

1011
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,350
dumb, dumb, dumb.
So, here's the 40s. Can they get back up

1012
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
So, here's the 40s. Can they get back up
 

1013
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,110
So, here's the 40s. Can they get back up
to the 50s? And how do they act once

1014
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
to the 50s? And how do they act once
 

1015
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,870
to the 50s? And how do they act once
they get to the 50s? And if they reclaim

1016
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:08,880
they get to the 50s? And if they reclaim
 

1017
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,149
they get to the 50s? And if they reclaim
the 50s, then I would imagine they're

1018
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
the 50s, then I would imagine they're
 

1019
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,270
the 50s, then I would imagine they're
going to go all the way back to the

1020
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
going to go all the way back to the
 

1021
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,590
going to go all the way back to the
highs. That's what you've got at the

1022
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
highs. That's what you've got at the
 

1023
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,270
highs. That's what you've got at the
moment. They're starting to try and

1024
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
moment. They're starting to try and
 

1025
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,990
moment. They're starting to try and
absorb this to try and get that squeeze.

1026
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
absorb this to try and get that squeeze.
 

1027
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,750
absorb this to try and get that squeeze.
Ridiculous that we're trading inside

1028
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
Ridiculous that we're trading inside
 

1029
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,430
Ridiculous that we're trading inside
value again. How are we trading inside

1030
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
value again. How are we trading inside
 

1031
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,990
value again. How are we trading inside
value again? is complete groundhog day.

1032
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
value again? is complete groundhog day.
 

1033
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,870
value again? is complete groundhog day.
All right, failing 40s and 50s. Are they

1034
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
All right, failing 40s and 50s. Are they
 

1035
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,430
All right, failing 40s and 50s. Are they
going to see any continuation

1036
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
going to see any continuation
 

1037
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,270
going to see any continuation
and we come back for the lows at this

1038
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
and we come back for the lows at this
 

1039
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,310
and we come back for the lows at this
point? So, I'm going to put a small

1040
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,320
point? So, I'm going to put a small
 

1041
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,070
point? So, I'm going to put a small
piece on here. I'm very, very skeptical

1042
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
piece on here. I'm very, very skeptical
 

1043
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,549
piece on here. I'm very, very skeptical
about sizing in right now. So, a tiny

1044
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
about sizing in right now. So, a tiny
 

1045
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,710
about sizing in right now. So, a tiny
piece down to see if we can take out

1046
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
piece down to see if we can take out
 

1047
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,270
piece down to see if we can take out
this value area low. Holding previous

1048
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
this value area low. Holding previous
 

1049
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,430
this value area low. Holding previous
days VWAP, which is right here, 600. So,

1050
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
days VWAP, which is right here, 600. So,
 

1051
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,270
days VWAP, which is right here, 600. So,
this is your overunder. I need to sell

1052
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
this is your overunder. I need to sell
 

1053
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,350
this is your overunder. I need to sell
through 600 here. Let me just check

1054
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
through 600 here. Let me just check
 

1055
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,390
through 600 here. Let me just check
profile.

1056
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400

 

1057
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,909

Big selling coming in there and not

1058
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
Big selling coming in there and not
 

1059
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,270
Big selling coming in there and not
getting their way. So I'm very aware of

1060
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
getting their way. So I'm very aware of
 

1061
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,710
getting their way. So I'm very aware of
that right now. If we get follow through

1062
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
that right now. If we get follow through
 

1063
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,630
that right now. If we get follow through
under 600 then I'll size in. Until that

1064
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:00,640
under 600 then I'll size in. Until that
 

1065
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,149
under 600 then I'll size in. Until that
point I'm not going to size in this

1066
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
point I'm not going to size in this
 

1067
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,590
point I'm not going to size in this
guy's starter on

1068
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600

 

1069
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,390

40s and 50s like I talked about expect

1070
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
40s and 50s like I talked about expect
 

1071
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,950
40s and 50s like I talked about expect
rotation from here to here. If we break

1072
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
rotation from here to here. If we break
 

1073
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,710
rotation from here to here. If we break
this we should come back for this. If we

1074
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
this we should come back for this. If we
 

1075
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,549
this we should come back for this. If we
break that we're coming down here. Any

1076
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
break that we're coming down here. Any
 

1077
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,350
break that we're coming down here. Any
reclaim of this is a big no no if we're

1078
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
reclaim of this is a big no no if we're
 

1079
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,630
reclaim of this is a big no no if we're
looking for shorts. All right. Any

1080
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
looking for shorts. All right. Any
 

1081
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,110
looking for shorts. All right. Any
reclaim of 50s is a big no no. So I've

1082
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
reclaim of 50s is a big no no. So I've
 

1083
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,510
reclaim of 50s is a big no no. So I've
got a tiny bit tiny tiny tiny starter

1084
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
got a tiny bit tiny tiny tiny starter
 

1085
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,110
got a tiny bit tiny tiny tiny starter
on. That's it. I want to see if we get

1086
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
on. That's it. I want to see if we get
 

1087
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,549
on. That's it. I want to see if we get
follow through under 600.

1088
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
follow through under 600.
 

1089
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,190
follow through under 600.
Trying to sell aggressively here again.

1090
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,200
Trying to sell aggressively here again.
 

1091
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,630
Trying to sell aggressively here again.
Here we go. So starting to see a bit

1092
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
Here we go. So starting to see a bit
 

1093
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,909
Here we go. So starting to see a bit
follow through. We've got imbalance down

1094
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
follow through. We've got imbalance down
 

1095
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,190
follow through. We've got imbalance down
to 80 and another one at 70. So I don't

1096
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
to 80 and another one at 70. So I don't
 

1097
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,110
to 80 and another one at 70. So I don't
want to see bulls step in here. I will

1098
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
want to see bulls step in here. I will
 

1099
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,029
want to see bulls step in here. I will
cut this if I see them starting to step

1100
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
cut this if I see them starting to step
 

1101
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,270
cut this if I see them starting to step
in. It's just a starter. Nothing more

1102
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,280
in. It's just a starter. Nothing more
 

1103
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:54,470
in. It's just a starter. Nothing more
than that.

1104
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480

 

1105
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,029

What a dumb dumb market.

1106
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
What a dumb dumb market.
 

1107
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,830
What a dumb dumb market.

Cannot move out of this range.

All

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960

 

1119
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,789

right, out of this now. Basically flat

1120
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
right, out of this now. Basically flat
 

1121
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,830

scratch trade

1122
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
scratch trade
 

1123
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:25,830
scratch trade
actually green on it somehow.

1124
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840

 

1125
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,669

This feels like yesterday. It feels

1126
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
This feels like yesterday. It feels
 

1127
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,190
This feels like yesterday. It feels
exactly the same as yesterday, just a

1128
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
exactly the same as yesterday, just a
 

1129
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,950
exactly the same as yesterday, just a
bit higher.

1130
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
bit higher.
 

1131
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,470
bit higher.
All right, we're into value. So,

1132
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,480
All right, we're into value. So,
 

1133
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,029
All right, we're into value. So,
basically, they failed to hold the top.

1134
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
basically, they failed to hold the top.
 

1135
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,789
basically, they failed to hold the top.
They came down to the bottom of previous

1136
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
They came down to the bottom of previous
 

1137
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,350
They came down to the bottom of previous
day's value. Buyers bid up here. I still

1138
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,360
day's value. Buyers bid up here. I still
 

1139
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,110
day's value. Buyers bid up here. I still
think there's a chance to do this move

1140
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
think there's a chance to do this move
 

1141
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,549
think there's a chance to do this move
because we left it yesterday, but

1142
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:44,559
because we left it yesterday, but
 

1143
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,029
because we left it yesterday, but
all depends what their intentions are.

1144
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
all depends what their intentions are.
 

1145
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,789
all depends what their intentions are.
Just want to be very careful if they if

1146
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
Just want to be very careful if they if
 

1147
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,350
Just want to be very careful if they if
they reclaim 50s, all shorts are off the

1148
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
they reclaim 50s, all shorts are off the
 

1149
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,950
they reclaim 50s, all shorts are off the
table.

1150
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
table.
 

1151
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,269
table.
Very hard trying to fade these moves at

1152
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
Very hard trying to fade these moves at
 

1153
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,870
Very hard trying to fade these moves at
the moment.

1154
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880

 

1155
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,630

Definitely bears got stuck there under

1156
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
Definitely bears got stuck there under
 

1157
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,669
Definitely bears got stuck there under
600 twice. Those last two two attempts

1158
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
600 twice. Those last two two attempts
 

1159
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,990
600 twice. Those last two two attempts
under 600. Let me get rid of previous

1160
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
under 600. Let me get rid of previous
 

1161
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,430
under 600. Let me get rid of previous
days VW, which is also 600 by the way.

1162
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440

 

1163
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,789

Midpoint of range. I'm going to leave

1164
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
Midpoint of range. I'm going to leave
 

1165
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,190
Midpoint of range. I'm going to leave
this alone and let it shake out. Had my

1166
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
this alone and let it shake out. Had my
 

1167
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,430
this alone and let it shake out. Had my
first attempt. Didn't didn't go for me.

1168
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
first attempt. Didn't didn't go for me.
 

1169
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,909
first attempt. Didn't didn't go for me.
So, just get up on and leave this alone

1170
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
So, just get up on and leave this alone
 

1171
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:29,190
So, just get up on and leave this alone
for a minute.

1172
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200

 

1173
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,549

Okay. Yeah, definitely those shorts

1174
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
Okay. Yeah, definitely those shorts
 

1175
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,590
Okay. Yeah, definitely those shorts
under 600 got caught.

1176
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
under 600 got caught.
 

1177
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,110
under 600 got caught.
So, we're coming back towards these 50s

1178
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,120
So, we're coming back towards these 50s
 

1179
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,110
So, we're coming back towards these 50s
again. Like I said, if they reclaim 50s,

1180
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
again. Like I said, if they reclaim 50s,
 

1181
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,710
again. Like I said, if they reclaim 50s,
I would say it's a big leave alone.

1182
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
I would say it's a big leave alone.
 

1183
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,029
I would say it's a big leave alone.
It's PDC up there. If they reclaim that,

1184
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
It's PDC up there. If they reclaim that,
 

1185
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,870
It's PDC up there. If they reclaim that,
it's a big leave alone short side. If

1186
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
it's a big leave alone short side. If
 

1187
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,110
it's a big leave alone short side. If
they reject that, then you might want to

1188
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
they reject that, then you might want to
 

1189
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,070
they reject that, then you might want to
have another attempt.

1190
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
have another attempt.
 

1191
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,909
have another attempt.

1231
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,390
gap. I'm up about 10%. I've only got a
starter on though. Okay, back to these

1232
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
starter on though. Okay, back to these
 

1233
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,149
starter on though. Okay, back to these
600s. We know this is where bears got

1234
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159
600s. We know this is where bears got
 

1235
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,070
600s. We know this is where bears got
stuck on the last attempt. They got

1236
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
stuck on the last attempt. They got
 

1237
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,470
stuck on the last attempt. They got
stuck under 600.

1238
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
stuck under 600.
 

1239
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,870
stuck under 600.
Still rejecting VW up. Still rejecting

1245
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,789
previous day close. So bears are trying
to protect this level here. Balls are

1246
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
to protect this level here. Balls are
 

1247
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,230
to protect this level here. Balls are
trying to protect 600. That's where

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,240
trying to protect 600. That's where
 

1249
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,909

bears got stuck. The rotation right now

00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919
bears got stuck. The rotation right now
 

1251
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,390
bears got stuck. The rotation right now
is from basically 600 to 650. That's

1252
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,400
is from basically 600 to 650. That's
 

1253
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,230
is from basically 600 to 650. That's
your rotation.

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,230

Heck, yes, you can do it on an ATM

1256
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
Heck, yes, you can do it on an ATM
 

1257
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,070
Heck, yes, you can do it on an ATM
strategy. You can have it automated for

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
strategy. You can have it automated for

bears got stuck. Are we going to see

1264
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,200
bears got stuck. Are we going to see
 

1265
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,830
bears got stuck. Are we going to see
some follow through

back down into an imbalance?
 

1269
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,190
back down into an imbalance?
Say 600 now is your under over. Now

1270
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
Say 600 now is your under over. Now
 

1271
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,190
Say 600 now is your under over. Now
we've snapped it, right? If they reject

1272
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
we've snapped it, right? If they reject
 

1273
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,269
we've snapped it, right? If they reject

1277
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,230
seller just came in and we might see a
new low of day. If they reclaim this,

1278
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
new low of day. If they reclaim this,
 

1279
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,789
new low of day. If they reclaim this,
we're going to go straight back to 650.

00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:54,799
we're going to go straight back to 650.
 

1281
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:05,029
we're going to go straight back to 650.
They've got the opportunity here.

1282
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039

 

1283
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,710

Come on bears, do something.
 

1289
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,149
Come on bears, do something.
All right. Are we going to do something

1290
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:20,159
All right. Are we going to do something
 

1291
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,909
All right. Are we going to do something
here?

1292
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919

But 600's your level. Bears need to

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240
But 600's your level. Bears need to
 

1309

But 600's your level. Bears need to
defend 600. Reclaim that. We go straight

1310
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
defend 600. Reclaim that. We go straight
 

1311
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,350
defend 600. Reclaim that. We go straight
back up to 650.

So, we're just dancing in the midpoint

1314
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
So, we're just dancing in the midpoint
 

1315
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,630
So, we're just dancing in the midpoint
range. This is the old balance. Remember

1316
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
range. This is the old balance. Remember
 

1317
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,269
range. This is the old balance. Remember
this gray box is the old balance, right?

1318
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:53,279
this gray box is the old balance, right?
 

1319
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,950
this gray box is the old balance, right?
Bears need to defend this. We didn't.

1320
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
Bears need to defend this. We didn't.
 

1321
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,549
Bears need to defend this. We didn't.
Bulls couldn't hold it. We came to the

1322
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
Bulls couldn't hold it. We came to the
 

1323
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,630
Bulls couldn't hold it. We came to the
other side. Bears need to fend defend

1324
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
other side. Bears need to fend defend
 

1325
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,029
other side. Bears need to fend defend
this level to get this move and then

1326
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
this level to get this move and then
 

1327
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,430
this level to get this move and then
this move. If bears fail to defend this

1328
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
this move. If bears fail to defend this
 

1329
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,630
this move. If bears fail to defend this
level, a squeeze is available.

1330
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
level, a squeeze is available.
 

1331
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,070
level, a squeeze is available.
That's what you've got. You've got see

1332
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
That's what you've got. You've got see
 

1333
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,310
That's what you've got. You've got see
money, take money. Nothing more than

1334
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
money, take money. Nothing more than
 

1335
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:20,870
money, take money. Nothing more than
just small little scalps.

1336
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:20,880

 

1337
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,389

I'm with you, Zar Trader. This is what

1338
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
I'm with you, Zar Trader. This is what
 

1339
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,750
I'm with you, Zar Trader. This is what
happens when we go into balance. But

1340
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
happens when we go into balance. But
 

1341
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,669
happens when we go into balance. But
what I'd say is once we move out of

1342
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
what I'd say is once we move out of
 

1343
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,909
what I'd say is once we move out of
balance, we will get some big big big

1344
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
balance, we will get some big big big
 

1345
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,149
balance, we will get some big big big
moves regardless of which direction it

1346
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:30,159
moves regardless of which direction it
 

1347
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,310
moves regardless of which direction it
goes.

1348
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320

 

1349
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,470

You see how spy lost that gamma level of

1350
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,480
You see how spy lost that gamma level of
 

1351
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,990
You see how spy lost that gamma level of
85.

1352
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
85.
 

1353
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,990
85.
We opened above it and it instantly lost

1354
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,000
We opened above it and it instantly lost
 

1355
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,789
We opened above it and it instantly lost
it. All right. So, we're pinned there.

1356
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:44,799
it. All right. So, we're pinned there.
 

1357
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,789
it. All right. So, we're pinned there.
Can't get above it. If we keep failing

1358
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:46,799
Can't get above it. If we keep failing
 

1359
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,470
Can't get above it. If we keep failing
there, there's potential for a rotation

1360
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:48,480
there, there's potential for a rotation
 

1361
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,510
there, there's potential for a rotation
to 80. We fail 80. There's gamma at uh

1362
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:51,520
to 80. We fail 80. There's gamma at uh
 

1363
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,669
to 80. We fail 80. There's gamma at uh
78 and then 70.

1364
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
78 and then 70.
 

1365
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,350
78 and then 70.
So those are the dealers levels. That's

1366
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
So those are the dealers levels. That's
 

1367
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,710
So those are the dealers levels. That's
where they're pinning price at the

1368
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
where they're pinning price at the
 

1369
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,630
where they're pinning price at the
moment. And they're just rotating

1370
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
moment. And they're just rotating
 

1371
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:12,230
moment. And they're just rotating
between them.

1372
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240

 

1373
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,389

What an awful awful start again.

1374
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399

 

1375
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,029

I really don't know what you're going to

1376
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
I really don't know what you're going to
 

1377
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,870
I really don't know what you're going to
do with that. What's your opening

1378
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
do with that. What's your opening
 

1379
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,110
do with that. What's your opening
candle?

1380
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,120
candle?
 

1381
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,750
candle?
I guess one, two, three, four, five.

1382
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:27,760
I guess one, two, three, four, five.
 

1383
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,029
I guess one, two, three, four, five.
There's nothing to play on a five

1384
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,039
There's nothing to play on a five
 

1385
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,470
There's nothing to play on a five
minute. So, I guess if you played like a

1386
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
minute. So, I guess if you played like a
 

1387
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,269
minute. So, I guess if you played like a
30 second orb, you probably got a flush

1388
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
30 second orb, you probably got a flush
 

1389
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,549
30 second orb, you probably got a flush
breakdown under there. But other than

1390
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:34,559
breakdown under there. But other than
 

1391
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,230
breakdown under there. But other than
that, I don't really see much to play

1392
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
that, I don't really see much to play
 

1393
00:30:36,240 --> 00:31:38,070
that, I don't really see much to play
with.

1394
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,080

 

1395
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,389

Apple losing that uh that edge. I just

1396
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:40,399
Apple losing that uh that edge. I just
 

1397
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,870
Apple losing that uh that edge. I just
got a notification. So Apple's crossing

1398
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
got a notification. So Apple's crossing
 

1399
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,110
got a notification. So Apple's crossing
the 82. So if it loses that, that's the

1400
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
the 82. So if it loses that, that's the
 

1401
00:31:45,120 --> 00:32:15,029
the 82. So if it loses that, that's the
breakdown level. So be aware of that.

1402
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,039

 

1403
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,950

Yeah, breaking down. You can see this

1404
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
Yeah, breaking down. You can see this
 

1405
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,590
Yeah, breaking down. You can see this
level I put on.

1406
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:19,600
level I put on.
 

1407
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,750
level I put on.
This can drag the market down with it if

1408
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
This can drag the market down with it if
 

1409
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,789
This can drag the market down with it if
it starts letting go.

1410
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:24,799
it starts letting go.
 

1411
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,149
it starts letting go.
That's why I put price like there.

1412
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:28,159
That's why I put price like there.
 

1413
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,509
That's why I put price like there.
Yeah, Apple heavy

1414
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519

 

1415
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,750

starting to lose 600s. It's starting to

1416
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:35,760
starting to lose 600s. It's starting to
 

1417
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,830
starting to lose 600s. It's starting to
retest time and time and time again and

1418
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:37,840
retest time and time and time again and
 

1419
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,070
retest time and time and time again and
starting to lose it.

1420
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,080

 

1421
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,230

No doubt about it. It's starting to lose

1422
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
No doubt about it. It's starting to lose
 

1423
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,909
No doubt about it. It's starting to lose
the 600s.

1424
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:47,919

 

1425
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,149

You might get a wash here if Apple if

1426
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:50,159
You might get a wash here if Apple if
 

1427
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,549
You might get a wash here if Apple if
it's a big if we lose 600 and Apple

1428
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559
it's a big if we lose 600 and Apple
 

1429
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,830
it's a big if we lose 600 and Apple
starts breaking down. You might get a

1430
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
starts breaking down. You might get a
 

1431
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,350
starts breaking down. You might get a
wash to previous day's value area low

1432
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,360
wash to previous day's value area low
 

1433
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,669
wash to previous day's value area low
and under that there is definitely a

1434
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
and under that there is definitely a
 

1435
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:05,029
and under that there is definitely a
bigger move available.

1436
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:05,039

 

1437
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,430

Just no follow through. Lots of bids

1438
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
Just no follow through. Lots of bids
 

1439
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,789
Just no follow through. Lots of bids
coming in here into 60s.

1440
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
coming in here into 60s.
 

1441
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,310
coming in here into 60s.
Wow, look at that. Straight back up to

1442
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
Wow, look at that. Straight back up to
 

1443
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,470
Wow, look at that. Straight back up to
test the 600s.

1444
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:14,480
test the 600s.
 

1445
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,070
test the 600s.
That will just get saved. They're trying

1446
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
That will just get saved. They're trying
 

1447
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,430
That will just get saved. They're trying
to save 82s.

1448
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440

 

1449
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,789

What an awful market, man. Okay, this is

1450
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:24,799
What an awful market, man. Okay, this is
 

1451
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,990
What an awful market, man. Okay, this is
your level now. Sort of 600, 610s. Bears

1452
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,000
your level now. Sort of 600, 610s. Bears
 

1453
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,350
your level now. Sort of 600, 610s. Bears
need to defend that. Failing to defend

1454
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
need to defend that. Failing to defend
 

1455
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,029
need to defend that. Failing to defend
that will open up a squeeze all the way

1456
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
that will open up a squeeze all the way
 

1457
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,190
that will open up a squeeze all the way
back up to 50s.

1458
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
back up to 50s.
 

1459
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,110
back up to 50s.
Fixes breaking out. Is there going to be

1460
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120
Fixes breaking out. Is there going to be
 

1461
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,789
Fixes breaking out. Is there going to be
follow through in this market or are we

1462
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:36,799
follow through in this market or are we
 

1463
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,549
follow through in this market or are we
just going to be stuck inside the

1464
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:38,559
just going to be stuck inside the
 

1465
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,070
just going to be stuck inside the
previous range, which is what we're in

1466
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
previous range, which is what we're in
 

1467
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,350
previous range, which is what we're in
at the moment? We're stuck inside

1468
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360
at the moment? We're stuck inside
 

1469
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,950
at the moment? We're stuck inside
previous days value.

1470
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960

 

1471
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,630

God awful.

1472
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,640

 

1473
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,669

So rejecting 600 again.

1474
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:57,679
So rejecting 600 again.
 

1475
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,750
So rejecting 600 again.
There's a bid down at 550. I'm wondering

1476
00:33:59,750 --> 00:33:59,760
There's a bid down at 550. I'm wondering
 

1477
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,230
There's a bid down at 550. I'm wondering
if we come down to him. That' be

1478
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
if we come down to him. That' be
 

1479
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:12,069
if we come down to him. That' be
previous day's value area low

1480
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:12,079

 

1481
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,550

600. Above 600 they can trigger like a

1482
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:14,560
600. Above 600 they can trigger like a
 

1483
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,750
600. Above 600 they can trigger like a
50 point squeeze very very quickly. Be

1484
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
50 point squeeze very very quickly. Be
 

1485
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:25,589
50 point squeeze very very quickly. Be
very careful there.

1486
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599

 

1487
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,030

1489
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,349

Don't know why I bother at the moment.

1490

Don't know why I bother at the moment.

Don't know why I bother at the moment.
So testing 600 again. Failing 600 again.

These buyers
no bears taking control. There's no

no bears taking control. There's no
 

1497
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,550
no bears taking control. There's no
follow through. Apple's now lost the

00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:42,560
follow through. Apple's now lost the
 

1499
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,190
follow through. Apple's now lost the
82s. That's that's a big problem for

1500
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
82s. That's that's a big problem for
 

1501
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,190
82s. That's that's a big problem for
this market. It just depends if the rest

1502
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,200
this market. It just depends if the rest
 

1503
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,430
this market. It just depends if the rest
of the market follows suit to go risk

00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:49,440
of the market follows suit to go risk
 

1505
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,310
of the market follows suit to go risk
off. That is a problem for the market, I

off. That is a problem for the market, I
 

1507
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,069
off. That is a problem for the market, I
would say, at the moment is lost the

would say, at the moment is lost the

There's just no follow through. Like

you need to be covering some into this

Because bulls needed to hold above here.

1663
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,589

It looks like it's just going to come
 

1667
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,069
It looks like it's just going to come
all the way down to 80 at the moment.

1668
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:12,079
all the way down to 80 at the moment.

Yeah, I'd say 80

1672
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,240
Yeah, I'd say 80
 

1673
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,990
Yeah, I'd say 80
8280 8260 looks key. So, and then under

1674
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,000
8280 8260 looks key. So, and then under
 

1675
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,270
8280 8260 looks key. So, and then under
that, back to the 80s. Under 80s, this

1676
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,280
that, back to the 80s. Under 80s, this
 

1677
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,190
that, back to the 80s. Under 80s, this
whole market burns. In my opinion,

1678
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,200
whole market burns. In my opinion,
 

1679
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,270
whole market burns. In my opinion,
you want to see it's starting to get

1680
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,280
you want to see it's starting to get
 

1681
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,030
you want to see it's starting to get
tight here. I'm just slightly cautious

1682
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
tight here. I'm just slightly cautious
 

1683
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,710
tight here. I'm just slightly cautious
about taking another trade. I'm not

1684
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,720
about taking another trade. I'm not
 

1685
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,910
about taking another trade. I'm not
seeing bears step in aggressively,

1686
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
seeing bears step in aggressively,
 

1687
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,069
seeing bears step in aggressively,
and that would concern me about thinking

1688
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:42,079
and that would concern me about thinking
 

1689
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,910
and that would concern me about thinking
about a short near previous day value

1690
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
about a short near previous day value
 

1691
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,150

tilted 725.
Oh, you were short from 725. Well, if

1700
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:54,880
Oh, you were short from 725. Well, if
 

1701
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,710
Oh, you were short from 725. Well, if
you close that out, then you made money

1702
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
you close that out, then you made money
 

1703
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,190
you close that out, then you made money
anyway. Don't Don't stress about it.

1704
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
anyway. Don't Don't stress about it.
 

1705
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,710
anyway. Don't Don't stress about it.
Don't get tilted about that.

1706
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:02,720
Don't get tilted about that.
 

1707
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,030
Don't get tilted about that.
I would get tilted if if you were the

1708
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,040
I would get tilted if if you were the
 

1709
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,550
I would get tilted if if you were the
wrong side of it. But you've made good

1710
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,560
wrong side of it. But you've made good
 

1711
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,950
wrong side of it. But you've made good
money on that. Don't even Don't even

1712
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:08,960
money on that. Don't even Don't even
 

1713
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:17,270

stress it.

1714
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:17,280

 

1715
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,910

Oh, please market.

1716
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:19,920
Oh, please market.
 

1717

Oh, please market.
Please don't just rotate for another

1718
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,000
Please don't just rotate for another
 

1719
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:40,310
Please don't just rotate for another
whole day. Please

1720
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:40,320

 

1721
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,550

anything else on the calendar? Bowman at

1722
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:42,560
anything else on the calendar? Bowman at
 

1723
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,589
anything else on the calendar? Bowman at
midday. That's it. Still rejecting those

1724
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
midday. That's it. Still rejecting those
 

1725
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,150
midday. That's it. Still rejecting those
600s, but uh this is not looking good if

1726
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
600s, but uh this is not looking good if
 

1727
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,990
600s, but uh this is not looking good if
you ask me.

1728
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,000
you ask me.
 

1729
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,910
you ask me.
Bears should have come flying in already

1730
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:51,920
Bears should have come flying in already
 

1731
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,670
Bears should have come flying in already
and they're not. That's the only thing

1732
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:53,680
and they're not. That's the only thing
 

1733
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,750
and they're not. That's the only thing
I'd say.

1734
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:55,760
I'd say.
 

1735
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,270
I'd say.
They should have come flying in. They

1736
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280
They should have come flying in. They
 

1737
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,829
They should have come flying in. They
had the chance to come flying in. We've

1738
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
had the chance to come flying in. We've
 

1739
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,829
had the chance to come flying in. We've
not even retested previous days value

1740
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:01,839
not even retested previous days value
 

1741
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,670
not even retested previous days value
area low. We got close, but we didn't

1742
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:03,680
area low. We got close, but we didn't
 

1743
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,309
area low. We got close, but we didn't
actually retest it. So, all the time

1744
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:06,319
actually retest it. So, all the time
 

1745
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,550
actually retest it. So, all the time
we're rejecting gray box. I'd say this

1746
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
we're rejecting gray box. I'd say this
 

1747
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,550
we're rejecting gray box. I'd say this
move here and potentially this move here

1748
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
move here and potentially this move here
 

1749
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,309
move here and potentially this move here
is possible. A reclaim of this. So, I'd

1750
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:12,319
is possible. A reclaim of this. So, I'd
 

1751
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,750
is possible. A reclaim of this. So, I'd
be risk off because then you're going to

1752
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,760
be risk off because then you're going to
 

1753
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,510
be risk off because then you're going to
see potential squeeze back up 6 650 and

1754
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
see potential squeeze back up 6 650 and
 

1755
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,870
see potential squeeze back up 6 650 and
then through that back to the highs. And

1756
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:18,880
then through that back to the highs. And
 

1757
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,230
then through that back to the highs. And
this is what we did the last few days,

1758
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,240
this is what we did the last few days,
 

1759
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,829
this is what we did the last few days,
isn't it? Big sell at the open,

1760
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:21,839
isn't it? Big sell at the open,
 

1761
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,589
isn't it? Big sell at the open,
sideways, sideways, sideways, grind,

1762
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:23,599
sideways, sideways, sideways, grind,
 

1763
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,109
sideways, sideways, sideways, grind,
grind, grind, grind, grind all the way

1764
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:25,119
grind, grind, grind, grind all the way
 

1765
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,790
grind, grind, grind, grind all the way
back up. So, just be aware of that. If

1766
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:26,800
back up. So, just be aware of that. If
 

1767
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,109
back up. So, just be aware of that. If
it reclaims this gray box here, I'd be

1768
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:29,119
it reclaims this gray box here, I'd be
 

1769
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,510
it reclaims this gray box here, I'd be
uh very concerned about looking for any

1770
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520
uh very concerned about looking for any
 

1771
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:52,069
uh very concerned about looking for any
more downside.

1772
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:52,079

 

1773
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,750

Sorry, I know I know I'm quiet, guys,

1774
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
Sorry, I know I know I'm quiet, guys,
 

1775
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,510
Sorry, I know I know I'm quiet, guys,
but there's there's nothing more to do

1776
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:55,520
but there's there's nothing more to do
 

1777
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,990
but there's there's nothing more to do
than that. Spy did just reject its

1778
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,000
than that. Spy did just reject its
 

1779
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,910
than that. Spy did just reject its
attempt to reclaim PDC. So, that's

1780
00:41:59,910 --> 00:41:59,920
attempt to reclaim PDC. So, that's
 

1781
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,309
attempt to reclaim PDC. So, that's
pretty bearish, actually. See if they

1782
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:02,319
pretty bearish, actually. See if they
 

1783
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:13,190
pretty bearish, actually. See if they
actually get follow through, though.

1784
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,200

 

1785
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,190

Still not taking out the 50s. I still

1786
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,200
Still not taking out the 50s. I still
 

1787
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,790
Still not taking out the 50s. I still
feel like it wants to get to the 50s.

1788
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
feel like it wants to get to the 50s.
 

1789
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:28,390
feel like it wants to get to the 50s.
They're sat there.

1790

They're trying to sell through these

1798
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:40,480
They're trying to sell through these
 

1799
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,910
They're trying to sell through these
participants. There's just no uh no big

1800
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:43,920
participants. There's just no uh no big
 

1801
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,910
participants. There's just no uh no big
knife, which is what I'd be looking for

1802
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
knife, which is what I'd be looking for
 

1803
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,670
knife, which is what I'd be looking for
of that big big knife sell candle.

1804
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,680
of that big big knife sell candle.
 

1805
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,150
of that big big knife sell candle.
Feels like it's coming. Here we go. All

1806
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,160
Feels like it's coming. Here we go. All
 

1807
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,950
Feels like it's coming. Here we go. All
right. 50s are coming up here. This

1808
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
right. 50s are coming up here. This
 

1809
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,470
right. 50s are coming up here. This
player on a bit. Let's see if he pulls

1810
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:56,480
player on a bit. Let's see if he pulls
 

1811
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,230
player on a bit. Let's see if he pulls
his order.

1812
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,240
his order.
 

1813
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,990
his order.
This is better. Now they're having a

1814
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,000
This is better. Now they're having a
 

1815
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,750
This is better. Now they're having a
good go. They just needed to retest one

1816
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:01,760
good go. They just needed to retest one
 

1817
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,270
good go. They just needed to retest one
more time. All right. So cover point

1818
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:03,280
more time. All right. So cover point
 

1819
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,630
more time. All right. So cover point
here into previous day value area low

1820
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:06,640
here into previous day value area low
 

1821
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,230
here into previous day value area low
and then hold your runners because if

1822
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
and then hold your runners because if
 

1823
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,309
and then hold your runners because if
you get a breakdown we can look at PD

1824
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
you get a breakdown we can look at PD
 

1825
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,470
you get a breakdown we can look at PD
PDH and we can look at this low down

1826
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:12,480
PDH and we can look at this low down
 

1827
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,510
PDH and we can look at this low down
here into four 418s.

1828
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
here into four 418s.
 

1829
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,349
here into four 418s.
So here's your previous day value low.

1830
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359
So here's your previous day value low.
 

1831
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,750
So here's your previous day value low.
So this must be TP.

1832
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:19,760
So this must be TP.
 

1833
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,349
So this must be TP.
Take some of your size off here into

1834
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:21,359
Take some of your size off here into
 

1835
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,030
Take some of your size off here into
this

1836
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
this
 

1837
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,349
this
and let's see if they uh want to let go

1838
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
and let's see if they uh want to let go
 

1839
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,109
and let's see if they uh want to let go
of previous day's value and let us

1840
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:27,119
of previous day's value and let us
 

1841
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,349
of previous day's value and let us
rotate or not. If they hold previous

1842
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
rotate or not. If they hold previous
 

1843
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,990
rotate or not. If they hold previous
day's value, then this whole day, right,

1844
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
day's value, then this whole day, right,
 

1845
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,349
day's value, then this whole day, right,
if they keep holding previous days

1846
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
if they keep holding previous days
 

1847
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,109
if they keep holding previous days
value, this whole day is going to trade

1848
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:35,119
value, this whole day is going to trade
 

1849
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,870
value, this whole day is going to trade
inside this box. All right, this is what

1850
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:36,880
inside this box. All right, this is what
 

1851
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,109
inside this box. All right, this is what
we did yesterday. We traded inside this.

1852
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:39,119
we did yesterday. We traded inside this.
 

1853
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,109
we did yesterday. We traded inside this.
We haven't held it. We've come down and

1854
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:41,119
We haven't held it. We've come down and
 

1855
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,030
We haven't held it. We've come down and
retested it. All right, if we can't

1856
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
retested it. All right, if we can't
 

1857
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,470
retested it. All right, if we can't
break down under this or we do a look

1858
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:44,480
break down under this or we do a look
 

1859
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,990
break down under this or we do a look
below and reclaim, then we're going to

1860
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
below and reclaim, then we're going to
 

1861
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,910
below and reclaim, then we're going to
come back up and test these. If we

1862
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:47,920
come back up and test these. If we
 

1863
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,309
come back up and test these. If we
sustain an auction lower under here,

1864
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
sustain an auction lower under here,
 

1865
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,470
sustain an auction lower under here,
then my expectation is the low 400s.

1866
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:54,480
then my expectation is the low 400s.
 

1867
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,230
then my expectation is the low 400s.
And once we get under there, that will

1868
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:56,240
And once we get under there, that will
 

1869
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,870
And once we get under there, that will
be the 680 on SPY. If we let go of that,

1870
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:58,880
be the 680 on SPY. If we let go of that,
 

1871
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,589
be the 680 on SPY. If we let go of that,
we will get a big big puke out. Big puke

1872
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
we will get a big big puke out. Big puke
 

1873
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,470
we will get a big big puke out. Big puke
out.

1874
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,480
out.
 

1875
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:12,069
out.
Can we see 398 today? Um,

1876
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:12,079

 

1877
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,870

I mean, yes, potentially. I mean,

1878
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:14,880
I mean, yes, potentially. I mean,
 

1879
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,630
I mean, yes, potentially. I mean,
potentially we can see zero today,

1880
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:16,640
potentially we can see zero today,
 

1881
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,990
potentially we can see zero today,
right? So, I'd be watching for 420s. If

1882
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
right? So, I'd be watching for 420s. If
 

1883
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,829
right? So, I'd be watching for 420s. If
we break this, I'd be watching for 420s.

1884
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
we break this, I'd be watching for 420s.
 

1885
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,990
we break this, I'd be watching for 420s.
That would be my first port of call. Can

1886
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,000
That would be my first port of call. Can
 

1887
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,829
That would be my first port of call. Can
we get down into this? because we left

1888
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
we get down into this? because we left
 

1889
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,150
we get down into this? because we left
that yesterday and I said that we leave

1890
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,160
that yesterday and I said that we leave
 

1891
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,190
that yesterday and I said that we leave
that it looks uh a little bit dubious

1892
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200

 

1893
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,750

but they can still hold a bid here. All

1894
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
but they can still hold a bid here. All
 

1895
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,030
but they can still hold a bid here. All
right, this value area is the spike high

1896
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,040
right, this value area is the spike high
 

1897
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,069
right, this value area is the spike high
from that Sunday open. Is it Sunday open

1898
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:44,079
from that Sunday open. Is it Sunday open
 

1899
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,230
from that Sunday open. Is it Sunday open
or Friday close? Can't remember. Is it

1900
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,240
or Friday close? Can't remember. Is it
 

1901
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:53,750
or Friday close? Can't remember. Is it
Sunday open? Seems like Sunday open.

1902
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760

 

1903
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,670

This is like the Sunday open high where

1904
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:55,680
This is like the Sunday open high where
 

1905
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,069
This is like the Sunday open high where
we are now. So you got to be covering

1906
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079
we are now. So you got to be covering
 

1907
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,309
we are now. So you got to be covering
some here. But what is looking good is

1908
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:00,319
some here. But what is looking good is
 

1909
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,430
some here. But what is looking good is
VIX is still driving higher

1910
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,440
VIX is still driving higher
 

1911
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,430
VIX is still driving higher
and it's got room. If we start breaking

1912
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,440
and it's got room. If we start breaking
 

1913
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,510
and it's got room. If we start breaking
out of uh 60 1660 on the VIX, we can

1914
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
out of uh 60 1660 on the VIX, we can
 

1915
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,030
out of uh 60 1660 on the VIX, we can
trade all the way back up to 17s.

1916
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,040
trade all the way back up to 17s.
 

1917
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,710
trade all the way back up to 17s.
That will increase sellside pressure on

1918
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:14,720
That will increase sellside pressure on
 

1919
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,550
That will increase sellside pressure on
this market.

1920
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,560
this market.
 

1921
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,109
this market.
Yeah, you should be uh have trimmed some

1922
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:19,119
Yeah, you should be uh have trimmed some
 

1923
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,069
Yeah, you should be uh have trimmed some
of your size down here as we traded into

1924
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:22,079
of your size down here as we traded into
 

1925
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,670
of your size down here as we traded into
value. And now you can just wait.

1926
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
value. And now you can just wait.
 

1927
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,030
value. And now you can just wait.
Hopefully, you've got room. If you were

1928
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,040
Hopefully, you've got room. If you were
 

1929
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,710
Hopefully, you've got room. If you were
entering at 600, you know, you've made

1930
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:26,720
entering at 600, you know, you've made
 

1931
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,109
entering at 600, you know, you've made
50 points, you've got room to see if

1932
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:29,119
50 points, you've got room to see if
 

1933
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,550
50 points, you've got room to see if
your runners will go for you. And if

1934
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:30,560
your runners will go for you. And if
 

1935
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,790
your runners will go for you. And if
they do, you're going to get about 100

1936
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:32,800
they do, you're going to get about 100
 

1937
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,190
they do, you're going to get about 100
point trade out of this. If you're

1938
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,200
point trade out of this. If you're
 

1939
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,230
point trade out of this. If you're
actually more than that, you're going to

1940
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
actually more than that, you're going to
 

1941
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,750
actually more than that, you're going to
get 200 point trade. So, if you were

1942
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
get 200 point trade. So, if you were
 

1943
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,190
get 200 point trade. So, if you were
short anywhere around these here, either

1944
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:41,200
short anywhere around these here, either
 

1945
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,870
short anywhere around these here, either
650 or 600s, here's your TP1. The TP2 is

1946
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880
650 or 600s, here's your TP1. The TP2 is
 

1947
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,270
650 or 600s, here's your TP1. The TP2 is
all the way down here. Do not hold on a

1948
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
all the way down here. Do not hold on a
 

1949
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,870
all the way down here. Do not hold on a
reclaim of this level here. All right,

1950
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
reclaim of this level here. All right,
 

1951
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,710
reclaim of this level here. All right,
this is a flat top here. If it reclaims

1952
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:50,720
this is a flat top here. If it reclaims
 

1953
00:45:50,720 --> 00:46:01,349
this is a flat top here. If it reclaims
this, you cut the trade.

1954
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,359

 

1955
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,790

Really, you'd want them to reject this

1956
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
Really, you'd want them to reject this
 

1957
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,589
Really, you'd want them to reject this
shelf here. Now, 76 is right. So,

1958
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:05,599
shelf here. Now, 76 is right. So,
 

1959
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,309
shelf here. Now, 76 is right. So,
really, you'd want this to be rejected.

1960
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
really, you'd want this to be rejected.
 

1961
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:13,109
really, you'd want this to be rejected.
So, I'm going to do this

1962
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:13,119

 

1963
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,829

as red a bit thicker. And those are your

1964
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
as red a bit thicker. And those are your
 

1965
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,349
as red a bit thicker. And those are your
levels. Really, you'd want that gray box

1966
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:17,359
levels. Really, you'd want that gray box
 

1967
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:29,670
levels. Really, you'd want that gray box
to reject

1968
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680

 

1969
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,470

so far. They tried to buy into it.

1970
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:32,480
so far. They tried to buy into it.
 

1971
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,589
so far. They tried to buy into it.
There's a passive seller up there

1972
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
There's a passive seller up there
 

1973
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,870
There's a passive seller up there
because we saw some aggressive buying

1974
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880
because we saw some aggressive buying
 

1975
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,030
because we saw some aggressive buying
into it. There is still a passive seller

1976
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,040
into it. There is still a passive seller
 

1977
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,510
into it. There is still a passive seller
at 80s, which is good, which is what you

1978
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:39,520
at 80s, which is good, which is what you
 

1979
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,069
at 80s, which is good, which is what you
want to see. Really nice. This is much

1980
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:42,079
want to see. Really nice. This is much
 

1981
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,510
want to see. Really nice. This is much
better now, folks. What I'm starting to

1982
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:43,520
better now, folks. What I'm starting to
 

1983
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,870
better now, folks. What I'm starting to
see on the tape is starting to look a

1984
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
see on the tape is starting to look a
 

1985
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,790
see on the tape is starting to look a
bit better. So, we had some aggressive

1986
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,800
bit better. So, we had some aggressive
 

1987
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,790
bit better. So, we had some aggressive
buying into 70 and 80, and they didn't

1988
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:48,800
buying into 70 and 80, and they didn't
 

1989
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,230
buying into 70 and 80, and they didn't
get anywhere. So, there is a passive

1990
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:50,240
get anywhere. So, there is a passive
 

1991
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,710
get anywhere. So, there is a passive
seller still at 70s and 80s. All the

1992
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,720
seller still at 70s and 80s. All the
 

1993
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,390
seller still at 70s and 80s. All the
time he's there, we can potentially move

1994
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
time he's there, we can potentially move
 

1995
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,790
time he's there, we can potentially move
lower. If he gets taken out though, I'd

1996
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
lower. If he gets taken out though, I'd
 

1997
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,309
lower. If he gets taken out though, I'd
be very, very cautious. All right. So,

1998
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:58,319
be very, very cautious. All right. So,
 

1999
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,309
be very, very cautious. All right. So,
this gray box, that's kind of your first

2000
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:00,319
this gray box, that's kind of your first
 

2001
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,470
this gray box, that's kind of your first
overunder. If we start eating through

2002
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:02,480
overunder. If we start eating through
 

2003
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,230
overunder. If we start eating through
that, it's we can still reject up here

2004
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,240
that, it's we can still reject up here
 

2005
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,710
that, it's we can still reject up here
into 600, but really we want this edge

2006
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
into 600, but really we want this edge
 

2007
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,150
into 600, but really we want this edge
to stay heavy, especially now that I've

2008
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
to stay heavy, especially now that I've
 

2009
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,430
to stay heavy, especially now that I've
seen that there's a passive seller on

2010
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:09,440
seen that there's a passive seller on
 

2011
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:16,230
seen that there's a passive seller on
the book up there.

2012
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:16,240

 

2013
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,750

Spine to 683. Remember 82s was a level.

2014
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:19,760
Spine to 683. Remember 82s was a level.
 

2015
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,670
Spine to 683. Remember 82s was a level.
There was a level at 82s when I looked

2016
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:21,680
There was a level at 82s when I looked
 

2017
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,510
There was a level at 82s when I looked
last night on the options chain. The

2018
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:23,520
last night on the options chain. The
 

2019
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:53,510
last night on the options chain. The
bigger level obviously is 80.

2020
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520

 

2021
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,950

Okay, we're into a new hour here.

2022
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
Okay, we're into a new hour here.
 

2023
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,710
Okay, we're into a new hour here.
Need to be careful. We're into new H1,

2024
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
Need to be careful. We're into new H1,
 

2025
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,270
Need to be careful. We're into new H1,
H4 here.

2026
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:01,280
H4 here.
 

2027
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,349
H4 here.
Do need to be careful of this. We might

2028
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
Do need to be careful of this. We might
 

2029
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,349
Do need to be careful of this. We might
see a rebalance. Rebalance could take us

2030
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:05,359
see a rebalance. Rebalance could take us
 

2031
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,670
see a rebalance. Rebalance could take us
all the way back up to 620s, which is

2032
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
all the way back up to 620s, which is
 

2033
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,950
all the way back up to 620s, which is
not ideal. Do not want to see that.

2034
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:12,960

 

2035
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,630

It's coming back up to maybe test the

2036
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:14,640
It's coming back up to maybe test the
 

2037
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,150
It's coming back up to maybe test the
edge of this gray box. If we get through

2038
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,160
edge of this gray box. If we get through
 

2039
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,710
edge of this gray box. If we get through
it, then they're going to come and test

2040
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:18,720
it, then they're going to come and test
 

2041
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,550
it, then they're going to come and test
610.

2042
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:20,560
610.
 

2043
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,150
610.
I don't want to be in anything if we're

2044
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
I don't want to be in anything if we're
 

2045
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,069
I don't want to be in anything if we're
coming up there. Here come the

2046
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:24,079
coming up there. Here come the
 

2047
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,430
coming up there. Here come the
aggressive buyers again. There's still a

2048
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
aggressive buyers again. There's still a
 

2049
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,589
aggressive buyers again. There's still a
passive seller up here, right? That's

2050
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
passive seller up here, right? That's
 

2051
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,510
passive seller up here, right? That's
another attempt to break into the 80s.

2052
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:29,520
another attempt to break into the 80s.
 

2053
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:55,270
another attempt to break into the 80s.
There's still a passive seller up there.

2054
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,280

 

2055
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,790

Don't think he's going to have unlimited

2056
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
Don't think he's going to have unlimited
 

2057
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,710
Don't think he's going to have unlimited
funds.

2058
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,720
funds.
 

2059
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,270
funds.
If these buyers keep going, at some

2060
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:01,280
If these buyers keep going, at some
 

2061
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:13,030
If these buyers keep going, at some
point he won't be there anymore.

2062
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,040

 

2063
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,470

Aggressive selling coming in now.

2064
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:14,480
Aggressive selling coming in now.
 

2065
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,910
Aggressive selling coming in now.
They're looking for a breakdown. Let's

2066
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:15,920
They're looking for a breakdown. Let's
 

2067
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,270
They're looking for a breakdown. Let's
see if there's someone on the bid the

2068
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,280
see if there's someone on the bid the
 

2069
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,670
see if there's someone on the bid the
other side of it.

2070
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:23,680

 

2071
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,790

Oh, it's slow, isn't it?

2072
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:26,800
Oh, it's slow, isn't it?
 

2073
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,790
Oh, it's slow, isn't it?
Always

2074
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:28,800
Always
 

2075
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,950
Always
worries me when we're slow near an edge.

2076
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
worries me when we're slow near an edge.
 

2077
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,309
worries me when we're slow near an edge.
You just think wouldn't take that much

2078
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:32,319
You just think wouldn't take that much
 

2079
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:42,549
You just think wouldn't take that much
to turn it around.

2080
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:42,559

 

2081
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:43,990

These buyers at the moment can't get

2082
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
These buyers at the moment can't get
 

2083
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,549
These buyers at the moment can't get
back through 80. They keep trying over

2084
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
back through 80. They keep trying over
 

2085
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,150
back through 80. They keep trying over
and over again. It doesn't mean it won't

2086
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:48,160
and over again. It doesn't mean it won't
 

2087
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,670
and over again. It doesn't mean it won't
happen, but they've tried one, two,

2088
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:49,680
happen, but they've tried one, two,
 

2089
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,150
happen, but they've tried one, two,
three, four, five times here

2090
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,160
three, four, five times here
 

2091
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,150
three, four, five times here
aggressively as well, market buys, and

2092
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:54,160
aggressively as well, market buys, and
 

2093
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,190
aggressively as well, market buys, and
they're not getting their way.

2094
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200

 

2095
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,589

Apple trying to reapproach 282. So, I

2096
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:01,599
Apple trying to reapproach 282. So, I
 

2097
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,430
Apple trying to reapproach 282. So, I
want to be careful on a reclaim of that.

2098
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,440
want to be careful on a reclaim of that.
 

2099
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,950
want to be careful on a reclaim of that.
That might signal that the market's not

2100
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:04,960
That might signal that the market's not
 

2101
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:29,670
That might signal that the market's not
willing to move lower.

2102
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,680

 

2103
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,829

Uh maybe Zav, but I don't think we will

2104
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:31,839
Uh maybe Zav, but I don't think we will
 

2105
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,069
Uh maybe Zav, but I don't think we will
sit in this same range until next

2106
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:34,079
sit in this same range until next
 

2107
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,549
sit in this same range until next
Wednesday. I think that's asking quite a

2108
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
Wednesday. I think that's asking quite a
 

2109
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,270
Wednesday. I think that's asking quite a
lot of the market. I think we'll see a

2110
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
lot of the market. I think we'll see a
 

2111
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,710
lot of the market. I think we'll see a
move out of the range before FOMC.

2112
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
move out of the range before FOMC.
 

2113
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,589
move out of the range before FOMC.
I think you find we've already priced in

2114
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:45,599
I think you find we've already priced in
 

2115
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,030
I think you find we've already priced in
the the cut. It's the something like a

2116
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,040
the the cut. It's the something like a
 

2117
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,670
the the cut. It's the something like a
85% chance of a cut now in December. I

2118
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:51,680
85% chance of a cut now in December. I
 

2119
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,790
85% chance of a cut now in December. I
think that you'll find that we've

2120
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:52,800
think that you'll find that we've
 

2121
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,870
think that you'll find that we've
already priced in

2122
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
already priced in
 

2123
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,470
already priced in
because we're back to where we were when

2124
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
because we're back to where we were when
 

2125
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,710
because we're back to where we were when
we thought the cut was going to happen,

2126
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
we thought the cut was going to happen,
 

2127
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,270
we thought the cut was going to happen,
especially on the S&P. All right, retest

2128
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
especially on the S&P. All right, retest
 

2129
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,430
especially on the S&P. All right, retest
of 80s here. 95% now is it? Jeez. Yeah.

2130
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:05,440
of 80s here. 95% now is it? Jeez. Yeah.
 

2131
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,630
of 80s here. 95% now is it? Jeez. Yeah.
So, that's just getting higher and

2132
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
So, that's just getting higher and
 

2133
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:17,109
So, that's just getting higher and
higher and higher.

2134
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:17,119

 

2135
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,190

This 80s is where this seller's been

2136
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
This 80s is where this seller's been
 

2137
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,190
This 80s is where this seller's been
hanging out. And I don't think he's

2138
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:21,200
hanging out. And I don't think he's
 

2139
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,470
hanging out. And I don't think he's
going to be here too much longer because

2140
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:22,480
going to be here too much longer because
 

2141
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,430
going to be here too much longer because
they keep chomping through him.

2142
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,440
they keep chomping through him.
 

2143
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,270
they keep chomping through him.
So this gray box and if they get through

2144
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
So this gray box and if they get through
 

2145
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,750
So this gray box and if they get through
gray box, they're going to go red box.

2146
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:29,760
gray box, they're going to go red box.
 

2147
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,589
gray box, they're going to go red box.
But if they protect gray box, I think we

2148
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
But if they protect gray box, I think we
 

2149
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:46,069
But if they protect gray box, I think we
can potentially see new lows.

2150
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:46,079

 

2151
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,910

We are protecting previous days value

2152
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
We are protecting previous days value
 

2153
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,950
We are protecting previous days value
area low right now.

2154
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
area low right now.
 

2155
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,829
area low right now.
at the moment. No doubt about it.

2156
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839

2157
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,510

Creating a bit of a new shelf here. So,

2158
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
Creating a bit of a new shelf here. So,
 

2159
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,950
Creating a bit of a new shelf here. So,
I'd say this little spike here is

2160
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
I'd say this little spike here is
 

2161
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,190
I'd say this little spike here is
starting to become important.

2162
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,200

 

2163
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,630

Alls are protecting that at the moment.

2164
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640

 

2165
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,190

Basically 80 to 60 point range.

2166
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,200
Basically 80 to 60 point range.
 

2167
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,270
Basically 80 to 60 point range.
Just like this. That's your range. this

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,510

We break under value though yesterday's

We break under value though yesterday's
 

2173

We break under value though yesterday's

Are they going to expend expand current

2180
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
Are they going to expend expand current
 

2181
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:45,109
Are they going to expend expand current
value on this session or not?

2182
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:45,119

 

2183
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,470

It's rejecting 80s again.

2184
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480

 

2185
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,390

Not seeing expansion of current value

2186
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
Not seeing expansion of current value
 

2187
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,349
Not seeing expansion of current value
yet.

2188
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359

 

2189
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,270

They're trying to sell this same level.

2190
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
They're trying to sell this same level.
 

2191
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,630
They're trying to sell this same level.
They've tried these. So, there's been

2192
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:00,640
They've tried these. So, there's been
 

2193
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,309
They've tried these. So, there's been
aggressive sellers at 60 uh for 1 2 3 4

2194
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,319
aggressive sellers at 60 uh for 1 2 3 4
 

2195
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,670
aggressive sellers at 60 uh for 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 minutes. They've tried to

2196
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:07,680
5 6 7 minutes. They've tried to
 

2197
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,430
5 6 7 minutes. They've tried to
aggressively sell 60 without getting

2198
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,440
aggressively sell 60 without getting
 

2199
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,270
aggressively sell 60 without getting
their way, which means there's a buyer

2200
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:11,280
their way, which means there's a buyer
 

2201
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,589
their way, which means there's a buyer
here.

2202
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:13,599
here.
 

2203
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,670
here.
There's a buyer at 60. All right. So,

2204
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:15,680
There's a buyer at 60. All right. So,
 

2205
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,950
There's a buyer at 60. All right. So,
there's a seller at 80 and there's a

2206
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:16,960
there's a seller at 80 and there's a
 

2207
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,630
there's a seller at 80 and there's a
passive buyer at 60, which is why we

2208
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
passive buyer at 60, which is why we
 

2209
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,990
passive buyer at 60, which is why we
keep getting blocked in. So, there's

2210
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
keep getting blocked in. So, there's
 

2211
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,549
keep getting blocked in. So, there's
someone just limit buying, refreshing

2212
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:22,559
someone just limit buying, refreshing
 

2213
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,549
someone just limit buying, refreshing
here, and there's some someone

2214
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:26,559
here, and there's some someone
 

2215
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,549
here, and there's some someone
limit selling, refreshing here, which is

2216
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,559
limit selling, refreshing here, which is
 

2217
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,549
limit selling, refreshing here, which is
why we keep getting these wicks this

2218
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
why we keep getting these wicks this
 

2219
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,390
why we keep getting these wicks this
side and wicks this side. Right? And

2220
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,400
side and wicks this side. Right? And
 

2221
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,150
side and wicks this side. Right? And
we're just doing this dance. Once one of

2222
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
we're just doing this dance. Once one of
 

2223
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,750
we're just doing this dance. Once one of
those loes, I think either this or this

2224
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:37,760
those loes, I think either this or this
 

2225
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,430
those loes, I think either this or this
is going to happen. Well, I don't think

2226
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
is going to happen. Well, I don't think
 

2227
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:54,150
is going to happen. Well, I don't think
I know.

2228
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,160

 

2229
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,670

Yeah. Well, there you go, JD. I mean,

2230
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:55,680
Yeah. Well, there you go, JD. I mean,
 

2231
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,309
Yeah. Well, there you go, JD. I mean,
then it's priced in then, isn't it?

2232
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:58,319
then it's priced in then, isn't it?
 

2233
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,510
then it's priced in then, isn't it?
Yeah. You know, if we think about this

2234
00:53:59,510 --> 00:53:59,520
Yeah. You know, if we think about this
 

2235
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,589
Yeah. You know, if we think about this
on a

2236
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:01,599
on a
 

2237
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,470
on a
on a daily,

2238
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:06,480

 

2239
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,109

all right, this was basically up here.

2240
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
all right, this was basically up here.
 

2241
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,790
all right, this was basically up here.
We were like, "Yeah, we're going to do

2242
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
We were like, "Yeah, we're going to do
 

2243
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,069
We were like, "Yeah, we're going to do
December rate cuts." Okay. And then

2244
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
December rate cuts." Okay. And then
 

2245
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,230
December rate cuts." Okay. And then
market came out. We had AI fear and

2246
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,240
market came out. We had AI fear and
 

2247
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,910
market came out. We had AI fear and
everything else. And then power gave the

2248
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:17,920
everything else. And then power gave the
 

2249
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,790
everything else. And then power gave the
like little sort of hawkish tone and we

2250
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:20,800
like little sort of hawkish tone and we
 

2251
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,829
like little sort of hawkish tone and we
lost it. And then down here, Fed came

2252
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:23,839
lost it. And then down here, Fed came
 

2253
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,750
lost it. And then down here, Fed came
back in and said, "No, no, no. We still

2254
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:25,760
back in and said, "No, no, no. We still
 

2255
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,589
back in and said, "No, no, no. We still
think we're going to cut." Oh, well,

2256
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,599
think we're going to cut." Oh, well,
 

2257
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,349
think we're going to cut." Oh, well,
we're right back to where we were,

2258
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:29,359
we're right back to where we were,
 

2259
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,190
we're right back to where we were,
right? So, I think it's kind of priced

2260
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200
right? So, I think it's kind of priced
 

2261
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,990
right? So, I think it's kind of priced
in.

2262
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000

 

2263
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,190

And I don't think

2264
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:41,200

 

2265
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,150

we can just stay here forever.

2266
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,160
we can just stay here forever.
 

2267
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,230
we can just stay here forever.
I think we either need a drift down here

2268
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,240
I think we either need a drift down here
 

2269
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,750
I think we either need a drift down here
or it just needs to put on a giant

2270
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:47,760
or it just needs to put on a giant
 

2271
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,589
or it just needs to put on a giant
squeeze and just trash everyone out. I

2272
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:49,599
squeeze and just trash everyone out. I
 

2273
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,109
squeeze and just trash everyone out. I
don't think we stay in here till next

2274
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:51,119
don't think we stay in here till next
 

2275
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,870
don't think we stay in here till next
Wednesday. I think that's asking too

2276
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880
Wednesday. I think that's asking too
 

2277
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,910
Wednesday. I think that's asking too
much of the market.

2278
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
much of the market.
 

2279
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,990
much of the market.
But who knows? Maybe you're right. Who

2280
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
But who knows? Maybe you're right. Who
 

2281
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,309
But who knows? Maybe you're right. Who
was it that said it? Zar or Zav Zav.

2282
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:00,319
was it that said it? Zar or Zav Zav.
 

2283
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,829
was it that said it? Zar or Zav Zav.
Maybe you're right. Maybe they are able

2284
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
Maybe you're right. Maybe they are able
 

2285
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,270
Maybe you're right. Maybe they are able
to do it. But I think that's asking

2286
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:03,280
to do it. But I think that's asking
 

2287
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,910
to do it. But I think that's asking
quite a lot to pin us for that amount of

2288
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:05,920
quite a lot to pin us for that amount of
 

2289
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:12,870
quite a lot to pin us for that amount of
time.

2290
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880

 

2291
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,750

Oh, I want to go back to sleep. Market's

2292
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,760
Oh, I want to go back to sleep. Market's
 

2293
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,190
Oh, I want to go back to sleep. Market's
not moving.

2294
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,200

 

2295
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,430

It's just so silly. It's so dumb.

2296
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:23,440
It's just so silly. It's so dumb.
 

2297
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,069
It's just so silly. It's so dumb.
Pre-market 100 point spike takes out the

2298
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:26,079
Pre-market 100 point spike takes out the
 

2299
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,069
Pre-market 100 point spike takes out the
liquidity, comes back under, goes

2300
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
liquidity, comes back under, goes
 

2301
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,430
liquidity, comes back under, goes
sideways, open, dump, pull back, and now

2302
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
sideways, open, dump, pull back, and now
 

2303
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,829
sideways, open, dump, pull back, and now
just trapped. My bias really is the

2304
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
just trapped. My bias really is the
 

2305
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,270
just trapped. My bias really is the
moment we break this blue line, we're

2306
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,280
moment we break this blue line, we're
 

2307
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,710
moment we break this blue line, we're
probably coming down to this white line

2308
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
probably coming down to this white line
 

2309
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,950
probably coming down to this white line
here.

2310
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960
here.
 

2311
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,829
here.
But it's hard to be bearish at the low

2312
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:41,839
But it's hard to be bearish at the low
 

2313
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,069
But it's hard to be bearish at the low
of the previous day value, right?

2314
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:44,079
of the previous day value, right?
 

2315
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,910
of the previous day value, right?
Because that's where we found bids from

2316
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:45,920
Because that's where we found bids from
 

2317
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,510
Because that's where we found bids from
yesterday, isn't it? Think about this.

2318
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
yesterday, isn't it? Think about this.
 

2319
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,510
yesterday, isn't it? Think about this.
Where we found bids from yesterday.

2320
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:49,520
Where we found bids from yesterday.
 

2321
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,270
Where we found bids from yesterday.

00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,280
sellers got trapped down here yesterday.
 

2323
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,829
sellers got trapped down here yesterday.
We found bids here and the day before,

2324
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:53,839
We found bids here and the day before,
 

2325
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,270
We found bids here and the day before,
right? So

2326
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:57,280

 

2327
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,030

be careful trying to get short too late

2328
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
be careful trying to get short too late
 

2329
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:19,430
be careful trying to get short too late
in the day.

2330
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:19,440

 

2331
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,430

Been down here so long now PC has now

2332
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:21,440

00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:41,349

It's red line.

2336
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:41,359

 

2337
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,430

I think there's a big sell coming. I

2338
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:43,440
I think there's a big sell coming. I
 

2339
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,670
I think there's a big sell coming. I
think it's coming because

2340
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:45,680
think it's coming because
 

2341
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,789
think it's coming because
buyers are not getting the squeeze out.

2342
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:48,799
buyers are not getting the squeeze out.
 

2343
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:55,750
buyers are not getting the squeeze out.
I think there's a snap coming soon.

2344
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:55,760

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,470
They're coming back to check him to see

00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:46,150
if he's going to refresh it again and
buy again.

Someone's going to get caught.

2386
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:18,880

Selling through him now. Now they're
 

2397
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,910

2398
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
going to come for the 40s.
 

2399
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,270

2403
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,510

A decent size bid at 40s that we can't

2404
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:41,520
A decent size bid at 40s that we can't
 

2405
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,910
A decent size bid at 40s that we can't
even get down into.

2406
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:47,920

 

2407
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,990

back to the 60s where that refresh bid

2408
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:50,000

was before.

2410
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:55,280

 

2411
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,349

This was his level

2412
00:58:59,349 --> 00:58:59,359

 

2413
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,230

2419
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,750
Come back down to test him again at 60s.
What a mess. Is he going to save this

2420
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:13,760
What a mess. Is he going to save this
 

2421
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,150
What a mess. Is he going to save this
and cause a squeeze now? Yep.

2422
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:18,160
and cause a squeeze now? Yep.
 

2423
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,069
and cause a squeeze now? Yep.
What a messy tape.

2424
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:22,079

 

2425
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,030

Oh, what a messy tape.

2426
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:27,040

 

2427
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,309

Well, that says everything you need to

2428
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
Well, that says everything you need to
 

2429
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,870
Well, that says everything you need to
know. He refreshed bid over and over and

2430
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:30,880
know. He refreshed bid over and over and
 

2431
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,470
know. He refreshed bid over and over and
over again at 60. Then he pulled his

2432
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:32,480
over again at 60. Then he pulled his
 

2433
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,990
over again at 60. Then he pulled his
bid. He let them through and they

2434
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
bid. He let them through and they
 

2435
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,069
bid. He let them through and they
couldn't come in even clear out 40. And

2436
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:36,079
couldn't come in even clear out 40. And
 

2437
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,349
couldn't come in even clear out 40. And
then he just went, "Well, if you're that

2438
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:37,359
then he just went, "Well, if you're that
 

2439
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,430
then he just went, "Well, if you're that
weak, I'll jump back in again." Refresh

2440
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:39,440
weak, I'll jump back in again." Refresh
 

2441
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,309
weak, I'll jump back in again." Refresh
caught 60s and now we're trading 70s. We

2442
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:42,319
caught 60s and now we're trading 70s. We
 

2443
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:43,990
caught 60s and now we're trading 70s. We
never even got down to the 40s. It's

2444
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:44,000
never even got down to the 40s. It's
 

2445
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,150
never even got down to the 40s. It's
absolutely pathetic. So, they're

2446
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,160
absolutely pathetic. So, they're
 

2447
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,750
absolutely pathetic. So, they're
successfully defending previous days

2448
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:47,760
successfully defending previous days
 

2449
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,470
successfully defending previous days
value. So, at the moment, you've got to

2450
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
value. So, at the moment, you've got to
 

2451
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,270
value. So, at the moment, you've got to
say all we're looking at is a rotation.

2452
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:53,280
say all we're looking at is a rotation.
 

2453
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,589
say all we're looking at is a rotation.
There's no expansion outside of previous

2454
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:55,599
There's no expansion outside of previous
 

2455
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,630
There's no expansion outside of previous
days value. And it's very messy at the

2456
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:58,640
days value. And it's very messy at the
 

2457
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,109
days value. And it's very messy at the
lows. And they've tried to sell it a

2458
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:01,119
lows. And they've tried to sell it a
 

2459
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,789
lows. And they've tried to sell it a
couple of times. That candle at what

2460
01:00:02,789 --> 01:00:02,799
couple of times. That candle at what
 

2461
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:07,589
couple of times. That candle at what
time was this? That 10:10 candle.

2462
01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:07,599
time was this? That 10:10 candle.
 

2463
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,109
time was this? That 10:10 candle.
It 10:10. Yeah. The bears came flying in

2464
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:11,119
It 10:10. Yeah. The bears came flying in
 

2465
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,190
It 10:10. Yeah. The bears came flying in
at 70. They then offered aggressively at

2466
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:15,200
at 70. They then offered aggressively at
 

2467
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,829
at 70. They then offered aggressively at
60 and 50 and then in the next candle

2468
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:17,839
60 and 50 and then in the next candle
 

2469
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,990
60 and 50 and then in the next candle
down to 50. They got scooped back up.

going to go 80s. Now, they're taking
 

2553
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,349
going to go 80s. Now, they're taking
this box. It's possible they come up for

2554
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:21,359
this box. It's possible they come up for
 

2555
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,910
this box. It's possible they come up for
these 600, 610s. Any reclaim of up there

2556
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:23,920
these 600, 610s. Any reclaim of up there
 

2557
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,789
these 600, 610s. Any reclaim of up there
will cause a squeeze.

01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,990
here. It's something like this where
you're sort of pinned in, right?

2567
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,829

right. And if they want to come up to
 

2573
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,069
right. And if they want to come up to
the top of value, they will. And that

2574
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
the top of value, they will. And that
 

2575
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,990
the top of value, they will. And that
will be a fail to get underneath.

2576
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,000
will be a fail to get underneath.
 

2577
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,589
will be a fail to get underneath.
Sellers failed to get underneath

2583
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,910

previous day's value. Which means we're

2584
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:55,920
previous day's value. Which means we're
 

2585
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,309
previous day's value. Which means we're
going to be left with this.

01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
going to be left with this.
 

2587

01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,270
that's what we're left with today at the
moment until we move outside of value.

2592
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:03,280
moment until we move outside of value.
 

2593
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,349

That's all we've got.

trade with what's in front of us. That's
all we're being given right now is

all we're being given right now is
 

2601
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,950
all we're being given right now is
rotation.

Yeah, lots of you saying back to bed. I
 

2607
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,870
Yeah, lots of you saying back to bed. I
kind of feel the same. I'm going to be

2608
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:30,880
kind of feel the same. I'm going to be
 

2609
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,190
kind of feel the same. I'm going to be
honest. Just hanging around in case we

2610
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
honest. Just hanging around in case we
 

2611
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,950
honest. Just hanging around in case we
move outside of rotation. I'm not going

2612
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:34,960
move outside of rotation. I'm not going
 

2613
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,470
move outside of rotation. I'm not going
to trade inside rotation. If we move

2614
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,480
to trade inside rotation. If we move
 

2615
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,630
to trade inside rotation. If we move
outside of rotation,

2616
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:38,640
outside of rotation,
 

2617
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:49,270
outside of rotation,
I am interested.

2619
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,230

Did they just fail 80s again? Oh my god.

2620
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:52,240
Did they just fail 80s again? Oh my god.
 

2621

01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480

 

2629
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:34,950

Be a big level that if it reclaims it.

2630
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960

 

2631
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:52,069

satisfy.

2632
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079

 

2633
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,670

Jack saying you're long. Well, good

2634
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:53,680
Jack saying you're long. Well, good
 

2635
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,470
Jack saying you're long. Well, good
luck, mate.

2636
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
luck, mate.
 

2637
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,829
luck, mate.
makes sense if you're just playing

2638
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:57,839
makes sense if you're just playing
 

2639
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,670
makes sense if you're just playing
value.

2640
01:04:59,670 --> 01:04:59,680
value.
 

2641
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,589
value.
Still making uh lower highs though. But

2642
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:03,599
Still making uh lower highs though. But
 

2643
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,109
Still making uh lower highs though. But
if you're playing versus value on a

2644
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:05,119
if you're playing versus value on a
 

2645
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,470
if you're playing versus value on a
rotation, as long as you got your stop

2646
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
rotation, as long as you got your stop
 

2647
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,870
rotation, as long as you got your stop
there, it makes sense. I don't trust it

2648
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
there, it makes sense. I don't trust it
 

2649
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,190
there, it makes sense. I don't trust it
right now.

2650
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
right now.
 

2651
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,390
right now.
Still think uh it's a battle.

2652
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,400
Still think uh it's a battle.
 

2653
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,829
Still think uh it's a battle.
We are starting to see it sort of go

2654
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
We are starting to see it sort of go
 

2655
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,190
We are starting to see it sort of go
sideways.

2656
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:19,200

 

2657
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,029

I think that the way I describe it is

2658
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:21,039
I think that the way I describe it is
 

2659
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,789
I think that the way I describe it is
there's a lack of control.

2660
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799

 

2661
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:33,349

There's a lack of control right now.

2662
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359

 

2663
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,349

Target is new session high. Well, you're

2664
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:35,359
Target is new session high. Well, you're
 

2665
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,870
Target is new session high. Well, you're
asking quite a lot because the session

2666
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:36,880
asking quite a lot because the session
 

2667
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,150
asking quite a lot because the session
high is over previous days value.

2668
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:40,160
high is over previous days value.
 

2669
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,789
high is over previous days value.
Doesn't mean it won't get there, but

2670
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799

 

2671
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,270

you're not even through current. You

2672
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,280
you're not even through current. You
 

2673
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,589
you're not even through current. You
know, you're bidding on previous day

2674
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:49,599
know, you're bidding on previous day
 

2675
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,430
know, you're bidding on previous day
value area low. You're not even through

2676
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
value area low. You're not even through
 

2677
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,150
value area low. You're not even through
current value area high on the day to

2678
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,160
current value area high on the day to
 

2679
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,990
current value area high on the day to
try and create a new session high.

2680
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:56,000
try and create a new session high.
 

2681
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,230
try and create a new session high.
You're asking quite a lot. It can easily

2682
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:58,240
You're asking quite a lot. It can easily
 

2683
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,470
You're asking quite a lot. It can easily
come up here and just get slammed and go

2684
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:00,480
come up here and just get slammed and go
 

2685
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:13,510
come up here and just get slammed and go
here all day.

2686
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:13,520

 

2687
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,109

Back to these 80s where they haven't

2688
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:15,119
Back to these 80s where they haven't
 

2689
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,390
Back to these 80s where they haven't
been able to bid through so far.

2690
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
been able to bid through so far.
 

2691
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:24,870
been able to bid through so far.
Personally,

2692
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:24,880

 

2693
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,549

I don't think it's anything to do here.

2694
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
I don't think it's anything to do here.
 

2695
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,309
I don't think it's anything to do here.
Like, I understand the longs you guys

2696
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
Like, I understand the longs you guys
 

2697
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:32,309
Like, I understand the longs you guys
are taking off previous days low, but

2698
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:32,319
are taking off previous days low, but
 

2699
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,990
are taking off previous days low, but
I'm not seeing big bullish sentiment

2700
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,000
I'm not seeing big bullish sentiment
 

2701
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,789
I'm not seeing big bullish sentiment
come in. Not yet. Not seeing like a big

2702
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:36,799
come in. Not yet. Not seeing like a big
 

2703
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,470
come in. Not yet. Not seeing like a big
drive higher and then a pullback that

2704
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:38,480
drive higher and then a pullback that
 

2705
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:59,349
drive higher and then a pullback that
holds a higher low. It's very slow.

2706
01:06:59,349 --> 01:06:59,359

 

2707
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:05,829

Still not even through BWAP.

2708
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:05,839

 

2709
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,910

What's that? Is that a London rejection?

2710
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:07,920
What's that? Is that a London rejection?
 

2711
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,630
What's that? Is that a London rejection?
What's the low there? Not even at London

2712
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:10,640
What's the low there? Not even at London
 

2713
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:19,029
What's the low there? Not even at London
lows yet.

2714
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:19,039

 

2715
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:24,150

This is bad.

2716
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160

 

2717
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,069

I wish they should just close down for

2718
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
I wish they should just close down for
 

2719
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,990
I wish they should just close down for
December cuz it's like no one comes back

2720
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
December cuz it's like no one comes back
 

2721
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,470
December cuz it's like no one comes back
after Thanksgiving. Like a week before

2722
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
after Thanksgiving. Like a week before
 

2723
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,510
after Thanksgiving. Like a week before
Thanksgiving was [\h__\h] volume. This is

2724
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:33,520
Thanksgiving was [\h__\h] volume. This is
 

2725
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,510
Thanksgiving was [\h__\h] volume. This is
just as [\h__\h] Like everyone's just

2726
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,520
just as [\h__\h] Like everyone's just
 

2727
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,829
just as [\h__\h] Like everyone's just
taking t taking it off. No one's come

2728

back to work.

2730
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:00,640

 

2731
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,270

That's completely mixed out there. Meta

2732
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:03,280
That's completely mixed out there. Meta
 

2733
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,029
That's completely mixed out there. Meta
the big winner in the market. Um,

01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
the big winner in the market. Um,
 

2735
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,789
the big winner in the market. Um,

2743
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,630

banks, well, banks have mixed as well.

banks, well, banks have mixed as well.
 

2745
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,269
banks, well, banks have mixed as well.
Banks are okay, but credit services are

2746
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
Banks are okay, but credit services are
 

2747
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,749
Banks are okay, but credit services are
all down. Healthcare is down.

Consumer defensive is down.
 

2753
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,470
Consumer defensive is down.
Consumer services outside of meta and

2754
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:38,480
Consumer services outside of meta and
 

2755
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,030
Consumer services outside of meta and
Apple are down.

2756
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040
Apple are down.
 

2757
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,349
Apple are down.
Basic materials are down. Energy is

2758
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:43,359
Basic materials are down. Energy is
 

2759
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,229
Basic materials are down. Energy is
flat. Real estate's up. Utilities

2760
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:46,239
flat. Real estate's up. Utilities
 

2761
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:49,430
flat. Real estate's up. Utilities
probably flat.

2762
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:49,440
probably flat.
 

2763
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,590
probably flat.
Just nothing going on.

2764
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:53,600

 

2765
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,590

I think you take meta out the equation

2766
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:55,600
I think you take meta out the equation
 

2767
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,390
I think you take meta out the equation
and uh this market is in a bit more of

2768
01:08:58,390 --> 01:08:58,400
and uh this market is in a bit more of
 

2769
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:05,349
and uh this market is in a bit more of
pain.

2770
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:05,359

 

2771
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,669

Okay, so you need to base here at 80s.

2772
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:07,679
Okay, so you need to base here at 80s.
 

2773
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:08,950
Okay, so you need to base here at 80s.
You've had numerous attempts to get

2774
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:08,960
You've had numerous attempts to get
 

2775
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,470
You've had numerous attempts to get
through it. You've got through it. Now

2776
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
through it. You've got through it. Now
 

2777
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,309
through it. You've got through it. Now
you're pulling back to it and you need

2778
01:09:12,309 --> 01:09:12,319
you're pulling back to it and you need
 

2779
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,390
you're pulling back to it and you need
to hold it. If you don't hold it, I'd be

2780
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
to hold it. If you don't hold it, I'd be
 

2781
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,149
to hold it. If you don't hold it, I'd be
very concerned for those of you who are

2782
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,159
very concerned for those of you who are
 

2783
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,510
very concerned for those of you who are
bullish because you've just popped

2784
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:17,520
bullish because you've just popped
 

2785
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,390
bullish because you've just popped
through tap VW and failed

2786
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400

 

2787
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,030

and you're not holding the 80s

2788
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,040
and you're not holding the 80s
 

2789
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,189
and you're not holding the 80s
and that's what the game is right now

2790
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:27,199
and that's what the game is right now
 

2791
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,110
and that's what the game is right now
and you didn't hold it. So, back to 60s.

2792
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:29,120
and you didn't hold it. So, back to 60s.
 

2793
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,470
and you didn't hold it. So, back to 60s.
You lose 60s, you're probably going to

2794
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,480
You lose 60s, you're probably going to
 

2795
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,189
You lose 60s, you're probably going to
see a new lower day. That's why I say I

2796
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:33,199
see a new lower day. That's why I say I
 

2797
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:34,149
see a new lower day. That's why I say I
don't think there's anything bullish

2798
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:34,159
don't think there's anything bullish
 

2799
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:35,829
don't think there's anything bullish
here. Your chance to be bullish would

2800
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:35,839
here. Your chance to be bullish would
 

2801
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,510
here. Your chance to be bullish would
have needed to hold that level. You can

2802
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:37,520
have needed to hold that level. You can
 

2803
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,910
have needed to hold that level. You can
see here's your compression.

2804
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:39,920
see here's your compression.
 

2805
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,229
see here's your compression.
There's the break. Did they hold that?

2806
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
There's the break. Did they hold that?
 

2807
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:43,829
There's the break. Did they hold that?
No. All right. So, bulls are not in

2808
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
No. All right. So, bulls are not in
 

2809
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,709
No. All right. So, bulls are not in
control. We just go back into this death

2810
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:46,719
control. We just go back into this death
 

2811
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,349
control. We just go back into this death
chop.

2812
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:49,359
chop.
 

2813
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,390
chop.
The death chop. And uh I wouldn't be

2814
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
The death chop. And uh I wouldn't be
 

2815
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,829
The death chop. And uh I wouldn't be
surprised to see a new low of day here

2816
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:53,839
surprised to see a new low of day here
 

2817
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,750
surprised to see a new low of day here
at this point because you've just had a

2818
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:55,760
at this point because you've just had a
 

2819
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,229
at this point because you've just had a
failed breakout

2820
01:09:58,229 --> 01:09:58,239
failed breakout
 

2821
01:09:58,239 --> 01:09:59,350
failed breakout
for those of you who are looking

2822
01:09:59,350 --> 01:09:59,360
for those of you who are looking
 

2823
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,870
for those of you who are looking
bullish.

2824
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,880
bullish.
 

2825
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,790
bullish.
Back into current value area low. If you

2826
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
Back into current value area low. If you
 

2827
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,990
Back into current value area low. If you
lose this, we're going to come back down

2828
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
lose this, we're going to come back down
 

2829
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,510
lose this, we're going to come back down
for low of day and previous day value

2830
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:05,520
for low of day and previous day value
 

2831
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,430
for low of day and previous day value
area low. So, current value area low

2832
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,440
area low. So, current value area low
 

2833
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,350
area low. So, current value area low
right here, right now. If we lose this,

2834
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
right here, right now. If we lose this,
 

2835
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,950
right here, right now. If we lose this,
I think you probably see a new low of

2836
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:10,960
I think you probably see a new low of
 

2837
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,470
I think you probably see a new low of
day. And if you snap that, it could get

2838
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:12,480
day. And if you snap that, it could get
 

2839
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,630
day. And if you snap that, it could get
very nasty because we've been here a

2840
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
very nasty because we've been here a
 

2841
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,669
very nasty because we've been here a
long time now.

2842
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:19,679

 

2843
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,270

They're trying to desperately save it

2844
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:21,280
They're trying to desperately save it
 

2845
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,870
They're trying to desperately save it
here.

2846
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:22,880
here.
 

2847
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,630
here.
They know if they lose this bulls,

2848
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
They know if they lose this bulls,
 

2849
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,790
They know if they lose this bulls,
they're in big trouble.

2850
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,800

 

2851
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,669

So underneath current value, I'd say

2852
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:31,679
So underneath current value, I'd say
 

2853
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,110
So underneath current value, I'd say
there's a new low day coming at this

2854
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
there's a new low day coming at this
 

2855
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,110
there's a new low day coming at this
point.

2856
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
point.
 

2857
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,709
point.
There's previous day's value.

2858
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:38,719
There's previous day's value.
 

2859
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,310
There's previous day's value.
Guess who's in it short. There we go.

2860
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
Guess who's in it short. There we go.
 

2861
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,390
Guess who's in it short. There we go.
So, I told you.

2862
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:42,400
So, I told you.
 

2863
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,950
So, I told you.
Don't say I didn't tell you.

2864
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:44,960
Don't say I didn't tell you.
 

2865
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,470
Don't say I didn't tell you.
In this short, let's see how much

2866
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:46,480
In this short, let's see how much
 

2867
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,870
In this short, let's see how much
expansion we can get.

2868
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:48,880
expansion we can get.
 

2869
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,709
expansion we can get.
It trapped all you bulls who were

2870
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:50,719
It trapped all you bulls who were
 

2871
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,390
It trapped all you bulls who were
looking for the rotation without it

2872
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
looking for the rotation without it
 

2873
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,149
looking for the rotation without it
giving you a reason. Here we go.

2874
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
giving you a reason. Here we go.
 

2875
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,550
giving you a reason. Here we go.
How low can we go? All right, 520s here.

2876
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
How low can we go? All right, 520s here.
 

2877
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,310
How low can we go? All right, 520s here.
Let's see if we can get fives. And then

2878
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
Let's see if we can get fives. And then
 

2879
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,070
Let's see if we can get fives. And then
if we break under fives, let's see if we

2880
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,080
if we break under fives, let's see if we
 

2881
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,950
if we break under fives, let's see if we
can get into those low fours. Why have I

2882
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
can get into those low fours. Why have I
 

2883
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,270
can get into those low fours. Why have I
not got this marked out? What is this

2884
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
not got this marked out? What is this
 

2885
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,750
not got this marked out? What is this
level? We'll check this level for Ninja

2886
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:09,760
level? We'll check this level for Ninja
 

2887
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,750
level? We'll check this level for Ninja
420s.

2888
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:13,760

 

2889
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,430

Covering a little piece here into the

2890
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:15,440
Covering a little piece here into the
 

2891
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,510
Covering a little piece here into the
520s and see if we can get another 100

2892
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:17,520
520s and see if we can get another 100
 

2893
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,189
520s and see if we can get another 100
points here or not would be nice. Be a

2894
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:21,199
points here or not would be nice. Be a
 

2895
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:22,790
points here or not would be nice. Be a
gift.

2896
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,800
gift.
 

2897
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,270
gift.
Any reclaim value though, I I'll cut the

2898
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,280
Any reclaim value though, I I'll cut the
 

2899
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,270
Any reclaim value though, I I'll cut the
rest. Need to see this reject previous

2900
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:27,280
rest. Need to see this reject previous
 

2901
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,070
rest. Need to see this reject previous
day value area low now. Continuation.

2902
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:30,080
day value area low now. Continuation.
 

2903
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,310
day value area low now. Continuation.
Good rejection so far.

2904
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320

 

2905
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,310

Need to see previous day value area low

2906
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:36,320
Need to see previous day value area low
 

2907
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,990
Need to see previous day value area low
stay heavy now.

2908
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:38,000
stay heavy now.
 

2909
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,149
stay heavy now.
That's what I need to see. That's what

2910
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
That's what I need to see. That's what
 

2911
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,510
That's what I need to see. That's what
I'm going to risk against

2912
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:43,520
I'm going to risk against
 

2913
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,350
I'm going to risk against
there. Or thereabouts. Any reclaim of

2914
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,360
there. Or thereabouts. Any reclaim of
 

2915
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,950
there. Or thereabouts. Any reclaim of
that will be a look below and fail and

2916
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:46,960
that will be a look below and fail and
 

2917
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,189
that will be a look below and fail and
I'll cut it.

2918
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:51,199

 

2919
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:56,790

Nice, Troy.

2920
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800

 

2921
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,709

Good work, Troy. Yeah.

2922
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:00,719
Good work, Troy. Yeah.
 

2923
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:01,990
Good work, Troy. Yeah.
Yeah. That's why I didn't want to be

2924
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:02,000
Yeah. That's why I didn't want to be
 

2925
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,910
Yeah. That's why I didn't want to be
bullish. Like I get what you guys were

2926
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:03,920
bullish. Like I get what you guys were
 

2927
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,110
bullish. Like I get what you guys were
looking at for the hold of value, but

2928
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:07,120
looking at for the hold of value, but
 

2929
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,870
looking at for the hold of value, but
this

2930
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:08,880
this
 

2931
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,189
this
we didn't see this. That's your

2932
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:11,199
we didn't see this. That's your
 

2933
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,110
we didn't see this. That's your
confirmation to hold above a range. It

2934
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,120
confirmation to hold above a range. It
 

2935
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,350
confirmation to hold above a range. It
never holds above a range. All right. So

2936
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
never holds above a range. All right. So
 

2937
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,070
never holds above a range. All right. So
you guys buy this. We didn't even get

2938
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,080
you guys buy this. We didn't even get
 

2939
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,910
you guys buy this. We didn't even get
above current value on the day. Like I

2940
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920
above current value on the day. Like I
 

2941
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,229
above current value on the day. Like I
said, they sell into it. Now you got

2942
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
said, they sell into it. Now you got
 

2943
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,630
said, they sell into it. Now you got
everyone buying this breakout and they

2944
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:24,640
everyone buying this breakout and they
 

2945
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,310
everyone buying this breakout and they
dump them. And like I said, once you

2946
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,320
dump them. And like I said, once you
 

2947
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,590
dump them. And like I said, once you
lost 80s, it was a problem. and then you

2948
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:29,600
lost 80s, it was a problem. and then you
 

2949
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,030
lost 80s, it was a problem. and then you
lost PC and then you lost pre uh current

2950
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
lost PC and then you lost pre uh current
 

2951
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,030
lost PC and then you lost pre uh current
value and then you lost previous day

2952
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:35,040
value and then you lost previous day
 

2953
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,669
value and then you lost previous day
value and then you washed. So

2954
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
value and then you washed. So
 

2955
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,790
value and then you washed. So
I'm now out of this but if it reclaims

2956
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:40,800
I'm now out of this but if it reclaims
 

2957
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,630
I'm now out of this but if it reclaims
now and bases then you've got more of a

2958
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:42,640
now and bases then you've got more of a
 

2959
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,070
now and bases then you've got more of a
chance long. But this is still bearish

2960
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:44,080
chance long. But this is still bearish
 

2961
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:50,550
chance long. But this is still bearish
in my mind.

2962
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,560

 

2963
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,630

But if you reclaim value maybe go

2964
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:52,640
But if you reclaim value maybe go
 

2965
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:58,470
But if you reclaim value maybe go
rotation again.

2966
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,480

 

2967
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,390

Apple selling more 1% down now.

2968
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:02,400
Apple selling more 1% down now.
 

2969
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,229
Apple selling more 1% down now.
VIX did just spike cut through that

2970
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:04,239
VIX did just spike cut through that
 

2971
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,310
VIX did just spike cut through that
1663. Couldn't hold a bid there. Where

2972
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:06,320
1663. Couldn't hold a bid there. Where
 

2973
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,750
1663. Couldn't hold a bid there. Where
did we just trade down to? Look at that

2974
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:07,760
did we just trade down to? Look at that
 

2975
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,709
did we just trade down to? Look at that
gamma level on SPY. That 82

2976
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
gamma level on SPY. That 82
 

2977
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,790
gamma level on SPY. That 82
big [\h__\h] level, man. It's just the

2978
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:12,800
big [\h__\h] level, man. It's just the
 

2979
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,590
big [\h__\h] level, man. It's just the
options dealers are controlling the

2980
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,600
options dealers are controlling the
 

2981
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,590
options dealers are controlling the
markets of

2982
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:17,600
markets of
 

2983
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,430
markets of
in this last quarter. It's very

2984
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:19,440
in this last quarter. It's very
 

2985
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,669
in this last quarter. It's very
annoying. Hate having to check options

2986
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:21,679
annoying. Hate having to check options
 

2987
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:23,669
annoying. Hate having to check options
levels, but that's where we're at right

2988
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:23,679
levels, but that's where we're at right
 

2989
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,669
levels, but that's where we're at right
now.

2990
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:25,679
now.
 

2991
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:31,990
now.
So they held 82s.

2992
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000

 

2993
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,149

Okay. Now if they hold, you look better

2994
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:34,159
Okay. Now if they hold, you look better
 

2995
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,830
Okay. Now if they hold, you look better
because you've had a look below and

2996
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:35,840
because you've had a look below and
 

2997
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,990
because you've had a look below and
fail. All right. So I'd say for bulls

2998
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:38,000
fail. All right. So I'd say for bulls
 

2999
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,310
fail. All right. So I'd say for bulls
now, now you've looked below. So I got

3000
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
now, now you've looked below. So I got
 

3001
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,390
now, now you've looked below. So I got
short for this breakdown. Now if you

3002
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,400
short for this breakdown. Now if you
 

3003
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,229
short for this breakdown. Now if you
start holding this for rotation, you

3004
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:44,239
start holding this for rotation, you
 

3005
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,990
start holding this for rotation, you
look better because there'll be lots of

3006
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
look better because there'll be lots of
 

3007
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,430
look better because there'll be lots of
breakout shorts. You came out in here.

3008
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:49,440
breakout shorts. You came out in here.
 

3009
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,270
breakout shorts. You came out in here.
You still really want to get back above

3010
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
You still really want to get back above
 

3011
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,350
You still really want to get back above
80. That 80 has been massive. You can

3012
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:53,360
80. That 80 has been massive. You can
 

3013
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,870
80. That 80 has been massive. You can
see it here.

3014
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:54,880
see it here.
 

3015
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,709
see it here.
All right. Trapped, trapped, trapped,

3016
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719
All right. Trapped, trapped, trapped,
 

3017
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,709
All right. Trapped, trapped, trapped,
trapped. Break above, failed, back to

3018
01:13:58,709 --> 01:13:58,719
trapped. Break above, failed, back to
 

3019
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:01,030
trapped. Break above, failed, back to
it. All right, this is your overunder.

3020
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
it. All right, this is your overunder.
 

3021
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,030
it. All right, this is your overunder.
They bulls need to hold above 80. It's

3022
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,040
They bulls need to hold above 80. It's
 

3023
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:12,390
They bulls need to hold above 80. It's
as simple as that.

3024
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:12,400

 

3025
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,990

I'm going to use a bathroom while this

3026
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,000
I'm going to use a bathroom while this
 

3027
01:14:14,000 --> 01:16:51,990
I'm going to use a bathroom while this
shakes out for a minute.

3028
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,000

 

3029
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,790

Oh, yeah. I mean,

3030
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:54,800
Oh, yeah. I mean,
 

3031
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,550
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I don't even hate what you did, Jack. I

3032
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:56,560
I don't even hate what you did, Jack. I
 

3033
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,189
I don't even hate what you did, Jack. I
just think uh as long as you cut and and

3034
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:01,199
just think uh as long as you cut and and
 

3035
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,270
just think uh as long as you cut and and
you know you had your reasons for me

3036
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
you know you had your reasons for me
 

3037
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,709
you know you had your reasons for me
it's not something I take but your

3038
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
it's not something I take but your
 

3039
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,310
it's not something I take but your
reasons were we were holding previous

3040
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:06,320
reasons were we were holding previous
 

3041
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,790
reasons were we were holding previous
day value

3042
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:08,800
day value
 

3043
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,229
day value
it's not a bad reason to look for that

3044
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
it's not a bad reason to look for that
 

3045
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,070
it's not a bad reason to look for that
trade I get what you're looking for I

3046
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:14,080
trade I get what you're looking for I
 

3047
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,110
trade I get what you're looking for I
would just say that in here it probably

3048
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:17,120
would just say that in here it probably
 

3049
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,030
would just say that in here it probably
hasn't given you if this held here

3050
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:21,040
hasn't given you if this held here
 

3051
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,590
hasn't given you if this held here
I would say in my mind that's the point

3052
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:23,600
I would say in my mind that's the point
 

3053
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,590
I would say in my mind that's the point
where I'm like okay well bulls are now

3054
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
where I'm like okay well bulls are now
 

3055
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,590
where I'm like okay well bulls are now
defending and leaving trapped sellers,

3056
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
defending and leaving trapped sellers,
 

3057
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,669
defending and leaving trapped sellers,
right? That that for me would be your

3058
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:29,679
right? That that for me would be your
 

3059
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,270
right? That that for me would be your
your cue. That was a fail breakout.

3060
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:33,280
your cue. That was a fail breakout.
 

3061
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,590
your cue. That was a fail breakout.
That's also a fail breakdown. This is

3062
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:35,600
That's also a fail breakdown. This is
 

3063
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,430
That's also a fail breakdown. This is
your ledge. Bulls just need to hold

3064
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:37,440
your ledge. Bulls just need to hold
 

3065
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,590
your ledge. Bulls just need to hold
this. If bulls hold this, you've got a

3066
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:39,600
this. If bulls hold this, you've got a
 

3067
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,310
this. If bulls hold this, you've got a
chance for the rotation. Now, set the

3068
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:42,320
chance for the rotation. Now, set the
 

3069
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,590
chance for the rotation. Now, set the
same story because if you just think

3070
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
same story because if you just think
 

3071
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,990
same story because if you just think
about how we built structure right here,

3072
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:46,000
about how we built structure right here,
 

3073
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,910
about how we built structure right here,
here, here, here. Test 80, fail. Test

3074
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:49,920
here, here, here. Test 80, fail. Test
 

3075
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:54,149
here, here, here. Test 80, fail. Test
80, fail. Get above 80 fail. back above

3076
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:54,159
80, fail. Get above 80 fail. back above
 

3077
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:58,709
80, fail. Get above 80 fail. back above
80 needs to hold this range, right? And

3078
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
80 needs to hold this range, right? And
 

3079
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:00,070
80 needs to hold this range, right? And
really, you want to hold the top of the

3080
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
really, you want to hold the top of the
 

3081
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,750
really, you want to hold the top of the
range because that will leave all the

3082
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:01,760
range because that will leave all the
 

3083
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,270
range because that will leave all the
sellers trapped and then you can use

3084
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:03,280
sellers trapped and then you can use
 

3085
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,950
sellers trapped and then you can use
their pain to go higher. Much like

3086
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:06,960
their pain to go higher. Much like
 

3087
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,030
their pain to go higher. Much like
the opposite up here, all right, once we

3088
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,040
the opposite up here, all right, once we
 

3089
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,110
the opposite up here, all right, once we
took

3090
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
took
 

3091
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,229
took
out previous days high, there's previous

3092
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:14,239
out previous days high, there's previous
 

3093
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,870
out previous days high, there's previous
day's value area high balls. All they

3094
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:16,880
day's value area high balls. All they
 

3095
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,030
day's value area high balls. All they
needed to do was defend this for a move

3096
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:19,040
needed to do was defend this for a move
 

3097
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,189
needed to do was defend this for a move
higher today. They didn't defend it. So,

3098
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:21,199
higher today. They didn't defend it. So,
 

3099
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,750
higher today. They didn't defend it. So,
we go back in. So, I'm not bullish

3100
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:23,760
we go back in. So, I'm not bullish
 

3101
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,430
we go back in. So, I'm not bullish
unless we hold this. We said that this

3102
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:25,440
unless we hold this. We said that this
 

3103
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,950
unless we hold this. We said that this
morning. So, it's the same thing just

3104
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:26,960
morning. So, it's the same thing just
 

3105
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,709
morning. So, it's the same thing just
the other way around. It got to defend a

3106
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:28,719
the other way around. It got to defend a
 

3107
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,630
the other way around. It got to defend a
level and leave sellers stuck, right?

3108
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:32,640
level and leave sellers stuck, right?
 

3109
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,270
level and leave sellers stuck, right?
The same way sellers here, right, had

3110
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:35,280
The same way sellers here, right, had
 

3111
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,870
The same way sellers here, right, had
the opportunity to

3112
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:38,880
the opportunity to
 

3113
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,950
the opportunity to
defend this

3114
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:40,960
defend this
 

3115
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,630
defend this
and leave all the buyers who keep

3116
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
and leave all the buyers who keep
 

3117
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,709
and leave all the buyers who keep
accumulating in here stuck. Sellers

3118
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
accumulating in here stuck. Sellers
 

3119
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,470
accumulating in here stuck. Sellers
would have needed to defend this to

3120
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:46,480
would have needed to defend this to
 

3121
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,470
would have needed to defend this to
complete this move down here. They

3122
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:48,480
complete this move down here. They
 

3123
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,390
complete this move down here. They
failed. All right. So, now you've got

3124
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
failed. All right. So, now you've got
 

3125
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,910
failed. All right. So, now you've got
both sides. You've got buyers and

3126
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:51,920
both sides. You've got buyers and
 

3127
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,189
both sides. You've got buyers and
sellers in here. So above 80, bulls have

3128
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
sellers in here. So above 80, bulls have
 

3129
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:58,790
sellers in here. So above 80, bulls have
control. Below 60s, bears have control.

3130
01:18:58,790 --> 01:18:58,800
control. Below 60s, bears have control.
 

3131
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,870
control. Below 60s, bears have control.
In between, no one has control. That

3132
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:00,880
In between, no one has control. That
 

3133
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,510
In between, no one has control. That
well, that's how I interpret it.

3134
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,520
well, that's how I interpret it.
 

3135
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,870
well, that's how I interpret it.
Hopefully that makes sense.

3136
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:08,880

 

3137
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,470

You're starting to see them hold the

3138
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:10,480
You're starting to see them hold the
 

3139
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,590
You're starting to see them hold the
80s. And it's key. So you bulls now are

3140
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
80s. And it's key. So you bulls now are
 

3141
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,350
80s. And it's key. So you bulls now are
holding 80s. You should see expansion.

3142
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:15,360
holding 80s. You should see expansion.
 

3143
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,350
holding 80s. You should see expansion.
Here you go. So this is so much better,

3144
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:17,360
Here you go. So this is so much better,
 

3145
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,110
Here you go. So this is so much better,
isn't it? You see that? Now we leave

3146
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:19,120
isn't it? You see that? Now we leave
 

3147
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,030
isn't it? You see that? Now we leave
them trapped. You pull back. you hold

3148
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:21,040
them trapped. You pull back. you hold
 

3149
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,830
them trapped. You pull back. you hold
PC's flip that's helping you. Now my TP1

3150
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:23,840
PC's flip that's helping you. Now my TP1
 

3151
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,510
PC's flip that's helping you. Now my TP1
would be into here because we've not

3152
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:25,520
would be into here because we've not
 

3153
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,270
would be into here because we've not
been able to get above value. So I'd be

3154
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:27,280
been able to get above value. So I'd be
 

3155
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,070
been able to get above value. So I'd be
looking for 600 610 and I'd be taking

3156
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:30,080
looking for 600 610 and I'd be taking
 

3157
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,149
looking for 600 610 and I'd be taking
some off because there's no guarantee.

3158
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:32,159
some off because there's no guarantee.
 

3159
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,390
some off because there's no guarantee.
Remember this is the bigger if we zoom

3160
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,400
Remember this is the bigger if we zoom
 

3161
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,870
Remember this is the bigger if we zoom
out. This is your bigger range from the

3162
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:36,880
out. This is your bigger range from the
 

3163
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,030
out. This is your bigger range from the
last few days and overnight. Right?

3164
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:39,040
last few days and overnight. Right?
 

3165
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,950
last few days and overnight. Right?
There's your overnight. So you're not

3166
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:40,960
There's your overnight. So you're not
 

3167
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,990
There's your overnight. So you're not
truly bullish until you reclaim that.

3168
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:44,000
truly bullish until you reclaim that.
 

3169
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,910
truly bullish until you reclaim that.
Now you want to get back inside that

3170
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
Now you want to get back inside that
 

3171
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,470
Now you want to get back inside that
range. So for me how I would be trading

3172
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:48,480
range. So for me how I would be trading
 

3173
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,229
range. So for me how I would be trading
Oh, don't want to move that. I would be

3174
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
Oh, don't want to move that. I would be
 

3175
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:51,669
Oh, don't want to move that. I would be
taking a little bit of profit into this

3176
01:19:51,669 --> 01:19:51,679
taking a little bit of profit into this
 

3177
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,470
taking a little bit of profit into this
red box, right? Between this red box and

3178
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:54,480
red box, right? Between this red box and
 

3179
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,310
red box, right? Between this red box and
you got multiple things here. You got

3180
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:56,320
you got multiple things here. You got
 

3181
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,630
you got multiple things here. You got
600, you got the red box 608, and you

3182
01:19:58,630 --> 01:19:58,640
600, you got the red box 608, and you
 

3183
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,110
600, you got the red box 608, and you
got VW up there. So, I'd be looking to

3184
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
got VW up there. So, I'd be looking to
 

3185
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,110
got VW up there. So, I'd be looking to
lift a bit of size off. This is how I

3186
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:03,120
lift a bit of size off. This is how I
 

3187
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,470
lift a bit of size off. This is how I
would trade it. If I was trading it, I'd

3188
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:04,480
would trade it. If I was trading it, I'd
 

3189
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,350
would trade it. If I was trading it, I'd
be long, sell some, wait and see if we

3190
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,360
be long, sell some, wait and see if we
 

3191
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,110
be long, sell some, wait and see if we
can get above,

3192
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:09,120
can get above,
 

3193
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,590
can get above,
add some, and then try and sell into

3194
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:11,600
add some, and then try and sell into
 

3195
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,669
add some, and then try and sell into
these pushes. Right? That's how I would

3196
01:20:13,669 --> 01:20:13,679
these pushes. Right? That's how I would
 

3197
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:18,310
these pushes. Right? That's how I would
personally trade this.

3198
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:18,320

 

3199
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:30,709

Thank you.

3200
01:20:30,709 --> 01:20:30,719

 

3201
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,470

Good thing for you is Spyy's reclaimed

3202
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:32,480
Good thing for you is Spyy's reclaimed
 

3203
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,790
Good thing for you is Spyy's reclaimed
VWAP. So they defended gamma level at

3204
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,800
VWAP. So they defended gamma level at
 

3205
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,350
VWAP. So they defended gamma level at
82. They've reclaimed VWAP. They're

3206
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:37,360
82. They've reclaimed VWAP. They're
 

3207
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,590
82. They've reclaimed VWAP. They're
coming up to 84s now. So Spyy's got

3208
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:39,600
coming up to 84s now. So Spyy's got
 

3209
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,189
coming up to 84s now. So Spyy's got
another dollar push in it. All right.

3210
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
another dollar push in it. All right.
 

3211
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,350
another dollar push in it. All right.
Spy can get up to 85. We know 85 is a

3212
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:43,360
Spy can get up to 85. We know 85 is a
 

3213
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,189
Spy can get up to 85. We know 85 is a
massive, massive level. All right. That

3214
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:45,199
massive, massive level. All right. That
 

3215
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,669
massive, massive level. All right. That
is a big cool wall up there. All right.

3216
01:20:47,669 --> 01:20:47,679
is a big cool wall up there. All right.
 

3217
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:48,950
is a big cool wall up there. All right.
So, you're starting to see some good

3218
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:48,960
So, you're starting to see some good
 

3219
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,550
So, you're starting to see some good
alignment here. What you really want to

3220
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:50,560
alignment here. What you really want to
 

3221
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,950
alignment here. What you really want to
see is Apple reclaim 282s, which we're

3222
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:52,960
see is Apple reclaim 282s, which we're
 

3223
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:59,510
see is Apple reclaim 282s, which we're
not seeing. Not yet.

3224
01:20:59,510 --> 01:20:59,520

 

3225
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,630

And you want to defend now the VWAP and

3226
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:02,640
And you want to defend now the VWAP and
 

3227
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,390
And you want to defend now the VWAP and
PC. You do not want to see it trade

3228
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,400
PC. You do not want to see it trade
 

3229
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,270
PC. You do not want to see it trade
under there. It's got no reason.

3230
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:07,280
under there. It's got no reason.
 

3231
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,189
under there. It's got no reason.
If you're bullish now, it's got zero

3232
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:09,199
If you're bullish now, it's got zero
 

3233
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,750
If you're bullish now, it's got zero
reason to trade under this. It needs to

3234
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
reason to trade under this. It needs to
 

3235
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,470
reason to trade under this. It needs to
trade over this. It needs to get into

3236
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:14,480
trade over this. It needs to get into
 

3237
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,990
trade over this. It needs to get into
this and then you can start

3238
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
this and then you can start
 

3239
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,229
this and then you can start
accelerating. If we get into the red box

3240
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239
accelerating. If we get into the red box
 

3241
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,990
accelerating. If we get into the red box
and base above it, you can start

3242
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,000
and base above it, you can start
 

3243
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,510
and base above it, you can start
accelerating. But like I said, I would

3244
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:21,520
accelerating. But like I said, I would
 

3245
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,870
accelerating. But like I said, I would
have already taken a little bit of

3246
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:22,880
have already taken a little bit of
 

3247
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,430
have already taken a little bit of
profit here. If you bought 82s,

3248
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:25,440
profit here. If you bought 82s,
 

3249
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,030
profit here. If you bought 82s,
I know it's not very much, but I would

3250
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,040
I know it's not very much, but I would
 

3251
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,189
I know it's not very much, but I would
have taken 20 25 points, a little bit of

3252
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
have taken 20 25 points, a little bit of
 

3253
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,590
have taken 20 25 points, a little bit of
profit, and I'd be waiting to see if you

3254
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:31,600
profit, and I'd be waiting to see if you
 

3255
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:38,310
profit, and I'd be waiting to see if you
can do this up here now for a read.

3256
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320

 

3257
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,110

Does that make sense, Jack?

3258
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:41,120
Does that make sense, Jack?
 

3259
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,430
Does that make sense, Jack?
Again,

3260
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:43,440
Again,
 

3261
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,750
Again,
I don't hate what you did. Like, I don't

3262
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:45,760
I don't hate what you did. Like, I don't
 

3263
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,510
I don't hate what you did. Like, I don't
I don't think it's a it's a terrible

3264
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:47,520
I don't think it's a it's a terrible
 

3265
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,270
I don't think it's a it's a terrible
trade down there. It's just don't think

3266
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:49,280
trade down there. It's just don't think
 

3267
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,030
trade down there. It's just don't think
you got confirmation. Look at the

3268
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
you got confirmation. Look at the
 

3269
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,550
you got confirmation. Look at the
difference with the flow zones now. They

3270
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:52,560
difference with the flow zones now. They
 

3271
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,510
difference with the flow zones now. They
want to try and support it. All right.

3272
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
want to try and support it. All right.
 

3273
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,950
want to try and support it. All right.
So, you've just trapped all the bears

3274
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:56,960
So, you've just trapped all the bears
 

3275
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,870
So, you've just trapped all the bears
under here now. Now, you're trying to

3276
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
under here now. Now, you're trying to
 

3277
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:04,390
under here now. Now, you're trying to
support it.

3278
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:04,400

 

3279
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,870

Wicked. Good. Good stuff. Good stuff,

3280
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:06,880
Wicked. Good. Good stuff. Good stuff,
 

3281
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,950
Wicked. Good. Good stuff. Good stuff,
mate.

3282
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:08,960
mate.
 

3283
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,550
mate.
There you go. This is looking good now.

3284
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
There you go. This is looking good now.
 

3285
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,189
There you go. This is looking good now.
So TP1 here basically hit here here to

3286
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:13,199
So TP1 here basically hit here here to
 

3287
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:14,790
So TP1 here basically hit here here to
green if you haven't already taken some

3288
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:14,800
green if you haven't already taken some
 

3289
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,870
green if you haven't already taken some
and wait and see now if you can base

3290
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
and wait and see now if you can base
 

3291
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,550
and wait and see now if you can base
above current value. If you can base

3292
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:18,560
above current value. If you can base
 

3293
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,790
above current value. If you can base
above this red box if you can base in

3294
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:20,800
above this red box if you can base in
 

3295
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,390
above this red box if you can base in
here create some bullish kind of move

3296
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:24,400
here create some bullish kind of move
 

3297
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,390
here create some bullish kind of move
then you can look for this drive. I'd

3298
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
then you can look for this drive. I'd
 

3299
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,629
then you can look for this drive. I'd
say like the 40s point of control from

3300
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:28,639
say like the 40s point of control from
 

3301
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:31,030
say like the 40s point of control from
yesterday. What's this? Is that gap

3302
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:31,040
yesterday. What's this? Is that gap
 

3303
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,750
yesterday. What's this? Is that gap
fill? That might be gap fill.

3304
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:33,760
fill? That might be gap fill.
 

3305
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,030
fill? That might be gap fill.
That gap fill. Hang on. Check my other

3306
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:37,040
That gap fill. Hang on. Check my other
 

3307
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,189
That gap fill. Hang on. Check my other
chart here. Going confused. What's what?

3308
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:41,199
chart here. Going confused. What's what?
 

3309
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,030
chart here. Going confused. What's what?
Yes, that is gap fill. Yeah. So, gap

3310
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:43,040
Yes, that is gap fill. Yeah. So, gap
 

3311
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,750
Yes, that is gap fill. Yeah. So, gap
fill.

3312
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:45,760
fill.
 

3313
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,110
fill.
All right. So, you're looking really

3314
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:47,120
All right. So, you're looking really
 

3315
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,790
All right. So, you're looking really
good now. This is really, really good.

3316
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:48,800
good now. This is really, really good.
 

3317
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,229
good now. This is really, really good.
Now, you got the bears caught. Now,

3318
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:50,239
Now, you got the bears caught. Now,
 

3319
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,830
Now, you got the bears caught. Now,
you're starting to see the acceleration.

3320
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:51,840
you're starting to see the acceleration.
 

3321
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,750
you're starting to see the acceleration.
Look at the difference in candles. Big

3322
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:53,760
Look at the difference in candles. Big
 

3323
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,470
Look at the difference in candles. Big
candles. Buyers in control. You're

3324
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,480
candles. Buyers in control. You're
 

3325
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,310
candles. Buyers in control. You're
looking really good. So, now you'd be

3326
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:58,320
looking really good. So, now you'd be
 

3327
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,390
looking really good. So, now you'd be
looking for any pullbacks. Now, if you

3328
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:00,400
looking for any pullbacks. Now, if you
 

3329
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,550
looking for any pullbacks. Now, if you
want to h hold or add, you want to hold

3330
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,560
want to h hold or add, you want to hold
 

3331
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,790
want to h hold or add, you want to hold
sort of 608 somewhere around there. And

3332
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:04,800
sort of 608 somewhere around there. And
 

3333
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,590
sort of 608 somewhere around there. And
then these are your targets now. So I'd

3334
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:07,600
then these are your targets now. So I'd
 

3335
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,590
then these are your targets now. So I'd
say liquidity is here for sure. So 30s,

3336
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:11,600
say liquidity is here for sure. So 30s,
 

3337
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,110
say liquidity is here for sure. So 30s,
50s,

3338
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,120
50s,
 

3339
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,350
50s,
60s, and if you get really lucky,

3340
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:15,360
60s, and if you get really lucky,
 

3341
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,110
60s, and if you get really lucky,
previous day value area high and very

3342
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:17,120
previous day value area high and very
 

3343
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,750
previous day value area high and very
lucky above here. But I'd be definitely

3344
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:19,760
lucky above here. But I'd be definitely
 

3345
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,070
lucky above here. But I'd be definitely
selling some into here because that's

3346
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,080
selling some into here because that's
 

3347
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,070
selling some into here because that's
been most of the rotation today, isn't

3348
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,080
been most of the rotation today, isn't
 

3349
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:45,669
been most of the rotation today, isn't
it? And that's most of the box.

3350
01:23:45,669 --> 01:23:45,679

 

3351
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:47,750

A bit of a battle here. You want to see

3352
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:47,760
A bit of a battle here. You want to see
 

3353
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,430
A bit of a battle here. You want to see
this hold the bottom side of this red

3354
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:49,440
this hold the bottom side of this red
 

3355
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,510
this hold the bottom side of this red
box now, right? You want to see this

3356
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
box now, right? You want to see this
 

3357
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,030
box now, right? You want to see this
hold the bottom side of this red box

3358
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
hold the bottom side of this red box
 

3359
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,030
hold the bottom side of this red box
because that's going to confirm that

3360
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
because that's going to confirm that
 

3361
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,629
because that's going to confirm that
we're reclaiming the range from

3362
01:23:56,629 --> 01:23:56,639
we're reclaiming the range from
 

3363
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,669
we're reclaiming the range from
overnight. All right. So if we move you

3364
01:23:59,669 --> 01:23:59,679
overnight. All right. So if we move you
 

3365
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:04,229
overnight. All right. So if we move you
move you into a five minute

3366
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239

 

3367
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,149

don't worry about this. This is this red

3368
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
don't worry about this. This is this red
 

3369
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:08,149
don't worry about this. This is this red
box is incorrect. If we move into a five

3370
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:08,159
box is incorrect. If we move into a five
 

3371
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,750
box is incorrect. If we move into a five
minute

3372
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:09,760
minute
 

3373
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,669
minute
right you can see that we get thick here

3374
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:11,679
right you can see that we get thick here
 

3375
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,750
right you can see that we get thick here
from this week.

3376
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:13,760
from this week.
 

3377
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,270
from this week.
This right here. Come on buddy.

3378
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
This right here. Come on buddy.
 

3379
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,629
This right here. Come on buddy.
Right. This right here is where we get

3380
01:24:18,629 --> 01:24:18,639
Right. This right here is where we get
 

3381
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,189
Right. This right here is where we get
thick this week.

3382
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:21,199
thick this week.
 

3383
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,470
thick this week.
And overnight you can see these lows

3384
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:24,480
And overnight you can see these lows
 

3385
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:27,669
And overnight you can see these lows
right where buyers kept stepping in or

3386
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
right where buyers kept stepping in or
 

3387
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,030
right where buyers kept stepping in or
it's those buyers who have become

3388
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
it's those buyers who have become
 

3389
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,950
it's those buyers who have become
sellers this morning. So this is their

3390
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:30,960
sellers this morning. So this is their
 

3391
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,550
sellers this morning. So this is their
chance to get out break even. Now if

3392
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:32,560
chance to get out break even. Now if
 

3393
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,910
chance to get out break even. Now if
they don't take that chance and they

3394
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:33,920
they don't take that chance and they
 

3395
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,590
they don't take that chance and they
rebid it then that's your move 650s. All

3396
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:37,600
rebid it then that's your move 650s. All
 

3397
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,310
rebid it then that's your move 650s. All
right. Don't expect more than 650s.

3398
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
right. Don't expect more than 650s.
 

3399
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,950
right. Don't expect more than 650s.
Hopefully you get more than 650s but

3400
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:42,960
Hopefully you get more than 650s but
 

3401
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,110
Hopefully you get more than 650s but
don't expect it. It's very possible that

3402
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:45,120
don't expect it. It's very possible that
 

3403

01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:45,520
I'm back. I'm back. Sorry guys. Just
 

3559
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:55,990
I'm back. I'm back. Sorry guys. Just
chatting to my wife.

3560
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:56,000

 

3561
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,350

All right. Nice thing you're seeing some

3562
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:57,360
All right. Nice thing you're seeing some
 

3563
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,189
All right. Nice thing you're seeing some
huge bids come on. So if you look at

3564
01:29:59,189 --> 01:29:59,199
huge bids come on. So if you look at
 

3565
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:04,470
huge bids come on. So if you look at
bookmap

3566
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:04,480

 

3567
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,149

finally we're seeing some size. I mean

3568
01:30:06,149 --> 01:30:06,159
finally we're seeing some size. I mean
 

3569
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,470
finally we're seeing some size. I mean
this is the first time I'd say in weeks

3570
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:08,480
this is the first time I'd say in weeks
 

3571
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,070
this is the first time I'd say in weeks
that I've seen some decent size on the

3572
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:10,080
that I've seen some decent size on the
 

3573
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,990
that I've seen some decent size on the
books. So you're seeing 800 lot down

3574
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,000
books. So you're seeing 800 lot down
 

3575
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,750
books. So you're seeing 800 lot down
here. 90s and 600. So they're telling

3576
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:13,760
here. 90s and 600. So they're telling
 

3577
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,070
here. 90s and 600. So they're telling
you they want to defend the range. The

3578
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
you they want to defend the range. The
 

3579
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,350
you they want to defend the range. The
same story. If you look on the right

3580
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:17,360
same story. If you look on the right
 

3581
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,950
same story. If you look on the right
hand side you see this offside delta

3582
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:18,960
hand side you see this offside delta
 

3583
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,750
hand side you see this offside delta
here. 35s around where we are now. You

3584
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:21,760
here. 35s around where we are now. You
 

3585
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,750
here. 35s around where we are now. You
got to get above these 35s. This is

3586
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:23,760
got to get above these 35s. This is
 

3587
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,430
got to get above these 35s. This is
where we've got offside delta right now.

3588
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:25,440
where we've got offside delta right now.
 

3589
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,030
where we've got offside delta right now.
It's standing out like a sore thumb. You

3590
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:27,040
It's standing out like a sore thumb. You
 

3591
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,030
It's standing out like a sore thumb. You
see, we keep rejecting this. See this

3592
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:29,040
see, we keep rejecting this. See this
 

3593
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,590
see, we keep rejecting this. See this
300 lot and and 186 lot. That's what's

3594
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:31,600
300 lot and and 186 lot. That's what's
 

3595
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,910
300 lot and and 186 lot. That's what's
been traded by side from aggressive

3596
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:33,920
been traded by side from aggressive
 

3597
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,430
been traded by side from aggressive
buyers and we haven't traded through it.

3598
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:35,440
buyers and we haven't traded through it.
 

3599
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,950
buyers and we haven't traded through it.
You've got to get above 35. That is very

3600
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:38,960
You've got to get above 35. That is very
 

3601
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,430
You've got to get above 35. That is very
very clear clearly a key level on the

3602
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:41,440
very clear clearly a key level on the
 

3603
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,270
very clear clearly a key level on the
level two. Once you get through that,

3604
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,280
level two. Once you get through that,
 

3605
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,030
level two. Once you get through that,
you should trade 42s, I would say,

3606
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,040
you should trade 42s, I would say,
 

3607
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:51,430
you should trade 42s, I would say,
fairly quickly.

3608
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:51,440

 

3609
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,830

Yes. Ah, I forgot, Adam, that you've got

3610
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:53,840
Yes. Ah, I forgot, Adam, that you've got
 

3611
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,270
Yes. Ah, I forgot, Adam, that you've got
this now.

3612
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:55,280
this now.
 

3613
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,629
this now.
Um, you can do a little lesson later on

3614
01:30:58,629 --> 01:30:58,639
Um, you can do a little lesson later on
 

3615
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,550
Um, you can do a little lesson later on
setting up and stuff if you want,

3616
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:02,560
setting up and stuff if you want,
 

3617
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,030
setting up and stuff if you want,
but yeah, exactly. Stacking 600s. The

3618
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,040
but yeah, exactly. Stacking 600s. The
 

3619
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,590
but yeah, exactly. Stacking 600s. The
interesting thing will be whether these

3620
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:07,600
interesting thing will be whether these
 

3621
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,870
interesting thing will be whether these
hold because they've only been on the

3622
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:08,880
hold because they've only been on the
 

3623
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,590
hold because they've only been on the
book for 2 minutes, right? So, let's see

3624
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:11,600
book for 2 minutes, right? So, let's see
 

3625
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,910
book for 2 minutes, right? So, let's see
if if we use them as magnets and drive

3626
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:13,920
if if we use them as magnets and drive
 

3627
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,990
if if we use them as magnets and drive
down to them, do they actually come in

3628
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:16,000
down to them, do they actually come in
 

3629
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,669
down to them, do they actually come in
here? Do they protect these levels or do

3630
01:31:17,669 --> 01:31:17,679
here? Do they protect these levels or do
 

3631
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:25,669
here? Do they protect these levels or do
they pull the orders?

3632
01:31:25,669 --> 01:31:25,679

 

3633
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,590

But so far holding that New York VW up

3634
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:27,600
But so far holding that New York VW up
 

3635
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,070
But so far holding that New York VW up
which is around what we at there is it

3636
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:30,080
which is around what we at there is it
 

3637
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:35,910
which is around what we at there is it
20s or something or 24hour view up 17s.

3638
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:35,920
20s or something or 24hour view up 17s.
 

3639
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:41,750
20s or something or 24hour view up 17s.
Why do I not have my view up on here?

3640
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:41,760

 

3641
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,070

Oh great. That's good, isn't it? Just

3642
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:44,080
Oh great. That's good, isn't it? Just
 

3643
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,030
Oh great. That's good, isn't it? Just
[\h__\h] log me out.

3644
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:47,040
[\h__\h] log me out.
 

3645
01:31:47,040 --> 01:32:02,229
[\h__\h] log me out.
Fantastic.

3646
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:02,239

 

3647
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,229

Thanks. Funded next just completely

3648
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:04,239
Thanks. Funded next just completely
 

3649
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:06,790
Thanks. Funded next just completely
locked me out. All right, so let's see.

3650
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:06,800
locked me out. All right, so let's see.
 

3651
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,709
locked me out. All right, so let's see.
Let's see if they soak here. So VWAP

3652
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
Let's see if they soak here. So VWAP
 

3653
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:13,189
Let's see if they soak here. So VWAP
24-hour VW up is about here at 17s.

3654
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
24-hour VW up is about here at 17s.
 

3655
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:17,110
24-hour VW up is about here at 17s.
We have an imbalance down to

3656
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,120
We have an imbalance down to
 

3657
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,830
We have an imbalance down to
611s

3658
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:19,840
611s
 

3659
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,669
611s
and I'd say they need to hold the 600s.

3660
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:21,679
and I'd say they need to hold the 600s.
 

3661
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,350
and I'd say they need to hold the 600s.
So, do they come and use these guys as a

3662
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:23,360
So, do they come and use these guys as a
 

3663
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,229
So, do they come and use these guys as a
magnet now? Do these guys pull? It

3664
01:32:26,229 --> 01:32:26,239
magnet now? Do these guys pull? It
 

3665
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:27,430
magnet now? Do these guys pull? It
wouldn't surprise me to see these guys

3666
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:27,440
wouldn't surprise me to see these guys
 

3667
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,070
wouldn't surprise me to see these guys
pull. But we're going to find out. We're

3668
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,080
pull. But we're going to find out. We're
 

3669
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:42,470
pull. But we're going to find out. We're
going to find out.

3670
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:42,480

 

3671
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,510

See how we never got through

3672
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:45,520
See how we never got through
 

3673
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,270
See how we never got through
where those buyers got stuck above that

3674
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:47,280
where those buyers got stuck above that
 

3675
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,790
where those buyers got stuck above that
I talked about. Okay, we're testing this

3676
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:48,800
I talked about. Okay, we're testing this
 

3677
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,270
I talked about. Okay, we're testing this
600. It's coming up now. He's staying on

3678
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:51,280
600. It's coming up now. He's staying on
 

3679
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:55,030
600. It's coming up now. He's staying on
the He's pulled.

3680
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,040

 

3681
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,350

He pulled. He left. He left the books.

3682
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:57,360
He pulled. He left. He left the books.
 

3683
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,270
He pulled. He left. He left the books.
They both left the book. They got very,

3684
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,280
They both left the book. They got very,
 

3685
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,790
They both left the book. They got very,
very scared and they left. This is not a

3686
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
very scared and they left. This is not a
 

3687
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,950
very scared and they left. This is not a
good sign. So, back down to the New York

3688
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:02,960
good sign. So, back down to the New York
 

3689
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:21,830
good sign. So, back down to the New York
field one here.

3690
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:21,840

 

3691
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,709

So you got buyers offside now 604 605

3692
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
So you got buyers offside now 604 605
 

3693
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:29,030
So you got buyers offside now 604 605
600 was a contested level but if you

3694
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:29,040
600 was a contested level but if you
 

3695
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,790
600 was a contested level but if you
look on the right hand side the delta

3696
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:30,800
look on the right hand side the delta
 

3697
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,189
look on the right hand side the delta
I'd say here is a big contested level

3698
01:33:33,189 --> 01:33:33,199
I'd say here is a big contested level
 

3699
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,430
I'd say here is a big contested level
405 if you don't bid back above that

3700
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:35,440
405 if you don't bid back above that
 

3701
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,350
405 if you don't bid back above that
you're in trouble as a bull starting to

3702
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:37,360
you're in trouble as a bull starting to
 

3703
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,189
you're in trouble as a bull starting to
bid back above that now and where are

3704
01:33:39,189 --> 01:33:39,199
bid back above that now and where are
 

3705
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:40,950
bid back above that now and where are
those players from earlier it was 35

3706
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:40,960
those players from earlier it was 35
 

3707
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,070
those players from earlier it was 35
wasn't it just get up here yeah they're

3708
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,080
wasn't it just get up here yeah they're
 

3709
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,870
wasn't it just get up here yeah they're
still here so added more 35. That's your

3710
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:46,880
still here so added more 35. That's your
 

3711
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,950
still here so added more 35. That's your
big level. If you can't get over 35, it

3712
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:48,960
big level. If you can't get over 35, it
 

3713
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,350
big level. If you can't get over 35, it
would be the end of the auction. That's

3714
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:51,360
would be the end of the auction. That's
 

3715
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,870
would be the end of the auction. That's
that's where the last buyer bought,

3716
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:54,880
that's where the last buyer bought,
 

3717
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,149
that's where the last buyer bought,
right? So, right into

3718
01:33:58,149 --> 01:33:58,159
right? So, right into
 

3719
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,550
right? So, right into
these guys here,

3720
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:00,560
these guys here,
 

3721
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:01,910
these guys here,
right? So, there's still a passive

3722
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:01,920
right? So, there's still a passive
 

3723
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,270
right? So, there's still a passive
seller here. Buyers got caught offside

3724
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,280
seller here. Buyers got caught offside
 

3725
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,590
seller here. Buyers got caught offside
trying to buy up here. Here's the

3726
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:07,600
trying to buy up here. Here's the
 

3727
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,430
trying to buy up here. Here's the
pullback to view up and point of

3728
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:09,440
pullback to view up and point of
 

3729
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,350
pullback to view up and point of
control. And this is your last level.

3730
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
control. And this is your last level.
 

3731
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,870
control. And this is your last level.
You've got to hold this as a bull.

3732
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
You've got to hold this as a bull.
 

3733
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,990
You've got to hold this as a bull.
failing to hold this, you will collapse.

3734
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:18,000

 

3735
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,270

There you go. So, it's starting to

3736
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:19,280
There you go. So, it's starting to
 

3737
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,189
There you go. So, it's starting to
collapse now. So, that was all because

3738
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:21,199
collapse now. So, that was all because
 

3739
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:24,310
collapse now. So, that was all because
there was too much buyers up here buying

3740
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,320
there was too much buyers up here buying
 

3741
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,110
there was too much buyers up here buying
the market being sold into from passive

3742
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:27,120
the market being sold into from passive
 

3743
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,270
the market being sold into from passive
sellers

3744
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:29,280
sellers
 

3745
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,270
sellers
and now maybe rotation here. And if you

3746
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:31,280
and now maybe rotation here. And if you
 

3747
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,790
and now maybe rotation here. And if you
lose that rotation, downside pressure.

3748
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:34,800
lose that rotation, downside pressure.
 

3749
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,870
lose that rotation, downside pressure.
And if we look at spy, did it get back

3750
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:36,880
And if we look at spy, did it get back
 

3751
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,270
And if we look at spy, did it get back
up towards 85? No, it failed in front of

3752
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:39,280
up towards 85? No, it failed in front of
 

3753
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,910
up towards 85? No, it failed in front of
it. It failed at 8455s on the spy and

3754
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:41,920
it. It failed at 8455s on the spy and
 

3755
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,430
it. It failed at 8455s on the spy and
it's going to come back down side now

3756
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
it's going to come back down side now
 

3757
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,750
it's going to come back down side now
and it's got to hold this shelf now at

3758
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:45,760
and it's got to hold this shelf now at
 

3759
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:50,390
and it's got to hold this shelf now at
83s.

3760
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:50,400

 

3761
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,350

So just another rotation

3762
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:53,360
So just another rotation
 

3763
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:58,070
So just another rotation
market rotation.

3764
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,080

 

3765
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,590

How do I get the VB PD column? Uh this

3766
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:01,600
How do I get the VB PD column? Uh this
 

3767
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:05,510
How do I get the VB PD column? Uh this
is level two. Uh so you will need to go

3768
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
is level two. Uh so you will need to go
 

3769
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:11,669
is level two. Uh so you will need to go
where's my studies?

3770
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:11,679

 

3771
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:14,709

on add-ons.

3772
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:14,719
on add-ons.
 

3773
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:22,070
on add-ons.
Go to add-ons and then go for Dom Pro.

3774
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:22,080

 

3775
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,550

So, here Adam

3776
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:24,560
So, here Adam
 

3777
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,149
So, here Adam
uh this little one on the right chart.

3778
01:35:28,149 --> 01:35:28,159
uh this little one on the right chart.
 

3779
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,629
uh this little one on the right chart.
Configure add-ons

3780
01:35:30,629 --> 01:35:30,639
Configure add-ons
 

3781
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,110
Configure add-ons
and then Dom Pro. And then you'll need

3782
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:33,120
and then Dom Pro. And then you'll need
 

3783
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,590
and then Dom Pro. And then you'll need
to set this up.

3784
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:37,600

 

3785
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:44,709

set this up.

3786
01:35:44,709 --> 01:35:44,719

 

3787
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,149

All right, you're starting to lose New

3788
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
All right, you're starting to lose New
 

3789
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,149
All right, you're starting to lose New
York view up. You're starting to lose

3790
01:35:48,149 --> 01:35:48,159
York view up. You're starting to lose
 

3791
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,550
York view up. You're starting to lose
this little shelf here. You might see

3792
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:50,560
this little shelf here. You might see
 

3793
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,390
this little shelf here. You might see
some sell pressure all the way back down

3794
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:52,400
some sell pressure all the way back down
 

3795
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,870
some sell pressure all the way back down
now. So, two leg. They finish the

3796
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
now. So, two leg. They finish the
 

3797
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,510
now. So, two leg. They finish the
two-leg. Buyers trapped at the highs.

3798
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:57,520
two-leg. Buyers trapped at the highs.
 

3799
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,149
two-leg. Buyers trapped at the highs.
Rotation back down to this shelf. If

3800
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:00,159
Rotation back down to this shelf. If
 

3801
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:03,510
Rotation back down to this shelf. If
they lose this shelf, back down we go.

3802
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:03,520
they lose this shelf, back down we go.
 

3803
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,110
they lose this shelf, back down we go.
What are the levels? Well, previous day

3804
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:05,120
What are the levels? Well, previous day
 

3805
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,030
What are the levels? Well, previous day
value area low. still just rotating

3806
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:07,040
value area low. still just rotating
 

3807
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,510
value area low. still just rotating
inside. Remember,

3808
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:09,520
inside. Remember,
 

3809
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,510
inside. Remember,
uh this is yesterday.

3810
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:13,520
uh this is yesterday.
 

3811
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,310
uh this is yesterday.
We're still just rotating inside of

3812
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,320
We're still just rotating inside of
 

3813
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,830
We're still just rotating inside of
yesterday. It's all we're doing right

3814
01:36:17,830 --> 01:36:17,840
yesterday. It's all we're doing right
 

3815
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,629
yesterday. It's all we're doing right
now. All right. So, imbalance.

3816
01:36:20,629 --> 01:36:20,639
now. All right. So, imbalance.
 

3817
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:26,470
now. All right. So, imbalance.
See money, take money.

3818
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:26,480

 

3819
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,149

But the big I would say the big key

3820
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:28,159
But the big I would say the big key
 

3821
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:29,830
But the big I would say the big key
there was those buyers trapped at the

3822
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:29,840
there was those buyers trapped at the
 

3823
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,070
there was those buyers trapped at the
highs. They stood out like a sore thumb.

3824
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:32,080
highs. They stood out like a sore thumb.
 

3825
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,550
highs. They stood out like a sore thumb.
Like I said, once they got stuck at 35,

3826
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
Like I said, once they got stuck at 35,
 

3827
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,430
Like I said, once they got stuck at 35,
that was a big problem. That's always a

3828
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:37,440
that was a big problem. That's always a
 

3829
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,950
that was a big problem. That's always a
good sign of a reversal. So, I kept

3830
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:38,960
good sign of a reversal. So, I kept
 

3831
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,070
good sign of a reversal. So, I kept
saying to you, if you guys can't get

3832
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:40,080
saying to you, if you guys can't get
 

3833
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,390
saying to you, if you guys can't get
over 35s, you're going to get a bigger

3834
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
over 35s, you're going to get a bigger
 

3835
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,950
over 35s, you're going to get a bigger
rotation down. And then you saw these

3836
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:44,960
rotation down. And then you saw these
 

3837
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,790
rotation down. And then you saw these
guys pull the pull the orders. All

3838
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:46,800
guys pull the pull the orders. All
 

3839
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,070
guys pull the pull the orders. All
right? And they're doing the same now.

3840
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:48,080
right? And they're doing the same now.
 

3841
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,229
right? And they're doing the same now.
So, they're adding lower, but you know,

3842
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:50,239
So, they're adding lower, but you know,
 

3843
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:52,229
So, they're adding lower, but you know,
now you know, you can't trust this guy.

3844
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:52,239
now you know, you can't trust this guy.
 

3845
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:53,669
now you know, you can't trust this guy.
Look, it's the same kind of size as

3846
01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:53,679
Look, it's the same kind of size as
 

3847
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,629
Look, it's the same kind of size as
above. You cannot trust this guy. He's

3848
01:36:56,629 --> 01:36:56,639
above. You cannot trust this guy. He's
 

3849
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:57,990
above. You cannot trust this guy. He's
probably going to pull the moment you

3850
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:58,000
probably going to pull the moment you
 

3851
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,750
probably going to pull the moment you
get close to him. So, do not trust. This

3852
01:36:59,750 --> 01:36:59,760
get close to him. So, do not trust. This
 

3853
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,390
get close to him. So, do not trust. This
is why I say the passive orders, we

3854
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,400
is why I say the passive orders, we
 

3855
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,070
is why I say the passive orders, we
might use them as magnets, but the

3856
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,080
might use them as magnets, but the
 

3857
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,149
might use them as magnets, but the
amount of people I say see saying like,

3858
01:37:06,149 --> 01:37:06,159
amount of people I say see saying like,
 

3859
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:07,510
amount of people I say see saying like,
"Oh, these guys are going to get filled

3860
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:07,520
"Oh, these guys are going to get filled
 

3861
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,109
"Oh, these guys are going to get filled
up here and a book has to go up there."

3862
01:37:09,109 --> 01:37:09,119
up here and a book has to go up there."
 

3863
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:11,109
up here and a book has to go up there."
No, it doesn't. They're advertising

3864

No, it doesn't. They're advertising
 

3865
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:12,709
No, it doesn't. They're advertising
price to get it down there. There's just

3866
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
price to get it down there. There's just
 

3867
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:15,590
price to get it down there. There's just
as much chance this is a short seller

3868
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
as much chance this is a short seller
 

3869
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,510
as much chance this is a short seller
trying to attract the market down to him

3870
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:17,520
trying to attract the market down to him
 

3871
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,750
trying to attract the market down to him
and that will pull his order the moment

3872
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:19,760
and that will pull his order the moment
 

3873
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,189
and that will pull his order the moment
it gets there. Right? We don't know. So,

3874
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:23,199
it gets there. Right? We don't know. So,
 

3875
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:25,750
it gets there. Right? We don't know. So,
we're going to find out again now. So,

3876
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:25,760
we're going to find out again now. So,
 

3877
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,189
we're going to find out again now. So,
some front running in front of it, some

3878
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:27,199
some front running in front of it, some
 

3879
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:41,189
some front running in front of it, some
covering in front of it.

3880
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:41,199

 

3881
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:53,030

See if he pulls his order.

3882
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:53,040

 

3883
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,590

So this is an old imbalance here. Now,

3884
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:55,600
So this is an old imbalance here. Now,
 

3885
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,910
So this is an old imbalance here. Now,
from that big candle

3886
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:57,920
from that big candle
 

3887
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,950
from that big candle
for those of you trade valley gaps,

3888
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:00,960
for those of you trade valley gaps,
 

3889
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,950

3891
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:55,109
right, we're filling some of this in
that big expansion.

3892
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:55,119

back to PC

3894
01:38:57,590 --> 01:38:57,600
back to PC
 

3895
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,189
back to PC
and they're going to test BW which is

So here comes the 60s. Let's see if this

3978
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:11,920
So here comes the 60s. Let's see if this

along

3982
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440

 

3983
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,629

don't see anything yet personally

don't see anything yet personally
 

3985
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:28,629
don't see anything yet personally
to see it as a battle zone.

3986
01:43:28,629 --> 01:43:28,639

 

3987
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:33,109

If the 60 guy loses the like pses bid,

3988
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:33,119
If the 60 guy loses the like pses bid,
 

3989
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,109
If the 60 guy loses the like pses bid,
I think you rotate to 50s very quickly

3990
01:43:35,109 --> 01:43:35,119
I think you rotate to 50s very quickly
 

3991
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:36,550
I think you rotate to 50s very quickly
and if you lose that I think you get a

3992
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:36,560
and if you lose that I think you get a
 

3993
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,629
and if you lose that I think you get a
new lower day again. But we will see it

3994
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:38,639
new lower day again. But we will see it
 

3995
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,550
new lower day again. But we will see it
all all depends on what this 60 guy

3996
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:40,560
all all depends on what this 60 guy
 

3997
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,550
all all depends on what this 60 guy
wants to do. You've got balances got a

01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:42,560
wants to do. You've got balances got a
 

3999
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,229

4001
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:45,990
ton of balances below. All right. So,
you've got things that need to get

4002
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:46,000
you've got things that need to get
 

4003
01:43:46,000 --> 01:44:17,990
you've got things that need to get
filled. 65 to 57 and 55 to 43.

4004
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:18,000

 

4005
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,709

Come on. Go and fill him

4006
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:20,719
Come on. Go and fill him
 

4007
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:22,950
Come on. Go and fill him

See if his bollocks really as big as
he's saying they are.

4014
01:44:39,669 --> 01:44:39,679

 

4015
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:42,790

13 points left to fill him. I think it's

4016
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:42,800
13 points left to fill him. I think it's
 

4017
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:48,550
13 points left to fill him. I think it's
coming.

4018
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:48,560

 

4019
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,510

You've got sellside del uh delta offside

So they keep trying to aggressively sell

4024
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:56,320
So they keep trying to aggressively sell
 

4025
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,910
So they keep trying to aggressively sell
71 and they're not getting their way

4026
01:44:59,910 --> 01:44:59,920
71 and they're not getting their way
 

4027
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,510
71 and they're not getting their way
under it for a second there. So they're

4028
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:01,520
under it for a second there. So they're
 

4029
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,790
under it for a second there. So they're
trying again to sell. They're just

4030
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:02,800
trying again to sell. They're just
 

4031
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,070
trying again to sell. They're just
making it worse for themselves at the

4032
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,080
making it worse for themselves at the
 

4033
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,149
making it worse for themselves at the
moment. These sellers, they've got to

4034
01:45:06,149 --> 01:45:06,159
moment. These sellers, they've got to
 

4035
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:07,910
moment. These sellers, they've got to
get a close under 71 here. Otherwise,

4036
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:07,920
get a close under 71 here. Otherwise,
 

4037
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,310
get a close under 71 here. Otherwise,
they're going to get caught.

4038
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:10,320
they're going to get caught.
 

4039
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,709
they're going to get caught.
Here we go. All right, you got your

4040
01:45:12,709 --> 01:45:12,719
Here we go. All right, you got your
 

4041
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:14,149
Here we go. All right, you got your
chance now. Sellers is still being

4042
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:14,159
chance now. Sellers is still being
 

4043
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:15,350
chance now. Sellers is still being
absorbed. All right, so that's telling

4044
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,360
absorbed. All right, so that's telling
 

4045
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,709
absorbed. All right, so that's telling
me there is a passive buyer around 70.

4046
01:45:18,709 --> 01:45:18,719
me there is a passive buyer around 70.
 

4047
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:21,030
me there is a passive buyer around 70.
All right, who's in front of that 60? In

4048
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:21,040
All right, who's in front of that 60? In
 

4049
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,950
All right, who's in front of that 60? In
front of 560. There's a passive buyer at

4050
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:22,960
front of 560. There's a passive buyer at
 

4051
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:27,109
front of 560. There's a passive buyer at
570 because twice now they've sold 80s

4052
01:45:27,109 --> 01:45:27,119
570 because twice now they've sold 80s
 

4053
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:29,430
570 because twice now they've sold 80s
and they've sold 75s and they've sold

4054
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:29,440
and they've sold 75s and they've sold
 

4055
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,430
and they've sold 75s and they've sold
71s without moving lower. So there's

4056
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:31,440
71s without moving lower. So there's
 

4057
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:39,990
71s without moving lower. So there's
there's a big big passive buyer here.

4058
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:40,000

 

4059
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,669

Mad to me that he's trying to absorb

4060
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:41,679
Mad to me that he's trying to absorb
 

4061
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:50,629
Mad to me that he's trying to absorb
this much, but that's what's happening.

4062
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639

 

4063
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:51,990

Here we go. We're going to fill this guy

4064
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:52,000
Here we go. We're going to fill this guy
 

4065
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,590
Here we go. We're going to fill this guy
now

4066
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:53,600
now
 

4067
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,830
now
under 71s. Retesting 71s. There's

4068
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:55,840
under 71s. Retesting 71s. There's
 

4069
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,109
under 71s. Retesting 71s. There's
definitely a pacifier here trying to

4070
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:57,119
definitely a pacifier here trying to
 

4071
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:58,149
definitely a pacifier here trying to
scoop it up. They're probably going to

4072
01:45:58,149 --> 01:45:58,159
scoop it up. They're probably going to
 

4073
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,590
scoop it up. They're probably going to
get a flush moment soon cuz they're

4074
01:45:59,590 --> 01:45:59,600
get a flush moment soon cuz they're
 

4075
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,430
get a flush moment soon cuz they're
going to want to feel really see if this

4076
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:01,440
going to want to feel really see if this
 

4077
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,830
going to want to feel really see if this
guy's real, which he is. He gets sold

4078
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:03,840
guy's real, which he is. He gets sold
 

4079
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,790
guy's real, which he is. He gets sold
into. All right, so we sold into him

4080
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:06,800
into. All right, so we sold into him
 

4081
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,229
into. All right, so we sold into him
there. We exchanged 568 contracts down

4082
01:46:10,229 --> 01:46:10,239
there. We exchanged 568 contracts down
 

4083
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:14,950
there. We exchanged 568 contracts down
at that low. So he got sold into

4084
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:14,960

 

4085
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,629

remember he was a passive buyer. So you

4086
01:46:16,629 --> 01:46:16,639
remember he was a passive buyer. So you
 

4087
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:18,390
remember he was a passive buyer. So you
needed an aggressive market orders to

4088
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:18,400
needed an aggressive market orders to
 

4089
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,790
needed an aggressive market orders to
fill him to match him off, which is what

4090
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:20,800
fill him to match him off, which is what
 

4091
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:25,030
fill him to match him off, which is what
you got 568 of them.

4092
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:25,040
you got 568 of them.
 

4093
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:30,229
you got 568 of them.

4119
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,669

4121
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:35,750
outside of the opening range. All right,
we did it for all of a second.

4122
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:35,760
we did it for all of a second.
 

4123
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,350
we did it for all of a second.
So,

4124
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:37,360
So,
 

4125
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,270
So,
these are the markets that you'll see me

4126
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:39,280
these are the markets that you'll see me
 

4127
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,790
these are the markets that you'll see me
not really participate in because we're

4128
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:40,800
not really participate in because we're
 

4129
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,189
not really participate in because we're
trading inside of previous days value.

4130
01:47:43,189 --> 01:47:43,199
trading inside of previous days value.
 

4131
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,350
trading inside of previous days value.
We're trading inside of current days

4132
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:45,360
We're trading inside of current days
 

4133
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,629
We're trading inside of current days
value. We're not expanding ranges,

4134
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:48,639
value. We're not expanding ranges,
 

4135
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,950
value. We're not expanding ranges,
right? We're just rotating and we all

4136
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:50,960
right? We're just rotating and we all
 

4137
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,709
right? We're just rotating and we all
know Alex does not like rotating

4138
01:47:52,709 --> 01:47:52,719
know Alex does not like rotating
 

4139
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:54,229
know Alex does not like rotating
markets. How can you see it's rotating?

4140
01:47:54,229 --> 01:47:54,239
markets. How can you see it's rotating?
 

4141
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:55,990
markets. How can you see it's rotating?
Well, look at the flow zones. Look at

4142
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:56,000
Well, look at the flow zones. Look at
 

4143
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,070
Well, look at the flow zones. Look at
the VWAP starting to flatten out. Look

4144
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:58,080
the VWAP starting to flatten out. Look
 

4145
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,870
the VWAP starting to flatten out. Look
how tight everything is together,

4146
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:00,880
how tight everything is together,
 

4147
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,950
how tight everything is together,
right? I still think it wants to come

4148
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:02,960
right? I still think it wants to come
 

4149
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,189
right? I still think it wants to come
down here, but you know it it hasn't

4150
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:05,199
down here, but you know it it hasn't
 

4151
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,590
down here, but you know it it hasn't
done it and that's all that matters. All

4152
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:07,600
done it and that's all that matters. All
 

4153
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,030
done it and that's all that matters. All
right, we got another big buyer on the

4154
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:09,040
right, we got another big buyer on the
 

4155
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,790
right, we got another big buyer on the
tape again.

4156
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:10,800
tape again.
 

4157
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,910

01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:13,920
540 now.
 

4159
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,990
540 now.
That'll be under the imbalance if we get

4160
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:16,000
That'll be under the imbalance if we get
 

4161
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,070
That'll be under the imbalance if we get
down there.

4162
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:20,080

 

4163
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,870

4177
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,109
which they couldn't get back in front
of. Right? So, we sold that. We're back

4178
01:48:41,109 --> 01:48:41,119
of. Right? So, we sold that. We're back
 

4179
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:42,629
of. Right? So, we sold that. We're back
down to the lows. Now, if they sell

4180
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:42,639
down to the lows. Now, if they sell
 

4181
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:45,030
down to the lows. Now, if they sell
this, this can be used as liquidity.

4182
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,040
this, this can be used as liquidity.
 

4183
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,030
this, this can be used as liquidity.
Now, everyone who bought that, if we

4184
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:47,040
Now, everyone who bought that, if we
 

4185
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,709
Now, everyone who bought that, if we
break the lows now, then I'm very

4186
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:48,719
break the lows now, then I'm very
 

4187
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,709
break the lows now, then I'm very
confident we come back down into here.

4188
01:48:50,709 --> 01:48:50,719
confident we come back down into here.
 

4189
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:57,669
confident we come back down into here.
Here's

4190
01:48:57,669 --> 01:48:57,679

 

4191
01:48:57,679 --> 01:48:59,590

01:48:59,590 --> 01:48:59,600
current or sorry, previous day value
 

4193
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,510
current or sorry, previous day value
area low again. So, rechecking previous

4194
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:01,520
area low again. So, rechecking previous
 

4195
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,310
area low again. So, rechecking previous
day value area low again.

4196
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:04,320
day value area low again.
 

4197
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,470

Vickstein trying to get going through

4198
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:06,480
Vickstein trying to get going through
 

4199
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,950
Vickstein trying to get going through
1650s. All right, this is its god knows

4200
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:08,960
1650s. All right, this is its god knows
 

4201
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,149
1650s. All right, this is its god knows
how many attempts it's had up here

4202
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:10,159
how many attempts it's had up here
 

4203
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:11,590
how many attempts it's had up here
today. It's had one spike through and

4204
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:11,600
today. It's had one spike through and
 

4205
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:24,390
today. It's had one spike through and
that's it.

4206
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:24,400

 

4207
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:28,149

So under previous day value area low now

4208
01:49:28,149 --> 01:49:28,159
So under previous day value area low now
 

4209
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:29,830
So under previous day value area low now
be watching to see they did they fill

4210
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:29,840
be watching to see they did they fill
 

4211
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,030
be watching to see they did they fill
that guy? Yeah, they filled him. All

4212
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:31,040
that guy? Yeah, they filled him. All
 

4213
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,950
that guy? Yeah, they filled him. All
right. So they're adding 500s now. So

4214
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:32,960
right. So they're adding 500s now. So
 

4215
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,390
right. So they're adding 500s now. So
this looking like it's going to start

4216
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,400
this looking like it's going to start
 

4217
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,030
this looking like it's going to start
drifting lower at this point

4218
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:37,040
drifting lower at this point
 

4219
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,629
drifting lower at this point
which is what you're starting to see. So

4220
01:49:38,629 --> 01:49:38,639
which is what you're starting to see. So
 

4221
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:40,070
which is what you're starting to see. So
I'm starting to attack this a little

4222
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,080
I'm starting to attack this a little
 

4223
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,830
I'm starting to attack this a little
bit. Small size playing with house

4224
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:41,840
bit. Small size playing with house
 

4225
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,109
bit. Small size playing with house
winnings here. Let's see if we can get

4226
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:43,119
winnings here. Let's see if we can get
 

4227
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:45,270
winnings here. Let's see if we can get
initial balance low and then let's see

4228
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:45,280
initial balance low and then let's see
 

4229
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,270
initial balance low and then let's see
if they actually want to let this go.

4230
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:47,280
if they actually want to let this go.
 

4231
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:50,629
if they actually want to let this go.
Previous week high would be 500.

4232
01:49:50,629 --> 01:49:50,639
Previous week high would be 500.
 

4233
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,669
Previous week high would be 500.
Previous week close would be

4234
01:49:53,669 --> 01:49:53,679
Previous week close would be
 

4235
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:55,350
Previous week close would be
482s

4236
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:55,360
482s
 

4237
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,510
482s
and that previous day low is down at

4238
01:49:57,510 --> 01:49:57,520
and that previous day low is down at
 

4239
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,390
and that previous day low is down at
423. So those are the targets if we're

4240
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:00,400
423. So those are the targets if we're
 

4241
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,390
423. So those are the targets if we're
going to get a continuation

4242
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:02,400
going to get a continuation
 

4243
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,910
going to get a continuation
if they're going to reject previous day

4244
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:03,920
if they're going to reject previous day
 

4245
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,390
if they're going to reject previous day
value and start getting a continuation

4246
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:06,400
value and start getting a continuation
 

4247
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,790
value and start getting a continuation
trade.

4248
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:08,800
trade.
 

4249
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,790
trade.
Um because I do think if we snap this

4250
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:10,800
Um because I do think if we snap this
 

4251
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,030
Um because I do think if we snap this
now then you've got all these bulls now

4252
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:13,040
now then you've got all these bulls now
 

4253
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:16,709
now then you've got all these bulls now
trapped in and these moves here should

4254
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:16,719
trapped in and these moves here should
 

4255
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:19,350
trapped in and these moves here should
happen right two leg pull back fail

4256
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:19,360
happen right two leg pull back fail
 

4257
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,510
happen right two leg pull back fail
starting to sell.

4258
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:21,520
starting to sell.
 

4259
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:25,669
starting to sell.
Bang. Here we go folks. All right so

4260
01:50:25,669 --> 01:50:25,679
Bang. Here we go folks. All right so
 

4261
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:27,990
Bang. Here we go folks. All right so
let's see if we can get that previous

4262
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:28,000
let's see if we can get that previous
 

4263
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,590
let's see if we can get that previous
week high 500s and let's see if we snap

4264
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:31,600
week high 500s and let's see if we snap
 

4265
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:33,109
week high 500s and let's see if we snap
that. It would be really nice if we

4266
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
that. It would be really nice if we
 

4267
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,590
that. It would be really nice if we
could snap that.

4268
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:35,600
could snap that.
 

4269
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,030
could snap that.
You can see they're covering some into

4270
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,040
You can see they're covering some into
 

4271
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:45,830
You can see they're covering some into
that on the book.

4272
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:45,840

 

4273
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,390

spy as well. Got to watch those 82s on

4274
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:48,400
spy as well. Got to watch those 82s on
 

4275
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:51,189
spy as well. Got to watch those 82s on
spy. Low of day on spy 8217. Remember

4276
01:50:51,189 --> 01:50:51,199
spy. Low of day on spy 8217. Remember
 

4277
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,189
spy. Low of day on spy 8217. Remember
big gamma level 82. Need to be aware of

4278
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:53,199
big gamma level 82. Need to be aware of
 

4279
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:55,430
big gamma level 82. Need to be aware of
that in my head. We've seen how big

4280
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:55,440
that in my head. We've seen how big
 

4281
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,950
that in my head. We've seen how big
those gamma levels have played the last

4282
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:56,960
those gamma levels have played the last
 

4283
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:04,709
those gamma levels have played the last
few days.

4284
01:51:04,709 --> 01:51:04,719

 

4285
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:07,750

watching to see uh initial balance low

4286
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:07,760
watching to see uh initial balance low
 

4287
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,550
watching to see uh initial balance low
and previous day value area low if they

4288
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,560
and previous day value area low if they
 

4289
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,070
and previous day value area low if they
stay heavy versus these. This is what

4290
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:12,080
stay heavy versus these. This is what
 

4291
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,830
stay heavy versus these. This is what
I'm watching to see. Do we stay heavy

4292
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:13,840
I'm watching to see. Do we stay heavy
 

4293
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,310
I'm watching to see. Do we stay heavy
versus these? Now, if we do, I'll think

4294
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:16,320
versus these? Now, if we do, I'll think
 

4295
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:19,350
versus these? Now, if we do, I'll think
about adding on.

4296
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,360
about adding on.
 

4297
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:20,870
about adding on.
If we just go straight reclaim through

4298
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:20,880
If we just go straight reclaim through
 

4299
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,790
If we just go straight reclaim through
previous day value, then nothing to do.

4300
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:22,800
previous day value, then nothing to do.
 

4301
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:32,229
previous day value, then nothing to do.
It's just to look below and fail again.

4302
01:51:32,229 --> 01:51:32,239

 

4303
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:34,149

So, slight divergence here. ENQ made a

4304
01:51:34,149 --> 01:51:34,159
So, slight divergence here. ENQ made a
 

4305
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:36,790
So, slight divergence here. ENQ made a
new low. SPY did not make a new low. I

4306
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:36,800
new low. SPY did not make a new low. I
 

4307
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,629
new low. SPY did not make a new low. I
assume ES did not make a new low. Let me

4308
01:51:38,629 --> 01:51:38,639
assume ES did not make a new low. Let me
 

4309
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:41,830
assume ES did not make a new low. Let me
just zoom in here. Check.

4310
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:41,840
just zoom in here. Check.
 

4311
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:46,070
just zoom in here. Check.
Did it? No, it did not.

4312
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:46,080
Did it? No, it did not.
 

4313
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:50,629
Did it? No, it did not.
Okay, so initial balance test here.

4314
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
Okay, so initial balance test here.
 

4315
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,709
Okay, so initial balance test here.
And uh through that, I'm watching that

4316
01:51:52,709 --> 01:51:52,719
And uh through that, I'm watching that
 

4317
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:55,189
And uh through that, I'm watching that
previous day value area low. Want to see

4318
01:51:55,189 --> 01:51:55,199
previous day value area low. Want to see
 

4319
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:56,870
previous day value area low. Want to see
if they sell that or not. If they

4320
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:56,880
if they sell that or not. If they
 

4321
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:03,030
if they sell that or not. If they
reclaim it, we go back into range again.

4322
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:03,040

4327
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,430

Where did that big seller step in? What

4328
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:11,440
Where did that big seller step in? What
 

4329
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:16,149
Where did that big seller step in? What
was his level? 540. 477.

4330
01:52:16,149 --> 01:52:16,159
was his level? 540. 477.
 

4331
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:18,149
was his level? 540. 477.
Traded at 540. So that's a big level to

4332
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:18,159
Traded at 540. So that's a big level to
 

4333
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:36,149
Traded at 540. So that's a big level to
watch.

4334
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:36,159

 

4335
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,550

And if BIS holds 1650 as well, that's a

4336
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:38,560
And if BIS holds 1650 as well, that's a
 

4337
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,709
And if BIS holds 1650 as well, that's a
big level. It's through it and it's back

4338
01:52:40,709 --> 01:52:40,719
big level. It's through it and it's back
 

4339
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:43,589
big level. It's through it and it's back
testing it.

4340
01:52:43,589 --> 01:52:43,599
testing it.
 

4341
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:45,109
testing it.
So here's the drive back up to where

4342
01:52:45,109 --> 01:52:45,119
So here's the drive back up to where
 

4343
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:47,270
So here's the drive back up to where
that seller was the 40s. First seller

4344
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:47,280
that seller was the 40s. First seller
 

4345
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:51,750
that seller was the 40s. First seller
was at 40s. Uh value 45, opening range

4346
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:51,760
was at 40s. Uh value 45, opening range
 

4347
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:54,629
was at 40s. Uh value 45, opening range
low 50. So watching 4550 reclaim that

4348
01:52:54,629 --> 01:52:54,639
low 50. So watching 4550 reclaim that
 

4349
01:52:54,639 --> 01:53:01,030
low 50. So watching 4550 reclaim that
then no good.

4350
01:53:01,030 --> 01:53:01,040

 

4351
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,430

There's the imbalance.

4352
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
There's the imbalance.
 

4353
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:09,109
There's the imbalance.
It's 40s.

4354
01:53:09,109 --> 01:53:09,119

 

4355
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:12,390

Zoom this in. Excel there into 40s. So,

4356
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:12,400
Zoom this in. Excel there into 40s. So,
 

4357
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,990
Zoom this in. Excel there into 40s. So,
it is definitely a level they're looking

4358
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:14,000
it is definitely a level they're looking
 

4359
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,070
it is definitely a level they're looking
to resell that still. But any now I know

4360
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:16,080
to resell that still. But any now I know
 

4361
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,950
to resell that still. But any now I know
any reclaim of 1450 then this thing will

4362
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:18,960
any reclaim of 1450 then this thing will
 

4363
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,790
any reclaim of 1450 then this thing will
probably squeeze. Right. So, this is

4364
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:20,800
probably squeeze. Right. So, this is
 

4365
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:23,669
probably squeeze. Right. So, this is
sort of

4366
01:53:23,669 --> 01:53:23,679
sort of
 

4367
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:25,589
sort of
probably call it 60. So, this is your

4368
01:53:25,589 --> 01:53:25,599
probably call it 60. So, this is your
 

4369
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:27,350
probably call it 60. So, this is your
level. They need to fail this otherwise

4370
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:27,360
level. They need to fail this otherwise
 

4371
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,870
level. They need to fail this otherwise
they squeeze up to here and then they'll

4372
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:28,880
they squeeze up to here and then they'll
 

4373
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,910
they squeeze up to here and then they'll
look to sell that. If they reclaim this

4374
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:31,920
look to sell that. If they reclaim this
 

4375
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:40,390
look to sell that. If they reclaim this
then they go back upside again.

4376
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,400

 

4377
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,070

Big players come back on the book buy

4378
01:53:42,070 --> 01:53:42,080
Big players come back on the book buy
 

4379
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,430
Big players come back on the book buy
side at twelves

4380
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:45,440
side at twelves
 

4381
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:53,669
side at twelves
300 lot.

4382
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:53,679

 

4383
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:55,589

Um, well, you're asking quite a lot for

4384
01:53:55,589 --> 01:53:55,599
Um, well, you're asking quite a lot for
 

4385
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,310
Um, well, you're asking quite a lot for
VIX to get up there right now.

4386
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
VIX to get up there right now.
 

4387
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,229
VIX to get up there right now.
It It's not got above it's not based

4388
01:54:00,229 --> 01:54:00,239
It It's not got above it's not based
 

4389
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:02,790
It It's not got above it's not based
above 1660 yet. So, I don't I don't

4390
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:02,800
above 1660 yet. So, I don't I don't
 

4391
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,070
above 1660 yet. So, I don't I don't
think there's any sign of it going for

4392
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,080
think there's any sign of it going for
 

4393
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,109
think there's any sign of it going for
previous day high right now.

4394
01:54:07,109 --> 01:54:07,119
previous day high right now.
 

4395
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:09,109
previous day high right now.
Things can change, but you know, I I

4396
01:54:09,109 --> 01:54:09,119
Things can change, but you know, I I
 

4397
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,830
Things can change, but you know, I I
don't have the magic uh magic eightball

4398
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:11,840
don't have the magic uh magic eightball
 

4399
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,229
don't have the magic uh magic eightball
to tell you. Okay, so they keep

4400
01:54:14,229 --> 01:54:14,239
to tell you. Okay, so they keep
 

4401
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,149
to tell you. Okay, so they keep
reselling 40s and 50s. Like I said, this

4402
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:16,159
reselling 40s and 50s. Like I said, this
 

4403
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:17,830
reselling 40s and 50s. Like I said, this
can drift all the way up to 60s if it

4404
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:17,840
can drift all the way up to 60s if it
 

4405
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,910
can drift all the way up to 60s if it
wants.

4406
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:19,920
wants.
 

4407
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,109
wants.
There's aggressive buying here and

4408
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:21,119
There's aggressive buying here and
 

4409
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:22,709
There's aggressive buying here and
there's definitely been a passive seller

4410
01:54:22,709 --> 01:54:22,719
there's definitely been a passive seller
 

4411
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:24,149
there's definitely been a passive seller
here. This was his level before.

4412
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:24,159
here. This was his level before.
 

4413
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:26,470
here. This was his level before.
Remember, we did a big exchange here

4414
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:26,480
Remember, we did a big exchange here
 

4415
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:29,109
Remember, we did a big exchange here
before for the breakdown.

4416
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:29,119
before for the breakdown.
 

4417
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:30,550
before for the breakdown.
If they start getting through previous

4418
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,560
If they start getting through previous
 

4419
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,550
If they start getting through previous
day value, low in 60s, this can squeeze

4420
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:32,560
day value, low in 60s, this can squeeze
 

4421
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:33,830
day value, low in 60s, this can squeeze
all the way back up to where it came

4422
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
all the way back up to where it came
 

4423
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,430
all the way back up to where it came
from. All the way back up to here. So,

4424
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:35,440
from. All the way back up to here. So,
 

4425
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,510
from. All the way back up to here. So,
I'd say this 60 is going to be a massive

4426
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:37,520
I'd say this 60 is going to be a massive
 

4427
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,350
I'd say this 60 is going to be a massive
level.

4428
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:39,360
level.
 

4429
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,430
level.
That's sort of last chance saloon for

4430
01:54:41,430 --> 01:54:41,440
That's sort of last chance saloon for
 

4431
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:50,390
That's sort of last chance saloon for
the shorts.

4432
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:50,400

 

4433
01:54:50,400 --> 01:55:35,990

Boring market just so pinned

4434
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,000

 

4435
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,830

Okay, there's a test towards the 60 that

4436
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:37,840
Okay, there's a test towards the 60 that
 

4437
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,470
Okay, there's a test towards the 60 that
shelf.

4438
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:42,480

 

4439
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,070

We're back inside previous days value

4440
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,080
We're back inside previous days value
 

4441
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,830
We're back inside previous days value
here, but we're at flow zones. We're at

4442
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:45,840
here, but we're at flow zones. We're at
 

4443
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,310
here, but we're at flow zones. We're at
this sort of gray box there, that shelf.

4444
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:48,320
this sort of gray box there, that shelf.
 

4445
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,109
this sort of gray box there, that shelf.
Anything through here will uh initiate a

4446
01:55:51,109 --> 01:55:51,119
Anything through here will uh initiate a
 

4447
01:55:51,119 --> 01:56:06,229
Anything through here will uh initiate a
new squeeze up, I would say.

4448
01:56:06,229 --> 01:56:06,239

 

4449
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:07,830

Regarding the indicators, are the ones

4450
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:07,840
Regarding the indicators, are the ones
 

4451
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,350
Regarding the indicators, are the ones
on Trading View and those on Ninja

4452
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,360
on Trading View and those on Ninja
 

4453
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,950
on Trading View and those on Ninja
Trader the same? Yeah, they're the same.

4454
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:10,960
Trader the same? Yeah, they're the same.
 

4455
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:13,030
Trader the same? Yeah, they're the same.
Exactly the same. Okay. Rejection of 60s

4456
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:13,040
Exactly the same. Okay. Rejection of 60s
 

4457
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,470
Exactly the same. Okay. Rejection of 60s
there so far. You need to see follow

4458
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:14,480
there so far. You need to see follow
 

4459
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:15,910
there so far. You need to see follow
through now to fill all these

4460
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:15,920
through now to fill all these
 

4461
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,910
through now to fill all these
participants through 25s and 12elves.

4462
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:17,920
participants through 25s and 12elves.
 

4463
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,189
participants through 25s and 12elves.
And if you see that, you're going to see

4464
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:19,199
And if you see that, you're going to see
 

4465
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,109
And if you see that, you're going to see
downside pressure. So it's big big

4466
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:21,119
downside pressure. So it's big big
 

4467
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:23,109
downside pressure. So it's big big
levels coming up here. If you see a

4468
01:56:23,109 --> 01:56:23,119
levels coming up here. If you see a
 

4469
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:24,470
levels coming up here. If you see a
flush here, they're going to really

4470
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:24,480
flush here, they're going to really
 

4471
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,270
flush here, they're going to really
really sell this. So this really is a

4472
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:27,280
really sell this. So this really is a
 

4473
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,910
really sell this. So this really is a
big big moment for this market here

4474
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:29,920
big big moment for this market here
 

4475
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:32,950
big big moment for this market here
because we just rejected 60s and we said

4476
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:32,960
because we just rejected 60s and we said
 

4477
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,229
because we just rejected 60s and we said
if we squeeze through that, it would

4478
01:56:34,229 --> 01:56:34,239
if we squeeze through that, it would
 

4479
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:35,990
if we squeeze through that, it would
test the 60s. If they get follow through

4480
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:36,000
test the 60s. If they get follow through
 

4481
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,830
test the 60s. If they get follow through
here underneath initial balance, it is

4482
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:37,840
here underneath initial balance, it is
 

4483
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:42,149
here underneath initial balance, it is
night night market. Really nice,

4484
01:56:42,149 --> 01:56:42,159
night night market. Really nice,
 

4485
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:44,390
night night market. Really nice,
right? Can we get through initial

4486
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:44,400
right? Can we get through initial
 

4487
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:47,109
right? Can we get through initial
balance low and expand this? Now we're

4488
01:56:47,109 --> 01:56:47,119
balance low and expand this? Now we're
 

4489
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:48,470
balance low and expand this? Now we're
starting to see aggressive selling

4490
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:48,480
starting to see aggressive selling
 

4491
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,830
starting to see aggressive selling
coming in. We got to fill these guys

4492
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:49,840
coming in. We got to fill these guys
 

4493
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:54,790
coming in. We got to fill these guys
into 500s and sell through 500s here.

4494
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:54,800
into 500s and sell through 500s here.
 

4495
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,390
into 500s and sell through 500s here.
Come on, Mr. Market. Let's have some

4496
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:56,400
Come on, Mr. Market. Let's have some
 

4497
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:05,030
Come on, Mr. Market. Let's have some
fun. Let's do something today.

4498
01:57:05,030 --> 01:57:05,040

 

4499
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,109

Still holding that IB. I want to sell

4500
01:57:07,109 --> 01:57:07,119
Still holding that IB. I want to sell
 

4501
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:10,149
Still holding that IB. I want to sell
through IB.

4502
01:57:10,149 --> 01:57:10,159
through IB.
 

4503
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:11,750
through IB.
So, I've just got a one guy on at the

4504
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:11,760
So, I've just got a one guy on at the
 

4505
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:14,550
So, I've just got a one guy on at the
moment at 45, which is that previous day

4506
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:14,560
moment at 45, which is that previous day
 

4507
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,070
moment at 45, which is that previous day
value area low once we spiked up and

4508
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:16,080
value area low once we spiked up and
 

4509
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:21,030
value area low once we spiked up and
then come back under it. Sold there.

4510
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:21,040

 

4511
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,109

I need to see us sell through initial

4512
01:57:23,109 --> 01:57:23,119
I need to see us sell through initial
 

4513
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:25,510
I need to see us sell through initial
balance. And I really need to see us

4514
01:57:25,510 --> 01:57:25,520
balance. And I really need to see us
 

4515
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:30,790
balance. And I really need to see us
where do those big sellers come in?

4516
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:30,800

 

4517
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:33,109

17s and 11s. So, if we don't get through

4518
01:57:33,109 --> 01:57:33,119
17s and 11s. So, if we don't get through
 

4519
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:35,350
17s and 11s. So, if we don't get through
that, I'll have to cut it. Break even.

4520
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:35,360
that, I'll have to cut it. Break even.
 

4521
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,109
that, I'll have to cut it. Break even.
And we're coming back towards my

4522
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
And we're coming back towards my
 

4523
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:39,350
And we're coming back towards my
position there already. Yeah. Okay. So

4524
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:39,360
position there already. Yeah. Okay. So
 

4525
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,830
position there already. Yeah. Okay. So
they can't get through the 17s.

4526
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:41,840
they can't get through the 17s.
 

4527
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,750
they can't get through the 17s.
And it's possible if we go through this,

4528
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:43,760
And it's possible if we go through this,
 

4529
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:45,510
And it's possible if we go through this,
we go back into rotation. So it's about

4530
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:45,520
we go back into rotation. So it's about
 

4531
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,709
we go back into rotation. So it's about
to stop our break even here.

4532
01:57:48,709 --> 01:57:48,719
to stop our break even here.
 

4533
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:50,550
to stop our break even here.

The last week's made me want to just

4556
01:58:41,589 --> 01:58:41,599
The last week's made me want to just
 

4557
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:43,030
The last week's made me want to just
start trading options because apparently

4558
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:43,040
start trading options because apparently

it's all you do now. You just get a
gamma level and you just buy the gamma

gamma level and you just buy the gamma
 

4563
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:48,470
gamma level and you just buy the gamma
level and that's it. That's all we do

4564
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,480
level and that's it. That's all we do
 

4565
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,910

Okay, perfect. Yeah, I've got WhatsApp.

4582
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:31,040

 

4583
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,950

Okay, so back to these 60s. This is the

4584
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:32,960
Okay, so back to these 60s. This is the
 

4585
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,790
Okay, so back to these 60s. This is the
big level. If they reclaim these 60s,

4586
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:34,800
big level. If they reclaim these 60s,
 

4587
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,229
big level. If they reclaim these 60s,
remember I'm flat now.

4588
01:59:38,229 --> 01:59:38,239
remember I'm flat now.
 

4589
01:59:38,239 --> 01:59:40,149
remember I'm flat now.
I was short for this breakdown and then

4590
01:59:40,149 --> 01:59:40,159
I was short for this breakdown and then
 

4591
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:41,750
I was short for this breakdown and then
I had another attempt here. Stopped out,

4592
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:41,760
I had another attempt here. Stopped out,
 

4593
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,990
I had another attempt here. Stopped out,
break even. Watching this gray box here,

4594
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:44,000
break even. Watching this gray box here,
 

4595
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,990
break even. Watching this gray box here,
this edge here. Sellers, in my mind,

4596
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:46,000
this edge here. Sellers, in my mind,
 

4597
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,589
this edge here. Sellers, in my mind,
they need to sell this for the rotation.

4598
01:59:47,589 --> 01:59:47,599
they need to sell this for the rotation.
 

4599
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:49,109
they need to sell this for the rotation.
If they don't sell it, then we go back

4600
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,119
If they don't sell it, then we go back
 

4601
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,270
If they don't sell it, then we go back
into this area here. And we will just

4602
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:51,280
into this area here. And we will just
 

4603
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,750
into this area here. And we will just
trade sideways again. But sellers can

4604
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:53,760
trade sideways again. But sellers can
 

4605
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,830
trade sideways again. But sellers can
resell this here. But they're not doing

4606
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:55,840
resell this here. But they're not doing
 

4607
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,390
resell this here. But they're not doing
a very good job.

4608
01:59:58,390 --> 01:59:58,400
a very good job.
 

4609
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,830
a very good job.
They are not doing a very good job.

4610
01:59:59,830 --> 01:59:59,840
They are not doing a very good job.
 

4611
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,430
They are not doing a very good job.
We've reclaimed initial balance low

4612
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:01,440
We've reclaimed initial balance low
 

4613
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,350
We've reclaimed initial balance low
after sweeping and here you had

4614
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:03,360
after sweeping and here you had
 

4615
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:05,669
after sweeping and here you had
divergence to ES. So it's worth being

4616
02:00:05,669 --> 02:00:05,679
divergence to ES. So it's worth being
 

4617
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:20,149
divergence to ES. So it's worth being
aware of

4618
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:20,159

 

4619
02:00:20,159 --> 02:00:23,830

failed 60 again.

4620
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:23,840
failed 60 again.
 

4621
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,990
failed 60 again.
Do I have one more go at this? Do I have

4622
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:26,000
Do I have one more go at this? Do I have
 

4623
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:37,830
Do I have one more go at this? Do I have
one more go at this, folks?

4624
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:37,840

 

4625
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,950

It's just so messy in here.

4626
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:40,960
It's just so messy in here.
 

4627
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:52,229
It's just so messy in here.
There's that P3

4628

4629
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:53,750

minute bars are not looking very good.

4630
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:53,760
minute bars are not looking very good.
 

4631
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,910
minute bars are not looking very good.
I'm going to be honest with you. We've

4632
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:55,920
I'm going to be honest with you. We've
 

4633
02:00:55,920 --> 02:01:00,709

we're just moving PC on those 30 minutes

4638
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:05,440
we're just moving PC on those 30 minutes
 

4639
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:08,310
we're just moving PC on those 30 minutes
around from like 604 and then it gets

02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:10,880
like moved down to 577, then moved up to
 

4643
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:13,830
like moved down to 577, then moved up to
595 and now moved to 546 and we're

4644
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:13,840
595 and now moved to 546 and we're
 

4645
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,510
595 and now moved to 546 and we're
trading there at the moment. So, it's

4646
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:15,520
trading there at the moment. So, it's
 

4647
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,030
trading there at the moment. So, it's
not

4648
02:01:17,030 --> 02:01:17,040
not
 

4649
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:18,550
not
there. There isn't a follow through in

4650
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:18,560
there. There isn't a follow through in
 

4651
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,030
there. There isn't a follow through in
the market at the moment

4652
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:21,040
the market at the moment
 

4653
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,470
the market at the moment
inside. We're back inside. So, well,

4654
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:22,480
inside. We're back inside. So, well,
 

4655
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:23,990
inside. We're back inside. So, well,
we're trying to get back inside previous

4656
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:24,000
we're trying to get back inside previous
 

4657
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,830
we're trying to get back inside previous
stage value at the moment. We're not

4658
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:25,840
stage value at the moment. We're not
 

4659
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:28,390
stage value at the moment. We're not
seeing acceptance underneath previous

4660
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:28,400
seeing acceptance underneath previous
 

4661
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:29,830
seeing acceptance underneath previous
stage value. We've had two attempts at

4662
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:29,840
stage value. We've had two attempts at
 

4663
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:31,430
stage value. We've had two attempts at
it today. I still think we can move

4664
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:31,440
it today. I still think we can move
 

4665
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:35,109
it today. I still think we can move
lower. Um, but I need to see aggression

4666
02:01:35,109 --> 02:01:35,119
lower. Um, but I need to see aggression
 

4667
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:37,030
lower. Um, but I need to see aggression
step in and I'm not seeing that. They

4668
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:37,040
step in and I'm not seeing that. They
 

4669
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,470
step in and I'm not seeing that. They
have the opportunity right here, right

4670
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:38,480
have the opportunity right here, right
 

4671
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,270
have the opportunity right here, right
now to sell versus 60s

4672
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:41,280
now to sell versus 60s
 

4673
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,990
now to sell versus 60s
and they're not. So, again, like it's

4674
02:01:43,990 --> 02:01:44,000
and they're not. So, again, like it's
 

4675
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,589
and they're not. So, again, like it's
going in my head. They're not selling

4676
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
going in my head. They're not selling
 

4677
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:47,270
going in my head. They're not selling
it. They should and they're not selling

4678
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:47,280
it. They should and they're not selling
 

4679
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:51,189
it. They should and they're not selling
it. Why alarm bells? They're holding

4680
02:01:51,189 --> 02:01:51,199
it. Why alarm bells? They're holding
 

4681
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:53,910
it. Why alarm bells? They're holding
82s. We haven't even traded to 682s on

4682
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:53,920
82s. We haven't even traded to 682s on
 

4683
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,510
82s. We haven't even traded to 682s on
SPY. We've traded in front of it twice

4684
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:55,520
SPY. We've traded in front of it twice
 

4685
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:56,950
SPY. We've traded in front of it twice
and they're bidding it. So, the options

4686
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:56,960
and they're bidding it. So, the options
 

4687
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:58,629
and they're bidding it. So, the options
dealers are bidding us up. They're

4688
02:01:58,629 --> 02:01:58,639
dealers are bidding us up. They're
 

4689
02:01:58,639 --> 02:02:00,709
dealers are bidding us up. They're
pinning us. Yesterday, they pinned us at

4690
02:02:00,709 --> 02:02:00,719
pinning us. Yesterday, they pinned us at
 

4691
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:02,790
pinning us. Yesterday, they pinned us at
680. Now, they've walked up, pinned us

4692
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:02,800
680. Now, they've walked up, pinned us
 

4693
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,589
680. Now, they've walked up, pinned us
at 682. So, we're pinned between 682,

4694
02:02:05,589 --> 02:02:05,599
at 682. So, we're pinned between 682,
 

4695
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:08,470
at 682. So, we're pinned between 682,
685. Rotation, rotation, rotation,

4696
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:08,480
685. Rotation, rotation, rotation,
 

4697
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,950
685. Rotation, rotation, rotation,
rotation. I'm saying this out loud loud

4698
02:02:10,950 --> 02:02:10,960
rotation. I'm saying this out loud loud
 

4699
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,229
rotation. I'm saying this out loud loud
in my head because it's like, stop

4700
02:02:12,229 --> 02:02:12,239
in my head because it's like, stop
 

4701
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:14,229
in my head because it's like, stop
looking for continuation. They don't

4702
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:14,239
looking for continuation. They don't
 

4703
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:16,070
looking for continuation. They don't
want it to continue. They want to pin

4704
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:16,080
want it to continue. They want to pin
 

4705
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:18,950
want it to continue. They want to pin
it. So, probably in my head telling

4706
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:18,960
it. So, probably in my head telling
 

4707
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,390
it. So, probably in my head telling
myself, you're done for the day. You've

4708
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:20,400
myself, you're done for the day. You've
 

4709
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,070
myself, you're done for the day. You've
made good money. Why are you trying to

4710
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:22,080
made good money. Why are you trying to
 

4711
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:24,870
made good money. Why are you trying to
trade if they don't want to find

4712
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:24,880
trade if they don't want to find
 

4713
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,109
trade if they don't want to find
acceptance lower? Why bother? Because my

4714
02:02:27,109 --> 02:02:27,119
acceptance lower? Why bother? Because my
 

4715
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:29,270
acceptance lower? Why bother? Because my
rule is don't trade rotation. We're now

4716
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,280
rule is don't trade rotation. We're now
 

4717
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,510
rule is don't trade rotation. We're now
back inside rotation.

4718
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:31,520
back inside rotation.
 

4719
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:36,229
back inside rotation.
This is me speaking out loud

4720
02:02:36,229 --> 02:02:36,239

 

4721
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:38,950

4722
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:38,960
to myself more than you guys. All right.
 

4723
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,589
to myself more than you guys. All right.
To myself more than you guys.

02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
To myself more than you guys.
 

4725
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:43,109
To myself more than you guys.
Look below and fail. Probably going to

02:02:43,109 --> 02:02:43,119
Look below and fail. Probably going to
 

4727
02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:45,109
Look below and fail. Probably going to
go to VW in this case. If we reclaim

4728
02:02:45,109 --> 02:02:45,119
go to VW in this case. If we reclaim
 

4729
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:46,790
go to VW in this case. If we reclaim
60s. All right. the initial balance

4731
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:50,390
60s. All right. the initial balance
trade. Look below fail. This is a big

4732
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,400
trade. Look below fail. This is a big
 

4733
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:51,830
trade. Look below fail. This is a big
shelf here. They get through this, they

4734
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:51,840
shelf here. They get through this, they
 

4735
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,350
shelf here. They get through this, they
will go to VWAP. That would be the IB to

4736
02:02:53,350 --> 02:02:53,360
will go to VWAP. That would be the IB to
 

4737
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:55,750
will go to VWAP. That would be the IB to
VWAP trade for me. Sellers have the

4738
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:55,760
VWAP trade for me. Sellers have the
 

4739
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:57,669
VWAP trade for me. Sellers have the
opportunity here to sell it. But I've

4740
02:02:57,669 --> 02:02:57,679
opportunity here to sell it. But I've
 

4741
02:02:57,679 --> 02:02:59,270
opportunity here to sell it. But I've
had a go at it. I'm not going to sell it

4742
02:02:59,270 --> 02:02:59,280
had a go at it. I'm not going to sell it
 

4743
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:03,510
had a go at it. I'm not going to sell it
again. I've had a go at it already.

4744
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:03,520

 

4745
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,589

Have to make some rules for myself. How

4746
02:03:05,589 --> 02:03:05,599
Have to make some rules for myself. How
 

4747
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:07,109
Have to make some rules for myself. How
many trades can you take in a day? I

4748
02:03:07,109 --> 02:03:07,119
many trades can you take in a day? I
 

4749
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:09,189
many trades can you take in a day? I
can't keep having a go at this same

4750
02:03:09,189 --> 02:03:09,199
can't keep having a go at this same
 

4751
02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:10,709
can't keep having a go at this same
trade. If it doesn't want to do it, it

4752
02:03:10,709 --> 02:03:10,719
trade. If it doesn't want to do it, it
 

4753
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:16,390
trade. If it doesn't want to do it, it
doesn't want to do it.

02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:16,400

 

4755

matter how bad it looks under the

4790
02:03:52,229 --> 02:03:52,239
matter how bad it looks under the
 

4791
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:55,589
matter how bad it looks under the
surface. They're not selling it. So

4792
02:03:55,589 --> 02:03:55,599
surface. They're not selling it. So
 

4793
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:57,030
surface. They're not selling it. So
there you go. You got fundamental

4794
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:57,040
there you go. You got fundamental
 

4795
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:58,470
there you go. You got fundamental
traders trading against technical

4796
02:03:58,470 --> 02:03:58,480
traders trading against technical
 

4797
02:03:58,480 --> 02:03:59,910
traders trading against technical
traders right now. That's what I would

4798
02:03:59,910 --> 02:03:59,920
traders right now. That's what I would
 

4799
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,830
traders right now. That's what I would
say. They're not in alignment. You're

4800
02:04:01,830 --> 02:04:01,840
say. They're not in alignment. You're
 

4801
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,830
say. They're not in alignment. You're
not seeing fundamentals saying, "Hey,

4802
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:03,840
not seeing fundamentals saying, "Hey,
 

4803
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,189
not seeing fundamentals saying, "Hey,
this market's in pain." And technical

4804
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:05,199
this market's in pain." And technical
 

4805
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:06,550
this market's in pain." And technical
traders go, "Yeah, you're right. Sell

4806
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:06,560
traders go, "Yeah, you're right. Sell
 

4807
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,310
traders go, "Yeah, you're right. Sell
it." You're seeing the opposite. You're

4808
02:04:08,310 --> 02:04:08,320
it." You're seeing the opposite. You're
 

4809
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,990
it." You're seeing the opposite. You're
seeing fundamental traders go, "Hey,

4810
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:10,000
seeing fundamental traders go, "Hey,
 

4811
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,470
seeing fundamental traders go, "Hey,
this market's [\h__\h] There's no jobs. No

4812
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:12,480
this market's [\h__\h] There's no jobs. No
 

4813
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,709
this market's [\h__\h] There's no jobs. No
one's working. We've got pressure on the

4814
02:04:14,709 --> 02:04:14,719
one's working. We've got pressure on the
 

4815
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:16,310
one's working. We've got pressure on the
market. You've seen technical traders

4816
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:16,320
market. You've seen technical traders
 

4817
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:17,990
market. You've seen technical traders
go, "We don't [\h__\h] care. Bid it up.

4818
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:18,000
go, "We don't [\h__\h] care. Bid it up.
 

4819
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,310
go, "We don't [\h__\h] care. Bid it up.
We haven't made our money." And that is

4820
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:20,320
We haven't made our money." And that is
 

4821
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,830
We haven't made our money." And that is
the fight right now. And until they

4822
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:21,840
the fight right now. And until they
 

4823
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,589
the fight right now. And until they
start agreeing, I think that will remain

4824
02:04:23,589 --> 02:04:23,599
start agreeing, I think that will remain
 

4825
02:04:23,599 --> 02:04:26,229
start agreeing, I think that will remain
the fight. And I think until SPY trades

4826
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:26,239
the fight. And I think until SPY trades
 

4827
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:28,470
the fight. And I think until SPY trades
under 680, there's still a chance for

4828
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:28,480
under 680, there's still a chance for
 

4829
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,310
under 680, there's still a chance for
new all-time highs this year. And that

4830
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:30,320
new all-time highs this year. And that
 

4831
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,709
new all-time highs this year. And that
is my feeling just based on what I'm

4832
02:04:32,709 --> 02:04:32,719
is my feeling just based on what I'm
 

4833
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:35,589
is my feeling just based on what I'm
seeing in the market. Look again today.

4834
02:04:35,589 --> 02:04:35,599
seeing in the market. Look again today.
 

4835
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:37,510
seeing in the market. Look again today.
How many chances have sellers had to

4836
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:37,520
How many chances have sellers had to
 

4837
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:39,669
How many chances have sellers had to
take control?

4838
02:04:39,669 --> 02:04:39,679
take control?
 

4839
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:41,750
take control?
How many chances

4840
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:41,760
How many chances
 

4841
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,510
How many chances
have they had here? Failed breakout

4842
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:45,520
have they had here? Failed breakout
 

4843
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,830
have they had here? Failed breakout
here. They're doing a terrible job of

4844
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:47,840
here. They're doing a terrible job of
 

4845
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,430
here. They're doing a terrible job of
it. All right. They're letting them

4846
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:49,440
it. All right. They're letting them
 

4847
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,070
it. All right. They're letting them
reclaim range. They're not even taking

4848
02:04:52,070 --> 02:04:52,080
reclaim range. They're not even taking
 

4849
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:54,709
reclaim range. They're not even taking
out a really, really obvious level down

4850
02:04:54,709 --> 02:04:54,719
out a really, really obvious level down
 

4851
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:56,870
out a really, really obvious level down
here to take out. They're unable to do

4852
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880
here to take out. They're unable to do
 

4853
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,750
here to take out. They're unable to do
it. That's the story for me of this

4854
02:04:59,750 --> 02:04:59,760
it. That's the story for me of this
 

4855
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:02,790
it. That's the story for me of this
market since April is sellers are unable

4856
02:05:02,790 --> 02:05:02,800
market since April is sellers are unable
 

4857
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:18,550
market since April is sellers are unable
to do anything of note.

4858
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:18,560

 

4859
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:20,470

No. Are these guys walking up or they

4860
02:05:20,470 --> 02:05:20,480
No. Are these guys walking up or they
 

4861
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:21,990
No. Are these guys walking up or they
just still? Yeah, they've walked up a

4862
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:22,000
just still? Yeah, they've walked up a
 

4863
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,750
just still? Yeah, they've walked up a
bit. All right. So, someone down here

4864
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:23,760
bit. All right. So, someone down here
 

4865
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,990
bit. All right. So, someone down here
trying to get filled.

4866
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:28,000

 

4867
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,910

Think he might be waiting a while. I

4868
02:05:29,910 --> 02:05:29,920
Think he might be waiting a while. I
 

4869
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:31,189
Think he might be waiting a while. I
don't think it's going to happen anytime

4870
02:05:31,189 --> 02:05:31,199
don't think it's going to happen anytime
 

4871
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:38,550
don't think it's going to happen anytime
soon.

4872
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:38,560

 

4873
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,149

What would you guys rather have for the

4874
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:40,159
What would you guys rather have for the
 

4875
02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:41,510
What would you guys rather have for the
end of the year? Would you rather have

4876
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:41,520
end of the year? Would you rather have
 

4877
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,790
end of the year? Would you rather have
this market rotate lower

4878
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:44,800
this market rotate lower
 

4879
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:46,470
this market rotate lower
into end of year or are you guys looking

4880
02:05:46,470 --> 02:05:46,480
into end of year or are you guys looking
 

4881
02:05:46,480 --> 02:06:00,390
into end of year or are you guys looking
for alltime highs?

4882
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:00,400

 

4883
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:08,709

Yeah. Back above 60. We get up here now.

4884
02:06:08,709 --> 02:06:08,719

 

4885
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:10,229

I mean, you can make money either side,

4886
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:10,239
I mean, you can make money either side,
 

4887
02:06:10,239 --> 02:06:12,390
I mean, you can make money either side,
but I'm talking about more from from

4888
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:12,400
but I'm talking about more from from
 

4889
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,070
but I'm talking about more from from
what might set up for next year because

4890
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:14,080
what might set up for next year because
 

4891
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:15,830
what might set up for next year because
it does have an impact on how we move

4892
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:15,840
it does have an impact on how we move
 

4893
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:18,629
it does have an impact on how we move
next year.

4894
02:06:18,629 --> 02:06:18,639
next year.
 

4895
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:20,870
next year.
I think we if we do new alltime highs in

4896
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:20,880
I think we if we do new alltime highs in
 

4897
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:23,189
I think we if we do new alltime highs in
December, I think January looks uh

4898
02:06:23,189 --> 02:06:23,199
December, I think January looks uh
 

4899
02:06:23,199 --> 02:06:25,270
December, I think January looks uh
pretty bleak

4900
02:06:25,270 --> 02:06:25,280
pretty bleak
 

4901
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,350
pretty bleak
because that would tell me, okay, hedges

4902
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:27,360
because that would tell me, okay, hedges
 

4903
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,430
because that would tell me, okay, hedges
just want their Christmas bonuses and

4904
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:29,440
just want their Christmas bonuses and
 

4905
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:30,629
just want their Christmas bonuses and
once they've made their Christmas

4906
02:06:30,629 --> 02:06:30,639
once they've made their Christmas
 

4907
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:32,870
once they've made their Christmas
bonuses, they probably unwind this

4908
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:32,880
bonuses, they probably unwind this
 

4909
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:35,189
bonuses, they probably unwind this
thing.

4910
02:06:35,189 --> 02:06:35,199
thing.
 

4911
02:06:35,199 --> 02:06:40,709
thing.
It does make a difference.

4912
02:06:40,709 --> 02:06:40,719

 

4913
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:43,109

Okay, so there's your VWAP, high to

4914
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:43,119
Okay, so there's your VWAP, high to
 

4915
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:47,270
Okay, so there's your VWAP, high to
VWAP. What a [\h__\h] market, man.

4916
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:47,280
VWAP. What a [\h__\h] market, man.
 

4917
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:49,109
VWAP. What a [\h__\h] market, man.
If you guys like rotation, this is your

If you guys like rotation, this is your

like this, you're mental. I can't get my
 

4929
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:08,069
like this, you're mental. I can't get my
head around people that like this, but

4930
02:07:08,069 --> 02:07:08,079
head around people that like this, but
 

4931
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:13,589
head around people that like this, but

It's just who likes this?
Someone does.

Someone likes it.

4938

4939
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,790

I don't think so. On Friday. Not if we

I don't think so. On Friday. Not if we
 

4941
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,149
I don't think so. On Friday. Not if we
keep doing this. Think what you'll see

keep doing this. Think what you'll see
 

4943
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:45,669
keep doing this. Think what you'll see
Vicks get crushed and us just keep

Vicks get crushed and us just keep
 

4945

Vicks get crushed and us just keep

dipped and dipped and failed and came
 

5103
02:11:56,719 --> 02:11:58,470
dipped and dipped and failed and came
back and failed and failed and got over

5104
02:11:58,470 --> 02:11:58,480
back and failed and failed and got over
 

5105
02:11:58,480 --> 02:11:59,750
back and failed and failed and got over
and now they want to see if they can

5106
02:11:59,750 --> 02:11:59,760
and now they want to see if they can
 

5107
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:01,910
and now they want to see if they can
hold this and if they can hold this they

5108
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:01,920
hold this and if they can hold this they
 

5109
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,430
hold this and if they can hold this they
can look for that rotation. My danger

5110
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:03,440
can look for that rotation. My danger
 

5111
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:04,870
can look for that rotation. My danger
would be that could be a two-legg like

5112
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:04,880
would be that could be a two-legg like
 

5113
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:06,229
would be that could be a two-legg like
this a two leg and if they want to

5114
02:12:06,229 --> 02:12:06,239
this a two leg and if they want to
 

5115
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:08,149
this a two leg and if they want to
resell this under here they come back

5116
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:08,159
resell this under here they come back
 

5117
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:09,910
resell this under here they come back
down for this again. I don't know how

5118
02:12:09,910 --> 02:12:09,920
down for this again. I don't know how
 

5119
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:11,510
down for this again. I don't know how
you're going to continue to play in a

5120
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:11,520
you're going to continue to play in a
 

5121
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:12,950
you're going to continue to play in a
tightening range. This is getting

5122
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:12,960
tightening range. This is getting
 

5123
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:22,950
tightening range. This is getting
smaller by the way not bigger.

5124
02:12:22,950 --> 02:12:22,960

 

5125
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:24,550

Like I've got no problem, guys. Like I

5126
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:24,560
Like I've got no problem, guys. Like I
 

5127
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,550
Like I've got no problem, guys. Like I
I'm I'm nicely green. It's the problem

5128
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:26,560
I'm I'm nicely green. It's the problem
 

5129
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:28,550
I'm I'm nicely green. It's the problem
is not being green. It's the fact that

5130
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:28,560
is not being green. It's the fact that
 

5131
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:32,629
is not being green. It's the fact that
I'm bored. Um I can't size in to

5132
02:12:32,629 --> 02:12:32,639
I'm bored. Um I can't size in to
 

5133
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:35,030
I'm bored. Um I can't size in to
anything.

5134
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:35,040
anything.
 

5135
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,990
anything.
It's not that I can't read it. It's that

5136
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:38,000
It's not that I can't read it. It's that
 

5137
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,910
It's not that I can't read it. It's that
if you ask me a market that I don't want

5138
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:39,920
if you ask me a market that I don't want
 

5139
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:42,149
if you ask me a market that I don't want
to trade, I will always tell you a

5140
02:12:42,149 --> 02:12:42,159
to trade, I will always tell you a
 

5141
02:12:42,159 --> 02:12:46,950
to trade, I will always tell you a
rotation. I don't like trading rotation

5142
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:46,960
rotation. I don't like trading rotation
 

5143
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:49,750
rotation. I don't like trading rotation
because for me I'm looking for 50 point

5144
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
because for me I'm looking for 50 point
 

5145

because for me I'm looking for 50 point
TP1 100 200 point bangers which means I

5146
02:12:52,709 --> 02:12:52,719
TP1 100 200 point bangers which means I
 

5147
02:12:52,719 --> 02:12:54,870
TP1 100 200 point bangers which means I
need to get out of a rotation to get

5148
02:12:54,870 --> 02:12:54,880
need to get out of a rotation to get
 

5149
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:57,189
need to get out of a rotation to get
that I need to get out of it. For

5150
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,199
that I need to get out of it. For
 

5151
02:12:57,199 --> 02:13:00,870
that I need to get out of it. For
example, if we leave value,

5152
02:13:00,870 --> 02:13:00,880
example, if we leave value,
 

5153
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:04,470
example, if we leave value,
right? If we if we trapped buyers here

5154
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:04,480
right? If we if we trapped buyers here
 

5155
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:06,069
right? If we if we trapped buyers here
and trapped some more here and came down

5156
02:13:06,069 --> 02:13:06,079
and trapped some more here and came down
 

5157
02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:08,390
and trapped some more here and came down
here and rejected this, right, where I

5158
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:08,400
here and rejected this, right, where I
 

5159
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:10,149
here and rejected this, right, where I
took that first position on and we came

5160
02:13:10,149 --> 02:13:10,159
took that first position on and we came
 

5161
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:12,069
took that first position on and we came
back down here and we rejected this,

5162
02:13:12,069 --> 02:13:12,079
back down here and we rejected this,
 

5163
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:13,910
back down here and we rejected this,
that would be my size in point. And then

5164
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:13,920
that would be my size in point. And then
 

5165
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:16,950
that would be my size in point. And then
I'm going, oh, wicked 100 points. Who

5166
02:13:16,950 --> 02:13:16,960
I'm going, oh, wicked 100 points. Who
 

5167
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:18,550
I'm going, oh, wicked 100 points. Who
knows? Maybe we get lucky and we come

5168
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:18,560
knows? Maybe we get lucky and we come
 

5169
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:23,270
knows? Maybe we get lucky and we come
down to previous week value area low.

5170
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:23,280
down to previous week value area low.
 

5171

down to previous week value area low.
All right, trend trade leaving volume

02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:25,280
All right, trend trade leaving volume
 

5173
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:29,030
All right, trend trade leaving volume
trapped. that for me that's my A+

5174
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:29,040
trapped. that for me that's my A+
 

5175
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:30,629
trapped. that for me that's my A+
that's what I want to trade I don't want

5176
02:13:30,629 --> 02:13:30,639
that's what I want to trade I don't want
 

5177
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:32,629
that's what I want to trade I don't want
to trade this man I don't want to become

5178
02:13:32,629 --> 02:13:32,639
to trade this man I don't want to become
 

5179
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:35,750
to trade this man I don't want to become
the volume I want to use people's pain I

5180
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:35,760
the volume I want to use people's pain I
 

5181
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,589
the volume I want to use people's pain I
don't want to become the volume so and

5182
02:13:37,589 --> 02:13:37,599
don't want to become the volume so and
 

5183
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:40,470
don't want to become the volume so and
that's why I had an attempt what did I

5184
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:40,480
that's why I had an attempt what did I
 

5185
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:43,270
that's why I had an attempt what did I
trade I traded this down to here

5186
02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:43,280
trade I traded this down to here
 

5187
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:46,470
trade I traded this down to here
and then I put one on here and we traded

5188
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:46,480
and then I put one on here and we traded
 

5189
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:48,069
and then I put one on here and we traded
away and came back and I was like no

5190
02:13:48,069 --> 02:13:48,079
away and came back and I was like no
 

5191
02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:49,830
away and came back and I was like no
done not going to hold that because if

5192
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:49,840
done not going to hold that because if
 

5193
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,189
done not going to hold that because if
they're going to squeeze through it like

5194
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:51,199
they're going to squeeze through it like
 

5195
02:13:51,199 --> 02:13:53,510
they're going to squeeze through it like
I said we come 60s reclaim 60s there's

5196
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:53,520
I said we come 60s reclaim 60s there's
 

5197
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:55,189
I said we come 60s reclaim 60s there's
your IB to VWOP trade so I don't want to

5198
02:13:55,189 --> 02:13:55,199
your IB to VWOP trade so I don't want to
 

5199
02:13:55,199 --> 02:14:04,229
your IB to VWOP trade so I don't want to
be the side of that.

5200
02:14:04,229 --> 02:14:04,239

 

5201
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:07,109

Exactly, Troy. That That is exactly my

5202
02:14:07,109 --> 02:14:07,119
Exactly, Troy. That That is exactly my
 

5203
02:14:07,119 --> 02:14:12,950
Exactly, Troy. That That is exactly my
point.

5204
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:12,960

 

5205
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,669

Croc [\h__\h] Did I say that? I do. It's

5206
02:14:15,669 --> 02:14:15,679
Croc [\h__\h] Did I say that? I do. It's
 

5207
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:16,950
Croc [\h__\h] Did I say that? I do. It's
very English thing to say. It's probably

5208
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:16,960
very English thing to say. It's probably
 

5209
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:19,750
very English thing to say. It's probably
what I said. Yay. I agree. Inferris that

5210
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:19,760
what I said. Yay. I agree. Inferris that
 

5211
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,750
what I said. Yay. I agree. Inferris that
December's been awful so far. I mean,

5212
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:21,760
December's been awful so far. I mean,
 

5213
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:25,589
December's been awful so far. I mean,
I'm I'm green, so I shouldn't complain.

5214
02:14:25,589 --> 02:14:25,599
I'm I'm green, so I shouldn't complain.
 

5215
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:28,069
I'm I'm green, so I shouldn't complain.
But it's been bad. I mean, let's have a

5216
02:14:28,069 --> 02:14:28,079
But it's been bad. I mean, let's have a
 

5217
02:14:28,079 --> 02:14:30,470
But it's been bad. I mean, let's have a
look at how we're looking on the higher

5218
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480
look at how we're looking on the higher
 

5219
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,470
look at how we're looking on the higher
time frames. Let's just let's just go

5220
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:32,480
time frames. Let's just let's just go
 

5221
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:34,709
time frames. Let's just let's just go
back. Let's take stock of where we are

5222
02:14:34,709 --> 02:14:34,719
back. Let's take stock of where we are
 

5223
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:37,030
back. Let's take stock of where we are
right now. Okay.

5224
02:14:37,030 --> 02:14:37,040
right now. Okay.
 

5225
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:42,229
right now. Okay.
This volume looks good, doesn't it?

5226
02:14:42,229 --> 02:14:42,239

 

5227
02:14:42,239 --> 02:14:43,990

I guarantee that this is not going to

5228
02:14:43,990 --> 02:14:44,000
I guarantee that this is not going to
 

5229
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,430
I guarantee that this is not going to
close higher than this. Not unless we

5230
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:45,440
close higher than this. Not unless we
 

5231
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:47,030
close higher than this. Not unless we
break out. All right. So, let's just

5232
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:47,040
break out. All right. So, let's just
 

5233
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,430
break out. All right. So, let's just
think about what the daily's done. Let's

5234
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:49,440
think about what the daily's done. Let's
 

5235
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:51,109
think about what the daily's done. Let's
think about the weekly model. We can

5236
02:14:51,109 --> 02:14:51,119
think about the weekly model. We can
 

5237
02:14:51,119 --> 02:14:55,830
think about the weekly model. We can
reset this. Uh here's your

5238
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:55,840
reset this. Uh here's your
 

5239
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:58,390
reset this. Uh here's your
Monday, Tuesday.

5240
02:14:58,390 --> 02:14:58,400
Monday, Tuesday.
 

5241
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:00,709
Monday, Tuesday.
There's I don't want to give away too

5242
02:15:00,709 --> 02:15:00,719
There's I don't want to give away too
 

5243
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:02,629
There's I don't want to give away too
much edge. Here's your weekly model for

5244
02:15:02,629 --> 02:15:02,639
much edge. Here's your weekly model for
 

5245
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:05,750
much edge. Here's your weekly model for
those who have done the course.

5246
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:05,760
those who have done the course.
 

5247
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:07,350
those who have done the course.
We're not getting outside of the weekly

5248
02:15:07,350 --> 02:15:07,360
We're not getting outside of the weekly
 

5249
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:09,910
We're not getting outside of the weekly
model. So, what are we going to do? Oh

5250
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:09,920
model. So, what are we going to do? Oh
 

5251
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:11,830
model. So, what are we going to do? Oh
god. You know what we're going to do? If

5252

god. You know what we're going to do? If
 

5253
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:14,229
god. You know what we're going to do? If
we can't get outside the weekly model,

5254
02:15:14,229 --> 02:15:14,239
we can't get outside the weekly model,
 

5255
02:15:14,239 --> 02:15:16,629
we can't get outside the weekly model,
we're going to get stuck. Monday low,

02:15:16,629 --> 02:15:16,639
we're going to get stuck. Monday low,
 

5257
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:19,430

We finally get a breakout, right? We're

5278
02:15:44,149 --> 02:15:44,159
We finally get a breakout, right? We're
 

5279

closing high. Well done. Tuesday.
Wednesday open, dip back down, hold the

5282
02:15:49,589 --> 02:15:49,599
Wednesday open, dip back down, hold the
 

5283
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:52,229
Wednesday open, dip back down, hold the
low. Would have liked to seen that sweep

5284
02:15:52,229 --> 02:15:52,239
low. Would have liked to seen that sweep
 

5285
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:55,750
low. Would have liked to seen that sweep
first, but close back inside. Okay, so

5286
02:15:55,750 --> 02:15:55,760
first, but close back inside. Okay, so
 

5287
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:57,669
first, but close back inside. Okay, so
we close inside. We peak above. So, it's

5288
02:15:57,669 --> 02:15:57,679
we close inside. We peak above. So, it's
 

5289
02:15:57,679 --> 02:15:59,830
we close inside. We peak above. So, it's
a look above and fail again. So, so far

5290
02:15:59,830 --> 02:15:59,840
a look above and fail again. So, so far
 

5291
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:02,550
a look above and fail again. So, so far
we've done a look above and a look below

5292
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:02,560
we've done a look above and a look below
 

5293
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:05,589
we've done a look above and a look below
and fail. A look above, a look above.

5294
02:16:05,589 --> 02:16:05,599
and fail. A look above, a look above.
 

5295
02:16:05,599 --> 02:16:07,830
and fail. A look above, a look above.
And guess what we're doing today? A look

5296
02:16:07,830 --> 02:16:07,840
And guess what we're doing today? A look
 

5297
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:10,149
And guess what we're doing today? A look
above and fail. What's that telling you

5298
02:16:10,149 --> 02:16:10,159
above and fail. What's that telling you
 

5299
02:16:10,159 --> 02:16:12,470
above and fail. What's that telling you
for me? that what this is telling me is

5300
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:12,480
for me? that what this is telling me is
 

5301
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:17,430
for me? that what this is telling me is
that as much as we're drifting higher

5302
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:17,440
that as much as we're drifting higher
 

5303
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:20,390
that as much as we're drifting higher
on declining volume, is that a good

5304
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:20,400
on declining volume, is that a good
 

5305
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,790
on declining volume, is that a good
thing? No, it's not a good thing. If we

5306
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:22,800
thing? No, it's not a good thing. If we
 

5307
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,709
thing? No, it's not a good thing. If we
keep looking above and failing but

5308
02:16:24,709 --> 02:16:24,719
keep looking above and failing but
 

5309
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:26,229
keep looking above and failing but
grinding higher, what's that telling

5310
02:16:26,229 --> 02:16:26,239
grinding higher, what's that telling
 

5311
02:16:26,239 --> 02:16:28,390
grinding higher, what's that telling
you? Means there's passive sellers up

5312
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:28,400
you? Means there's passive sellers up
 

5313
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:30,950
you? Means there's passive sellers up
here. It means if buyers were going to

5314
02:16:30,950 --> 02:16:30,960
here. It means if buyers were going to
 

5315
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:33,270
here. It means if buyers were going to
be really aggressive and step in this

5316
02:16:33,270 --> 02:16:33,280
be really aggressive and step in this
 

5317
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,030
be really aggressive and step in this
market, right? Then they should be

5318
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:35,040
market, right? Then they should be
 

5319
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,429
market, right? Then they should be
coming up here and smashing us higher,

5320
02:16:37,429 --> 02:16:37,439
coming up here and smashing us higher,
 

5321
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:39,429
coming up here and smashing us higher,
shouldn't they? They shouldn't be keep

5322
02:16:39,429 --> 02:16:39,439
shouldn't they? They shouldn't be keep
 

5323
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:41,830
shouldn't they? They shouldn't be keep
doing that and close and that and close

5324
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:41,840
doing that and close and that and close
 

5325
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:44,709
doing that and close and that and close
down and that and close down on a higher

5326
02:16:44,709 --> 02:16:44,719
down and that and close down on a higher
 

5327
02:16:44,719 --> 02:16:46,629
down and that and close down on a higher
time frame. That is not what you want

5328
02:16:46,629 --> 02:16:46,639
time frame. That is not what you want
 

5329
02:16:46,639 --> 02:16:48,150
time frame. That is not what you want
you would want to see if if you're

5330
02:16:48,150 --> 02:16:48,160
you would want to see if if you're
 

5331
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:50,549
you would want to see if if you're
looking for a continuation higher.

5332
02:16:50,549 --> 02:16:50,559
looking for a continuation higher.
 

5333
02:16:50,559 --> 02:16:52,070
looking for a continuation higher.
That's not what you'd want to see. Am I

5334
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:52,080
That's not what you'd want to see. Am I
 

5335
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:53,990
That's not what you'd want to see. Am I
surprised? No, because we've got an old

5336
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:54,000
surprised? No, because we've got an old
 

5337
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,429
surprised? No, because we've got an old
balance range here. Of course, I'm not

5338
02:16:55,429 --> 02:16:55,439
balance range here. Of course, I'm not
 

5339
02:16:55,439 --> 02:16:57,509
balance range here. Of course, I'm not
surprised to see that. What it tells me

5340
02:16:57,509 --> 02:16:57,519
surprised to see that. What it tells me
 

5341
02:16:57,519 --> 02:17:00,230
surprised to see that. What it tells me
then, stop bidding it here then buyers.

5342
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:00,240
then, stop bidding it here then buyers.
 

5343
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:03,990
then, stop bidding it here then buyers.
Let it come down to an area where maybe

5344
02:17:03,990 --> 02:17:04,000
Let it come down to an area where maybe
 

5345
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,750
Let it come down to an area where maybe
they're going to be interested in buying

5346
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:05,760
they're going to be interested in buying
 

5347
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,830
they're going to be interested in buying
more size and then we've got a better

5348
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:07,840
more size and then we've got a better
 

5349
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,669
more size and then we've got a better
shot at going upside. That's what I

5350
02:17:09,669 --> 02:17:09,679
shot at going upside. That's what I
 

5351
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:11,429
shot at going upside. That's what I
would like to see happen. That's what

5352
02:17:11,429 --> 02:17:11,439
would like to see happen. That's what
 

5353
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:13,190
would like to see happen. That's what
will fill me with confidence. If we can

5354
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:13,200
will fill me with confidence. If we can
 

5355
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:15,750
will fill me with confidence. If we can
come down and hold a bid down here and I

5356
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:15,760
come down and hold a bid down here and I
 

5357
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:17,910
come down and hold a bid down here and I
can see, you know, an increase in volume

5358
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:17,920
can see, you know, an increase in volume
 

5359
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:19,910
can see, you know, an increase in volume
down here and the next day we start

5360
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:19,920
down here and the next day we start
 

5361
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:21,750
down here and the next day we start
going up, then guess what? We're going

5362
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:21,760
going up, then guess what? We're going
 

5363
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:22,950
going up, then guess what? We're going
to come for these and we're going to

5364
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:22,960
to come for these and we're going to
 

5365
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:24,389
to come for these and we're going to
come for these. That's a much better

5366
02:17:24,389 --> 02:17:24,399
come for these. That's a much better
 

5367
02:17:24,399 --> 02:17:27,030
come for these. That's a much better
look. But at the moment, this incessant

5368
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:27,040
look. But at the moment, this incessant
 

5369
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,389
look. But at the moment, this incessant
grind but close back down is not good

5370
02:17:30,389 --> 02:17:30,399
grind but close back down is not good
 

5371
02:17:30,399 --> 02:17:32,389
grind but close back down is not good
look, folks. It's really not a good

5372
02:17:32,389 --> 02:17:32,399
look, folks. It's really not a good
 

5373
02:17:32,399 --> 02:17:34,870
look, folks. It's really not a good
look.

5374
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:34,880
look.
 

5375
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:36,309
look.
We have a look at the spiders. It's

5376
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:36,319
We have a look at the spiders. It's
 

5377
02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:40,950
We have a look at the spiders. It's
probably going to be even worse.

5378
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:40,960

 

5379
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:43,669

I mean, this is dreadful, guys. There's

5380
02:17:43,669 --> 02:17:43,679
I mean, this is dreadful, guys. There's
 

5381
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:45,429
I mean, this is dreadful, guys. There's
your box on the spiders. Those in

5382
02:17:45,429 --> 02:17:45,439
your box on the spiders. Those in
 

5383
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:47,349
your box on the spiders. Those in
Discord, we know we've talked about it.

5384
02:17:47,349 --> 02:17:47,359
Discord, we know we've talked about it.
 

5385
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:49,429
Discord, we know we've talked about it.
Look above yesterday, fail. Look above

5386
02:17:49,429 --> 02:17:49,439
Look above yesterday, fail. Look above
 

5387
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:50,950
Look above yesterday, fail. Look above
today, fail. We're just back down to

5388
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:50,960
today, fail. We're just back down to
 

5389
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:53,190
today, fail. We're just back down to
that same point, right? They should be.

5390
02:17:53,190 --> 02:17:53,200
that same point, right? They should be.
 

5391
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:54,629
that same point, right? They should be.
If they're really chomping at the bit

5392
02:17:54,629 --> 02:17:54,639
If they're really chomping at the bit
 

5393
02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:56,150
If they're really chomping at the bit
for alltime highs, why are they not

5394
02:17:56,150 --> 02:17:56,160
for alltime highs, why are they not
 

5395
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:59,750
for alltime highs, why are they not
bidding 83s to get us up there?

5396
02:17:59,750 --> 02:17:59,760
bidding 83s to get us up there?
 

5397
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:03,270
bidding 83s to get us up there?
Yeah, that's how I see it. Why are we

5398
02:18:03,270 --> 02:18:03,280
Yeah, that's how I see it. Why are we
 

5399
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:06,389
Yeah, that's how I see it. Why are we
not if if we're going alltime highs, if

5400
02:18:06,389 --> 02:18:06,399
not if if we're going alltime highs, if
 

5401
02:18:06,399 --> 02:18:08,790
not if if we're going alltime highs, if
they've spent 1, two, three, four, five

5402
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:08,800
they've spent 1, two, three, four, five
 

5403
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,629
they've spent 1, two, three, four, five
days building out this sort of range

5404
02:18:10,629 --> 02:18:10,639
days building out this sort of range
 

5405
02:18:10,639 --> 02:18:12,790
days building out this sort of range
here, you can clearly see we're pinned

5406
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:12,800
here, you can clearly see we're pinned
 

5407
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:15,270
here, you can clearly see we're pinned
in. Why are you not holding the top of

5408
02:18:15,270 --> 02:18:15,280
in. Why are you not holding the top of
 

5409
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:18,070
in. Why are you not holding the top of
this range, 84s, 83s, whatever you want

5410
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:18,080
this range, 84s, 83s, whatever you want
 

5411
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:19,990
this range, 84s, 83s, whatever you want
to call it, for that move to fill this

5412
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:20,000
to call it, for that move to fill this
 

5413
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,870
to call it, for that move to fill this
gap and get to alltime highs? Why not do

5414
02:18:22,870 --> 02:18:22,880
gap and get to alltime highs? Why not do
 

5415
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:24,790
gap and get to alltime highs? Why not do
that?

5416
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:24,800
that?
 

5417
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:28,230
that?
Because all they want to do is trap 85

5418
02:18:28,230 --> 02:18:28,240
Because all they want to do is trap 85
 

5419
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:30,549
Because all they want to do is trap 85
to 80 right now. Well, today it's 82.

5420
02:18:30,549 --> 02:18:30,559
to 80 right now. Well, today it's 82.
 

5421
02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:32,309
to 80 right now. Well, today it's 82.
Where's 82? There you go. So, we move

5422
02:18:32,309 --> 02:18:32,319
Where's 82? There you go. So, we move
 

5423
02:18:32,319 --> 02:18:36,070
Where's 82? There you go. So, we move
gamma up from 80 to 82 and we can't get

5424
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:36,080
gamma up from 80 to 82 and we can't get
 

5425
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:38,309
gamma up from 80 to 82 and we can't get
through 85. So, they're going to do this

5426
02:18:38,309 --> 02:18:38,319
through 85. So, they're going to do this
 

5427
02:18:38,319 --> 02:18:42,150
through 85. So, they're going to do this
again. What happens if we do this long

5428
02:18:42,150 --> 02:18:42,160
again. What happens if we do this long
 

5429
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,549
again. What happens if we do this long
enough and then we come under here? I

5430
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:44,559
enough and then we come under here? I
 

5431
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:46,950
enough and then we come under here? I
tell you what happens. That happens. And

5432
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:46,960
tell you what happens. That happens. And
 

5433
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:49,030
tell you what happens. That happens. And
that's my worry right now. And that's

5434
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:49,040
that's my worry right now. And that's
 

5435
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:51,830
that's my worry right now. And that's
also anyone with any common senses worry

5436
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:51,840
also anyone with any common senses worry
 

5437
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:53,910
also anyone with any common senses worry
is that if you're going to build a range

5438
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:53,920
is that if you're going to build a range
 

5439
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:55,509
is that if you're going to build a range
here for this long and you had the

5440
02:18:55,509 --> 02:18:55,519
here for this long and you had the
 

5441
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:58,150
here for this long and you had the
opportunity to go higher and you're not,

5442
02:18:58,150 --> 02:18:58,160
opportunity to go higher and you're not,
 

5443
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:00,230
opportunity to go higher and you're not,
that tells me that it probably is going

5444
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:00,240
that tells me that it probably is going
 

5445
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:02,389
that tells me that it probably is going
to go lower.

5446
02:19:02,389 --> 02:19:02,399
to go lower.
 

5447
02:19:02,399 --> 02:19:04,629
to go lower.
So that I'd say how we close this week

5448
02:19:04,629 --> 02:19:04,639
So that I'd say how we close this week
 

5449
02:19:04,639 --> 02:19:06,709
So that I'd say how we close this week
is going to matter. It's going to really

5450
02:19:06,709 --> 02:19:06,719
is going to matter. It's going to really
 

5451
02:19:06,719 --> 02:19:13,830
is going to matter. It's going to really
matter if we go to a weekly chart.

5452
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:13,840

 

5453
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:16,389

If we close

5454
02:19:16,389 --> 02:19:16,399
If we close
 

5455
02:19:16,399 --> 02:19:18,629
If we close
under this, that's a look above again.

5456
02:19:18,629 --> 02:19:18,639
under this, that's a look above again.
 

5457
02:19:18,639 --> 02:19:19,589
under this, that's a look above again.
Everyone's going to go, it's really

5458
02:19:19,589 --> 02:19:19,599
Everyone's going to go, it's really
 

5459
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:21,190
Everyone's going to go, it's really
bullish.

5460
02:19:21,190 --> 02:19:21,200
bullish.
 

5461
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:22,389
bullish.
We're probably going to come back down

5462
02:19:22,389 --> 02:19:22,399
We're probably going to come back down
 

5463
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:24,870
We're probably going to come back down
and revisit this.

5464
02:19:24,870 --> 02:19:24,880
and revisit this.
 

5465
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:26,870
and revisit this.
It's messy. It's definitely messy. And

5466
02:19:26,870 --> 02:19:26,880
It's messy. It's definitely messy. And
 

5467
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:28,070
It's messy. It's definitely messy. And
really, if you want to if you want to

5468
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,080
really, if you want to if you want to
 

5469
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:29,429
really, if you want to if you want to
make it really simple, we've been pinned

5470
02:19:29,429 --> 02:19:29,439
make it really simple, we've been pinned
 

5471
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:32,629
make it really simple, we've been pinned
in since se September.

5472
02:19:32,629 --> 02:19:32,639
in since se September.
 

5473
02:19:32,639 --> 02:19:34,230
in since se September.
We've been pinned in since September,

5474
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:34,240
We've been pinned in since September,
 

5475
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:35,990
We've been pinned in since September,
really.

5476
02:19:35,990 --> 02:19:36,000
really.
 

5477
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,469
really.
And tops, all right, tops take a long

5478
02:19:38,469 --> 02:19:38,479
And tops, all right, tops take a long
 

5479
02:19:38,479 --> 02:19:41,110
And tops, all right, tops take a long
time to form. If this is going to be a

5480
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:41,120
time to form. If this is going to be a
 

5481
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,549
time to form. If this is going to be a
top, I'm not saying it is going to be a

5482
02:19:42,549 --> 02:19:42,559
top, I'm not saying it is going to be a
 

5483
02:19:42,559 --> 02:19:45,030
top, I'm not saying it is going to be a
top, but if we get under here again,

5484
02:19:45,030 --> 02:19:45,040
top, but if we get under here again,
 

5485
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:46,790
top, but if we get under here again,
you're going to have months then of

5486
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:46,800
you're going to have months then of
 

5487
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:49,590
you're going to have months then of
trapped volume and that rotation back to

5488
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:49,600
trapped volume and that rotation back to
 

5489
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:52,150
trapped volume and that rotation back to
the 200 becomes highly, highly probable.

5490
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:52,160
the 200 becomes highly, highly probable.
 

5491
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:54,870
the 200 becomes highly, highly probable.
And you'll see, look how long tops take

5492
02:19:54,870 --> 02:19:54,880
And you'll see, look how long tops take
 

5493
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:57,349
And you'll see, look how long tops take
to form,

5494
02:19:57,349 --> 02:19:57,359
to form,
 

5495
02:19:57,359 --> 02:19:59,750
to form,
right? It takes a long time. This looks

5496
02:19:59,750 --> 02:19:59,760
right? It takes a long time. This looks
 

5497
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:01,349
right? It takes a long time. This looks
familiar, doesn't it? What happens when

5498
02:20:01,349 --> 02:20:01,359
familiar, doesn't it? What happens when
 

5499
02:20:01,359 --> 02:20:04,309
familiar, doesn't it? What happens when
we break down, retest, big flush, right?

5500
02:20:04,309 --> 02:20:04,319
we break down, retest, big flush, right?
 

5501
02:20:04,319 --> 02:20:08,870
we break down, retest, big flush, right?
Let's find some more.

5502
02:20:08,870 --> 02:20:08,880

 

5503
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:12,389

Long time to form

5504
02:20:12,389 --> 02:20:12,399
Long time to form
 

5505
02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:15,349
Long time to form
retest. Retest move away from it. Right?

5506
02:20:15,349 --> 02:20:15,359
retest. Retest move away from it. Right?
 

5507
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:18,070
retest. Retest move away from it. Right?
They don't happen. Okay. They happen

5508
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:18,080
They don't happen. Okay. They happen
 

5509
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:19,990
They don't happen. Okay. They happen
quick here, but that was unprecedented

5510
02:20:19,990 --> 02:20:20,000
quick here, but that was unprecedented
 

5511
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,429
quick here, but that was unprecedented
events. That was COVID. It's a little

5512
02:20:21,429 --> 02:20:21,439
events. That was COVID. It's a little
 

5513
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:23,110
events. That was COVID. It's a little
bit different. Right? So, that's what

5514
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:23,120
bit different. Right? So, that's what
 

5515
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:24,630
bit different. Right? So, that's what
I'm concerned about when I look at the

5516
02:20:24,630 --> 02:20:24,640
I'm concerned about when I look at the
 

5517
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:26,389
I'm concerned about when I look at the
charts. If we're not moving higher,

5518
02:20:26,389 --> 02:20:26,399
charts. If we're not moving higher,
 

5519
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:27,590
charts. If we're not moving higher,
there's a reason we're not moving

5520
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:27,600
there's a reason we're not moving
 

5521
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:31,110
there's a reason we're not moving
higher. That's all I'm going to say.

5522
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:31,120
higher. That's all I'm going to say.
 

5523
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:33,030
higher. That's all I'm going to say.
That's my two cent anyway. That's what

5524
02:20:33,030 --> 02:20:33,040
That's my two cent anyway. That's what
 

5525
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,389
That's my two cent anyway. That's what
concerns me at the market. That's why

5526
02:20:34,389 --> 02:20:34,399
concerns me at the market. That's why
 

5527
02:20:34,399 --> 02:20:36,230
concerns me at the market. That's why
I'm not swinging long any new money

5528
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:36,240
I'm not swinging long any new money
 

5529
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:43,590
I'm not swinging long any new money
positions right now. It's for a reason.

5530
02:20:43,590 --> 02:20:43,600

 

5531
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:45,429

Affordable indicators. I think it's

5532
02:20:45,429 --> 02:20:45,439
Affordable indicators. I think it's
 

5533
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:50,400
Affordable indicators. I think it's
should just be FCT. Um,

5534
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:50,410

 

5535
02:20:50,410 --> 02:20:57,349

[Music]

5536
02:20:57,349 --> 02:20:57,359

 

5537
02:20:57,359 --> 02:21:16,870

I'll post it in chat view.

5538
02:21:16,870 --> 02:21:16,880

 

5539
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:19,030

There you go. That's your affordable

5540
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:19,040
There you go. That's your affordable
 

5541
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,429
There you go. That's your affordable
indicators code should work with that.

5542
02:21:21,429 --> 02:21:21,439
indicators code should work with that.
 

5543
02:21:21,439 --> 02:21:25,670
indicators code should work with that.
But it should be FCT.

5544
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:25,680

 

5545
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:32,150

Oh my god, more people reaching out.

5546
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:32,160

 

5547
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:33,830

some dodgy prop firms out there right

5548
02:21:33,830 --> 02:21:33,840
some dodgy prop firms out there right
 

5549
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:36,469
some dodgy prop firms out there right
now.

5550
02:21:36,469 --> 02:21:36,479
now.
 

5551
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:38,550
now.
Okay, so still reclaiming here again.

5552
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:38,560
Okay, so still reclaiming here again.
 

5553
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,550
Okay, so still reclaiming here again.
I'm not touching this. I've absolutely

5554
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:40,560
I'm not touching this. I've absolutely
 

5555
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,070
I'm not touching this. I've absolutely
promised myself I'm not going to touch a

5556
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:42,080
promised myself I'm not going to touch a
 

5557
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:43,910
promised myself I'm not going to touch a
rotation. You guys, if you like

5558
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:43,920
rotation. You guys, if you like
 

5559
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:46,150
rotation. You guys, if you like
rotation, you should by all means take

5560
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:46,160
rotation, you should by all means take
 

5561
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:47,670
rotation, you should by all means take
this. This is like yesterday and the day

5562
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:47,680
this. This is like yesterday and the day
 

5563
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:49,670
this. This is like yesterday and the day
before. I'm I just don't want to touch a

5564
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:49,680
before. I'm I just don't want to touch a
 

5565
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:51,190
before. I'm I just don't want to touch a
rotation. I've made my money. If I've

5566
02:21:51,190 --> 02:21:51,200
rotation. I've made my money. If I've
 

5567
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:53,190
rotation. I've made my money. If I've
made my money, I'm even less inclined to

5568
02:21:53,190 --> 02:21:53,200
made my money, I'm even less inclined to
 

5569
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:56,950
made my money, I'm even less inclined to
do anything with it.

5570
02:21:56,950 --> 02:21:56,960

 

5571
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:58,550

We can have a look at what's going on in

5572
02:21:58,550 --> 02:21:58,560
We can have a look at what's going on in
 

5573
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,230
We can have a look at what's going on in
the broader market if you want. Let's

5574
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:00,240
the broader market if you want. Let's
 

5575
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:02,070
the broader market if you want. Let's
move this to a five minute. See how

5576
02:22:02,070 --> 02:22:02,080
move this to a five minute. See how
 

5577
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:09,429
move this to a five minute. See how
we're doing. ES.

5578
02:22:09,429 --> 02:22:09,439

 

5579
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:11,750

Okay. Just stuck. Same kind of story.

5580
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:11,760
Okay. Just stuck. Same kind of story.
 

5581
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:13,110
Okay. Just stuck. Same kind of story.
All right. There's your divergence

5582
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:13,120
All right. There's your divergence
 

5583
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:15,110
All right. There's your divergence
though. Didn't make a new low when ENQ

5584
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:15,120
though. Didn't make a new low when ENQ
 

5585
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:17,190
though. Didn't make a new low when ENQ
did. Coming back to VWOP. So, IB to

5586
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:17,200
did. Coming back to VWOP. So, IB to
 

5587
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,670
did. Coming back to VWOP. So, IB to
VWOUP trade. It's got to get back above

5588
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:19,680
VWOUP trade. It's got to get back above
 

5589
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:22,950
VWOUP trade. It's got to get back above
PDC uh to have a chance of completing

5590
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:22,960
PDC uh to have a chance of completing
 

5591
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:24,630
PDC uh to have a chance of completing
that rotation. We're not seeing that at

5592
02:22:24,630 --> 02:22:24,640
that rotation. We're not seeing that at
 

5593
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:26,790
that rotation. We're not seeing that at
the moment. Let's have a look at gold.

5594
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:26,800
the moment. Let's have a look at gold.
 

5595
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,790
the moment. Let's have a look at gold.
Nice drive. Is it following silver? Is

5596
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:28,800
Nice drive. Is it following silver? Is
 

5597
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:32,469
Nice drive. Is it following silver? Is
it starting to reclaim everything?

5598
02:22:32,469 --> 02:22:32,479
it starting to reclaim everything?
 

5599
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:35,429
it starting to reclaim everything?
Not yet.

5600
02:22:35,429 --> 02:22:35,439
Not yet.
 

5601
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:37,750
Not yet.
Not yet. Still can't get through that

5602
02:22:37,750 --> 02:22:37,760
Not yet. Still can't get through that
 

5603
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:42,630
Not yet. Still can't get through that
supply. Uh let's have a look at the mag.

5604
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:42,640

 

5605
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:43,990

Okay. So, you can see this level we

5606
02:22:43,990 --> 02:22:44,000
Okay. So, you can see this level we
 

5607
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,510
Okay. So, you can see this level we
talked about this morning on Apple. We

5608
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:45,520
talked about this morning on Apple. We
 

5609
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:47,590
talked about this morning on Apple. We
said 82 break. It's going to be in

5610
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:47,600
said 82 break. It's going to be in
 

5611
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:48,870
said 82 break. It's going to be in
trouble. That's where we set the price

5612
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:48,880
trouble. That's where we set the price
 

5613
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:51,110
trouble. That's where we set the price
alert this morning. Why? Because this

5614
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:51,120
alert this morning. Why? Because this
 

5615
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:53,910
alert this morning. Why? Because this
was your shelf.

5616
02:22:53,910 --> 02:22:53,920
was your shelf.
 

5617
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:56,710
was your shelf.
Okay, so this is your classic failure

5618
02:22:56,710 --> 02:22:56,720
Okay, so this is your classic failure
 

5619
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:59,429
Okay, so this is your classic failure
pattern up here. Right, there's your

5620
02:22:59,429 --> 02:22:59,439
pattern up here. Right, there's your
 

5621
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:01,830
pattern up here. Right, there's your
fail. Fails to hold this base. We trade

5622
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:01,840
fail. Fails to hold this base. We trade
 

5623
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:03,750
fail. Fails to hold this base. We trade
under it. It's got a last chance saloon

5624
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:03,760
under it. It's got a last chance saloon
 

5625
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:06,469
under it. It's got a last chance saloon
right here in 82. It fails 82. And like

5626
02:23:06,469 --> 02:23:06,479
right here in 82. It fails 82. And like
 

5627
02:23:06,479 --> 02:23:08,230
right here in 82. It fails 82. And like
you can see this level we put in here.

5628
02:23:08,230 --> 02:23:08,240
you can see this level we put in here.
 

5629
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:09,670
you can see this level we put in here.
So it probably is going to come down to

5630
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:09,680
So it probably is going to come down to
 

5631
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:11,270
So it probably is going to come down to
78s. Now this is the market we talked

5632
02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:11,280
78s. Now this is the market we talked
 

5633
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:12,950
78s. Now this is the market we talked
about pre this is the level we talked

5634
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:12,960
about pre this is the level we talked
 

5635
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:15,349
about pre this is the level we talked
about premarket. Lose 82, you're

5636
02:23:15,349 --> 02:23:15,359
about premarket. Lose 82, you're
 

5637
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:17,190
about premarket. Lose 82, you're
probably coming back into these 78s. All

5638
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:17,200
probably coming back into these 78s. All
 

5639
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:19,670
probably coming back into these 78s. All
right. And if we trade sideways there,

5640
02:23:19,670 --> 02:23:19,680
right. And if we trade sideways there,
 

5641
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,309
right. And if we trade sideways there,
it's a bigger problem. All right. So

5642
02:23:22,309 --> 02:23:22,319
it's a bigger problem. All right. So
 

5643
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:24,230
it's a bigger problem. All right. So
understand like this is sentiment of

5644
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:24,240
understand like this is sentiment of
 

5645
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:25,830
understand like this is sentiment of
whole market right now. If we trade

5646
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:25,840
whole market right now. If we trade
 

5647
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:28,870
whole market right now. If we trade
sideways here, all right, after a big

5648
02:23:28,870 --> 02:23:28,880
sideways here, all right, after a big
 

5649
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:31,110
sideways here, all right, after a big
squeeze, we're opening that up, aren't

5650
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:31,120
squeeze, we're opening that up, aren't
 

5651
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:34,950
squeeze, we're opening that up, aren't
we? All right, so if you want to be

5652
02:23:34,950 --> 02:23:34,960
we? All right, so if you want to be
 

5653
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:37,510
we? All right, so if you want to be
bullish, you need 78s to hold and you

5654
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:37,520
bullish, you need 78s to hold and you
 

5655
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:41,510
bullish, you need 78s to hold and you
need reclaims of of uh 82s. All right,

5656
02:23:41,510 --> 02:23:41,520
need reclaims of of uh 82s. All right,
 

5657
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:44,389
need reclaims of of uh 82s. All right,
Amazon

5658
02:23:44,389 --> 02:23:44,399
Amazon
 

5659
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:47,030
Amazon
weak as well. All right, so selling off,

5660
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,040
weak as well. All right, so selling off,
 

5661
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,270
weak as well. All right, so selling off,
never reclaiming, trading near and

5662
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:49,280
never reclaiming, trading near and
 

5663
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:52,309
never reclaiming, trading near and
around the lows of day.

5664
02:23:52,309 --> 02:23:52,319
around the lows of day.
 

5665
02:23:52,319 --> 02:23:53,750
around the lows of day.
This doesn't look very pretty. It's

5666
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:53,760
This doesn't look very pretty. It's
 

5667
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:55,349
This doesn't look very pretty. It's
underneath initial balance. So, this is

5668
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:55,359
underneath initial balance. So, this is
 

5669
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:57,110
underneath initial balance. So, this is
showing you text heavy, but we are into

5670
02:23:57,110 --> 02:23:57,120
showing you text heavy, but we are into
 

5671
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:59,510
showing you text heavy, but we are into
an old rotation. You can see here, this

5672
02:23:59,510 --> 02:23:59,520
an old rotation. You can see here, this
 

5673
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,590
an old rotation. You can see here, this
is where they sold from reclaim. This is

5674
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:01,600
is where they sold from reclaim. This is
 

5675
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:04,790
is where they sold from reclaim. This is
your RBS zone. So, I'd say Amazon 27s

5676
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:04,800
your RBS zone. So, I'd say Amazon 27s
 

5677
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:07,349
your RBS zone. So, I'd say Amazon 27s
down to 23s will now be your area of

5678
02:24:07,349 --> 02:24:07,359
down to 23s will now be your area of
 

5679
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:08,870
down to 23s will now be your area of
rotation. This is why it's trying to

5680
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:08,880
rotation. This is why it's trying to
 

5681
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:10,630
rotation. This is why it's trying to
find a bid here around 27s. There you

5682
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:10,640
find a bid here around 27s. There you
 

5683
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:13,190
find a bid here around 27s. There you
go. So, just structural. So, if you want

5684
02:24:13,190 --> 02:24:13,200
go. So, just structural. So, if you want
 

5685
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,870
go. So, just structural. So, if you want
to see how I play these swings and what

5686
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:14,880
to see how I play these swings and what
 

5687
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:16,790
to see how I play these swings and what
I look at, this is what I look at. All

5688
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:16,800
I look at, this is what I look at. All
 

5689
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,429
I look at, this is what I look at. All
right. Goo falling off a cliff. All

5690
02:24:19,429 --> 02:24:19,439
right. Goo falling off a cliff. All
 

5691
02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:21,990
right. Goo falling off a cliff. All
right. huge drive yesterday. They just

5692
02:24:21,990 --> 02:24:22,000
right. huge drive yesterday. They just
 

5693
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,510
right. huge drive yesterday. They just
said no more. Thanks very much. And

5694
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:23,520
said no more. Thanks very much. And
 

5695
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:26,070
said no more. Thanks very much. And
we're coming back to reality. All right.

5696
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:26,080
we're coming back to reality. All right.
 

5697
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:28,230
we're coming back to reality. All right.
So, can it find a bid here again? If it

5698
02:24:28,230 --> 02:24:28,240
So, can it find a bid here again? If it
 

5699
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:30,790
So, can it find a bid here again? If it
starts losing this bid, what will this

5700
02:24:30,790 --> 02:24:30,800
starts losing this bid, what will this
 

5701
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:32,870
starts losing this bid, what will this
be? There's your peak. Failed to

5702
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:32,880
be? There's your peak. Failed to
 

5703
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:35,750
be? There's your peak. Failed to
reclaim. Failed to reclaim. There's your

5704
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:35,760
reclaim. Failed to reclaim. There's your
 

5705
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:37,750
reclaim. Failed to reclaim. There's your
bull trap. There's your squeeze under

5706
02:24:37,750 --> 02:24:37,760
bull trap. There's your squeeze under
 

5707
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:39,510
bull trap. There's your squeeze under
here. You're going to get a lack of

02:24:39,510 --> 02:24:39,520
here. You're going to get a lack of
 

5709
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:41,110
here. You're going to get a lack of
structure for a move back down to the

02:24:41,110 --> 02:24:41,120
structure for a move back down to the
 

5711
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:44,389
structure for a move back down to the
low 300s possible. So far, I'm not

5712
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:44,399
low 300s possible. So far, I'm not
 

5713
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:46,630
low 300s possible. So far, I'm not
seeing anything in tech which is filling

5714
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:46,640
seeing anything in tech which is filling
 

5715
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,790
seeing anything in tech which is filling
me with confidence. Meta. All right.

5716
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:48,800
me with confidence. Meta. All right.
 

5717
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:50,790
me with confidence. Meta. All right.
This is also not great. It's probably

5718
02:24:50,790 --> 02:24:50,800
This is also not great. It's probably
 

5719
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:53,910
This is also not great. It's probably
holding a 50%. Let's just have a look.

5720
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:53,920
holding a 50%. Let's just have a look.
 

5721
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,670
holding a 50%. Let's just have a look.

you can do with that. That's a leave

5730
02:25:04,790 --> 02:25:04,800
you can do with that. That's a leave
 

5731
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:06,870
you can do with that. That's a leave
alone and wait and see what happens

5732
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:06,880
alone and wait and see what happens
 

5733
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:08,950
alone and wait and see what happens
tomorrow. Obviously, I'm long from the

5735
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:12,870

I remember when I got long. I did put it

5740
02:25:18,630 --> 02:25:18,640
I remember when I got long. I did put it
 

5741
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:20,469
I remember when I got long. I did put it
in Discord for everyone. Let's have a

5742
02:25:20,469 --> 02:25:20,479
in Discord for everyone. Let's have a
 

5743
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:28,550
in Discord for everyone. Let's have a
look. When did I get long?

5744
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:28,560

 

5745
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:31,030

Here you go. So 19th. So I've been long

5746
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:31,040
Here you go. So 19th. So I've been long
 

5747
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:33,670
Here you go. So 19th. So I've been long
since the 19th of November. I put feeler

5748
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:33,680
since the 19th of November. I put feeler
 

5749
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:36,550
since the 19th of November. I put feeler
on today. Super light. Right. So one of

5750
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:36,560
on today. Super light. Right. So one of
 

5751
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:38,309
on today. Super light. Right. So one of
the advantages being in the Discord, I

5752
02:25:38,309 --> 02:25:38,319
the advantages being in the Discord, I
 

5753
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:40,790
the advantages being in the Discord, I
always say if I'm getting into a swing

5754
02:25:40,790 --> 02:25:40,800
always say if I'm getting into a swing
 

5755
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:42,790
always say if I'm getting into a swing
position. So there you go. So, even if

5756
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:42,800
position. So there you go. So, even if
 

5757
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:45,910
position. So there you go. So, even if
you joined me on that from 580s,

5758
02:25:45,910 --> 02:25:45,920
you joined me on that from 580s,
 

5759
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:48,550
you joined me on that from 580s,
well, we were up over $100 a share this

5760
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:48,560
well, we were up over $100 a share this
 

5761
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:50,469
well, we were up over $100 a share this
morning and we're still up pretty good.

5762
02:25:50,469 --> 02:25:50,479
morning and we're still up pretty good.
 

5763
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:55,270
morning and we're still up pretty good.
We're up uh $85 a share. Very good. I'm

5764
02:25:55,270 --> 02:25:55,280
We're up uh $85 a share. Very good. I'm
 

5765
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:56,710
We're up uh $85 a share. Very good. I'm
not sized in though. Like I said, not

5766
02:25:56,710 --> 02:25:56,720
not sized in though. Like I said, not
 

5767
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:58,950
not sized in though. Like I said, not
sized in, but I felt like, if you want

5768
02:25:58,950 --> 02:25:58,960
sized in, but I felt like, if you want
 

5769
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:02,469
sized in, but I felt like, if you want
to know why, when we came down here,

5770
02:26:02,469 --> 02:26:02,479
to know why, when we came down here,
 

5771
02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:04,790
to know why, when we came down here,
for me, we were cheap versus the market.

5772
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:04,800
for me, we were cheap versus the market.
 

5773
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:08,469
for me, we were cheap versus the market.
All right, there's our pivot in April.

5774
02:26:08,469 --> 02:26:08,479
All right, there's our pivot in April.
 

5775
02:26:08,479 --> 02:26:10,550
All right, there's our pivot in April.
There's our peak formation. There's the

5776
02:26:10,550 --> 02:26:10,560
There's our peak formation. There's the
 

5777
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:12,630
There's our peak formation. There's the
pullback. This meant made sense to me

5778
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:12,640
pullback. This meant made sense to me
 

5779
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:15,190
pullback. This meant made sense to me
for at least a bounce right into the 61

5780
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:15,200
for at least a bounce right into the 61
 

5781
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:17,670
for at least a bounce right into the 61
at least a bounce which we've done right

5782
02:26:17,670 --> 02:26:17,680
at least a bounce which we've done right
 

5783
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:19,750
at least a bounce which we've done right
then we got stuck today in the gap. Now

5784
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:19,760
then we got stuck today in the gap. Now
 

5785
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:22,710
then we got stuck today in the gap. Now
the other thing is we're moving Meta's

5786
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:22,720
the other thing is we're moving Meta's
 

5787
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:27,270
the other thing is we're moving Meta's

nice earnings report because it's going
 

5797
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,230
nice earnings report because it's going
to drastically reduce the costs and if I

5798

to drastically reduce the costs and if I
 

5799
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:40,150
to drastically reduce the costs and if I
can get that gap fill if the market does

5800

can get that gap fill if the market does
 

5801
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:41,590

to make what $170 a share So,
 

5809

change there at all. Nvidia, it's trying

5818
02:27:01,349 --> 02:27:01,359
change there at all. Nvidia, it's trying
 

5819
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:03,270
change there at all. Nvidia, it's trying
to get going.

5820
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:03,280
to get going.
 

5821
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:04,950
to get going.
It's trying to get going. That's a good

5822
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:04,960
It's trying to get going. That's a good
 

5823
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:07,510
It's trying to get going. That's a good
thing to see. Maybe it wake this market

5824
02:27:07,510 --> 02:27:07,520
thing to see. Maybe it wake this market
 

5825
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:10,469
thing to see. Maybe it wake this market
up. Right. There's your channel. There's

5826
02:27:10,469 --> 02:27:10,479
up. Right. There's your channel. There's
 

5827
02:27:10,479 --> 02:27:13,030
up. Right. There's your channel. There's
the hold. Nvidia. If we can hold

5828
02:27:13,030 --> 02:27:13,040
the hold. Nvidia. If we can hold
 

5829
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,790
the hold. Nvidia. If we can hold
pullbacks and start getting back through

5830
02:27:14,790 --> 02:27:14,800
pullbacks and start getting back through
 

5831
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:16,550
pullbacks and start getting back through
these, we can get back into this old

5832
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:16,560
these, we can get back into this old
 

5833
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:19,030
these, we can get back into this old
range. Right, we're still in a range. We

5834
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:19,040
range. Right, we're still in a range. We
 

5835
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:21,590
range. Right, we're still in a range. We
can get back into this old range here.

5836
02:27:21,590 --> 02:27:21,600
can get back into this old range here.
 

5837
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:23,590
can get back into this old range here.
And then through 190s, we've got a shot

5838
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:23,600
And then through 190s, we've got a shot
 

5839
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:25,270
And then through 190s, we've got a shot
of those 200s and highs again. So,

5840
02:27:25,270 --> 02:27:25,280
of those 200s and highs again. So,
 

5841
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:28,630
of those 200s and highs again. So,
Nvidia's trying to find a bid.

5842
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:28,640
Nvidia's trying to find a bid.
 

5843
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,150
Nvidia's trying to find a bid.
Tesla

5844
02:27:30,150 --> 02:27:30,160
Tesla
 

5845
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:31,910
Tesla
looks like it's flat. Yeah, just at the

5846
02:27:31,910 --> 02:27:31,920
looks like it's flat. Yeah, just at the
 

5847
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:34,230
looks like it's flat. Yeah, just at the
New York open. All right. So, that's why

5848
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:34,240
New York open. All right. So, that's why
 

5849
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:36,150
New York open. All right. So, that's why
market's not really doing much. You can

5850
02:27:36,150 --> 02:27:36,160
market's not really doing much. You can
 

5851
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:38,550
market's not really doing much. You can
look a bit outside. Oracle, this thing's

5852
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:38,560
look a bit outside. Oracle, this thing's
 

5853
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:40,710
look a bit outside. Oracle, this thing's
not looking good debtwise. I was tempted

5854
02:27:40,710 --> 02:27:40,720
not looking good debtwise. I was tempted
 

5855
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:42,870
not looking good debtwise. I was tempted
to take a long into this a couple days

5856
02:27:42,870 --> 02:27:42,880
to take a long into this a couple days
 

5857
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:44,630
to take a long into this a couple days
ago, but I looked at the balance sheet

5858
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:44,640
ago, but I looked at the balance sheet
 

5859
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:47,590
ago, but I looked at the balance sheet
and it's not looking great.

5860
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:47,600
and it's not looking great.
 

5861
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:49,510
and it's not looking great.
They might have a debt problem here on

5862
02:27:49,510 --> 02:27:49,520
They might have a debt problem here on
 

5863
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:51,190
They might have a debt problem here on
Oracle. Though maybe the Fed come out

5864
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,200
Oracle. Though maybe the Fed come out
 

5865
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,790
Oracle. Though maybe the Fed come out
and say that I think we're still going

5866
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:52,800
and say that I think we're still going
 

5867
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:55,030
and say that I think we're still going
to see weakness for a gap fill into 170

5868
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:55,040
to see weakness for a gap fill into 170
 

5869
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:56,710
to see weakness for a gap fill into 170
here. So that's why I haven't bid on

5870
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:56,720
here. So that's why I haven't bid on
 

5871
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:01,429
here. So that's why I haven't bid on
that. Um AMD, I'm still long from 158.

5872
02:28:01,429 --> 02:28:01,439
that. Um AMD, I'm still long from 158.
 

5873
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:04,950
that. Um AMD, I'm still long from 158.
Still long from here, but I sold 80% of

5874
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:04,960
Still long from here, but I sold 80% of
 

5875
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:08,230
Still long from here, but I sold 80% of
it up here.

5876
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,240
it up here.
 

5877
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:10,389
it up here.
That's it.

5878
02:28:10,389 --> 02:28:10,399
That's it.
 

5879
02:28:10,399 --> 02:28:12,870
That's it.
Oscar, I cut

5880
02:28:12,870 --> 02:28:12,880
Oscar, I cut
 

5881
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:14,870
Oscar, I cut
because we're not doing anything. I was

5882
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:14,880
because we're not doing anything. I was
 

5883
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:16,550
because we're not doing anything. I was
having a go at long here and we just

5884
02:28:16,550 --> 02:28:16,560
having a go at long here and we just
 

5885
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,230
having a go at long here and we just
couldn't break out. So, should have

5886
02:28:18,230 --> 02:28:18,240
couldn't break out. So, should have
 

5887
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:19,670
couldn't break out. So, should have
taken more profit off that. That's it

5888
02:28:19,670 --> 02:28:19,680
taken more profit off that. That's it
 

5889
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:22,309
taken more profit off that. That's it
really.

5890
02:28:22,309 --> 02:28:22,319
really.
 

5891
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:23,830
really.
Nothing else to look at right now,

5892
02:28:23,830 --> 02:28:23,840
Nothing else to look at right now,
 

5893
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:40,070
Nothing else to look at right now,
folks.

5894
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:40,080

 

5895
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:41,670

Anything you guys want me to go through

5896
02:28:41,670 --> 02:28:41,680
Anything you guys want me to go through
 

5897
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:44,309
Anything you guys want me to go through
before I leave for the day? 15 minutes

5898
02:28:44,309 --> 02:28:44,319
before I leave for the day? 15 minutes
 

5899
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:56,309
before I leave for the day? 15 minutes
left for lunch.

5900
02:28:56,309 --> 02:28:56,319

 

5901
02:28:56,319 --> 02:28:57,990

Oh, sorry. Would be nice for you to keep

5902
02:28:57,990 --> 02:28:58,000
Oh, sorry. Would be nice for you to keep
 

5903
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,070
Oh, sorry. Would be nice for you to keep
giving bookmap info for those of you who

5904
02:29:00,070 --> 02:29:00,080
giving bookmap info for those of you who
 

5905
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:01,910
giving bookmap info for those of you who
are long. Well, look, you're okay. I

5906
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:01,920
are long. Well, look, you're okay. I
 

5907
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:02,870
are long. Well, look, you're okay. I
don't know where you're long. Where are

5908
02:29:02,870 --> 02:29:02,880
don't know where you're long. Where are
 

5909
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:05,670
don't know where you're long. Where are
you long from, chat?

5910
02:29:05,670 --> 02:29:05,680
you long from, chat?
 

5911
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:07,830
you long from, chat?
You long from IB reclaim or previous day

5912
02:29:07,830 --> 02:29:07,840
You long from IB reclaim or previous day
 

5913
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:09,910
You long from IB reclaim or previous day
or this level here? As long as you're,

5914
02:29:09,910 --> 02:29:09,920
or this level here? As long as you're,
 

5915
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:11,190
or this level here? As long as you're,
it depends which one you're long from,

5916
02:29:11,190 --> 02:29:11,200
it depends which one you're long from,
 

5917
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:12,389
it depends which one you're long from,
but you know, all the time you're

5918
02:29:12,389 --> 02:29:12,399
but you know, all the time you're
 

5919
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:14,790
but you know, all the time you're
holding this shelf, potential rotation

5920
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:14,800
holding this shelf, potential rotation
 

5921
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:17,110
holding this shelf, potential rotation
into 610s. Let go of this shelf, then

5922
02:29:17,110 --> 02:29:17,120
into 610s. Let go of this shelf, then
 

5923
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:19,110
into 610s. Let go of this shelf, then
they come back and back. We're just

5924
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:19,120
they come back and back. We're just
 

5925
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:21,830
they come back and back. We're just
going to back test. All right. So, it's

5926
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:21,840
going to back test. All right. So, it's
 

5927
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:27,030
going to back test. All right. So, it's
literally IB here, here, here, uh, here,

5928
02:29:27,030 --> 02:29:27,040
literally IB here, here, here, uh, here,
 

5929
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:29,830
literally IB here, here, here, uh, here,
and here. So, all we're doing, if you

5930
02:29:29,830 --> 02:29:29,840
and here. So, all we're doing, if you
 

5931
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,270
and here. So, all we're doing, if you
think about, all we're doing all day is

5932
02:29:31,270 --> 02:29:31,280
think about, all we're doing all day is
 

5933
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,429
think about, all we're doing all day is
testing one level, one level, one level,

5934
02:29:33,429 --> 02:29:33,439
testing one level, one level, one level,
 

5935
02:29:33,439 --> 02:29:35,590
testing one level, one level, one level,
next level, next level, next level, next

5936
02:29:35,590 --> 02:29:35,600
next level, next level, next level, next
 

5937
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:37,910
next level, next level, next level, next
level, next level, next level. See how

5938
02:29:37,910 --> 02:29:37,920
level, next level, next level. See how
 

5939
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:40,070
level, next level, next level. See how
we move? We're just moving from level to

5940
02:29:40,070 --> 02:29:40,080
we move? We're just moving from level to
 

5941
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:42,710
we move? We're just moving from level to
level.

5942
02:29:42,710 --> 02:29:42,720
level.
 

5943
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:44,389
level.
So your risk should be from level to

5944
02:29:44,389 --> 02:29:44,399
So your risk should be from level to
 

5945
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:46,230
So your risk should be from level to
level. So if you're long here, you're

5946
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:46,240
level. So if you're long here, you're
 

5947
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:47,670
level. So if you're long here, you're
partial here and you're holding for

5948
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:47,680
partial here and you're holding for
 

5949
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:49,670
partial here and you're holding for
here. If you're long here or partial

5950
02:29:49,670 --> 02:29:49,680
here. If you're long here or partial
 

5951
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:51,750
here. If you're long here or partial
here, partial here, partial here,

5952
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:51,760
here, partial here, partial here,
 

5953
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:53,510
here, partial here, partial here,
because you don't know if they let go of

5954
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:53,520
because you don't know if they let go of
 

5955
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:54,870
because you don't know if they let go of
this level, they probably come back down

5956
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:54,880
this level, they probably come back down
 

5957
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:56,309
this level, they probably come back down
to value. And if they let go of that,

5958
02:29:56,309 --> 02:29:56,319
to value. And if they let go of that,
 

5959
02:29:56,319 --> 02:29:57,830
to value. And if they let go of that,
they come back down to IB. And if they

5960
02:29:57,830 --> 02:29:57,840
they come back down to IB. And if they
 

5961
02:29:57,840 --> 02:29:59,349
they come back down to IB. And if they
let go of that, then maybe finally they

5962
02:29:59,349 --> 02:29:59,359
let go of that, then maybe finally they
 

5963
02:29:59,359 --> 02:30:03,990
let go of that, then maybe finally they
move down into this.

5964
02:30:03,990 --> 02:30:04,000

 

5965
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,510

You're long from right here. I'd say

5966
02:30:05,510 --> 02:30:05,520
You're long from right here. I'd say
 

5967
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:08,309
You're long from right here. I'd say
this is not trying to be a dick. This is

5968
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:08,319
this is not trying to be a dick. This is
 

5969
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:10,070
this is not trying to be a dick. This is
probably your the worst position you can

5970
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:10,080
probably your the worst position you can
 

5971
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:11,349
probably your the worst position you can
be long from because your point of

5972
02:30:11,349 --> 02:30:11,359
be long from because your point of
 

5973
02:30:11,359 --> 02:30:13,510
be long from because your point of
control. So this is the most traded area

5974
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:13,520
control. So this is the most traded area
 

5975
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:16,070
control. So this is the most traded area
of the day.

5976
02:30:16,070 --> 02:30:16,080
of the day.
 

5977
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:17,910
of the day.
Probably better off being long from here

5978
02:30:17,910 --> 02:30:17,920
Probably better off being long from here
 

5979
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:21,030
Probably better off being long from here
or you know on a retest of this. But

5980
02:30:21,030 --> 02:30:21,040
or you know on a retest of this. But
 

5981
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:22,710
or you know on a retest of this. But
yeah, I would say you don't want to lose

5982
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:22,720
yeah, I would say you don't want to lose
 

5983
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:25,110
yeah, I would say you don't want to lose
60s. If you lose 60s here, you're going

5984
02:30:25,110 --> 02:30:25,120
60s. If you lose 60s here, you're going
 

5985
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:27,270
60s. If you lose 60s here, you're going
to trade 44s. And if you lose 44s,

5986
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,280
to trade 44s. And if you lose 44s,
 

5987
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:28,710
to trade 44s. And if you lose 44s,
you're going to trade 20s. And if you

5988
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:28,720
you're going to trade 20s. And if you
 

5989
02:30:28,720 --> 02:30:31,590
you're going to trade 20s. And if you
lose 20s, you're going to trade 84 80s.

5990
02:30:31,590 --> 02:30:31,600
lose 20s, you're going to trade 84 80s.
 

5991
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:32,630
lose 20s, you're going to trade 84 80s.
And if you lose that, you're going to

5992
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:32,640
And if you lose that, you're going to
 

5993
02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:36,070
And if you lose that, you're going to
trade 420s. If you reclaim 600s, you're

5994
02:30:36,070 --> 02:30:36,080
trade 420s. If you reclaim 600s, you're
 

5995
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:37,830
trade 420s. If you reclaim 600s, you're
going to retest tens. And if you get

5996
02:30:37,830 --> 02:30:37,840
going to retest tens. And if you get
 

5997
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:40,790
going to retest tens. And if you get
through that, you're going to test 40s.

5998
02:30:40,790 --> 02:30:40,800
through that, you're going to test 40s.
 

5999
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:43,590
through that, you're going to test 40s.
But remember, we have buyers stuck at

6000
02:30:43,590 --> 02:30:43,600
But remember, we have buyers stuck at
 

6001
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,750
But remember, we have buyers stuck at
35. This is why being good at numbers is

6002
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:45,760
35. This is why being good at numbers is
 

6003
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,830
35. This is why being good at numbers is
important. We come back up here on the

6004
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:47,840
important. We come back up here on the
 

6005
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,910
important. We come back up here on the
book. 635.

6006
02:30:49,910 --> 02:30:49,920
book. 635.
 

6007
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:51,349
book. 635.
So I can see here, where have you got

6008
02:30:51,349 --> 02:30:51,359
So I can see here, where have you got
 

6009
02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:54,309
So I can see here, where have you got
buyers offside, right? 595, big buyers

6010
02:30:54,309 --> 02:30:54,319
buyers offside, right? 595, big buyers
 

6011
02:30:54,319 --> 02:30:55,510
buyers offside, right? 595, big buyers
offside. I'm going to give you all the

6012
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:55,520
offside. I'm going to give you all the
 

6013
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:59,910
offside. I'm going to give you all the
levels. 600 buyers offside. 60

6014
02:30:59,910 --> 02:30:59,920
levels. 600 buyers offside. 60
 

6015
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:02,870
levels. 600 buyers offside. 60
405 big buyers offside. These are all

6016
02:31:02,870 --> 02:31:02,880
405 big buyers offside. These are all
 

6017
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:05,349
405 big buyers offside. These are all
buyers who have market ordered in and

6018
02:31:05,349 --> 02:31:05,359
buyers who have market ordered in and
 

6019
02:31:05,359 --> 02:31:07,510
buyers who have market ordered in and
got stuck. Right. Let's keep going. So,

6020
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:07,520
got stuck. Right. Let's keep going. So,
 

6021
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,630
got stuck. Right. Let's keep going. So,
you can mark these out if you want. 605.

6022
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:10,640
you can mark these out if you want. 605.
 

6023
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,150
you can mark these out if you want. 605.
Need this book to slow down for a

6024
02:31:12,150 --> 02:31:12,160
Need this book to slow down for a
 

6025
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:17,429
Need this book to slow down for a
minute. D

6026
02:31:17,429 --> 02:31:17,439

 

6027
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:19,830

635 is another level. So, that's the

6028
02:31:19,830 --> 02:31:19,840
635 is another level. So, that's the
 

6029
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:22,309
635 is another level. So, that's the
that was the peak where we had buyers

6030
02:31:22,309 --> 02:31:22,319
that was the peak where we had buyers
 

6031
02:31:22,319 --> 02:31:25,110
that was the peak where we had buyers
caught. 635.

6032
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:25,120
caught. 635.
 

6033
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:27,670
caught. 635.
All right. So, I'd say all those levels

6034
02:31:27,670 --> 02:31:27,680
All right. So, I'd say all those levels
 

6035
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,429
All right. So, I'd say all those levels
I just gave you are where buyers are

6036
02:31:29,429 --> 02:31:29,439
I just gave you are where buyers are
 

6037
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:35,190
I just gave you are where buyers are
stuck. Right. 635 up here. Big level.

6038
02:31:35,190 --> 02:31:35,200
stuck. Right. 635 up here. Big level.
 

6039
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,469
stuck. Right. 635 up here. Big level.
So, you need this peak formation to come

6040
02:31:38,469 --> 02:31:38,479
So, you need this peak formation to come
 

6041
02:31:38,479 --> 02:31:41,190
So, you need this peak formation to come
and close over 600 really. And you'd be

6042
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:41,200
and close over 600 really. And you'd be
 

6043
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:42,870
and close over 600 really. And you'd be
watching this 24-hour view up. All

6044
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:42,880
watching this 24-hour view up. All
 

6045
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:44,630
watching this 24-hour view up. All
right. And if you can get through that,

6046
02:31:44,630 --> 02:31:44,640
right. And if you can get through that,
 

6047
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:46,309
right. And if you can get through that,
maybe they come and test this block up

6048
02:31:46,309 --> 02:31:46,319
maybe they come and test this block up
 

6049
02:31:46,319 --> 02:31:49,190
maybe they come and test this block up
here.

6050
02:31:49,190 --> 02:31:49,200
here.
 

6051
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:51,429
here.
But I say the best long was that retest

6052
02:31:51,429 --> 02:31:51,439
But I say the best long was that retest
 

6053
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:53,349
But I say the best long was that retest
of IB where I was trying to fight it a

6054
02:31:53,349 --> 02:31:53,359
of IB where I was trying to fight it a
 

6055
02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:54,469
of IB where I was trying to fight it a
little bit. That was probably the best

6056
02:31:54,469 --> 02:31:54,479
little bit. That was probably the best
 

6057
02:31:54,479 --> 02:31:57,030
little bit. That was probably the best
long. And then here into 60s. It's

6058
02:31:57,030 --> 02:31:57,040
long. And then here into 60s. It's
 

6059
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:07,990
long. And then here into 60s. It's
holding 60s though, so you look good.

6060
02:32:07,990 --> 02:32:08,000

 

6061
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:17,110

What is the range for ES?

6062
02:32:17,110 --> 02:32:17,120

 

6063
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:18,870

Well, you're at the edge of one now. So,

6064
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:18,880
Well, you're at the edge of one now. So,
 

6065
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:23,270
Well, you're at the edge of one now. So,
we're boxed in here.

6066
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280

 

6067
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:27,270

80s to 50s. And if you get a sentence

6068
02:32:27,270 --> 02:32:27,280
80s to 50s. And if you get a sentence
 

6069
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:31,670
80s to 50s. And if you get a sentence
above 80s, we can look for 68. Right. So

6070
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:31,680
above 80s, we can look for 68. Right. So
 

6071
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:35,349
above 80s, we can look for 68. Right. So
80s to is it 80s?

6072
02:32:35,349 --> 02:32:35,359
80s to is it 80s?
 

6073
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:39,910
80s to is it 80s?
Sorry 60s. God I can't even see 860.

6074
02:32:39,910 --> 02:32:39,920
Sorry 60s. God I can't even see 860.
 

6075
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:41,830
Sorry 60s. God I can't even see 860.
This level here is your edge and the

6076
02:32:41,830 --> 02:32:41,840
This level here is your edge and the
 

6077
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:43,830
This level here is your edge and the
lower edge is 850. So you got a 10point

6078
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:43,840
lower edge is 850. So you got a 10point
 

6079
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,590
lower edge is 850. So you got a 10point
range here on ES. You need to find

6080
02:32:45,590 --> 02:32:45,600
range here on ES. You need to find
 

6081
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,230
range here on ES. You need to find
acceptance above pullback and hold 60

6082
02:32:48,230 --> 02:32:48,240
acceptance above pullback and hold 60
 

6083
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:51,750
acceptance above pullback and hold 60
for a rotation all the way up into let's

6084
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:51,760
for a rotation all the way up into let's
 

6085
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:57,990
for a rotation all the way up into let's
call it 65.

6086
02:32:57,990 --> 02:32:58,000

 

6087
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,870

And that's where same thing as

6088
02:33:00,870 --> 02:33:00,880
And that's where same thing as
 

6089
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:02,790
And that's where same thing as
on cues. I would imagine if I have a

6090
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:02,800
on cues. I would imagine if I have a
 

6091
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:04,230
on cues. I would imagine if I have a
look at the book up there, we find some

6092
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:04,240
look at the book up there, we find some
 

6093
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,670
look at the book up there, we find some
buyers who got caught up there. Let's

6094
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:05,680
buyers who got caught up there. Let's
 

6095
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:10,150
buyers who got caught up there. Let's
have a little look.

6096
02:33:10,150 --> 02:33:10,160

 

6097
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:13,270

What was that level

6098
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:13,280
What was that level
 

6099
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:26,469
What was that level
time? 1040.

6100
02:33:26,469 --> 02:33:26,479

 

6101
02:33:26,479 --> 02:33:28,710

Yeah. So you had buying into that on the

6102
02:33:28,710 --> 02:33:28,720
Yeah. So you had buying into that on the
 

6103
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:32,870
Yeah. So you had buying into that on the
way up

6104
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:32,880

 

6105
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:37,270

the size there. So you had

6106
02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:37,280

 

6107
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:39,910

from

6108
02:33:39,910 --> 02:33:39,920
from
 

6109
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:43,030
from
64s on ES. You had like a 280 bid, then

6110
02:33:43,030 --> 02:33:43,040
64s on ES. You had like a 280 bid, then
 

6111
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:47,190
64s on ES. You had like a 280 bid, then
a 240 bid, then 176, 150, 143. This

6112
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:47,200
a 240 bid, then 176, 150, 143. This
 

6113
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:50,550
a 240 bid, then 176, 150, 143. This
guy's a big guy. So you had a 754 lot

6114
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:50,560
guy's a big guy. So you had a 754 lot
 

6115
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:53,429
guy's a big guy. So you had a 754 lot
trade at 684

6116
02:33:53,429 --> 02:33:53,439
trade at 684
 

6117
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:55,110
trade at 684
6864

6118
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:55,120
6864
 

6119
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:56,950
6864
and then after that he got washed out.

6120
02:33:56,950 --> 02:33:56,960
and then after that he got washed out.
 

6121
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:59,750
and then after that he got washed out.
So look at that volume. 2,488 lot

6122
02:33:59,750 --> 02:33:59,760
So look at that volume. 2,488 lot
 

6123
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:03,429
So look at that volume. 2,488 lot
dropped it under 860. So I'd say uh you

6124
02:34:03,429 --> 02:34:03,439
dropped it under 860. So I'd say uh you
 

6125
02:34:03,439 --> 02:34:05,030
dropped it under 860. So I'd say uh you
want to be very very careful if you get

6126
02:34:05,030 --> 02:34:05,040
want to be very very careful if you get
 

6127
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:08,550
want to be very very careful if you get
anywhere near 6864 on ES because that's

6128
02:34:08,550 --> 02:34:08,560
anywhere near 6864 on ES because that's
 

6129
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:11,110
anywhere near 6864 on ES because that's
where they all got stuck above.

6130
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:11,120
where they all got stuck above.
 

6131
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:13,190
where they all got stuck above.
So you're you're getting into it now. If

6132
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:13,200
So you're you're getting into it now. If
 

6133
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:14,550
So you're you're getting into it now. If
we look at putmat now you're getting

6134
02:34:14,550 --> 02:34:14,560
we look at putmat now you're getting
 

6135
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:16,309
we look at putmat now you're getting
into this area now. So, this is where

6136
02:34:16,309 --> 02:34:16,319
into this area now. So, this is where
 

6137
02:34:16,319 --> 02:34:18,870
into this area now. So, this is where
that guy got stuck. 64 is where he got

6138
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:18,880
that guy got stuck. 64 is where he got
 

6139
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:21,349
that guy got stuck. 64 is where he got
stuck. 64

6140
02:34:21,349 --> 02:34:21,359
stuck. 64
 

6141
02:34:21,359 --> 02:34:27,670
stuck. 64
up to 68.

6142
02:34:27,670 --> 02:34:27,680

 

6143
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:30,630

64 up to 68 on ES. That's where they got

6144
02:34:30,630 --> 02:34:30,640
64 up to 68 on ES. That's where they got
 

6145
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:33,110
64 up to 68 on ES. That's where they got
stuck. So, if they become sellers,

6146
02:34:33,110 --> 02:34:33,120
stuck. So, if they become sellers,
 

6147
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:34,550
stuck. So, if they become sellers,
right, if you were a buyer up there and

6148
02:34:34,550 --> 02:34:34,560
right, if you were a buyer up there and
 

6149
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:36,469
right, if you were a buyer up there and
they didn't sell for whatever reason,

6150
02:34:36,469 --> 02:34:36,479
they didn't sell for whatever reason,
 

6151
02:34:36,479 --> 02:34:38,070
they didn't sell for whatever reason,
this is going to be the supply zone that

6152
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:38,080
this is going to be the supply zone that
 

6153
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:42,150
this is going to be the supply zone that
they're going to get stuck in.

6154
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:42,160

 

6155
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:46,550

Yeah. His big order was he had a 491 lot

6156
02:34:46,550 --> 02:34:46,560
Yeah. His big order was he had a 491 lot
 

6157
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:48,389
Yeah. His big order was he had a 491 lot
6865

6158
02:34:48,389 --> 02:34:48,399
6865
 

6159
02:34:48,399 --> 02:34:52,870
6865
6864 6865 somewhere around there.

6160
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:52,880
6864 6865 somewhere around there.
 

6161
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:54,630
6864 6865 somewhere around there.
So, I would be taking some profit into

6162
02:34:54,630 --> 02:34:54,640
So, I would be taking some profit into
 

6163
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:56,790
So, I would be taking some profit into
that and then holding runners in case

6164
02:34:56,790 --> 02:34:56,800
that and then holding runners in case
 

6165
02:34:56,800 --> 02:34:58,630
that and then holding runners in case
you get an expansion on a stop hunt.

6166
02:34:58,630 --> 02:34:58,640
you get an expansion on a stop hunt.
 

6167
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:00,389
you get an expansion on a stop hunt.
Like, if you get that, great. But don't

6168
02:35:00,389 --> 02:35:00,399
Like, if you get that, great. But don't
 

6169
02:35:00,399 --> 02:35:18,710
Like, if you get that, great. But don't
expect it in a range rotating day.

6170
02:35:18,710 --> 02:35:18,720

 

6171
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:21,190

Tanish is asking, can anyone here guide

6172
02:35:21,190 --> 02:35:21,200
Tanish is asking, can anyone here guide
 

6173
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:23,030
Tanish is asking, can anyone here guide
them on the flow zone course in

6174
02:35:23,030 --> 02:35:23,040
them on the flow zone course in
 

6175
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:25,270
them on the flow zone course in
indicators? So, any of you here who have

6176
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:25,280
indicators? So, any of you here who have
 

6177
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:29,429
indicators? So, any of you here who have
done the course or use the indicator,

6178
02:35:29,429 --> 02:35:29,439
done the course or use the indicator,
 

6179
02:35:29,439 --> 02:35:31,030
done the course or use the indicator,
let Tanish know what it's like. Better

6180
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:31,040
let Tanish know what it's like. Better
 

6181
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:32,550
let Tanish know what it's like. Better
to come from someone else and you get an

6182
02:35:32,550 --> 02:35:32,560
to come from someone else and you get an
 

6183
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:34,950
to come from someone else and you get an
honest opinion rather than whatever I

6184
02:35:34,950 --> 02:35:34,960
honest opinion rather than whatever I
 

6185
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:57,190
honest opinion rather than whatever I
say.

6186
02:35:57,190 --> 02:35:57,200

 

6187
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:59,429

I'll be right back, folks. Use the

6188
02:35:59,429 --> 02:35:59,439
I'll be right back, folks. Use the
 

6189
02:35:59,439 --> 02:38:00,870
I'll be right back, folks. Use the
bathroom.

6190
02:38:00,870 --> 02:38:00,880

 

6191
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:03,270

Can anyone here help Tanish? Any current

6192
02:38:03,270 --> 02:38:03,280
Can anyone here help Tanish? Any current
 

6193
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:06,630
Can anyone here help Tanish? Any current
students?

6194
02:38:06,630 --> 02:38:06,640

 

6195
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:08,070

Must be some of you on here. Maybe

6196
02:38:08,070 --> 02:38:08,080
Must be some of you on here. Maybe
 

6197
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:10,550
Must be some of you on here. Maybe
you've all gone to bed.

6198
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:10,560
you've all gone to bed.
 

6199
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:12,230
you've all gone to bed.
Do I think this is going to break out?

6200
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:12,240
Do I think this is going to break out?
 

6201
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,670
Do I think this is going to break out?
Uh I think we're going to get a stop

6202
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:13,680
Uh I think we're going to get a stop
 

6203
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:16,309
Uh I think we're going to get a stop
hunt. I think this is going to take out

6204
02:38:16,309 --> 02:38:16,319
hunt. I think this is going to take out
 

6205
02:38:16,319 --> 02:38:20,389
hunt. I think this is going to take out
these highs, these uh internal highs.

6206
02:38:20,389 --> 02:38:20,399
these highs, these uh internal highs.
 

6207
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:22,150
these highs, these uh internal highs.
I don't know if it can sustain a bid,

6208
02:38:22,150 --> 02:38:22,160
I don't know if it can sustain a bid,
 

6209
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:23,190
I don't know if it can sustain a bid,
but I think we're going to take out

6210
02:38:23,190 --> 02:38:23,200
but I think we're going to take out
 

6211
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,270
but I think we're going to take out
these highs because there'll be lots of

6212
02:38:25,270 --> 02:38:25,280
these highs because there'll be lots of
 

6213
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:29,030
these highs because there'll be lots of
stops here. And so once we do that, uh,

6214
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:29,040
stops here. And so once we do that, uh,
 

6215
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:30,950
stops here. And so once we do that, uh,
we'll probably get a violent move

6216
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:30,960
we'll probably get a violent move
 

6217
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:35,270
we'll probably get a violent move
higher. Even if it's not sustained,

6218
02:38:35,270 --> 02:38:35,280
higher. Even if it's not sustained,
 

6219
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:39,429
higher. Even if it's not sustained,
you probably see like a spike.

6220
02:38:39,429 --> 02:38:39,439

 

6221
02:38:39,439 --> 02:38:43,990

Come on. Come on.

6222
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:44,000

 

6223
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,910

There we go.

6224
02:38:45,910 --> 02:38:45,920
There we go.
 

6225
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:48,950
There we go.
I think any push through 43s, you

6226
02:38:48,950 --> 02:38:48,960
I think any push through 43s, you
 

6227
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:51,750
I think any push through 43s, you
probably instantly get up to 50s.

6228
02:38:51,750 --> 02:38:51,760
probably instantly get up to 50s.
 

6229
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:53,429
probably instantly get up to 50s.
You probably instantly get there. It's

6230
02:38:53,429 --> 02:38:53,439
You probably instantly get there. It's
 

6231
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:55,349
You probably instantly get there. It's
probably done like that. If they get

6232
02:38:55,349 --> 02:38:55,359
probably done like that. If they get
 

6233
02:38:55,359 --> 02:38:57,270
probably done like that. If they get
through the 43s, probably so many stops

6234
02:38:57,270 --> 02:38:57,280
through the 43s, probably so many stops
 

6235
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:59,270
through the 43s, probably so many stops
there, probably instantly pushes

6236
02:38:59,270 --> 02:38:59,280
there, probably instantly pushes
 

6237
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:04,550
there, probably instantly pushes
through.

6238
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:04,560

 

6239
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:07,670

Any break through 40s and 43 should

6240
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:07,680
Any break through 40s and 43 should
 

6241
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:10,230
Any break through 40s and 43 should
probably instantly get to 50s and 57s.

6242
02:39:10,230 --> 02:39:10,240
probably instantly get to 50s and 57s.
 

6243
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:12,309
probably instantly get to 50s and 57s.
Probably like if they do it, it would be

6244
02:39:12,309 --> 02:39:12,319
Probably like if they do it, it would be
 

6245
02:39:12,319 --> 02:39:14,550
Probably like if they do it, it would be
a swipe. So, if they pull back here,

6246
02:39:14,550 --> 02:39:14,560
a swipe. So, if they pull back here,
 

6247
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:16,150
a swipe. So, if they pull back here,
they might encourage more shorts to come

6248
02:39:16,150 --> 02:39:16,160
they might encourage more shorts to come
 

6249
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:18,870
they might encourage more shorts to come
in, right? And then I think the next

6250
02:39:18,870 --> 02:39:18,880
in, right? And then I think the next
 

6251
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:20,469
in, right? And then I think the next
attempt

6252
02:39:20,469 --> 02:39:20,479
attempt
 

6253
02:39:20,479 --> 02:39:22,070
attempt
probably

6254
02:39:22,070 --> 02:39:22,080
probably
 

6255
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:24,150
probably
just slams through this to be quite

6256
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:24,160
just slams through this to be quite
 

6257
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:25,670
just slams through this to be quite
honest because there's too many stops

6258
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:25,680
honest because there's too many stops
 

6259
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:27,110
honest because there's too many stops
there now. It's going to be too juicy

6260
02:39:27,110 --> 02:39:27,120
there now. It's going to be too juicy
 

6261
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:28,630
there now. It's going to be too juicy
for them to ignore. Let me just check

6262
02:39:28,630 --> 02:39:28,640
for them to ignore. Let me just check
 

6263
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:30,950
for them to ignore. Let me just check
where SPY is trading at. Want to be

6264
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:30,960
where SPY is trading at. Want to be
 

6265
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:32,950
where SPY is trading at. Want to be
aware of that 85 level. All right, we

6266
02:39:32,950 --> 02:39:32,960
aware of that 85 level. All right, we
 

6267
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:36,550
aware of that 85 level. All right, we
know 85 is the pin on Spy. Okay, I don't

6268
02:39:36,550 --> 02:39:36,560
know 85 is the pin on Spy. Okay, I don't
 

6269
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:38,630
know 85 is the pin on Spy. Okay, I don't
think Spy probably gets through 85.

6270
02:39:38,630 --> 02:39:38,640
think Spy probably gets through 85.
 

6271
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,630
think Spy probably gets through 85.
Currently trading 8430, so it's got

6272
02:39:40,630 --> 02:39:40,640
Currently trading 8430, so it's got
 

6273
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:43,110
Currently trading 8430, so it's got
room. So, I I imagine this will break.

6274
02:39:43,110 --> 02:39:43,120
room. So, I I imagine this will break.
 

6275
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:45,510
room. So, I I imagine this will break.
If you want my opinion, this will break

6276
02:39:45,510 --> 02:39:45,520
If you want my opinion, this will break
 

6277
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:47,349
If you want my opinion, this will break
out through these highs and squeeze it.

6278
02:39:47,349 --> 02:39:47,359
out through these highs and squeeze it.
 

6279
02:39:47,359 --> 02:39:49,110
out through these highs and squeeze it.
Like I said, I think that anything down

6280
02:39:49,110 --> 02:39:49,120
Like I said, I think that anything down
 

6281
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:51,670
Like I said, I think that anything down
here probably gets absorbed and then a

6282
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:51,680
here probably gets absorbed and then a
 

6283
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:53,110
here probably gets absorbed and then a
stop hunt through here and you probably

6284
02:39:53,110 --> 02:39:53,120
stop hunt through here and you probably
 

6285
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:54,710
stop hunt through here and you probably
just see a swipe up. And if you're in

6286
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:54,720
just see a swipe up. And if you're in
 

6287
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:56,230
just see a swipe up. And if you're in
this long, you better be selling that

6288
02:39:56,230 --> 02:39:56,240
this long, you better be selling that
 

6289
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:58,469
this long, you better be selling that
swipe. You better be taking profit

6290
02:39:58,469 --> 02:39:58,479
swipe. You better be taking profit
 

6291
02:39:58,479 --> 02:40:00,070
swipe. You better be taking profit
because there's no guarantee that it

6292
02:40:00,070 --> 02:40:00,080
because there's no guarantee that it
 

6293
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:02,230
because there's no guarantee that it
doesn't do this afterwards.

6294
02:40:02,230 --> 02:40:02,240
doesn't do this afterwards.
 

6295
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:04,070
doesn't do this afterwards.
But, you know, if you're long from I

6296
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:04,080
But, you know, if you're long from I
 

6297
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:05,270
But, you know, if you're long from I
think Jack and some others were long

6298
02:40:05,270 --> 02:40:05,280
think Jack and some others were long
 

6299
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:06,950
think Jack and some others were long
from here, you look good. You get a

6300
02:40:06,950 --> 02:40:06,960
from here, you look good. You get a
 

6301
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:08,469
from here, you look good. You get a
swipe through here, that's almost 100

6302
02:40:08,469 --> 02:40:08,479
swipe through here, that's almost 100
 

6303
02:40:08,479 --> 02:40:11,990
swipe through here, that's almost 100
points. sell like 80% of it and hold a

6304
02:40:11,990 --> 02:40:12,000
points. sell like 80% of it and hold a
 

6305
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,590
points. sell like 80% of it and hold a
runner in case you get all the way up

6306
02:40:13,590 --> 02:40:13,600
runner in case you get all the way up
 

6307
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:15,910
runner in case you get all the way up
here.

6308
02:40:15,910 --> 02:40:15,920
here.
 

6309
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:17,510

6317
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:35,429

How do you know when price is accepted

6318
02:40:35,429 --> 02:40:35,439
How do you know when price is accepted
 

6319
02:40:35,439 --> 02:40:37,190
How do you know when price is accepted
above or below a level? because it will

6320
02:40:37,190 --> 02:40:37,200
above or below a level? because it will
 

6321
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:39,510
above or below a level? because it will
get above it and then it will hold,

6322
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:39,520
get above it and then it will hold,
 

6323
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:42,150
get above it and then it will hold,
right? It get above it and hold. So, see

6324
02:40:42,150 --> 02:40:42,160
right? It get above it and hold. So, see
 

6325
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:44,790
right? It get above it and hold. So, see
this level here?

6326
02:40:44,790 --> 02:40:44,800
this level here?
 

6327
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:47,190
this level here?
We didn't

6328
02:40:47,190 --> 02:40:47,200
We didn't
 

6329
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:49,590
We didn't
get above it and fell under, did we? We

6330
02:40:49,590 --> 02:40:49,600
get above it and fell under, did we? We
 

6331
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:51,349
get above it and fell under, did we? We
got above it and held. They held the

6332
02:40:51,349 --> 02:40:51,359
got above it and held. They held the
 

6333
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:52,950
got above it and held. They held the
base. They tried again. They held the

6334
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:52,960
base. They tried again. They held the
 

6335
02:40:52,960 --> 02:40:54,309
base. They tried again. They held the
base. All right. So, that's the new

6336
02:40:54,309 --> 02:40:54,319
base. All right. So, that's the new
 

6337
02:40:54,319 --> 02:40:56,150
base. All right. So, that's the new
level. If they want to come down and

6338
02:40:56,150 --> 02:40:56,160
level. If they want to come down and
 

6339
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:57,990
level. If they want to come down and
test this, they can. We know there's

6340
02:40:57,990 --> 02:40:58,000
test this, they can. We know there's
 

6341
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:59,750
test this, they can. We know there's
volume here. They can come all the way

6342
02:40:59,750 --> 02:40:59,760
volume here. They can come all the way
 

6343
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:01,670
volume here. They can come all the way
down here. Right. So, if you want to see

6344
02:41:01,670 --> 02:41:01,680
down here. Right. So, if you want to see
 

6345
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:03,750
down here. Right. So, if you want to see
price above this,

6346
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:03,760
price above this,
 

6347
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:06,870
price above this,
you would need to hold above that for

6348
02:41:06,870 --> 02:41:06,880
you would need to hold above that for
 

6349
02:41:06,880 --> 02:41:08,870
you would need to hold above that for
acceptance.

6350
02:41:08,870 --> 02:41:08,880
acceptance.
 

6351
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:10,150
acceptance.
Getting through it doesn't mean

6352
02:41:10,150 --> 02:41:10,160
Getting through it doesn't mean
 

6353
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:11,830
Getting through it doesn't mean
anything. That's a stop hunt. That's why

6354
02:41:11,830 --> 02:41:11,840
anything. That's a stop hunt. That's why
 

6355
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:13,190
anything. That's a stop hunt. That's why
I'm saying if you spike through this,

6356
02:41:13,190 --> 02:41:13,200
I'm saying if you spike through this,
 

6357
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:14,309
I'm saying if you spike through this,
you better be selling some of your

6358
02:41:14,309 --> 02:41:14,319
you better be selling some of your
 

6359
02:41:14,319 --> 02:41:15,990
you better be selling some of your
profit into it because there's no

6360
02:41:15,990 --> 02:41:16,000
profit into it because there's no
 

6361
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:17,510
profit into it because there's no
guarantee

6362
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:17,520
guarantee
 

6363
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:19,030
guarantee
it doesn't do this. And you don't want

6364
02:41:19,030 --> 02:41:19,040
it doesn't do this. And you don't want
 

6365
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:24,309
it doesn't do this. And you don't want
to give the whole thing back.

6366
02:41:24,309 --> 02:41:24,319

 

6367
02:41:24,319 --> 02:41:25,670

Doesn't matter what time frame you're

6368
02:41:25,670 --> 02:41:25,680
Doesn't matter what time frame you're
 

6369
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:27,910
Doesn't matter what time frame you're
looking at. It's a hold on any market.

6370
02:41:27,910 --> 02:41:27,920
looking at. It's a hold on any market.
 

6371
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:29,910
looking at. It's a hold on any market.
It's closing above. It's absorbing at

6372
02:41:29,910 --> 02:41:29,920
It's closing above. It's absorbing at
 

6373
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:37,670
It's closing above. It's absorbing at
that new level.

6374
02:41:37,670 --> 02:41:37,680

 

6375
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:40,710

How long have I been trading for? Um,

6376
02:41:40,710 --> 02:41:40,720
How long have I been trading for? Um,
 

6377
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:44,230
How long have I been trading for? Um,
fulltime probably six years, but I mean

6378
02:41:44,230 --> 02:41:44,240
fulltime probably six years, but I mean
 

6379
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:48,469
fulltime probably six years, but I mean
I was trading long before that in my uh

6380
02:41:48,469 --> 02:41:48,479
I was trading long before that in my uh
 

6381
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:51,910
I was trading long before that in my uh
early 20ies. I am 40 now. So, okay. So,

6382
02:41:51,910 --> 02:41:51,920
early 20ies. I am 40 now. So, okay. So,
 

6383
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:53,429
early 20ies. I am 40 now. So, okay. So,
like I said, I think we'll be absorbed

6384
02:41:53,429 --> 02:41:53,439
like I said, I think we'll be absorbed
 

6385
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:55,670
like I said, I think we'll be absorbed
here. I think this will be a trap for

6386
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:55,680
here. I think this will be a trap for
 

6387
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:57,429
here. I think this will be a trap for
bears to come and try and attack versus

6388
02:41:57,429 --> 02:41:57,439
bears to come and try and attack versus
 

6389
02:41:57,439 --> 02:41:59,190
bears to come and try and attack versus
this. and you will see a squeeze out

6390
02:41:59,190 --> 02:41:59,200
this. and you will see a squeeze out
 

6391
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:02,630
this. and you will see a squeeze out
here, folks. So, stop hunt incoming.

6392
02:42:02,630 --> 02:42:02,640
here, folks. So, stop hunt incoming.
 

6393
02:42:02,640 --> 02:42:05,030
here, folks. So, stop hunt incoming.
Make sure you sell some of your profits

6394
02:42:05,030 --> 02:42:05,040
Make sure you sell some of your profits
 

6395
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:06,950
Make sure you sell some of your profits
in this stop hunt. All right, stop hunt

6396
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:06,960
in this stop hunt. All right, stop hunt
 

6397
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:09,990
in this stop hunt. All right, stop hunt
should happen from sort of 40 to 43.

6398
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,000
should happen from sort of 40 to 43.
 

6399
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,150
should happen from sort of 40 to 43.
We've got liquidity above, I believe.

6400
02:42:12,150 --> 02:42:12,160
We've got liquidity above, I believe.
 

6401
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:13,830
We've got liquidity above, I believe.
Yeah, we've got liquidity up above into

6402
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:13,840
Yeah, we've got liquidity up above into
 

6403
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:15,190
Yeah, we've got liquidity up above into
50. So, I think once you get through the

6404
02:42:15,190 --> 02:42:15,200
50. So, I think once you get through the
 

6405
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:17,110
50. So, I think once you get through the
40 43, you probably see a little spike

6406
02:42:17,110 --> 02:42:17,120
40 43, you probably see a little spike
 

6407
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:18,630
40 43, you probably see a little spike
high. Make sure you're taking some

6408
02:42:18,630 --> 02:42:18,640
high. Make sure you're taking some
 

6409
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:28,550
high. Make sure you're taking some
profit in that.

6410
02:42:28,550 --> 02:42:28,560

 

6411
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:30,630

I've just got one eye on spy because I

6412
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:30,640
I've just got one eye on spy because I
 

6413
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:42,469
I've just got one eye on spy because I
know 85 is a big big level on spy 685.

6414
02:42:42,469 --> 02:42:42,479

 

6415
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:45,030

So here we go. Stop hunt incoming. First

6416
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,040
So here we go. Stop hunt incoming. First
 

6417
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:46,870
So here we go. Stop hunt incoming. First
lot just got popped there. Second lot

6418
02:42:46,870 --> 02:42:46,880
lot just got popped there. Second lot
 

6419
02:42:46,880 --> 02:42:48,469
lot just got popped there. Second lot
will be above 43. And then you should

6420
02:42:48,469 --> 02:42:48,479
will be above 43. And then you should
 

6421
02:42:48,479 --> 02:42:51,349
will be above 43. And then you should
see a swipe. Should see a swipe above

6422
02:42:51,349 --> 02:42:51,359
see a swipe. Should see a swipe above
 

6423
02:42:51,359 --> 02:42:55,830
see a swipe. Should see a swipe above
43.

6424
02:42:55,830 --> 02:42:55,840

 

6425
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:57,910

I look no older than 32. I'll take that.

6426
02:42:57,910 --> 02:42:57,920
I look no older than 32. I'll take that.
 

6427
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:07,190
I look no older than 32. I'll take that.
It's very kind of you.

6428
02:43:07,190 --> 02:43:07,200

 

6429
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:09,510

There's 42s. Here's 43s. You should see

6430
02:43:09,510 --> 02:43:09,520
There's 42s. Here's 43s. You should see
 

6431
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:11,349
There's 42s. Here's 43s. You should see
a stop hunt coming incoming. There's

6432
02:43:11,349 --> 02:43:11,359
a stop hunt coming incoming. There's
 

6433
02:43:11,359 --> 02:43:13,590
a stop hunt coming incoming. There's
46es. I want to see you trade to 50s and

6434
02:43:13,590 --> 02:43:13,600
46es. I want to see you trade to 50s and
 

6435
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:15,429
46es. I want to see you trade to 50s and
through it. Make sure you're selling

6436
02:43:15,429 --> 02:43:15,439
through it. Make sure you're selling
 

6437
02:43:15,439 --> 02:43:16,550
through it. Make sure you're selling
through this stop hunt, though. I think

6438
02:43:16,550 --> 02:43:16,560
through this stop hunt, though. I think
 

6439
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:17,429
through this stop hunt, though. I think
you're going to get up there. Remember,

6440
02:43:17,429 --> 02:43:17,439
you're going to get up there. Remember,
 

6441
02:43:17,439 --> 02:43:18,790
you're going to get up there. Remember,
this is previous day point of control.

6442
02:43:18,790 --> 02:43:18,800
this is previous day point of control.
 

6443
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:20,230
this is previous day point of control.
This is the biggest level traded

6444
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:20,240
This is the biggest level traded
 

6445
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:22,070
This is the biggest level traded
yesterday. So, there's your stop hunt.

6446
02:43:22,070 --> 02:43:22,080
yesterday. So, there's your stop hunt.
 

6447
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:23,590
yesterday. So, there's your stop hunt.
So if you don't get acceptance above

6448
02:43:23,590 --> 02:43:23,600
So if you don't get acceptance above
 

6449
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:25,510
So if you don't get acceptance above
this, we will just collapse right the

6450
02:43:25,510 --> 02:43:25,520
this, we will just collapse right the
 

6451
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:28,070
this, we will just collapse right the
way downside now. So this was your stop

6452
02:43:28,070 --> 02:43:28,080
way downside now. So this was your stop
 

6453
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:32,230
way downside now. So this was your stop
hunt through this and 43s.

6454
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:32,240
hunt through this and 43s.
 

6455
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:34,309
hunt through this and 43s.
There's your stop hunt through this.

6456
02:43:34,309 --> 02:43:34,319
There's your stop hunt through this.
 

6457
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:36,389
There's your stop hunt through this.
Okay, rejecting previous day point of

6458
02:43:36,389 --> 02:43:36,399
Okay, rejecting previous day point of
 

6459
02:43:36,399 --> 02:43:37,750
Okay, rejecting previous day point of
control. You should have sold the

6460
02:43:37,750 --> 02:43:37,760
control. You should have sold the
 

6461
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:39,270

majority of your position. Those of you

6462

who are long from here, because this can

6464
02:43:41,349 --> 02:43:41,359
who are long from here, because this can
 

6465
02:43:41,359 --> 02:43:43,190
who are long from here, because this can
collapse all the way back down to 600,

6466
02:43:43,190 --> 02:43:43,200
collapse all the way back down to 600,
 

6467
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:44,710
collapse all the way back down to 600,
and you don't really want to give 40

6468
02:43:44,710 --> 02:43:44,720
and you don't really want to give 40
 

6469
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,389
and you don't really want to give 40
points back, do you as we're approaching

6470
02:43:46,389 --> 02:43:46,399
points back, do you as we're approaching
 

6471
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:49,030
points back, do you as we're approaching
lunch in 2 minutes?

6472
02:43:49,030 --> 02:43:49,040
lunch in 2 minutes?
 

6473
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:51,429
lunch in 2 minutes?
So you can hold runners, but you should

6474
02:43:51,429 --> 02:43:51,439
So you can hold runners, but you should
 

6475
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:52,870
So you can hold runners, but you should
have sold a a good chunk of your

6476
02:43:52,870 --> 02:43:52,880
have sold a a good chunk of your
 

6477
02:43:52,880 --> 02:44:01,190
have sold a a good chunk of your
position for for that move through 43.

6478
02:44:01,190 --> 02:44:01,200

 

6479
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:03,269

Hopefully that made sense for you all.

6480
02:44:03,269 --> 02:44:03,279
Hopefully that made sense for you all.
 

6481
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:05,429
Hopefully that made sense for you all.
ES still not done it. All right, if ES

6482
02:44:05,429 --> 02:44:05,439
ES still not done it. All right, if ES
 

6483
02:44:05,439 --> 02:44:10,630
ES still not done it. All right, if ES
does play catchup,

6484
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:10,640

 

6485
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:12,630

what's ES got a break here? ES has got

6486
02:44:12,630 --> 02:44:12,640
what's ES got a break here? ES has got
 

6487
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:14,790
what's ES got a break here? ES has got
to get through

6488
02:44:14,790 --> 02:44:14,800
to get through
 

6489
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:17,750
to get through
6875 and really got to get back above

6490
02:44:17,750 --> 02:44:17,760
6875 and really got to get back above
 

6491
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:20,070
6875 and really got to get back above
72. But I think the spiders are going to

6492
02:44:20,070 --> 02:44:20,080
72. But I think the spiders are going to
 

6493
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:21,590
72. But I think the spiders are going to
make it harder for it to do that. That

6494
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:21,600
make it harder for it to do that. That
 

6495
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:23,910
make it harder for it to do that. That
previous day high on the spiders and

6496
02:44:23,910 --> 02:44:23,920
previous day high on the spiders and
 

6497
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:25,830
previous day high on the spiders and
that big uh block above is going to make

6498
02:44:25,830 --> 02:44:25,840
that big uh block above is going to make
 

6499
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:30,950
that big uh block above is going to make
it a little bit harder.

6500
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:30,960

 

6501
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:35,830

So again, we're still in rotation.

6502
02:44:35,830 --> 02:44:35,840

 

6503
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:37,750

I should have flipped long here. Should

6504
02:44:37,750 --> 02:44:37,760
I should have flipped long here. Should
 

6505
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:39,190
I should have flipped long here. Should
have absolutely flipped long there. The

6506
02:44:39,190 --> 02:44:39,200
have absolutely flipped long there. The
 

6507
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:40,630
have absolutely flipped long there. The
moment I stopped out, I should have been

6508
02:44:40,630 --> 02:44:40,640
moment I stopped out, I should have been
 

6509
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:42,070
moment I stopped out, I should have been
flipping long knowing that we're going

6510
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:42,080
flipping long knowing that we're going
 

6511
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:44,150
flipping long knowing that we're going
to be looking at that. But I [\h__\h]

6512
02:44:44,150 --> 02:44:44,160
to be looking at that. But I [\h__\h]
 

6513
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:46,550
to be looking at that. But I [\h__\h]
hate rotation.

6514
02:44:46,550 --> 02:44:46,560
hate rotation.
 

6515
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:48,469
hate rotation.
I hate it. There's previous day value

6516
02:44:48,469 --> 02:44:48,479
I hate it. There's previous day value
 

6517
02:44:48,479 --> 02:44:53,030
I hate it. There's previous day value
high value low point of control. Lack of

6518
02:44:53,030 --> 02:44:53,040
high value low point of control. Lack of
 

6519
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:54,870
high value low point of control. Lack of
acceptance below. Lack of acceptance

6520
02:44:54,870 --> 02:44:54,880

6521
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:57,110

6523
02:44:57,120 --> 02:44:59,910

6524
02:44:59,910 --> 02:44:59,920

6525
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:17,030
point of control. TP1 up here is TP2. If
you get it,

6526
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:17,040

 

6527
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:19,269

nice inferrisk. Good work, man. Great

6528
02:45:19,269 --> 02:45:19,279
nice inferrisk. Good work, man. Great
 

6529
02:45:19,279 --> 02:45:39,269
nice inferrisk. Good work, man. Great
work. Payout coming your way.

6530
02:45:39,269 --> 02:45:39,279

 

6531
02:45:39,279 --> 02:45:41,590

still holding. It's still holding. I

6532
02:45:41,590 --> 02:45:41,600
still holding. It's still holding. I
 

6533
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:43,110
still holding. It's still holding. I
hope you get a squeeze here, guys, for

6534
02:45:43,110 --> 02:45:43,120
hope you get a squeeze here, guys, for
 

6535
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:44,550
hope you get a squeeze here, guys, for
you guys that are long. But just be

6536
02:45:44,550 --> 02:45:44,560
you guys that are long. But just be
 

6537
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:46,309
you guys that are long. But just be
careful. This, remember, this is the

6538
02:45:46,309 --> 02:45:46,319
careful. This, remember, this is the
 

6539
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:48,630
careful. This, remember, this is the
most contested level from yesterday. And

6540
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:48,640
most contested level from yesterday. And
 

6541
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:50,870
most contested level from yesterday. And
we do have supply above, right? So, if

6542
02:45:50,870 --> 02:45:50,880
we do have supply above, right? So, if
 

6543
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:53,670
we do have supply above, right? So, if
we look left, this is a big level. This

6544
02:45:53,670 --> 02:45:53,680
we look left, this is a big level. This
 

6545
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:55,510
we look left, this is a big level. This
is where we closed yesterday. This is

6546
02:45:55,510 --> 02:45:55,520
is where we closed yesterday. This is
 

6547
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:56,950
is where we closed yesterday. This is
where the most volume was traded

6548
02:45:56,950 --> 02:45:56,960
where the most volume was traded
 

6549
02:45:56,960 --> 02:46:00,870
where the most volume was traded
yesterday, right? And overnight,

6550
02:46:00,870 --> 02:46:00,880
yesterday, right? And overnight,
 

6551
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:02,870
yesterday, right? And overnight,
right? This is a huge, huge zone in

6552
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:02,880
right? This is a huge, huge zone in
 

6553
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:05,510
right? This is a huge, huge zone in
here. Huge, huge zone. Do not expect, do

6554
02:46:05,510 --> 02:46:05,520
here. Huge, huge zone. Do not expect, do
 

6555
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:07,110
here. Huge, huge zone. Do not expect, do
not be entering long late. That's a

6556
02:46:07,110 --> 02:46:07,120
not be entering long late. That's a
 

6557
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:08,550
not be entering long late. That's a
better way of me putting it. Do not

6558
02:46:08,550 --> 02:46:08,560
better way of me putting it. Do not
 

6559
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:10,790
better way of me putting it. Do not
expect price to get through this. If it

6560
02:46:10,790 --> 02:46:10,800
expect price to get through this. If it
 

6561
02:46:10,800 --> 02:46:12,630
expect price to get through this. If it
gets through it for your runners,

6562
02:46:12,630 --> 02:46:12,640
gets through it for your runners,
 

6563
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:14,710
gets through it for your runners,
fantastic. But think about how straight

6564
02:46:14,710 --> 02:46:14,720
fantastic. But think about how straight
 

6565
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:17,510
fantastic. But think about how straight
up you've been since that hold.

6566
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:17,520
up you've been since that hold.
 

6567
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:19,910
up you've been since that hold.
Straight up since that hold. We expect

6568
02:46:19,910 --> 02:46:19,920
Straight up since that hold. We expect
 

6569
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:21,830
Straight up since that hold. We expect
failures here. We hope it doesn't fail

6570
02:46:21,830 --> 02:46:21,840
failures here. We hope it doesn't fail
 

6571
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:23,429
failures here. We hope it doesn't fail
here and you get a squeeze, but we

6572
02:46:23,429 --> 02:46:23,439
here and you get a squeeze, but we
 

6573
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:25,590
here and you get a squeeze, but we
expect this level to be highly

6574
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:25,600
expect this level to be highly
 

6575
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:35,830
expect this level to be highly
contested,

6576
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:35,840

 

6577
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:42,790

would

6578
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:42,800

 

6579
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:44,389

have, would have, should have. Could

6580
02:46:44,389 --> 02:46:44,399
have, would have, should have. Could
 

6581
02:46:44,399 --> 02:46:47,990
have, would have, should have. Could
have, would have, should have.

6582
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:48,000
have, would have, should have.
 

6583
02:46:48,000 --> 02:47:00,790
have, would have, should have.
All

6584
02:47:00,790 --> 02:47:00,800

 

6585
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:01,990

right, folks. If you haven't got any

6586
02:47:01,990 --> 02:47:02,000
right, folks. If you haven't got any
 

6587
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:03,910
right, folks. If you haven't got any
more questions, I'm going to jump out of

6588
02:47:03,910 --> 02:47:03,920
more questions, I'm going to jump out of
 

6589
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:06,150
more questions, I'm going to jump out of
here.

6590
02:47:06,150 --> 02:47:06,160
here.
 

6591
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:08,230
here.
Spy uh did just take one of the key

6592
02:47:08,230 --> 02:47:08,240
Spy uh did just take one of the key
 

6593
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:09,510
Spy uh did just take one of the key
levels. So, the only thing left for it

6594
02:47:09,510 --> 02:47:09,520
levels. So, the only thing left for it
 

6595
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:11,670
levels. So, the only thing left for it
to trade up to is 85 if it wants to go.

6596
02:47:11,670 --> 02:47:11,680
to trade up to is 85 if it wants to go.
 

6597
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:14,230
to trade up to is 85 if it wants to go.
This can this can pull back violently.

6598
02:47:14,230 --> 02:47:14,240
This can this can pull back violently.
 

6599
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:15,750
This can this can pull back violently.
It's done its main job here. All right,

6600
02:47:15,750 --> 02:47:15,760
It's done its main job here. All right,
 

6601
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:17,590
It's done its main job here. All right,
you've done the main rotation here. If

6602
02:47:17,590 --> 02:47:17,600
you've done the main rotation here. If
 

6603
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:20,309
you've done the main rotation here. If
this wants to pull all the way back down

6604
02:47:20,309 --> 02:47:20,319
this wants to pull all the way back down
 

6605
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:23,030
this wants to pull all the way back down
into where you have volume, it will.

6606
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,040
into where you have volume, it will.
 

6607
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:25,110
into where you have volume, it will.
Where's my pen? All right. So, just be

6608
02:47:25,110 --> 02:47:25,120
Where's my pen? All right. So, just be
 

6609
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:27,110
Where's my pen? All right. So, just be
careful. Those of you who are long, you

6610
02:47:27,110 --> 02:47:27,120
careful. Those of you who are long, you
 

6611
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:28,790
careful. Those of you who are long, you
don't want it to start flushing

6612
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:28,800
don't want it to start flushing
 

6613
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:30,389
don't want it to start flushing
underneath this node here. So, if it

6614
02:47:30,389 --> 02:47:30,399
underneath this node here. So, if it
 

6615
02:47:30,399 --> 02:47:32,710
underneath this node here. So, if it
loses 30, you're going to get to 600.

6616
02:47:32,710 --> 02:47:32,720
loses 30, you're going to get to 600.
 

6617
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:35,030
loses 30, you're going to get to 600.
You don't want to give back 60 odd

6618
02:47:35,030 --> 02:47:35,040
You don't want to give back 60 odd
 

6619
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:36,469
You don't want to give back 60 odd
points, do you? So, you need this to

6620
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:36,479
points, do you? So, you need this to
 

6621
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:39,190
points, do you? So, you need this to
hold 30 for a continuation. Any failure

6622
02:47:39,190 --> 02:47:39,200
hold 30 for a continuation. Any failure
 

6623
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,830
hold 30 for a continuation. Any failure
under 30, I'd be very, very cautious. I

6624
02:47:41,830 --> 02:47:41,840
under 30, I'd be very, very cautious. I
 

6625
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:43,429
under 30, I'd be very, very cautious. I
would not be adding long up here either,

6626
02:47:43,429 --> 02:47:43,439
would not be adding long up here either,
 

6627
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:45,030
would not be adding long up here either,
by the way. Those of you who took the

6628
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:45,040
by the way. Those of you who took the
 

6629
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:47,030
by the way. Those of you who took the
long here or here or here,

6630
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:47,040

Like really good trades. This long down
here slightly tougher if I'm honest.

6636
02:47:53,429 --> 02:47:53,439
here slightly tougher if I'm honest.
 

6637

confidence into your trading.

All right, folks. Any questions?
 

6675
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:39,429
All right, folks. Any questions?
Otherwise, I'm going to going to jump

6676
02:48:39,429 --> 02:48:39,439
Otherwise, I'm going to going to jump
 

6677
02:48:39,439 --> 02:48:41,910
Otherwise, I'm going to going to jump
off.

off.
 

6679
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:43,590
off.
Remember that Apex sale has just

6680
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:43,600
Remember that Apex sale has just
 

6681
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:44,950
Remember that Apex sale has just
started. What day does that end? I

6682
02:48:44,950 --> 02:48:44,960
started. What day does that end? I
 

6683
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:51,590
started. What day does that end? I
should probably let you guys know.

6684
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:51,600

 

6685
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:53,030

Here's a good sale. The more I look at

02:48:53,040 --> 02:49:04,870
Here's a good sale. The more I look at
it, the better I think it is.

6688
02:49:04,870 --> 02:49:04,880

 

6689
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:12,550

When does it end? December

6690
02:49:12,550 --> 02:49:12,560

 

6691
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:14,710

9th. Okay. So, you got you got five days

6692
02:49:14,710 --> 02:49:14,720
9th. Okay. So, you got you got five days
 

6693
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:20,230
9th. Okay. So, you got you got five days
for it. December 9th. Um, I would say

6694
02:49:20,230 --> 02:49:20,240
for it. December 9th. Um, I would say
 

6695
02:49:20,240 --> 02:49:23,030
for it. December 9th. Um, I would say
if you want the bigger accounts, now's

6696
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:23,040
if you want the bigger accounts, now's
 

6697
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:25,830
if you want the bigger accounts, now's
the time to do it. still good for 50ks

6698
02:49:25,830 --> 02:49:25,840
the time to do it. still good for 50ks
 

6699
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:27,910
the time to do it. still good for 50ks
and stuff, but if you're looking to do

6700
02:49:27,910 --> 02:49:27,920
and stuff, but if you're looking to do
 

6701
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:31,110
and stuff, but if you're looking to do
the 150, 250, or 300k accounts, now is

6702
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:31,120
the 150, 250, or 300k accounts, now is
 

6703
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:32,870
the 150, 250, or 300k accounts, now is
the time to do it because it's going to

6704
02:49:32,870 --> 02:49:32,880
the time to do it because it's going to
 

6705
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:35,830
the time to do it because it's going to
cost you

6706
02:49:35,830 --> 02:49:35,840
cost you
 

6707
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:40,469
cost you
84 bucks all in with activation.

6708
02:49:40,469 --> 02:49:40,479
84 bucks all in with activation.
 

6709
02:49:40,479 --> 02:49:41,990
84 bucks all in with activation.
That's probably the cheapest you're ever

6710
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:42,000
That's probably the cheapest you're ever
 

6711
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,910
That's probably the cheapest you're ever
going to get a 300k account for. That's

6712
02:49:43,910 --> 02:49:43,920
going to get a 300k account for. That's
 

6713
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:45,910
going to get a 300k account for. That's
insane.

6714
02:49:45,910 --> 02:49:45,920
insane.
 

6715
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:50,389
insane.
Absolutely insane.

6716
02:49:50,389 --> 02:49:50,399

 

6717
02:49:50,399 --> 02:49:52,230

Does it look like a good time to short

6718
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:52,240
Does it look like a good time to short
 

6719
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:58,389
Does it look like a good time to short
ES? Uh,

6720
02:49:58,389 --> 02:49:58,399

 

6721
02:49:58,399 --> 02:50:03,429

I mean, you're at the edge of a range.

6722
02:50:03,429 --> 02:50:03,439

 

6723
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:05,269

Momentum's been bullish. You failed to

6724
02:50:05,269 --> 02:50:05,279
Momentum's been bullish. You failed to
 

6725
02:50:05,279 --> 02:50:07,830
Momentum's been bullish. You failed to
break the low.

6726
02:50:07,830 --> 02:50:07,840
break the low.
 

6727
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:10,230
break the low.
You could try a cheap short here, but I

6728
02:50:10,230 --> 02:50:10,240
You could try a cheap short here, but I
 

6729
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:12,389
You could try a cheap short here, but I
don't love it. But, you know, I don't

6730
02:50:12,389 --> 02:50:12,399
don't love it. But, you know, I don't
 

6731
02:50:12,399 --> 02:50:13,990
don't love it. But, you know, I don't
love range rotation. But, if there's a

6732
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:14,000
love range rotation. But, if there's a
 

6733
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,429
love range rotation. But, if there's a
short here, it's probably down to this

6734
02:50:15,429 --> 02:50:15,439
short here, it's probably down to this
 

6735
02:50:15,439 --> 02:50:17,830
short here, it's probably down to this
point here. All right. And if they bid

6736
02:50:17,830 --> 02:50:17,840
point here. All right. And if they bid
 

6737
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:19,110
point here. All right. And if they bid
off that, they're going to go back for

6738
02:50:19,110 --> 02:50:19,120
off that, they're going to go back for
 

6739
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:20,630
off that, they're going to go back for
the highs. If they fail that, then

6740
02:50:20,630 --> 02:50:20,640
the highs. If they fail that, then
 

6741
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:21,670
the highs. If they fail that, then
they're going to go back for the lows.

6742
02:50:21,670 --> 02:50:21,680
they're going to go back for the lows.
 

6743
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:23,670
they're going to go back for the lows.
That's the midpoint in the range, right?

6744
02:50:23,670 --> 02:50:23,680
That's the midpoint in the range, right?
 

6745
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:25,590
That's the midpoint in the range, right?
So, it's exactly the same as ENQ. We

6746
02:50:25,590 --> 02:50:25,600
So, it's exactly the same as ENQ. We
 

6747
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:27,429
So, it's exactly the same as ENQ. We
just talked about this on ENQ. If NQ

6748
02:50:27,429 --> 02:50:27,439
just talked about this on ENQ. If NQ
 

6749
02:50:27,439 --> 02:50:30,710
just talked about this on ENQ. If NQ
can't hold uh this little node here at

6750
02:50:30,710 --> 02:50:30,720
can't hold uh this little node here at
 

6751
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:32,710
can't hold uh this little node here at
30s, which we're about to draw 28, which

6752
02:50:32,710 --> 02:50:32,720
30s, which we're about to draw 28, which
 

6753
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:34,389
30s, which we're about to draw 28, which
we're just trading into now. If it

6754
02:50:34,389 --> 02:50:34,399
we're just trading into now. If it
 

6755
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:35,830
we're just trading into now. If it
doesn't hold that, it slams all the way

6756
02:50:35,830 --> 02:50:35,840
doesn't hold that, it slams all the way
 

6757
02:50:35,840 --> 02:50:38,150
doesn't hold that, it slams all the way
down to 600. Again, why it's telling you

6758
02:50:38,150 --> 02:50:38,160
down to 600. Again, why it's telling you
 

6759
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:40,630
down to 600. Again, why it's telling you
make sure you're taking profit in the

6760
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:40,640
make sure you're taking profit in the
 

6761
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:42,790
make sure you're taking profit in the
stop hunt up here, previous days point

6762
02:50:42,790 --> 02:50:42,800
stop hunt up here, previous days point
 

6763
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:44,790
stop hunt up here, previous days point
of control, previous days close. If they

6764
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:44,800
of control, previous days close. If they
 

6765
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:46,469
of control, previous days close. If they
don't hold here, they will slide back

6766
02:50:46,469 --> 02:50:46,479
don't hold here, they will slide back
 

6767
02:50:46,479 --> 02:50:49,110
don't hold here, they will slide back
down into this area of value. I would

6768
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:49,120
down into this area of value. I would
 

6769
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:50,950
down into this area of value. I would
not rebid this either. You'd need it to

6770
02:50:50,950 --> 02:50:50,960
not rebid this either. You'd need it to
 

6771
02:50:50,960 --> 02:50:53,190
not rebid this either. You'd need it to
see it hold the top of that. But again,

6772
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:53,200
