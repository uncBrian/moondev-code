afternoon because yesterday morning was

8
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
afternoon because yesterday morning was
 

9
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,270
afternoon because yesterday morning was
rather boring, wasn't it? And uh you had

10
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
rather boring, wasn't it? And uh you had
 

11
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,869
rather boring, wasn't it? And uh you had
to be ready for that fail breakout

12
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
to be ready for that fail breakout
 

13
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,390
to be ready for that fail breakout
yesterday for the turn inside.

14
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
yesterday for the turn inside.
 

15
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,550
yesterday for the turn inside.
And uh that is the scary thing in this

16
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
And uh that is the scary thing in this
 

17
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,149
And uh that is the scary thing in this
market. As you can see on this daily

18
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
market. As you can see on this daily
 

19
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,949
market. As you can see on this daily
chart again, look at this low volume.

20
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
chart again, look at this low volume.
 

21
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,949
chart again, look at this low volume.
All right, very very low volume. Again,

22
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
All right, very very low volume. Again,
 

23
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,350
All right, very very low volume. Again,
yesterday, very, very low. Yes, we're

24
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
yesterday, very, very low. Yes, we're
 

25
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,910
yesterday, very, very low. Yes, we're
walking up, but it just has me

26
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
walking up, but it just has me
 

27
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,750
walking up, but it just has me
questioning. For sure, there is a higher

28
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
questioning. For sure, there is a higher
 

29
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,430
questioning. For sure, there is a higher
low. I would call it a soft high low on

30
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
low. I would call it a soft high low on
 

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,430
low. I would call it a soft high low on
a daily yesterday. But really, there's

32
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
a daily yesterday. But really, there's
 

33
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,990
a daily yesterday. But really, there's
no gut check of lower. It's a slow drift

34
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
no gut check of lower. It's a slow drift
 

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,550
no gut check of lower. It's a slow drift
higher. You don't want to be caught

36
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
higher. You don't want to be caught
 

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,949
higher. You don't want to be caught
buying a high off a low volume move

38
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
buying a high off a low volume move
 

39
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,470
buying a high off a low volume move
because if they want to dump it, it

40
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
because if they want to dump it, it
 

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,550
because if they want to dump it, it
won't take a lot to rotate it. And that

42
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
won't take a lot to rotate it. And that
 

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,229
won't take a lot to rotate it. And that
is the scariest thing right now is

44
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
is the scariest thing right now is
 

45
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,149
is the scariest thing right now is
trying to get long in this market

46
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
trying to get long in this market
 

47
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,509
trying to get long in this market
without seeing a daily higher low at a

48
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
without seeing a daily higher low at a
 

49
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,990
without seeing a daily higher low at a
decent area is a little bit scary. But

50
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
decent area is a little bit scary. But
 

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,830
decent area is a little bit scary. But
we are where we are. We can only trade

52
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
we are where we are. We can only trade
 

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,270
we are where we are. We can only trade
what's in front of us. Let's get into

54
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
what's in front of us. Let's get into
 

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,390
what's in front of us. Let's get into
it. We are opening up inside. Yesterday

56
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
it. We are opening up inside. Yesterday
 

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,750
it. We are opening up inside. Yesterday
had a fail breakout and a fail

58
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
had a fail breakout and a fail
 

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,190
had a fail breakout and a fail
breakdown. All right. Look below and

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
breakdown. All right. Look below and
 

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,429
breakdown. All right. Look below and
fail. That's what happened first during

62
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
fail. That's what happened first during
 

63
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,429
fail. That's what happened first during
the overnight session. And look above

64
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
the overnight session. And look above
 

65
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,190
the overnight session. And look above
and fail and trade back inside the

66
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
and fail and trade back inside the
 

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,149
and fail and trade back inside the
range. And today we are opening up

68
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
range. And today we are opening up
 

69
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,469
range. And today we are opening up
within Monday's range. All right. So

70
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
within Monday's range. All right. So
 

71
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,069
within Monday's range. All right. So
we're going to be aware of what breakout

72
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
we're going to be aware of what breakout
 

73
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,670
we're going to be aware of what breakout
versus fail breakout. It's really that

74
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
versus fail breakout. It's really that
 

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,909
versus fail breakout. It's really that
simple. And you really your key levels

76
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
simple. And you really your key levels
 

77
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,510
simple. And you really your key levels
are sort of 550. 550 here has the

78
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
are sort of 550. 550 here has the
 

79
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,510
are sort of 550. 550 here has the
ability to trigger a squeeze up towards

80
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
ability to trigger a squeeze up towards
 

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,629
ability to trigger a squeeze up towards
700 and if they get really trigger happy

82
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
700 and if they get really trigger happy
 

83
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,749
700 and if they get really trigger happy
900. All right. It also has the ability

84
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
900. All right. It also has the ability
 

85
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,230
900. All right. It also has the ability
to do a little look above and a big

86
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
to do a little look above and a big
 

87
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,350
to do a little look above and a big
dumpama back to where that low was put

88
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
dumpama back to where that low was put
 

89
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,270
dumpama back to where that low was put
in yesterday. And if it wanted to keep

90
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
in yesterday. And if it wanted to keep
 

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,150
in yesterday. And if it wanted to keep
washing to 25,000, it can. So, I'm very,

92
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
washing to 25,000, it can. So, I'm very,
 

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,710
washing to 25,000, it can. So, I'm very,
very aware of both sides of the trade. I

94
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
very aware of both sides of the trade. I
 

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,110
very aware of both sides of the trade. I
don't really want to action new

96
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
don't really want to action new
 

97
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,830
don't really want to action new
positions in here. That seems like a

98
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
positions in here. That seems like a
 

99
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,749
positions in here. That seems like a
very, very risky move. So, I really want

100
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
very, very risky move. So, I really want
 

101
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,909
very, very risky move. So, I really want
to wait to see if we do this or one of

102
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
to wait to see if we do this or one of
 

103
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,150
to wait to see if we do this or one of
these. All right, that's going to be the

104
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
these. All right, that's going to be the
 

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,909
these. All right, that's going to be the
easiest two trades that we get today.

106
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
easiest two trades that we get today.
 

107
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,670
easiest two trades that we get today.
And it is very much a C money, take

108
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
And it is very much a C money, take
 

109
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,150
And it is very much a C money, take
money kind of environment as we get into

110
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
money kind of environment as we get into
 

111
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,870
money kind of environment as we get into
that. Um, and we can look at that in a

112
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
that. Um, and we can look at that in a
 

113
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,510
that. Um, and we can look at that in a
bit more detail on the hourly chart.

114
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520

 

115
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,909

Okay. So, let's just move this down so

116
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
Okay. So, let's just move this down so
 

117
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,629
Okay. So, let's just move this down so
you can see it properly. There we go.

118
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
you can see it properly. There we go.
 

119
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,189
you can see it properly. There we go.
All right. So, still trading inside

120
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
All right. So, still trading inside
 

121
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,749
All right. So, still trading inside
yesterday's range, but key is we are

122
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
yesterday's range, but key is we are
 

123
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,990
yesterday's range, but key is we are
trading outside of the previous week

124
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
trading outside of the previous week
 

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,390
trading outside of the previous week
range. All right. We held previous

126
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
range. All right. We held previous
 

127
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,390
range. All right. We held previous
week's value area high yesterday and

128
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
week's value area high yesterday and
 

129
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,550
week's value area high yesterday and
we've created more liquidity in this

130
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
we've created more liquidity in this
 

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,469
we've created more liquidity in this
same sort of pocket here. So I'd say

132
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
same sort of pocket here. So I'd say
 

133
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,350
same sort of pocket here. So I'd say
sort of the the 300s

134
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
sort of the the 300s
 

135
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,629
sort of the the 300s
uh yeah the 300s will remain key. This

136
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
uh yeah the 300s will remain key. This
 

137
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,310
uh yeah the 300s will remain key. This
little node here if we're going to

138
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
little node here if we're going to
 

139
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,110
little node here if we're going to
continue to hold it. Now you can see as

140
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
continue to hold it. Now you can see as
 

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,510
continue to hold it. Now you can see as
we get into an old two week balance

142
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
we get into an old two week balance
 

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,790
we get into an old two week balance
range right one two that's where we're

144
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
range right one two that's where we're
 

145
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,189
range right one two that's where we're
trading into. And you can see the supply

146
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
trading into. And you can see the supply
 

147
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,950
trading into. And you can see the supply
here. And this is the problem for the

148
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
here. And this is the problem for the
 

149
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,830
here. And this is the problem for the
market right now. To be truly bullish

150
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
market right now. To be truly bullish
 

151
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,270
market right now. To be truly bullish
we're going to have to get above all of

152
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
we're going to have to get above all of
 

153
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,110
we're going to have to get above all of
this supply. Everyone's calling for oh

154
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
this supply. Everyone's calling for oh
 

155
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,950
this supply. Everyone's calling for oh
we've broken out of a trend line. Yeah.

156
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
we've broken out of a trend line. Yeah.
 

157
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,629
we've broken out of a trend line. Yeah.
Whoopydoo. Um, we have, but it's not

158
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
Whoopydoo. Um, we have, but it's not
 

159
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,950
Whoopydoo. Um, we have, but it's not
like we've broken out and this is thin

160
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
like we've broken out and this is thin
 

161
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,390
like we've broken out and this is thin
structure. All right. If we had

162
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
structure. All right. If we had
 

163
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,189
structure. All right. If we had
something like this on a profile, you

164
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
something like this on a profile, you
 

165
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,950
something like this on a profile, you
know, then we would have plenty of room

166
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
know, then we would have plenty of room
 

167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,790
know, then we would have plenty of room
to run upside. The problem is we're

168
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
to run upside. The problem is we're
 

169
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,110
to run upside. The problem is we're
trading into a very, very thick

170
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
trading into a very, very thick
 

171
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,469
trading into a very, very thick
contested area right now. All right.

172
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
contested area right now. All right.
 

173
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,629
contested area right now. All right.
This is a thick area and we still remain

174
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
This is a thick area and we still remain
 

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,309
This is a thick area and we still remain

all these buyers trapped above with
 

177
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,790
all these buyers trapped above with
relative weakness in the QQQ. I want to

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
relative weakness in the QQQ. I want to

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,430
relative weakness in the QQQ. I want to

183
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,510
long for the 550 break, what are you
getting long into? All right, just

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
getting long into? All right, just
 

185
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,430
getting long into? All right, just
remember that. All right, supply,

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
remember that. All right, supply,
 

187
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,070
remember that. All right, supply,
supply, supply, supply. Can it keep

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
supply, supply, supply. Can it keep
 

189
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,629
supply, supply, supply. Can it keep
going higher? Absolutely it can. But

190
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
going higher? Absolutely it can. But
 

191
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,550
going higher? Absolutely it can. But
it's unlikely to keep going higher off

192
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
it's unlikely to keep going higher off

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,230
it's unlikely to keep going higher off

That's one thing I would keep saying.

That's one thing I would keep saying.

Everyone looking for that up close.

Everyone looking for that up close.

Everyone looking for that up close.
Let's see.

Let's see.

So, yeah, these are the areas I'm

226
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
So, yeah, these are the areas I'm
 

227
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,510
So, yeah, these are the areas I'm
looking at. Do we break out over 515,

228
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
looking at. Do we break out over 515,
 

229
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,990
looking at. Do we break out over 515,
sustain a bid? um or are we just going

230
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
sustain a bid? um or are we just going
 

231
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,589
sustain a bid? um or are we just going
to come and test this old point of

00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
to come and test this old point of
 

233
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,909
to come and test this old point of
control 625 and find rejection around

there? I don't know. I don't know folks,

236
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
there? I don't know. I don't know folks,
 

237
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,550
there? I don't know. I don't know folks,
but these are contested areas. We will

238
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
but these are contested areas. We will
 

239
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,029
but these are contested areas. We will
trade accordingly. Overnight, you can

240
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
trade accordingly. Overnight, you can
 

241
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,070
trade accordingly. Overnight, you can
see not a whole lot happened really. If

242
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
see not a whole lot happened really. If
 

243
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,029
see not a whole lot happened really. If
we look at yesterday's

244
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
we look at yesterday's
 

245
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,990
we look at yesterday's
value area low from yesterday,

246
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
value area low from yesterday,
 

247
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,710
value area low from yesterday,
right? All we did all day was just slow

248
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
right? All we did all day was just slow
 

249
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,430
right? All we did all day was just slow
grind up, right? And eventually it had a

250
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
grind up, right? And eventually it had a
 

251
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,029
grind up, right? And eventually it had a
fail breakout and then guess what

252
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
fail breakout and then guess what
 

253
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,749
fail breakout and then guess what
happened? Well, we give back 50 plus% of

254
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
happened? Well, we give back 50 plus% of
 

255
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,670
happened? Well, we give back 50 plus% of
that move and then we went sideways. I

256
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
that move and then we went sideways. I
 

257
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,270
that move and then we went sideways. I
did try a long here yesterday to see if

258
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
did try a long here yesterday to see if
 

259
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,629
did try a long here yesterday to see if
they wanted to reclaim. They didn't have

260
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
they wanted to reclaim. They didn't have
 

261
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,230
they wanted to reclaim. They didn't have
the juice to do it. So, we went sideways

262
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
the juice to do it. So, we went sideways
 

263
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,869
the juice to do it. So, we went sideways
and uh Asia couldn't take out

264
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
and uh Asia couldn't take out
 

265
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,670
and uh Asia couldn't take out
yesterday's high, failed, came back down

266
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
yesterday's high, failed, came back down
 

267
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,029
yesterday's high, failed, came back down
to this pivot low. London washed Asia,

268
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
to this pivot low. London washed Asia,
 

269
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,110
to this pivot low. London washed Asia,
found a bid and has come back up and

270
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
found a bid and has come back up and
 

271
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,790
found a bid and has come back up and
taken out yesterday's high. All right,

272
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
taken out yesterday's high. All right,
 

273
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,909
taken out yesterday's high. All right,
so this is where we're at now.

274
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
so this is where we're at now.
 

275
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,790
so this is where we're at now.
We are bullish in this rotation but as

276
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
We are bullish in this rotation but as
 

277
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,430
We are bullish in this rotation but as
you can see big red box up here right

278
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
you can see big red box up here right
 

279
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,430
you can see big red box up here right
into that big chunky supply. We have

280
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
into that big chunky supply. We have
 

281
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,230
into that big chunky supply. We have
that overnight high from uh Sunday

282
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
that overnight high from uh Sunday
 

283
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,870
that overnight high from uh Sunday
still. So 550 is still a level where

284
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
still. So 550 is still a level where
 

285
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,350
still. So 550 is still a level where
it's left stop. So I am aware of that.

286
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
it's left stop. So I am aware of that.
 

287
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,630
it's left stop. So I am aware of that.
Let's move into this lower time frame.

288
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
Let's move into this lower time frame.
 

289
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,149
Let's move into this lower time frame.
You can see here the London traders

290
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
You can see here the London traders
 

291
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,389
You can see here the London traders
grabbing that pivot and dragging us

292
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
grabbing that pivot and dragging us
 

293
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,470
grabbing that pivot and dragging us
higher. Uh notably as well that pivot

294
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
higher. Uh notably as well that pivot
 

295
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,509
higher. Uh notably as well that pivot
was right on sort of the top of that

296
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
was right on sort of the top of that
 

297
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,430
was right on sort of the top of that
value. Let's just go back to it so you

298
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
value. Let's just go back to it so you
 

299
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,389
value. Let's just go back to it so you
can see it on top of this value previous

300
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
can see it on top of this value previous
 

301
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,310
can see it on top of this value previous
week value. This area here is the

302
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
week value. This area here is the
 

303
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,150
week value. This area here is the
contested area. I say all the time we're

304
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
contested area. I say all the time we're
 

305
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,070
contested area. I say all the time we're
holding that bulls have the ability to

306
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
holding that bulls have the ability to
 

307
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,829
holding that bulls have the ability to
rotate. But if we take liquidity and

308
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
rotate. But if we take liquidity and
 

309
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,750
rotate. But if we take liquidity and
fail under that, you want to watch out

310
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
fail under that, you want to watch out
 

311
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,750
fail under that, you want to watch out
because you can see notice how thin we

312
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
because you can see notice how thin we
 

313
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,230
because you can see notice how thin we
get down here, right? So if we start

314
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
get down here, right? So if we start
 

315
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,630
get down here, right? So if we start
losing these levels, it shouldn't take

316
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
losing these levels, it shouldn't take
 

317
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,310
losing these levels, it shouldn't take
too much to get us back to there. So

318
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
too much to get us back to there. So
 

319
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,750
too much to get us back to there. So
that's why I want to be cautious about

320
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
that's why I want to be cautious about
 

321
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,630
that's why I want to be cautious about
getting long at the highs. All right,

322
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
getting long at the highs. All right,
 

323
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,230
getting long at the highs. All right,
let's go through some of the other uh

324
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
let's go through some of the other uh
 

325
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,150
let's go through some of the other uh
key levels on the other indexes. Move

326
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
key levels on the other indexes. Move
 

327
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,870
key levels on the other indexes. Move
this to a 5m minute ES. All right, ES

328
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
this to a 5m minute ES. All right, ES
 

329
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,389
this to a 5m minute ES. All right, ES
has had relative strength in case you're

330
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
has had relative strength in case you're
 

331
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,310
has had relative strength in case you're
not aware of that. All right, we're

332
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
not aware of that. All right, we're
 

333
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,030
not aware of that. All right, we're
right up near the highs right now on ES.

334
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
right up near the highs right now on ES.
 

335
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,750
right up near the highs right now on ES.
It's an impressive move again into a

336
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
It's an impressive move again into a
 

337
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,990
It's an impressive move again into a
supply zone.

338
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
supply zone.
 

339
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,550
supply zone.
But if you know we can get one of these

340
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
But if you know we can get one of these
 

341
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,389
But if you know we can get one of these
looks and they are going to sustain the

342
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
looks and they are going to sustain the
 

343
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,550
looks and they are going to sustain the
bid and alltime highs really isn't far

344
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
bid and alltime highs really isn't far
 

345
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,670
bid and alltime highs really isn't far
away and neither is uh the 7,000 which

346
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
away and neither is uh the 7,000 which
 

347
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,509
away and neither is uh the 7,000 which
you've got to imagine is where it's

348
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
you've got to imagine is where it's
 

349
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,110
you've got to imagine is where it's
trying to go right now. All right, two

350
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
trying to go right now. All right, two
 

351
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,430
trying to go right now. All right, two
leg pullback.

352
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
leg pullback.
 

353
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,150
leg pullback.
Can it hold right? Can it hold or build

354
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
Can it hold right? Can it hold or build
 

355
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,949
Can it hold right? Can it hold or build
liquidity here to get up to 7,000?

356
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
liquidity here to get up to 7,000?
 

357
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,470
liquidity here to get up to 7,000?
That's what we're looking for in ES. The

358
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
That's what we're looking for in ES. The
 

359
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,550
That's what we're looking for in ES. The
one thing I do want to go over is the

360
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
one thing I do want to go over is the
 

361
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,389
one thing I do want to go over is the
spiders.

362
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
spiders.
 

363
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,389
spiders.
Spiders has a couple big gamma levels

364
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
Spiders has a couple big gamma levels
 

365
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,910
Spiders has a couple big gamma levels
right now. Uh 80s is one of them. 680s.

366
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
right now. Uh 80s is one of them. 680s.
 

367
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,590
right now. Uh 80s is one of them. 680s.
Now we're opening up above that. But

368
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
Now we're opening up above that. But
 

369
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,949
Now we're opening up above that. But
this level right in here, all right,

370
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
this level right in here, all right,
 

371
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,350
this level right in here, all right,
that is a big gamma level. If you lose

372
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
that is a big gamma level. If you lose
 

373
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,030
that is a big gamma level. If you lose
that, there's gap fill potential. All

374
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
that, there's gap fill potential. All
 

375
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,790
that, there's gap fill potential. All
right, so just be aware of that today.

376
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
right, so just be aware of that today.
 

377
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,590
right, so just be aware of that today.
If they fail to break out, I'd say

378
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
If they fail to break out, I'd say
 

379
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,310
If they fail to break out, I'd say
probably the 85s and they lose 80s and

380
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
probably the 85s and they lose 80s and
 

381
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,870
probably the 85s and they lose 80s and
back test it, there's a deeper wash. So

382
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
back test it, there's a deeper wash. So
 

383
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,069
back test it, there's a deeper wash. So
it probably worth setting a uh alert

384
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
it probably worth setting a uh alert
 

385
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:46,482
it probably worth setting a uh alert
there.

386
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:46,492

 

387
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:52,710

389
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,990

>> All right. So, that's where weakness

390
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
>> All right. So, that's where weakness
 

391
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,069
>> All right. So, that's where weakness
will come in if we start staying heavy

392
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
will come in if we start staying heavy
 

393
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,910
will come in if we start staying heavy
under 680 until that point. You can see

394
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
under 680 until that point. You can see
 

395
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,310
under 680 until that point. You can see
we're gapping up. So, it looks pretty

396
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
we're gapping up. So, it looks pretty
 

397
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,069
we're gapping up. So, it looks pretty
good. Uh Q's the same thing. Dixie,

398
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
good. Uh Q's the same thing. Dixie,
 

399
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,829
good. Uh Q's the same thing. Dixie,
it's starting to get messy on the 10

it's starting to get messy on the 10
 

401

it's starting to get messy on the 10
year and 30-year and Dixie, but here you

402
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
year and 30-year and Dixie, but here you
 

403
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,910
year and 30-year and Dixie, but here you
go. It's trying to form this base.

404
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
go. It's trying to form this base.
 

405

go. It's trying to form this base.
All right, it's trying to form this base

All right, it's trying to form this base
 

407

All right, it's trying to form this base
to go higher.

408
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279

412
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
the one broke out of alltime highs. That
 

413
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,509
the one broke out of alltime highs. That
thing will probably have to stop at some

414
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
thing will probably have to stop at some
 

415
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,350
thing will probably have to stop at some
point soon. But you can see we're just

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
point soon. But you can see we're just
 

417
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,949
point soon. But you can see we're just
going into like a two, three month

418
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
going into like a two, three month
 

419

whether it can break on out or not will
 

425
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,069
whether it can break on out or not will
be key. VIX. All right, VIX still

426
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
be key. VIX. All right, VIX still

All right, back down into the sort of

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
All right, back down into the sort of
 

431
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,030
All right, back down into the sort of
mid teens. Remember, the volatility dies

432
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
mid teens. Remember, the volatility dies
 

433
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,630
mid teens. Remember, the volatility dies
down as you can see once we get down

434
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
down as you can see once we get down
 

435
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,949
down as you can see once we get down
here. So, VIX can't find a bid. We

436
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
here. So, VIX can't find a bid. We
 

437
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,190
here. So, VIX can't find a bid. We
expect lower volatility days and

438
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
expect lower volatility days and
 

439
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,190
expect lower volatility days and
probably more slow, grindy days like we

440
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
probably more slow, grindy days like we
 

441
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,829
probably more slow, grindy days like we
had yesterday. Uh, the one thing I do

442
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
had yesterday. Uh, the one thing I do
 

443
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,710
had yesterday. Uh, the one thing I do
want to keep one eye on is this guy

444
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
want to keep one eye on is this guy
 

445
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,710
want to keep one eye on is this guy
right here. All right, the 10-year and

446
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
right here. All right, the 10-year and
 

447
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,389
right here. All right, the 10-year and
the 30-year. I've been calling for this

448
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
the 30-year. I've been calling for this
 

449
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,389
the 30-year. I've been calling for this
for a while. I think they're going to

450
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
for a while. I think they're going to
 

451
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,190
for a while. I think they're going to
need to be very careful. If this starts

452
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
need to be very careful. If this starts
 

453
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,629
need to be very careful. If this starts
breaking out, we are going to see

454
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
breaking out, we are going to see
 

455
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,470
breaking out, we are going to see
weakness come in the market. There's no

456
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
weakness come in the market. There's no
 

457
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,150
weakness come in the market. There's no
doubt about it. All right, there's the

458
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
doubt about it. All right, there's the
 

459
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,430
doubt about it. All right, there's the
30-year doing the same. So, you want to

460
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
30-year doing the same. So, you want to
 

461
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,030
30-year doing the same. So, you want to
be careful. All right, we've just

462
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
be careful. All right, we've just
 

463
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,509
be careful. All right, we've just
washed. We're starting to reclaim. If

464
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
washed. We're starting to reclaim. If
 

465
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,430
washed. We're starting to reclaim. If
this starts going, it's going to force

466
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
this starts going, it's going to force
 

467
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,790
this starts going, it's going to force
some pressure on the market. So, one

468
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
some pressure on the market. So, one
 

469
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,790
some pressure on the market. So, one
thing I'd be very, very aware of. All

470
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
thing I'd be very, very aware of. All
 

471
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,870
thing I'd be very, very aware of. All
right, let's get into the mag.

472
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880

 

473
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,190

There we go.

474
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
There we go.
 

475
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,750
There we go.
Right, Apple gapping down and it closed

476
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
Right, Apple gapping down and it closed
 

477
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,870
Right, Apple gapping down and it closed
yesterday at those alltime highs.

478
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
yesterday at those alltime highs.
 

479
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,710
yesterday at those alltime highs.
There might have been a wick higher

480
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
There might have been a wick higher
 

481
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,829
There might have been a wick higher
based on uh I think there was an

482
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
based on uh I think there was an
 

483
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,910
based on uh I think there was an
earnings there we go the earnings up to

484
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
earnings there we go the earnings up to
 

485
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,829
earnings there we go the earnings up to
85. So there is a wick higher but in

486
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
85. So there is a wick higher but in
 

487
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,069
85. So there is a wick higher but in
terms of a close and a daily it closed

488
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
terms of a close and a daily it closed
 

489
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,949
terms of a close and a daily it closed
at alltime highs and pulling back

490
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
at alltime highs and pulling back
 

491
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,790
at alltime highs and pulling back
because Apple dragged the market up

492
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
because Apple dragged the market up
 

493
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,350
because Apple dragged the market up
yesterday. You can see just this squeeze

494
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
yesterday. You can see just this squeeze
 

495
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,190
yesterday. You can see just this squeeze
all day long once it got outside of the

496
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
all day long once it got outside of the
 

497
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,990
all day long once it got outside of the
initial balance. All right. So probably

498
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
initial balance. All right. So probably
 

499
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,670
initial balance. All right. So probably
going to offer a pullback today and then

500
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
going to offer a pullback today and then
 

501
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,870
going to offer a pullback today and then
see if they bid off sort of 280 or not

502
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
see if they bid off sort of 280 or not
 

503
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,949
see if they bid off sort of 280 or not
for a continuation trade on Apple. So

504
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
for a continuation trade on Apple. So
 

505
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,310
for a continuation trade on Apple. So
pretty strong there but pulling back

506
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
pretty strong there but pulling back
 

507
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,030
pretty strong there but pulling back
this morning. Amazon starting to like

510
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
get going here which I'm pretty happy
 

511
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,790
get going here which I'm pretty happy
about. I'm still holding my core

512
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
about. I'm still holding my core
 

513
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,509
about. I'm still holding my core
position from months ago now. But this

514
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
position from months ago now. But this
 

515
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,190
position from months ago now. But this
level here is going to be key. All

516
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
level here is going to be key. All
 

517
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,750
level here is going to be key. All
right. You can see this old wick here.

518
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
right. You can see this old wick here.
 

519
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,710

That's where we failed from. This is a

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
That's where we failed from. This is a
 

525
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,430
That's where we failed from. This is a
back test.

526
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
back test.

You'd expect some sell pressure to come

528
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
You'd expect some sell pressure to come
 

529
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,430
You'd expect some sell pressure to come
in here soon on Amazon. Just be aware of

530
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
in here soon on Amazon. Just be aware of
 

531
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,910
in here soon on Amazon. Just be aware of
that if you're trading Amazon, but still

532
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
that if you're trading Amazon, but still
 

533
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,150
that if you're trading Amazon, but still
gapping up. Looking good, but you want

534
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
gapping up. Looking good, but you want
 

535
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,590
gapping up. Looking good, but you want
to be careful as you get into those

536
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
to be careful as you get into those
 

537
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,550
to be careful as you get into those
levels. It's been a nice drive off these

538
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
levels. It's been a nice drive off these
 

539
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,629
levels. It's been a nice drive off these
lows. You can see from last week really

540
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
lows. You can see from last week really
 

541
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,629

really good drive. That's uh no joke

right. bouncy ball getting slower and
slower. If it starts to turn around, you

554
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
slower. If it starts to turn around, you
 

555
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,389
slower. If it starts to turn around, you
might see an explosive move. If it can't

556
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
might see an explosive move. If it can't
 

557
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,310
might see an explosive move. If it can't
turn around, then you know, watch out.

Only a small position. Didn't size into

was going to give back more weakness but

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
was going to give back more weakness but
 

575
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,389
was going to give back more weakness but
apparently not. So gap fill potential

576
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
apparently not. So gap fill potential
 

577
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,710
apparently not. So gap fill potential
here. See how we act at high of day. You

have to be watching for a fail breakout

580
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
have to be watching for a fail breakout
 

581
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,629
have to be watching for a fail breakout
on a turn back inside. Same kind of

on a turn back inside. Same kind of
 

583
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,670
on a turn back inside. Same kind of
story. Target right now is back towards

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
story. Target right now is back towards
 

585
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,829
story. Target right now is back towards
these 90s. Right. That's the target. It

00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
these 90s. Right. That's the target. It
 

587
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,910
these 90s. Right. That's the target. It
can still put in a lower high but was

588
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
can still put in a lower high but was
 

589
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,069
can still put in a lower high but was
due this bounce here. I want to see how

590
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
due this bounce here. I want to see how
 

591
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,829
due this bounce here. I want to see how
we act if we can get up to 690 ideally.

592
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
we act if we can get up to 690 ideally.

Break out here. Consolidation breakout

606
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
Break out here. Consolidation breakout
 

607
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,310
Break out here. Consolidation breakout
starting to come back down to this. And

608
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
starting to come back down to this. And
 

609
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,470
starting to come back down to this. And
can they find a bid for that

610
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
can they find a bid for that
 

611
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,389
can they find a bid for that
continuation? And this is the liquidity

612
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
continuation? And this is the liquidity
 

613
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,069
continuation? And this is the liquidity
that they're going to need to use. So

614
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
that they're going to need to use. So
 

615
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,069
that they're going to need to use. So
all the time they're holding 80s,

616
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
all the time they're holding 80s,
 

617
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,230
all the time they're holding 80s,
they're going to look to try and bid up

618
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
they're going to look to try and bid up
 

619
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,670
they're going to look to try and bid up
through 95.

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
higher low and now trying to break out.
 

633
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,750

you can see where the supply is. 84
 

637
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,350
you can see where the supply is. 84
to sort of 82s. That's your first level

638
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
to sort of 82s. That's your first level
 

639
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,949
to sort of 82s. That's your first level
to get through. Base over that, you've

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
to get through. Base over that, you've
 

641
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,790
to get through. Base over that, you've
got a shot of getting back to 200s. But

642
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
got a shot of getting back to 200s. But
 

643
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,470
got a shot of getting back to 200s. But
that's the level to get through. All

right, that is absolutely the level to
 

647
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,749
right, that is absolutely the level to
get through.

648
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759

For me, I'd be very cautious about

650
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:55,600
For me, I'd be very cautious about
 

651
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,829
For me, I'd be very cautious about
thinking long on Nvidia at the moment.

652
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
thinking long on Nvidia at the moment.
 

653
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,230
thinking long on Nvidia at the moment.
Um, I think you're in just in a range

654
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
Um, I think you're in just in a range
 

655
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,269
Um, I think you're in just in a range
here. It might coil and go

656
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
here. It might coil and go
 

657
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,710
here. It might coil and go
and it definitely has put in a higher

658
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
and it definitely has put in a higher
 

659
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,310
and it definitely has put in a higher
low, but this is still a range. This can

660
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
low, but this is still a range. This can
 

661
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,670
low, but this is still a range. This can
come back down and test the other side

662
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
come back down and test the other side
 

663
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,269
come back down and test the other side
of the range. And we can do this for a

664
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
of the range. And we can do this for a
 

665
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,350
of the range. And we can do this for a
long time. Like I talked about December

666
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
long time. Like I talked about December
 

667
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,990
long time. Like I talked about December

670
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
moves, which is why had a really good
 

671
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,749
moves, which is why had a really good
year. I want to be cautious going into

672
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
year. I want to be cautious going into
 

673
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,030

not too eager to do much this morning
given where we're opening. I want to see

780
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
given where we're opening. I want to see
 

781
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,350
given where we're opening. I want to see
if we do a failed breakout or a breakout

782
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
if we do a failed breakout or a breakout
 

783
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,430
if we do a failed breakout or a breakout
really. And uh I'm not really too keen

784
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
really. And uh I'm not really too keen
 

785
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,990
really. And uh I'm not really too keen
to buy this market back until we get

786
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
to buy this market back until we get
 

787
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,990
to buy this market back until we get
down into sort of 25,000 24900s. Really

788
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
down into sort of 25,000 24900s. Really
 

789
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,909
down into sort of 25,000 24900s. Really
24900 is a better level that I'd be

790
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
24900 is a better level that I'd be
 

791
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,110
24900 is a better level that I'd be
interested in taking a buy position.

792
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
interested in taking a buy position.
 

793
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,950
interested in taking a buy position.
So yeah, that's a lot lower right now,

794
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
So yeah, that's a lot lower right now,
 

795
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,669
So yeah, that's a lot lower right now,
isn't it? right 5 600 points lower. So,

796
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
isn't it? right 5 600 points lower. So,
 

797
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,110
isn't it? right 5 600 points lower. So,
let's just see. Let's just see

798
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120
let's just see. Let's just see
 

799
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,190
let's just see. Let's just see
see if the uh market can inject some

800
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
see if the uh market can inject some
 

801
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,669
see if the uh market can inject some
volume today or not because yesterday

802
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
volume today or not because yesterday
 

803
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,470
volume today or not because yesterday
was a very lackluster.

804
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
was a very lackluster.
 

805
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,350
was a very lackluster.
Felt like a holiday hangover

806
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
Felt like a holiday hangover
 

807
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,870
Felt like a holiday hangover
and right now we're just opening up

808
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
and right now we're just opening up

810
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
inside Monday
 

811
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,549
inside Monday
and uh not too far off from Friday as

812
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
and uh not too far off from Friday as
 

813
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,390
and uh not too far off from Friday as
well. So, let's just see what they want

814
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400

815
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,270
well. So, let's just see what they want
to do with this market.

816
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280

 

817
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,590

Did anyone trade yesterday afternoon?

818
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
Did anyone trade yesterday afternoon?
 

819
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,270
Did anyone trade yesterday afternoon?
Did any of you catch something good in

820
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
Did any of you catch something good in
 

821
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,549
Did any of you catch something good in
the afternoon session?

822
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559

 

823
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,070

What are you guys looking for today?

824
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
What are you guys looking for today?
 

825
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,909
What are you guys looking for today?
Same things as me or have you got other

826
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
Same things as me or have you got other
 

827
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,029
Same things as me or have you got other
plans? Is it buy and close your eyes?

828
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
plans? Is it buy and close your eyes?
 

829
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,310
plans? Is it buy and close your eyes?
Are any of you in that kind of

830
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,320
Are any of you in that kind of
 

831
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,893
Are any of you in that kind of
territory?

832
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:03,903
territory?
 

833
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:12,789
territory?
[snorts]

834
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799

 

835
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,470

All right, here's the 500 test. [snorts]

836
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:16,480
All right, here's the 500 test. [snorts]
 

837
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,710
All right, here's the 500 test. [snorts]
Let's see how we act

838
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
Let's see how we act
 

839
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,549
Let's see how we act
at those uh 550s. And if we get going

840
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:22,559
at those uh 550s. And if we get going
 

841
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,870
at those uh 550s. And if we get going
through that, then imagine there's 100

842
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
through that, then imagine there's 100
 

843
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,950
through that, then imagine there's 100
points in it for that old point of

844
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
points in it for that old point of
 

845
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,310
points in it for that old point of
control check to 650.

846
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
control check to 650.
 

847
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,310
control check to 650.
So if they get over 550 in base, I'd

848
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
So if they get over 550 in base, I'd
 

849
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,830
So if they get over 550 in base, I'd
imagine there's potentially a move to

850
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840
imagine there's potentially a move to
 

851
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,149
imagine there's potentially a move to
650. If they get over 550 and they fail,

852
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
650. If they get over 550 and they fail,
 

853
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,830
650. If they get over 550 and they fail,
imagine there's a rotational play back

854
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
imagine there's a rotational play back
 

855
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,390
imagine there's a rotational play back
down.

856
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
down.
 

857
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,710
down.
Nice address. Uh, one thing I also

858
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
Nice address. Uh, one thing I also
 

859
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,149
Nice address. Uh, one thing I also
wanted to say, do any of you know how I

860
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159
wanted to say, do any of you know how I
 

861
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,830
wanted to say, do any of you know how I
change your names back? Is that is that

862
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840
change your names back? Is that is that
 

863
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,070
change your names back? Is that is that
setting I need to look at? Because it's

864
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
setting I need to look at? Because it's
 

865
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,669
setting I need to look at? Because it's
uh I can't tell who half of you are now,

866
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,679
uh I can't tell who half of you are now,
 

867
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,390
uh I can't tell who half of you are now,
which is a shame

868
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
which is a shame
 

869
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,990
which is a shame
after we've been streaming for 15

870
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
after we've been streaming for 15
 

871

after we've been streaming for 15
months.

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760

 

873
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,990

So, SPY failing to take out yesterday's

874
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
So, SPY failing to take out yesterday's
 

875

didn't quite fill the gap yesterday on
 

881
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,710
didn't quite fill the gap yesterday on
SPY. One thing to be aware of, we did

882
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
SPY. One thing to be aware of, we did
 

883
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,149
SPY. One thing to be aware of, we did
fill it on the cues.

884
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
fill it on the cues.
 

885
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,149

889
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,310
come and take out the the uh 550s?
Tesla's gone red. Apple's gone red.

anything, it's given back. But Nvidia
 

903
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:56,549
anything, it's given back. But Nvidia
with a bit of a squeeze on this morning.

904
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559

 

905
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,310

It's a YouTube thing, is it? It's quite

906
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
It's a YouTube thing, is it? It's quite
 

907
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,510
It's a YouTube thing, is it? It's quite
annoying that they've done that

908
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520

 

909
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,350

cuz now I don't know who half of you

910
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
cuz now I don't know who half of you
 

911

912
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880

 

913
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,230

I'm just waiting here to see if we take

914
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm just waiting here to see if we take
 

915
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,990
I'm just waiting here to see if we take
out 550s and then how we act.

916
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000

 

917
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,029

SPY trading downside still while the Q's

918
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:23,039
SPY trading downside still while the Q's
 

919
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,870
SPY trading downside still while the Q's
are squeezing. So relative strength in

920
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
are squeezing. So relative strength in
 

921
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,750
are squeezing. So relative strength in
the NQ today. That will all just be down

922
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
the NQ today. That will all just be down
 

923
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,270
the NQ today. That will all just be down
to video.

924
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280

 

925
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,545

All down to video.

926
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:34,555
All down to video.
 

927
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:41,669
All down to video.
[cough]

928
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679

 

929
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,270

Yeah, big old squeeze this morning from

930
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
Yeah, big old squeeze this morning from
 

931
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,350
Yeah, big old squeeze this morning from
Nvidia. Starting to break out through

932
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
Nvidia. Starting to break out through
 

933
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,669
Nvidia. Starting to break out through
that balanced range. And you'd imagine

934
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
that balanced range. And you'd imagine
 

935
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,909
that balanced range. And you'd imagine
it probably going to test 88. If it

936
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
it probably going to test 88. If it
 

937
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,789
it probably going to test 88. If it
really gets going today, it can really

965
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,070
weekly point of control 620s,
right? All right. So, how we act here,

966
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
right? All right. So, how we act here,
 

967
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,750
right? All right. So, how we act here,
this red line is important.

968
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760

 

969
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,029

And if we get through that, maybe 620s

970
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
And if we get through that, maybe 620s
 

971
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,430
And if we get through that, maybe 620s
if they continue to squeeze squeeze.

972
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
if they continue to squeeze squeeze.

changed everything to try and be a
 

983
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,110
changed everything to try and be a
subscription like Greedy Buggers. So,

984
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
subscription like Greedy Buggers. So,
 

985
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,510
subscription like Greedy Buggers. So,
they got binned off.

986
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520

 

987
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,789

So, I'd say how we operate at 550 now

996
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
So, I'd say how we operate at 550 now
 

997

range. I'm interested how we act. 620,

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,789
daily yesterday, but of no volume, it's
kind of hard to uh give it too much

1096
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
kind of hard to uh give it too much
 

1097
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,190
kind of hard to uh give it too much
credit, but uh let's just see. Market

1098
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
credit, but uh let's just see. Market
 

1099
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:11,590
credit, but uh let's just see. Market
will do whatever it wants.

1100
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600

 

1101
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,669

First hesitation here on Nvidia that

1102
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
First hesitation here on Nvidia that
 

1103
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,710
First hesitation here on Nvidia that
we've seen this morning. Not at the 86s

1104
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
we've seen this morning. Not at the 86s
 

1105
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,830
we've seen this morning. Not at the 86s
yet, but still above the 85s.

1106
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
yet, but still above the 85s.
 

1107
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,510
yet, but still above the 85s.
still think this can get up into this

1108
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,520
still think this can get up into this
 

1109
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,549
still think this can get up into this
old point of control. So 620 to 680 is a

1110
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
old point of control. So 620 to 680 is a
 

1111
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,990
old point of control. So 620 to 680 is a
level of interest if we get through

1112
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
level of interest if we get through
 

1113
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,029
level of interest if we get through
that. Well, you can't rule out the 800s.

1114
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
that. Well, you can't rule out the 800s.
 

1115
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,549
that. Well, you can't rule out the 800s.
You really can't. But I don't think we

1116
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:30,559
You really can't. But I don't think we
 

1117
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,669
You really can't. But I don't think we
do it in a straight move up, but or we

1118
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:33,679
do it in a straight move up, but or we
 

1119
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,430
do it in a straight move up, but or we
shouldn't. I should say we shouldn't do

1120
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
shouldn't. I should say we shouldn't do
 

1121
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,110
shouldn't. I should say we shouldn't do
it in a straight move up. It might well

1122
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
it in a straight move up. It might well
 

1123
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,710
it in a straight move up. It might well
do it in a straight move up. You've seen

1124
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:38,720
do it in a straight move up. You've seen
 

1125
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:50,870
do it in a straight move up. You've seen
this market do it before.

1126
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:50,880

 

1127
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,549

Look at this. Just straight squeeze.

1128
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
Look at this. Just straight squeeze.
 

1129
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,230
Look at this. Just straight squeeze.
This will end at some point. There's no

1130
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
This will end at some point. There's no
 

1131
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,669
This will end at some point. There's no
structure being built out here

1132
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
structure being built out here
 

1133
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,430
structure being built out here
whatsoever.

1134
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440

 

1135
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,350

Struggling to find buyers above 600

1136
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
Struggling to find buyers above 600
 

1137
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,549
Struggling to find buyers above 600
right now. I don't think that will last

1138
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:02,559
right now. I don't think that will last
 

1139
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,230
right now. I don't think that will last
too long. I think they will find buyers

1140
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
too long. I think they will find buyers
 

1141
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,149
too long. I think they will find buyers
above 600.

1142
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:06,159
above 600.
 

1143
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,950
above 600.
Doesn't look like an end of auction yet.

1144
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:10,960

 

1145
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,789

I'm watching a video at that 185.

1146
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:14,799
I'm watching a video at that 185.
 

1147
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:24,950
I'm watching a video at that 185.
It holds a bit there or not.

1148
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960

 

1149
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,750

Big transactions coming in here. Vidia

1150
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
Big transactions coming in here. Vidia
 

1151
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,230
Big transactions coming in here. Vidia
under that 85. Here's your first

1152
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
under that 85. Here's your first
 

1153
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,630
under that 85. Here's your first
pullback. How they operate now is going

1154
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:32,640
pullback. How they operate now is going
 

1155
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,149
pullback. How they operate now is going
to be key. Let's get some volume on

1156
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
to be key. Let's get some volume on
 

1157
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,029
to be key. Let's get some volume on
here.

1158
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,039

 

1159
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:49,990

There you go. It's your edge.

1160
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000

 

1161
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,029

I don't think this has finished

1162
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039
I don't think this has finished
 

1163
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,789
I don't think this has finished
auctioning high yet. I don't think we

1164
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
auctioning high yet. I don't think we
 

1165
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,789
auctioning high yet. I don't think we
high yet.

1166
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:56,799

 

1167
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,470

Failed another attempt up there, mind

1168
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
Failed another attempt up there, mind
 

1169
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:06,230
Failed another attempt up there, mind
you. But

1170
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240

 

1171
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,789

get it back over 185. I still think this

1172
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
get it back over 185. I still think this
 

1173
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,389
get it back over 185. I still think this
potentially got more in it before it

1174
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
potentially got more in it before it
 

1175
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,990
potentially got more in it before it
pulls back. And when it pulls back, it's

1176
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
pulls back. And when it pulls back, it's
 

1177
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,590
pulls back. And when it pulls back, it's
probably going to get pretty violent.

1178
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
probably going to get pretty violent.
 

1179
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,590
probably going to get pretty violent.
It's a decent 50 point pull back there.

1180
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
It's a decent 50 point pull back there.
 

1181
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:26,070
It's a decent 50 point pull back there.
So, just be aware of that.

1182
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080

 

1183
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,830

Starting to see heavier delta come in

1184
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
Starting to see heavier delta come in
 

1185
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,830
Starting to see heavier delta come in
here sellside. Trying to flip the book

1186
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
here sellside. Trying to flip the book
 

1187
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,789
here sellside. Trying to flip the book
here a little bit. Still just dancing in

1188
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799
here a little bit. Still just dancing in
 

1189
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,230
here a little bit. Still just dancing in
this range. I'm still not convinced

1190
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
this range. I'm still not convinced
 

1191
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,149
this range. I'm still not convinced
we've had a high put in, but there we

1192
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:36,159
we've had a high put in, but there we
 

1193
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,549
we've had a high put in, but there we
go. back down into the edge of this

1194
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:38,559
go. back down into the edge of this
 

1195
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:54,950
go. back down into the edge of this
volume. Nvidia giving up 85.

1196
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960

 

1197
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,549

Watching the edge of this volume in case

1198
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
Watching the edge of this volume in case
 

1199
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,590
Watching the edge of this volume in case
they lose it or a 50 point drift down,

1200
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,600
they lose it or a 50 point drift down,
 

1201
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,510
they lose it or a 50 point drift down,
but I'm still not convinced we put in

1202
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
but I'm still not convinced we put in
 

1203
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,430
but I'm still not convinced we put in
that high yet. Just looking at the

1204
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,440
that high yet. Just looking at the
 

1205
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,350
that high yet. Just looking at the
volume up there. There's the loss of it.

1206
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360
volume up there. There's the loss of it.
 

1207
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,029
volume up there. There's the loss of it.
Oh, we missed that.

1208
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039
Oh, we missed that.
 

1209
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,710
Oh, we missed that.
Just talked about that. Probably missed

1210
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:10,720
Just talked about that. Probably missed
 

1211
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,389
Just talked about that. Probably missed
it. Want to be careful of the bear trap

1212
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
it. Want to be careful of the bear trap
 

1213
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,870
it. Want to be careful of the bear trap
here. I'm not convinced that high days

1214
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880
here. I'm not convinced that high days
 

1215
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,350
here. I'm not convinced that high days
in, but we did just flip the book delta

1216
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,360
in, but we did just flip the book delta
 

1217
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:26,870
in, but we did just flip the book delta
wise.

1218
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:26,880

 

1219
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,710

Can be a deep drive here if they let it

1220
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
Can be a deep drive here if they let it
 

1221
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,269
Can be a deep drive here if they let it
go.

1222
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:31,279
go.
 

1223
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,310
go.
One 185 on Nvidia still been reclaimed.

1224
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,320
One 185 on Nvidia still been reclaimed.
 

1225
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,070
One 185 on Nvidia still been reclaimed.
So, I'm not convinced yet. I think

1226
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
So, I'm not convinced yet. I think
 

1227
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,470
So, I'm not convinced yet. I think
Nvidia's going to do a five bar and then

1228
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,480
Nvidia's going to do a five bar and then
 

1229
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,630
Nvidia's going to do a five bar and then
one more shove up. And I think ENQ still

1230
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640
one more shove up. And I think ENQ still
 

1231
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,230
one more shove up. And I think ENQ still
needs to get to that 6 20 P 620 to 680.

1232
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
needs to get to that 6 20 P 620 to 680.
 

1233
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,510
needs to get to that 6 20 P 620 to 680.
That's what I think. So, I think this

1234
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
That's what I think. So, I think this
 

1235
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,190
That's what I think. So, I think this
might be accumulation and another shove

1236
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
might be accumulation and another shove
 

1237
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,870
might be accumulation and another shove
up. So, I'm just waiting.

1238
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880

 

1239
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,389

If you're asking why am I not buying up

1240
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:56,399
If you're asking why am I not buying up
 

1241
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,909
If you're asking why am I not buying up
here, well, we're nowhere near any form

1242
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:57,919
here, well, we're nowhere near any form
 

1243
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:07,110
here, well, we're nowhere near any form
of structure to buy off.

1244
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120

 

1245
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,269

This is your build out.

1246
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279

 

1247
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,029

See, so far they're absorbing underneath

1248
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,039
See, so far they're absorbing underneath
 

1249
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,710
See, so far they're absorbing underneath
it and turning back inside every time

1250
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:16,720
it and turning back inside every time
 

1251
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,230
it and turning back inside every time
they get the chance. [snorts]

1252
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,240
they get the chance. [snorts]
 

1253
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,070
they get the chance. [snorts]
Volume is very slow on the book again.

1254
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
Volume is very slow on the book again.
 

1255
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,590
Volume is very slow on the book again.
It's a bit concerning, guys. I'm going

1256
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
It's a bit concerning, guys. I'm going
 

1257
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,510
It's a bit concerning, guys. I'm going
to be honest. This looks very, very slow

1258
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:25,520
to be honest. This looks very, very slow
 

1259
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,750
to be honest. This looks very, very slow
on the book again.

1260
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
on the book again.
 

1261
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,750
on the book again.
This is literally like yesterday.

1262
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:31,760
This is literally like yesterday.
 

1263
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,110
This is literally like yesterday.
Nvidia is looking like it wants to make

1264
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
Nvidia is looking like it wants to make
 

1265
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,909
Nvidia is looking like it wants to make
a new high day here. Mac is all green,

1266
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
a new high day here. Mac is all green,
 

1267
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,669
a new high day here. Mac is all green,
so I don't want to fight the tape.

1268
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
so I don't want to fight the tape.
 

1269
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,070
so I don't want to fight the tape.
They're going to do low vol and drift.

1270
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
They're going to do low vol and drift.
 

1271
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,070
They're going to do low vol and drift.
They are going to do it. It is what it

1272
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
They are going to do it. It is what it
 

1273
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:53,669
They are going to do it. It is what it
is.

1274
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:53,679

 

1275
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,230

Still absorbing down here.

1276
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,240

 

1277
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,470

Um, yeah. I mean, I like trading the the

1278
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:00,480
Um, yeah. I mean, I like trading the the
 

1279
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,470
Um, yeah. I mean, I like trading the the
10:00 exchange, Jack, for sure, but

1280
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480
10:00 exchange, Jack, for sure, but
 

1281
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,470
10:00 exchange, Jack, for sure, but
beyond that, not really.

1282
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:08,480
beyond that, not really.
 

1283
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,230
beyond that, not really.
If there's volume and price is moving,

1284
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:10,240
If there's volume and price is moving,
 

1285
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,669
If there's volume and price is moving,
I'm interested. Doesn't really matter

1286
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
I'm interested. Doesn't really matter
 

1287
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,110
I'm interested. Doesn't really matter
what time, but yes.

1288
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
what time, but yes.
 

1289
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:26,149
what time, but yes.
I am interested in those exchanges

1290
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:26,159

 

1291
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,190

very close to that 20s old point of

1292
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,200
very close to that 20s old point of
 

1293
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,430
very close to that 20s old point of
control there. Get through that and

1294
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
control there. Get through that and
 

1295
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,190
control there. Get through that and
there's room to 80s I would say which

1296
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200
there's room to 80s I would say which
 

1297
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,590
there's room to 80s I would say which
would be the week before.

1298
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:37,600

 

1299
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,430

Get through that you're looking at 800.

1300
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440
Get through that you're looking at 800.
 

1301
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,269
Get through that you're looking at 800.
So,

1302
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
So,
 

1303
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,509
So,
or at least you're looking at 720

1304
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:43,519
or at least you're looking at 720
 

1305
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,977
or at least you're looking at 720
liquidity there and then 800s.

1306
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:46,987
liquidity there and then 800s.
 

1307
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:55,909
liquidity there and then 800s.
[snorts]

1308
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919

 

1309
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:03,190

Morning DK.

1310
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200

 

1311
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,230

620. Old weekly point of control. Just

1312
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
620. Old weekly point of control. Just
 

1313
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,029
620. Old weekly point of control. Just
got stuck just in front of that so far.

1314
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039

 

1315
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,630

Nvidia new high day. Like I said,

1316
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
Nvidia new high day. Like I said,
 

1317
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,230
Nvidia new high day. Like I said,
thought we'd do a 5m minute bar and then

1318
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,240
thought we'd do a 5m minute bar and then
 

1319
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,590
thought we'd do a 5m minute bar and then
go. That's exactly what we've seen.

1320
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600

 

1321
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,430

So, accumulation here. Probably one more

1322
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
So, accumulation here. Probably one more
 

1323
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,669
So, accumulation here. Probably one more
shove up and then see what they how they

1324
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:23,679
shove up and then see what they how they
 

1325
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,590
shove up and then see what they how they
act there. We've had no retest of the

1326
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:25,600
act there. We've had no retest of the
 

1327
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,789
act there. We've had no retest of the
550 where we just broke out from. Right.

1328
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
550 where we just broke out from. Right.
 

1329
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,750
550 where we just broke out from. Right.
So, we are now in an outside bar. Daily

1330
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
So, we are now in an outside bar. Daily
 

1331
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,509
So, we are now in an outside bar. Daily
is trading up. We've had a higher low

1332
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:33,519
is trading up. We've had a higher low
 

1333
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,029
is trading up. We've had a higher low
put in yesterday. Want to be aware of

1334
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:35,039
put in yesterday. Want to be aware of
 

1335
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,230
put in yesterday. Want to be aware of
that. Don't really want to fight the

1336
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
that. Don't really want to fight the
 

1337
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,630
that. Don't really want to fight the
trend. This is more me talking out loud

1338
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
trend. This is more me talking out loud
 

1339
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,630
trend. This is more me talking out loud
here as well.

1340
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,640
here as well.
 

1341
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,389
here as well.
Unless there's a big exchange and a big

1342
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:42,399
Unless there's a big exchange and a big
 

1343
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,909
Unless there's a big exchange and a big
failure for a trade back inside the

1344
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:43,919
failure for a trade back inside the
 

1345
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,990
failure for a trade back inside the
range, we have to be aware that we are

1346
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
range, we have to be aware that we are
 

1347
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,750
range, we have to be aware that we are
now breaking out on a daily after

1348
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
now breaking out on a daily after
 

1349
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,389
now breaking out on a daily after
putting a higher low. There's the fail

1350
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,399
putting a higher low. There's the fail
 

1351
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,470
putting a higher low. There's the fail
on Nvidia trading back down to these

1352
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
on Nvidia trading back down to these
 

1353
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,310
on Nvidia trading back down to these
85s. Now we're testing the edge of this

1354
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,320
85s. Now we're testing the edge of this
 

1355
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,830
85s. Now we're testing the edge of this
range again, the edge of this volume

1356
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:55,840
range again, the edge of this volume
 

1357
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,669
range again, the edge of this volume
range. If they leave this volume range,

1358
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:57,679
range. If they leave this volume range,
 

1359
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,509
range. If they leave this volume range,
we can trade about another 50 points

1360
00:33:59,509 --> 00:33:59,519
we can trade about another 50 points
 

1361
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,110
we can trade about another 50 points
lower. If they reclaim this, it's going

1362
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,120
lower. If they reclaim this, it's going
 

1363
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,190
lower. If they reclaim this, it's going
to be another bear trap and a trade

1364
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,200
to be another bear trap and a trade
 

1365
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,389
to be another bear trap and a trade
inside. All right. So, just be very very

1366
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
inside. All right. So, just be very very
 

1367
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,830
inside. All right. So, just be very very
careful. There's a trade back down

1368
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
careful. There's a trade back down
 

1369
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,069
careful. There's a trade back down
towards the New York VWAP. We're holding

1370
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:10,079
towards the New York VWAP. We're holding
 

1371
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,589
towards the New York VWAP. We're holding
flow zones. We're holding edge of this

1372
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:11,599
flow zones. We're holding edge of this
 

1373
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,869
flow zones. We're holding edge of this
range again. Nvidia still holding uh 185

1374
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:14,879
range again. Nvidia still holding uh 185
 

1375
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:23,109
range again. Nvidia still holding uh 185
for now.

1376
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119

 

1377
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,149

This looks very dangerous to me. That's

1378
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
This looks very dangerous to me. That's
 

1379
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,629
This looks very dangerous to me. That's
annoying again.

1380
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:32,639

 

1381
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,190

It's under 185, but we found a bid here

1382
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
It's under 185, but we found a bid here
 

1383
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,470
It's under 185, but we found a bid here
on the market. So,

1384
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:38,480
on the market. So,
 

1385
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,389
on the market. So,
just feels like it's teetering on the

1386
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,399
just feels like it's teetering on the
 

1387
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,069
just feels like it's teetering on the
edge here.

1388
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:44,079

 

1389
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,990

Do they leave this volume and trade 50

1390
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
Do they leave this volume and trade 50
 

1391
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,550
Do they leave this volume and trade 50
points lower is the question right now.

1392
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:48,560
points lower is the question right now.
 

1393
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,389
points lower is the question right now.
Back to point control. Back inside the

1394
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
Back to point control. Back inside the
 

1395
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,270
Back to point control. Back inside the
volume, testing this volume. They need

1396
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,280
volume, testing this volume. They need
 

1397
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,030
volume, testing this volume. They need
to sell this. And if they don't sell it,

1398
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
to sell this. And if they don't sell it,
 

1399
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,950
to sell this. And if they don't sell it,
Nvidia's reclaimed 185. You want to be

1400
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:56,960
Nvidia's reclaimed 185. You want to be
 

1401
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,870
Nvidia's reclaimed 185. You want to be
very careful about a new a resqueeze

1402
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:58,880
very careful about a new a resqueeze
 

1403
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,069
very careful about a new a resqueeze
higher here. This looks very trappy here

1404
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:02,079
higher here. This looks very trappy here
 

1405
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,150
higher here. This looks very trappy here

level that I would feel comfortable
buying at.

1564
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280

 

1565
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,910

Tesla fighting to stay green right now.

1566
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:09,920
Tesla fighting to stay green right now.
 

1567
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:21,750
Tesla fighting to stay green right now.
Meta the same.

1568
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760

 

1569
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,230

Nvidia losing that 85 at the moment.

1570
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
Nvidia losing that 85 at the moment.
 

1571
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,630
Nvidia losing that 85 at the moment.
Might see some uh more downside pressure

1572
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
Might see some uh more downside pressure
 

1573
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,230
Might see some uh more downside pressure
here on Nvidia if it starts to really

1574
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,240
here on Nvidia if it starts to really
 

1575
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,550
here on Nvidia if it starts to really
get going.

1576
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:32,560

 

1577
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,710

620 is that level, that old point

1578
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:34,720
620 is that level, that old point
 

1579
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,950
620 is that level, that old point
control.

1580
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
control.
 

1581
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,510
control.
Yeah. 620ish. And then what's the other

1582
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,520
Yeah. 620ish. And then what's the other
 

1583
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,190
Yeah. 620ish. And then what's the other
one?

1584
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
one?
 

1585
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,562
one?
86.

1586
00:39:43,562 --> 00:39:43,572
86.
 

1587
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:44,870
86.
[snorts]

1588
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:44,880
[snorts]
 

1589
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,829
[snorts]
Here's a test of date.

1590
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
Here's a test of date.
 

1591
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,630
Here's a test of date.
No dice up there so far.

1592
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
No dice up there so far.
 

1593
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,990
No dice up there so far.
All just got slammed in their face.

1594
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,000
All just got slammed in their face.
 

1595
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,430
All just got slammed in their face.
Still don't think we've left enough

1596
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
Still don't think we've left enough
 

1597
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,589
Still don't think we've left enough
excess as a high. Still think there's a

1598
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
excess as a high. Still think there's a
 

1599
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,069
excess as a high. Still think there's a
new high coming. Don't think we've left

1600
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:00,079
new high coming. Don't think we've left
 

1601
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:39,510
new high coming. Don't think we've left
enough excess by side as a height.

1602
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520

 

1603
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,190

Oh, mate. [sighs]

1604
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,200
Oh, mate. [sighs]
 

1605
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,870
Oh, mate. [sighs]
Straight move and then sideways

1606
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:44,880
Straight move and then sideways
 

1607
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,910
Straight move and then sideways
market honestly. [snorts]

1608
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:47,920
market honestly. [snorts]
 

1609
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,510
market honestly. [snorts]
All right, back down towards VW up. Do

1610
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520
All right, back down towards VW up. Do
 

1611
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,030
All right, back down towards VW up. Do
they buy the VW up again and take us

1612
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,040
they buy the VW up again and take us
 

1613
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,950
they buy the VW up again and take us
back upside? Look how quickly these move

1614
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:52,960
back upside? Look how quickly these move
 

1615
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,589
back upside? Look how quickly these move
were so thin. That didn't take a lot to

1616
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:55,599
were so thin. That didn't take a lot to
 

1617
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,870
were so thin. That didn't take a lot to
move us straight back down to the other

1618
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
move us straight back down to the other
 

1619
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,510
move us straight back down to the other
side of that range. Then

1620
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
side of that range. Then
 

1621
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,150
side of that range. Then
it really took nothing. They bid VW up

1622
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,160
it really took nothing. They bid VW up
 

1623
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,430
it really took nothing. They bid VW up
here. Still don't think there's enough

1624
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:03,440
here. Still don't think there's enough
 

1625
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,990
here. Still don't think there's enough
excess at the high, but

1626
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
excess at the high, but
 

1627
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,829
excess at the high, but
just back down into that imbalance from

1628
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:07,839
just back down into that imbalance from
 

1629
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,270
just back down into that imbalance from
that first big candle on the way up,

1630
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
that first big candle on the way up,
 

1631
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,550
that first big candle on the way up,
right? This imbalance here. We're

1632
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
right? This imbalance here. We're
 

1633
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:22,870
right? This imbalance here. We're
holding that imbalance right now.

1634
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:22,880

 

1635
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,950

No follow through on VWAP. Yeah, VWAP's

1636
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:24,960
No follow through on VWAP. Yeah, VWAP's
 

1637
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,390
No follow through on VWAP. Yeah, VWAP's
flattened out. Like I said, it's one

1638
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
flattened out. Like I said, it's one
 

1639
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,150
flattened out. Like I said, it's one
thing I'd be concerned about. It's

1640
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160
thing I'd be concerned about. It's
 

1641
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,190
thing I'd be concerned about. It's
flattening out.

1642
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200

 

1643
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,589

Is there any liquidity hanging lower?

1644
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:35,599
Is there any liquidity hanging lower?
 

1645
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:49,109
Is there any liquidity hanging lower?
40. That's about it.

1646
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:49,119

 

1647
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,750

This looks so bad, folks. This looks

1648
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
This looks so bad, folks. This looks
 

1649
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,349
This looks so bad, folks. This looks
like another day where I want to go back

1650
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:53,359
like another day where I want to go back
 

1651
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,069
like another day where I want to go back
to bed. It's got that feeling at the

1652
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
to bed. It's got that feeling at the
 

1653
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,550
to bed. It's got that feeling at the
moment.

1654
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:58,560
moment.
 

1655
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,990
moment.
Hope the whole of December isn't going

1656
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
Hope the whole of December isn't going
 

1657
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:13,030
Hope the whole of December isn't going
to be like this. Really do

1658
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,040

 

1659
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,349

just holding on to VWOP right now.

1660
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,359
just holding on to VWOP right now.
 

1661
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,190
just holding on to VWOP right now.
There's a bigger rotation if they let go

1662
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,200
There's a bigger rotation if they let go
 

1663
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,430
There's a bigger rotation if they let go
of it.

1664
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:19,440
of it.
 

1665
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,349
of it.
It's an old imbalance. If they let go of

1666
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
It's an old imbalance. If they let go of
 

1667
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,109
It's an old imbalance. If they let go of
that first squeeze, they can go right

1668
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:23,119
that first squeeze, they can go right
 

1669
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,630
that first squeeze, they can go right
back down to the beginning of the day,

1670
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:24,640
back down to the beginning of the day,
 

1671
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:34,950
back down to the beginning of the day,
honestly. But uh we just have to see

1672
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:34,960

 

1673
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,950

tape looks dreadful again. Just so slow.

1674
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
tape looks dreadful again. Just so slow.
 

1675
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,470
tape looks dreadful again. Just so slow.
But that just so slow

1676
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:46,480

 

1677
00:42:46,480 --> 00:43:02,230

and we're absorbing off no size.

1678
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,240

 

1679
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,750

Uh,

1680
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:03,760
Uh,
 

1681
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,910
Uh,
this doesn't look good, folks. Looks

1682
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:05,920
this doesn't look good, folks. Looks
 

1683
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,510
this doesn't look good, folks. Looks
like a no trade situation at the moment.

1684
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
like a no trade situation at the moment.
 

1685
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,670
like a no trade situation at the moment.
Unless we leave volume one way or the

1686
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:09,680
Unless we leave volume one way or the
 

1687
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,069
Unless we leave volume one way or the
other, we keep going sideways just under

1688
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:12,079
other, we keep going sideways just under
 

1689
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,790
other, we keep going sideways just under
volume. There's nothing we can do.

1690
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:14,800
volume. There's nothing we can do.
 

1691
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:27,910
volume. There's nothing we can do.
There's no play here to be had.

1692
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920

 

1693
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,390

And looks very dangerous.

1694
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,400
And looks very dangerous.
 

1695
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,150
And looks very dangerous.
Very, very dangerous. And we still

1696
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
Very, very dangerous. And we still
 

1697
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,430
Very, very dangerous. And we still
haven't hit that 620, remember.

1698
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:35,440
haven't hit that 620, remember.
 

1699
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,349
haven't hit that 620, remember.
And we're not leaving. Unless they leave

1700
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:37,359
And we're not leaving. Unless they leave
 

1701
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,349
And we're not leaving. Unless they leave
aggressively this volume and we just

1702
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:39,359
aggressively this volume and we just
 

1703
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,710
aggressively this volume and we just
hang out. If we just hang around between

1704
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:40,720
hang out. If we just hang around between
 

1705
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,150
hang out. If we just hang around between
VW up in here, all we're going to do is

1706
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
VW up in here, all we're going to do is
 

1707
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,109
VW up in here, all we're going to do is
build a bigger volume shelf,

1708
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
build a bigger volume shelf,
 

1709
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,390
build a bigger volume shelf,
which is basically what we did

1710
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:46,400
which is basically what we did
 

1711
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,390
which is basically what we did
yesterday. We just kept building more

1712
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,400
yesterday. We just kept building more
 

1713
00:43:48,400 --> 00:44:07,670
yesterday. We just kept building more
and more volume.

1714
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680

 

1715
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,750

They need to leave this volume to trade

1716
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:09,760
They need to leave this volume to trade
 

1717
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,349
They need to leave this volume to trade
lower for a trade inside and then a buy

1718
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
lower for a trade inside and then a buy
 

1719
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,430
lower for a trade inside and then a buy
back. Once they do that, I'm not going

1720
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
back. Once they do that, I'm not going
 

1721
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:23,430
back. Once they do that, I'm not going
to buy up here. There's just no way.

1722
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440

 

1723
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,510

Yes, your view up is down here. This is

1724
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:25,520
Yes, your view up is down here. This is
 

1725
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,190
Yes, your view up is down here. This is
a New York view up.

1726
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
a New York view up.
 

1727
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,349
a New York view up.
That's why this is anchored off the

1728
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:31,359
That's why this is anchored off the
 

1729
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,190
That's why this is anchored off the
opening print. This is cash. I care

1730
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200
opening print. This is cash. I care
 

1731
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,430
opening print. This is cash. I care
about cash. You can see market cares

1732
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,440
about cash. You can see market cares
 

1733
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,109
about cash. You can see market cares
about cash. Doesn't care about this down

1734
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:37,119
about cash. Doesn't care about this down
 

1735
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,630
about cash. Doesn't care about this down
here. It's too far away to care about

1736
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
here. It's too far away to care about
 

1737
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,309
here. It's too far away to care about
right now. Might care about it later if

1738
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
right now. Might care about it later if
 

1739
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:49,190
right now. Might care about it later if
we get there.

1740
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,200

 

1741
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,750

failing PC there on that last push. Now

1742
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
failing PC there on that last push. Now
 

1743
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,430
failing PC there on that last push. Now
they need to trade away from here now.

1744
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
they need to trade away from here now.
 

1745
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,030
they need to trade away from here now.
They're stuck between New York View up

1746
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
They're stuck between New York View up
 

1747
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,670
They're stuck between New York View up
and PC.

1748
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:57,680
and PC.
 

1749
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:06,630
and PC.
This is about as dreadful as you get.

1750
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:06,640

 

1751
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,190

Chance to breathe. Um I don't really

1752
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,200
Chance to breathe. Um I don't really
 

1753
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,950
Chance to breathe. Um I don't really
think so. Consolidation. What? after a

1754
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:12,960
think so. Consolidation. What? after a
 

1755
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,510
think so. Consolidation. What? after a
five or six day squeeze higher a

1756
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,520
five or six day squeeze higher a
 

1757
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,069
five or six day squeeze higher a
consolidation for 10 minutes on low

1758
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:18,079
consolidation for 10 minutes on low
 

1759
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,870
consolidation for 10 minutes on low
volume after low volume squeeze for six

1760
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:20,880
volume after low volume squeeze for six
 

1761
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,430
volume after low volume squeeze for six
days I wouldn't say it's a chance to

1762
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:23,440
days I wouldn't say it's a chance to
 

1763
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,670
days I wouldn't say it's a chance to
breathe it's more a chance to play

1764
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
breathe it's more a chance to play
 

1765
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,750
breathe it's more a chance to play
stupid games

1766
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,760
stupid games
 

1767
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,910
stupid games
to breathe is a pullback which

1768
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920
to breathe is a pullback which
 

1769
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,630
to breathe is a pullback which
consolidates into a good area not the

consolidates into a good area not the
 

1771
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,270
consolidates into a good area not the
nonsense that we've seen for six days

1772
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:37,280
nonsense that we've seen for six days
 

1773
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,349
nonsense that we've seen for six days
and it is nonsense that's exactly what

00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
and it is nonsense that's exactly what
 

1775
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:48,390
and it is nonsense that's exactly what
it is

1777
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,870

this is ridiculous. Just either break

1778
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
this is ridiculous. Just either break
 

1779
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,270
this is ridiculous. Just either break
out or break down. Please stop sitting

1780
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,280

00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:00,079

 

1783
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,670

Someone trying to bid it up now. Trying

1784
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:01,680
Someone trying to bid it up now. Trying
 

1785
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,910
Someone trying to bid it up now. Trying
to walk up. He's got no size on his

1786
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:03,920
to walk up. He's got no size on his
 

1787
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,910
to walk up. He's got no size on his
tape. So, I'm just interested if they

1788
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
tape. So, I'm just interested if they
 

1789
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:13,510
tape. So, I'm just interested if they
actually fill him and Oh, he's moved.

1790
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,520

 

1791
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,950

Yeah, they're playing games on the order

1792
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:14,960
Yeah, they're playing games on the order

Yeah, they're playing games on the order
float. It's It's actually just stupid.

1794
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200
float. It's It's actually just stupid.
 

1795
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,309
float. It's It's actually just stupid.
It's like yesterday. They're playing

1796
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:18,319
It's like yesterday. They're playing
 

1797
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,990
It's like yesterday. They're playing
games with tiny lot sizes. This is what

1798
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:20,000
games with tiny lot sizes. This is what
 

1799
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,069
games with tiny lot sizes. This is what
I mean.

1800
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:22,079
I mean.
 

1801
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,150
I mean.
I don't think this is not tradable,

1802
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
I don't think this is not tradable,
 

1803
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,990
I don't think this is not tradable,
folks. Like, if you all think this is a

1804
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,000
folks. Like, if you all think this is a
 

1805
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,510
folks. Like, if you all think this is a
tradeable, if you're watching the book

1806
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:27,520
tradeable, if you're watching the book
 

1807
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,109
tradeable, if you're watching the book
right now, it is so slow with such

1808
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
right now, it is so slow with such
 

1809
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,390
right now, it is so slow with such
little size.

Yeah, it will be like this till
Christmas. What I said at the beginning

00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:38,880
Christmas. What I said at the beginning
 

1815
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,230
Christmas. What I said at the beginning
of the day, December tends to be choppy,

1816
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:42,240
of the day, December tends to be choppy,
 

1817
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,870
of the day, December tends to be choppy,
low volatility, low volume. Everyone's

00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
low volatility, low volume. Everyone's
 

1819
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,309
low volatility, low volume. Everyone's
like, "Oh, we close higher at

00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
like, "Oh, we close higher at
 

1821
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,990
like, "Oh, we close higher at
Christmas." That's [\h__\h] great, isn't

1822
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
Christmas." That's [\h__\h] great, isn't
 

1823
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,069

00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:51,920
close higher. It doesn't matter what we
 

1827
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,910
close higher. It doesn't matter what we
do. You can keep giving stats. We close

higher. Unless you're buying it at a
 

1831
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,510
higher. Unless you're buying it at a
good level to close higher, doesn't mean

1832
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,520
good level to close higher, doesn't mean
 

1833
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,990
good level to close higher, doesn't mean
[\h__\h] You're going to get shaken out.

1834
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,000
[\h__\h] You're going to get shaken out.
 

1835
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,430

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:08,640
what level that you buy at.
 

1843
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,550
what level that you buy at.
Everyone's a statician. No one's a

Everyone's a statician. No one's a
 

1845
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,870
Everyone's a statician. No one's a
trader. It's hilarious.

1846
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:12,880
trader. It's hilarious.
 

1847
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,870
trader. It's hilarious.
All right. Still not hitting those 620s.

1848
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
All right. Still not hitting those 620s.
 

1849
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,950
All right. Still not hitting those 620s.
Still don't think there's a strong high

1850
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:16,960
Still don't think there's a strong high
 

1851
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,550
Still don't think there's a strong high
in here. Still haven't left the volume

1852
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,560
in here. Still haven't left the volume
 

1853
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,630
in here. Still haven't left the volume
either side. Still trading sideways.

1854
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
either side. Still trading sideways.
 

1855
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:28,150
either side. Still trading sideways.
This is absolutely terrible.

1856
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160

 

1857
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,910

Dreadful.

1858
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:31,920

 

1859
00:47:31,920 --> 00:48:04,710

I'm going to get a refill of water here.

1860
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720

 

1861
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,750

We're in a 30 point range.

1862
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:09,760

 

1863
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:25,190

A 30 point range. That's what we're in.

1864
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,200

 

1865
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,630

Here's the break. There's the 620. This

1866
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:28,640
Here's the break. There's the 620. This
 

1867
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:40,710
Here's the break. There's the 620. This
is the old point of control.

1868
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:40,720

 

1869
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,589

Now, if they get through this, the next

1870
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
Now, if they get through this, the next
 

1871
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,710
Now, if they get through this, the next
weekly, the week before that is

1872
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:48,720
weekly, the week before that is
 

1873
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,589
weekly, the week before that is
675 and there is liquidity to come and

1874
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
675 and there is liquidity to come and
 

1875
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:58,470
675 and there is liquidity to come and
run up to 720. is undeniable.

1876
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480

 

1877
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:14,069

It is undeniable.

1878
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:14,079

 

1879
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,190

Yeah, of course. Well, any

1880
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
Yeah, of course. Well, any
 

1881
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,109
Yeah, of course. Well, any
anything's a potential spoof. It's if

1882
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:19,119
anything's a potential spoof. It's if
 

1883
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,870
anything's a potential spoof. It's if
it's above us or below us, anything's

1884
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:20,880
it's above us or below us, anything's
 

1885
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,710
it's above us or below us, anything's
got a potential spoof. Of course it is

1886
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:22,720
got a potential spoof. Of course it is
 

1887
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,150
got a potential spoof. Of course it is
potential. I don't know if he gets

1888
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160
potential. I don't know if he gets
 

1889
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,950
potential. I don't know if he gets
filled until we get there.

1890
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:26,960
filled until we get there.
 

1891
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,109
filled until we get there.
Yes. Like anything you see above or

1892
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:29,119
Yes. Like anything you see above or
 

1893
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,270
Yes. Like anything you see above or
below you is obviously a potential

1894
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:31,280
below you is obviously a potential
 

1895
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,030
below you is obviously a potential
spoof. But again, that's not big size,

1896
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,040
spoof. But again, that's not big size,
 

1897
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,430
spoof. But again, that's not big size,
is it? Like we just saw someone come in

1898
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,440
is it? Like we just saw someone come in
 

1899
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,069
is it? Like we just saw someone come in
with 113 lot and pull it instantly and

1900
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:38,079
with 113 lot and pull it instantly and
 

1901
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,470
with 113 lot and pull it instantly and
they come back in again with a 50 lot

1902
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
they come back in again with a 50 lot
 

1903
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,230
they come back in again with a 50 lot
this time. I mean 100 lot is not is not

above the daily. But we are thin
regardless of what people say. We're

2200
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
regardless of what people say. We're
 

2201
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,950
regardless of what people say. We're
thin on the book. All right. We are thin

2202
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:12,960
thin on the book. All right. We are thin
 

2203
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,549
thin on the book. All right. We are thin
on the book and they are playing games.

2204
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:14,559
on the book and they are playing games.
 

2205
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,230
on the book and they are playing games.
I'm literally watching them play games

2206
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:16,240
I'm literally watching them play games
 

2207
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,990
I'm literally watching them play games
on the book. You could learn something

2208
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
on the book. You could learn something
 

2209
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,030
on the book. You could learn something
new, Jack, by learning how to read tape.

2210
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:21,040
new, Jack, by learning how to read tape.
 

2211
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,069
new, Jack, by learning how to read tape.
But hey,

2212
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:24,079
But hey,
 

2213
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,309
But hey,
so how we act into this node becomes

2214
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:26,319
so how we act into this node becomes
 

2215
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,910
so how we act into this node becomes
important now. We're still making higher

2216
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
important now. We're still making higher
 

2217
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,430
important now. We're still making higher
highs and higher lows.

2218
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,440
highs and higher lows.
 

2219
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:40,309
highs and higher lows.
Thank you, darling.

2220
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:40,319

 

2221
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,270

Still no trade for me.

2222
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:43,280
Still no trade for me.
 

2223
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,789
Still no trade for me.
still think this is a very very

2224
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
still think this is a very very
 

2225
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,870
still think this is a very very
dangerous tape because if you get stuck

2226
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:46,880
dangerous tape because if you get stuck
 

2227
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,349
dangerous tape because if you get stuck
the long wrong wrong side of it on low

2228
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:49,359
the long wrong wrong side of it on low
 

2229
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,670
the long wrong wrong side of it on low
volume it will not take a lot for them

2230
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:51,680
volume it will not take a lot for them
 

2231
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,990
volume it will not take a lot for them
to move this. It was just like yesterday

2232
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,000
to move this. It was just like yesterday
 

2233
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,109
to move this. It was just like yesterday
we saw the same thing. I'm going to get

2234
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:55,119
we saw the same thing. I'm going to get
 

2235
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,030
we saw the same thing. I'm going to get
rid of this. We don't need that now.

2236
01:01:59,030 --> 01:01:59,040
rid of this. We don't need that now.
 

2237
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,190
rid of this. We don't need that now.
Once they went into rotation that was

2238
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
Once they went into rotation that was
 

2239
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:12,789
Once they went into rotation that was
it.

2240
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:12,799

 

2241
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,789

That high is looking better than that

2242
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:14,799
That high is looking better than that
 

2243
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,030
That high is looking better than that
last one though. There are buyers

2244
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:17,040
last one though. There are buyers
 

2245
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,030
last one though. There are buyers
chapped over 50 right now. There's no

2246
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:19,040
chapped over 50 right now. There's no
 

2247
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,270
chapped over 50 right now. There's no
doubt about it.

2248
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,280
doubt about it.
 

2249
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,789
doubt about it.
And we are starting to see a reaction

2250
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:22,799
And we are starting to see a reaction
 

2251
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,230
And we are starting to see a reaction
there. So they're starting to walk this

2252
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
there. So they're starting to walk this
 

2253
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,390
there. So they're starting to walk this
down now. It's more aggressive.

2254
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:28,400

 

2255
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,630

Let's see if this retest holds or not.

2256
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
Let's see if this retest holds or not.
 

2257
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,390
Let's see if this retest holds or not.
So it's trapped between these two sort

2258
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:34,400
So it's trapped between these two sort
 

2259
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,230
So it's trapped between these two sort
of imbalance levels. So we got imbalance

2260
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
of imbalance levels. So we got imbalance
 

2261
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,750
of imbalance levels. So we got imbalance
here. We're trapped between them. How we

2262
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:39,760
here. We're trapped between them. How we
 

2263
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,829
here. We're trapped between them. How we
act here becomes key. This high is not

2264
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
act here becomes key. This high is not
 

2265
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,349
act here becomes key. This high is not
too bad. We did leave some buyers

2266
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359
too bad. We did leave some buyers
 

2267
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,470
too bad. We did leave some buyers
trapped above 50. Like I said,

2268
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,480
trapped above 50. Like I said,
 

2269
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,390
trapped above 50. Like I said,
the market very, very bullish overall.

2270
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:48,400
the market very, very bullish overall.
 

2271
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,109
the market very, very bullish overall.
We're in a breakout on the daily.

2272
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
We're in a breakout on the daily.
 

2273
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,390
We're in a breakout on the daily.
So, really should be looking for areas

2274
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:52,400
So, really should be looking for areas
 

2275
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,630
So, really should be looking for areas
to buy at, but really want to buy up

2276
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:54,640
to buy at, but really want to buy up
 

2277
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,630
to buy at, but really want to buy up
here right now. Not into this old point

2278
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,640
here right now. Not into this old point
 

2279
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,789
here right now. Not into this old point
of control on the weekly.

2280
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:00,799

 

2281
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,710

We're into a really dense area from

We're into a really dense area from
 

2283
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,430
We're into a really dense area from
where we are now really all the way up

01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:05,440
where we are now really all the way up
 

2285
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,870
where we are now really all the way up

2287
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,990
to 900 but definitely up to
680 is very very thick resellers. It's a

2288
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:12,000
680 is very very thick resellers. It's a
 

2289
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,950
680 is very very thick resellers. It's a
highly traded area for you know for 10

01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
highly traded area for you know for 10

2301
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,309

Nvidia is starting to struggle a bit

2302
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
Nvidia is starting to struggle a bit
 

2303
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,870
Nvidia is starting to struggle a bit
there into its imbalance. If it rejects

2304
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:48,880
there into its imbalance. If it rejects
 

2305
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,789
there into its imbalance. If it rejects
85 again and starts washing, it's going

2306
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
85 again and starts washing, it's going
 

2307
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,390
85 again and starts washing, it's going
to be problematic. It's just a question

2308
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:52,400
to be problematic. It's just a question
 

2309
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,150
to be problematic. It's just a question
then of do the chips see weakness with

is still well up on the day.

2315
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,789

As a seller keeps coming in here

2316
01:04:58,789 --> 01:04:58,799
As a seller keeps coming in here
 

2317
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,349
As a seller keeps coming in here
and he's being absorbed into 25 over and

2318
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:01,359
and he's being absorbed into 25 over and
 

2319
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:46,710
and he's being absorbed into 25 over and
over again. He keeps trying.

2320
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:46,720

 

2321
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,630

25 is a big area. They keep absorbing

2322
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:48,640
25 is a big area. They keep absorbing
 

2323
01:05:48,640 --> 01:06:04,549
25 is a big area. They keep absorbing
off 25 right now.

2324
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559

 

2325
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,349

Back down towards it now. See if a guy

2326
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:07,359
Back down towards it now. See if a guy
 

2327
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,710
Back down towards it now. See if a guy
shows up again and absorbs at 25 again.

2328
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:10,720
shows up again and absorbs at 25 again.
 

2329
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,630
shows up again and absorbs at 25 again.
Yep, he's trying. He's trying. He's

2330
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
Yep, he's trying. He's trying. He's
 

2331
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,069
Yep, he's trying. He's trying. He's
probably going to get washed to 15 here

2332
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:14,079
probably going to get washed to 15 here
 

2333
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,870
probably going to get washed to 15 here
if he can't hold.

2334
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:16,880
if he can't hold.
 

2335
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:24,710
if he can't hold.
Trying again at 25s.

2336
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:24,720

 

2337
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:40,470

He's still soaking.

2338
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:40,480

 

2339
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,829

Back to 25s again. If he if he gets

2340
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:43,839
Back to 25s again. If he if he gets
 

2341
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,589
Back to 25s again. If he if he gets
stuck here, there'll be a bigger wash

2342
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
stuck here, there'll be a bigger wash
 

2343
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,430
stuck here, there'll be a bigger wash
because he's been reloading there a lot.

2344
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:49,440
because he's been reloading there a lot.
 

2345
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,950
because he's been reloading there a lot.
I don't think they finish their business

2346
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
I don't think they finish their business
 

2347
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,710
I don't think they finish their business
higher, but uh they're building out new

2348
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:52,720
higher, but uh they're building out new
 

2349
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,390
higher, but uh they're building out new
volume here. And if we start to leave

2350
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:54,400
volume here. And if we start to leave
 

2351
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,950
volume here. And if we start to leave
this volume, we will rotate back down as

2352
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:56,960
this volume, we will rotate back down as
 

2353
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,390
this volume, we will rotate back down as
you can see. And if we lose that next

2354
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
you can see. And if we lose that next
 

2355
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,069
you can see. And if we lose that next
shelf, it will get very, very nasty

01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:00,079
shelf, it will get very, very nasty
 

2357
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,510
shelf, it will get very, very nasty
because Nvidia is starting to lose

2358
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,520
because Nvidia is starting to lose
 

2359
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,270
because Nvidia is starting to lose
everything

2360
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,280

 

2361
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,270

back down to the old PC's. Very very

2362
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,280
back down to the old PC's. Very very
 

2363
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,589
back down to the old PC's. Very very
possible here. Now 95 if they start to

2364
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:09,599
possible here. Now 95 if they start to
 

2365
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:15,029
possible here. Now 95 if they start to
lose these shelves.

2366
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:15,039

 

2367
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,950

right into that low volume node.

2368
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
right into that low volume node.
 

2369
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,789
right into that low volume node.

01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,390

Back to these 25s again. So sellers came

2376
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:30,400
Back to these 25s again. So sellers came
 

2377
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,190
Back to these 25s again. So sellers came
in under there, got caught

2378
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,200
in under there, got caught
 

2379
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,029
in under there, got caught
elaugh offside in this current candle

elaugh offside in this current candle
 

2381
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,950
elaugh offside in this current candle
under 25. They tried to force him out

2382
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
under 25. They tried to force him out
 

2383
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,109
under 25. They tried to force him out
and he's reclaimed. It's going to get

2384
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:39,119
and he's reclaimed. It's going to get
 

2385
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,390
and he's reclaimed. It's going to get
it's going to get tricky here. is a

2386
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,400
it's going to get tricky here. is a
 

2387
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,750
it's going to get tricky here. is a
sensitive area. They're going to make a

2388
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:41,760
sensitive area. They're going to make a
 

2389
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,990
sensitive area. They're going to make a
decision very very soon because it's

2390
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,000
decision very very soon because it's
 

2391
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,270
decision very very soon because it's
first time I've seen Delta start to get

2392
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280
first time I've seen Delta start to get
 

2393
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,950
first time I've seen Delta start to get
caught offside both sides. There we go.

2394
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:46,960
caught offside both sides. There we go.
 

2395
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,710
caught offside both sides. There we go.
It's a stronger selling back down to

2396
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
It's a stronger selling back down to
 

2397
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,549
It's a stronger selling back down to
where those sellers just got caught a

2398
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
where those sellers just got caught a
 

2399
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,789
where those sellers just got caught a
minute ago. Nvidia starting to crack a

2400
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:52,799
minute ago. Nvidia starting to crack a
 

2401
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,710
minute ago. Nvidia starting to crack a
little bit here like we talked about and

2402
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:54,720
little bit here like we talked about and
 

2403
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,150
little bit here like we talked about and
I think there's a rotation all the way

2404
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:56,160
I think there's a rotation all the way
 

2405
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,910
I think there's a rotation all the way
back down to point of control and VWAP

2406
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
back down to point of control and VWAP
 

2407
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,670
back down to point of control and VWAP
here. Very very possible which would be

2408
01:07:59,670 --> 01:07:59,680
here. Very very possible which would be
 

2409
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,309
here. Very very possible which would be
sort of 95s and below if they can

2410
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
sort of 95s and below if they can
 

2411
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,470
sort of 95s and below if they can
sustain this auction. We're coming right

2412
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:04,480
sustain this auction. We're coming right
 

2413
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,309
sustain this auction. We're coming right
into this edge of volume, but I think

2414
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:06,319
into this edge of volume, but I think
 

2415
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,069
into this edge of volume, but I think
the back test of here is possible if

2416
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:08,079
the back test of here is possible if
 

2417
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,630
the back test of here is possible if
they keep rejecting 30s. And then how we

2418
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:10,640
they keep rejecting 30s. And then how we
 

2419
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,549
they keep rejecting 30s. And then how we
at there will sort of determine what we

2420
01:08:12,549 --> 01:08:12,559
at there will sort of determine what we
 

2421
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:25,829
at there will sort of determine what we
do the rest of the day.

2422
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839

 

2423
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,189

They're trying to buy this and protect

2424
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:27,199
They're trying to buy this and protect
 

2425
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:28,390
They're trying to buy this and protect
that low. I don't think it's going to

2426
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:28,400
that low. I don't think it's going to
 

2427
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,110
that low. I don't think it's going to
work. I think there's deeper coming in

2428
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
work. I think there's deeper coming in
 

2429
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:37,749
work. I think there's deeper coming in
here.

2430
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:37,759

 

2431
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,789

I think there's deeper coming.

2432
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:42,799

 

2433
01:08:42,799 --> 01:09:02,309

We go

2434
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:02,319

 

2435
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,789

feels very close here to a wash back

2436
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
feels very close here to a wash back
 

2437
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,789
feels very close here to a wash back
down to 93. All the time it can reject

2438
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:06,799
down to 93. All the time it can reject
 

2439
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,309
down to 93. All the time it can reject
that. But we are trying to balance

2440
01:09:08,309 --> 01:09:08,319
that. But we are trying to balance
 

2441
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,630
that. But we are trying to balance
between these two shelves right now. I'm

2442
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
between these two shelves right now. I'm
 

2443
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,829
between these two shelves right now. I'm
just watching the book. I think there's

2444
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:11,839
just watching the book. I think there's
 

2445
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,590
just watching the book. I think there's
a wash

2446
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,600
a wash
 

2447
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,910
a wash
back in on the next uh if the pop

2448
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
back in on the next uh if the pop
 

2449
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,430
back in on the next uh if the pop
rejects here, but it depends if it

2450
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:17,440
rejects here, but it depends if it
 

2451
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,950
rejects here, but it depends if it
rejects or not.

2452
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:20,960
rejects or not.
 

2453
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,950
rejects or not.
Nvidia is trying to reclaim.

2454
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:26,960

 

2455
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,550

Yeah, more sellers just came in here.

2456
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:28,560
Yeah, more sellers just came in here.
 

2457
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,910
Yeah, more sellers just came in here.
They're looking for that rotation back

2458
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
They're looking for that rotation back
 

2459
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,749
They're looking for that rotation back
down to 95 probably. And then you're

2460
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:31,759
down to 95 probably. And then you're
 

2461
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,829
down to 95 probably. And then you're
going to probably see some absorption

2462
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:33,839
going to probably see some absorption
 

2463
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,590
going to probably see some absorption
start to take place as we get into that,

2464
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:35,600
start to take place as we get into that,
 

2465
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:43,829
start to take place as we get into that,
I would imagine. Anyway,

2466
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839

 

2467
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:47,030

here we come.

2468
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
here we come.
 

2469
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,309
here we come.
Have they got any strength to follow

2470
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:48,319
Have they got any strength to follow
 

2471
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:49,349
Have they got any strength to follow
through? They got to break that low. If

2472
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:49,359
through? They got to break that low. If
 

2473
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,309
through? They got to break that low. If
they can't break that low, they're going

2474
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319
they can't break that low, they're going
 

2475
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:56,149
they can't break that low, they're going
to get caught. They just try it again.

2476
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:56,159

 

2477
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,669

If they can't break that low, they will

2478
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:57,679
If they can't break that low, they will
 

2479
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:11,910
If they can't break that low, they will
get caught.

2480
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:11,920

 

2481
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,669

I sell side imbalance up to

2482
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:15,679
I sell side imbalance up to
 

2483
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:26,149
I sell side imbalance up to
28.

2484
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:26,159

 

2485
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,590

Mag's still all green. We're still in

2486
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:27,600
Mag's still all green. We're still in
 

2487
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,750
Mag's still all green. We're still in
breakout

2488
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:31,760

 

2489
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:41,030

time there. 8 minutes left until the IB.

2490
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:41,040

 

2491
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,270

Yeah, that 2829 is going to be key here.

2492
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,280
Yeah, that 2829 is going to be key here.
 

2493
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,630
Yeah, that 2829 is going to be key here.
Over under, they reclaim that. Uh say

2494
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
Over under, they reclaim that. Uh say
 

2495
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,630
Over under, they reclaim that. Uh say
bears are in big trouble. They reject

2496
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:48,640
bears are in big trouble. They reject
 

2497
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,830
bears are in big trouble. They reject
that. There's still a chance to move

2498
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:49,840
that. There's still a chance to move
 

2499
01:10:49,840 --> 01:11:00,390
that. There's still a chance to move
lower.

2500
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:00,400

 

2501
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:07,830

They're

2502
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:07,840

 

2503
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,590

starting to reclaim it. They hold a bid

2504
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:09,600
starting to reclaim it. They hold a bid
 

2505
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,390
starting to reclaim it. They hold a bid
here, they will squeeze out. No trade

2506
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:12,400
here, they will squeeze out. No trade
 

2507
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,709
here, they will squeeze out. No trade
again then.

2508
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:16,719

 

2509
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,870

They didn't reach

2510
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:18,880
They didn't reach
 

2511
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,709
They didn't reach
for the lows and didn't offer the sell

2512
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719
for the lows and didn't offer the sell
 

2513
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:54,390
for the lows and didn't offer the sell
versus here reclaimed.

2514
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:54,400

 

2515
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,470

What a uh

2516
01:11:58,470 --> 01:11:58,480

 

2517
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,870

weird market not to retest, reclaim and

2518
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:00,880
weird market not to retest, reclaim and
 

2519
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,990
weird market not to retest, reclaim and
then probably reg.

2520
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,000
then probably reg.
 

2521
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,750
then probably reg.
So will they go for that next point of

2522
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:05,760
So will they go for that next point of
 

2523
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,750
So will they go for that next point of
control is the question which would be

2524
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:07,760
control is the question which would be
 

2525
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:18,390
control is the question which would be
80s or 75 somewhere up there.

2526
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:18,400

 

2527
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,910

Buyers will want to step in here. They

2528
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920
Buyers will want to step in here. They
 

2529
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,910
Buyers will want to step in here. They
will not want to lose this edge again.

2530
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:21,920
will not want to lose this edge again.
 

2531
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,310
will not want to lose this edge again.
30s. They lose that edge again. The

2532
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:24,320
30s. They lose that edge again. The
 

2533
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:31,030
30s. They lose that edge again. The
rotation still possible.

2534
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,040

 

2535
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:38,870

Got sweet coffee.

2536
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880

 

2537
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,030

Yeah, exactly. Same story all year. It's

2538
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
Yeah, exactly. Same story all year. It's
 

2539
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,790
Yeah, exactly. Same story all year. It's
not even like the bears though at this

2540
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:42,800
not even like the bears though at this
 

2541
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,030
not even like the bears though at this
point. It's um more just like

2542
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:47,040
point. It's um more just like
 

2543
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,189
point. It's um more just like
how we're reclaiming is very very ugly

2544
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199
how we're reclaiming is very very ugly
 

2545
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,910
how we're reclaiming is very very ugly
and very very very dangerous. Uh this is

2546
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:51,920
and very very very dangerous. Uh this is
 

2547
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,350
and very very very dangerous. Uh this is
what I mean. Low volume markets

2548
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
what I mean. Low volume markets
 

2549
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,830
what I mean. Low volume markets
they're nasty because we don't respect

2550
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:57,840
they're nasty because we don't respect
 

2551
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,470
they're nasty because we don't respect
uh levels very well because this might

2552
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
uh levels very well because this might
 

2553
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,709
uh levels very well because this might
look big but it's tiny. You know that's

2554
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:02,719
look big but it's tiny. You know that's
 

2555
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,149
look big but it's tiny. You know that's
like there's not not much here. More

2556
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
like there's not not much here. More
 

2557
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,990
like there's not not much here. More
down here because it's a bigger area but

2558
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:08,000
down here because it's a bigger area but
 

2559
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,669
down here because it's a bigger area but
still like we're trading very light

2560
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:09,679
still like we're trading very light
 

2561
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:13,590
still like we're trading very light
volume. It's uh it's really dangerous.

2562
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:13,600
volume. It's uh it's really dangerous.
 

2563
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,365
volume. It's uh it's really dangerous.
Really, really dangerous.

2564
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:18,375

 

2565
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:21,750

2567
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,430

There's no follow through, you know?

There's no follow through, you know?

There's no follow through, you know?
There's no follow through e either

2572
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
direction. Like, we we're drifting, but
 

2573

2575
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,110
there's no real follow through. We're in
breakout buys. Remember, we're in

01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,120
breakout buys. Remember, we're in
 

2577
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,470

Like down here, you know,

2582
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:38,159
Like down here, you know,
 

2583
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,110
Like down here, you know,
again, it's another day again where Asia

2584
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,120
again, it's another day again where Asia
 

2585
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,950
again, it's another day again where Asia
has had all the fun. You know, they get

2586
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:42,960
has had all the fun. You know, they get
 

2587
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,550
has had all the fun. You know, they get
the rotation, they get the cheap buy,

2588
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:44,560
the rotation, they get the cheap buy,
 

2589
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,189
the rotation, they get the cheap buy,
and we go, they get the buy. Everyone or

2590
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:47,199
and we go, they get the buy. Everyone or
 

2591
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,510
and we go, they get the buy. Everyone or
London gets the buy. Everyone else is is

2592
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,520
London gets the buy. Everyone else is is
 

2593
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,350
London gets the buy. Everyone else is is
trying to buy very very high right now.

2594
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:51,360
trying to buy very very high right now.
 

2595
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,189
trying to buy very very high right now.
It's

2596
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
It's
 

2597
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,750
It's
it's not it's not ideal. It's really not

2598
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:55,760
it's not it's not ideal. It's really not
 

2599
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,910
it's not it's not ideal. It's really not
ideal to be trying to trade higher up

2600
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:57,920
ideal to be trying to trade higher up
 

2601
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,910
ideal to be trying to trade higher up
here after a six day squeeze out on low

2602
01:13:59,910 --> 01:13:59,920
here after a six day squeeze out on low
 

2603
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,189
here after a six day squeeze out on low
volume. It's uh about as dangerous as

2604
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:03,199
volume. It's uh about as dangerous as
 

2605
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,110
volume. It's uh about as dangerous as
you get. It might very well keep going,

2606
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:05,120
you get. It might very well keep going,
 

2607
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,350
you get. It might very well keep going,
but it's very very dangerous cuz it

2608
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
but it's very very dangerous cuz it
 

2609
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,350
but it's very very dangerous cuz it
would not take a lot if someone gets

2610
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
would not take a lot if someone gets
 

2611
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,030
would not take a lot if someone gets
stuck. It would not take a lot to see

2612
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:11,040
stuck. It would not take a lot to see
 

2613
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:19,110
stuck. It would not take a lot to see
this thing slam on faces, you know.

2614
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:19,120

 

2615
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,790

Look at that failed breakout there again

2616
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:20,800
Look at that failed breakout there again
 

2617
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,630
Look at that failed breakout there again
of the high right back down into that

2618
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
of the high right back down into that
 

2619
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,990
of the high right back down into that
25. This is where that guy's been

2620
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,000
25. This is where that guy's been
 

2621
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,510
25. This is where that guy's been
absorbing all day. If he gets stuck

2622
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:25,520
absorbing all day. If he gets stuck
 

2623
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,229
absorbing all day. If he gets stuck
here, like we've talked about this,

2624
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:28,239
here, like we've talked about this,
 

2625
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:31,110
here, like we've talked about this,
this can trade lower. If he gets stuck,

2626
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,120
this can trade lower. If he gets stuck,
 

2627
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:43,669
this can trade lower. If he gets stuck,
this can trade lower.

2628
01:14:43,669 --> 01:14:43,679

 

2629
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,149

There we go. Someone's stuck. This is

2630
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:46,159
There we go. Someone's stuck. This is
 

2631
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,310
There we go. Someone's stuck. This is
his level.

2632
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:48,320
his level.
 

2633
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:59,270
his level.
This is his level.

2634
01:14:59,270 --> 01:14:59,280

 

2635
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:21,510

They're trying to wash

2636
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:21,520

 

2637
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,430

Oh, if he gets stuck, it's going to

2638
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:23,440
Oh, if he gets stuck, it's going to
 

2639
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,070
Oh, if he gets stuck, it's going to
wash. This is what I mean about so

2640
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,080
wash. This is what I mean about so
 

2641
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,830
wash. This is what I mean about so
dangerous.

2642
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
dangerous.
 

2643
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,830
dangerous.
If he gets stuck here, this is the same

2644
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:29,840
If he gets stuck here, this is the same
 

2645
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,390
If he gets stuck here, this is the same
guy. This is his level 25s there, there

2646
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:32,400
guy. This is his level 25s there, there
 

2647
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,990
guy. This is his level 25s there, there
or thereabouts. And he's been soaking

2648
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,000
or thereabouts. And he's been soaking
 

2649
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,830
or thereabouts. And he's been soaking
and soaking and soaking and soaking and

2650
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:35,840
and soaking and soaking and soaking and
 

2651
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:42,070
and soaking and soaking and soaking and
soaking.

2652
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,080

 

2653
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,669

He's trying again. He's trying to absorb

2654
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:43,679
He's trying again. He's trying to absorb
 

2655
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,430
He's trying again. He's trying to absorb
the tape pit. If he gets caught, it's

2656
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
the tape pit. If he gets caught, it's
 

2657
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:51,990
the tape pit. If he gets caught, it's
going to get a nasty candle down.

2658
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,000

 

2659
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,590

Here we come. And it's going to it's

2660
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:53,600
Here we come. And it's going to it's
 

2661
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,830
Here we come. And it's going to it's
going to hurt him. He's tried so many

2662
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:55,840
going to hurt him. He's tried so many
 

2663
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,990
going to hurt him. He's tried so many
times here. Like I said, I thought we'd

2664
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,000
times here. Like I said, I thought we'd
 

2665
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,510
times here. Like I said, I thought we'd
move back to point of control that first

2666
01:15:59,510 --> 01:15:59,520
move back to point of control that first
 

2667
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,830
move back to point of control that first
attempt, right, and VWAP. And you're now

2668
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:01,840
attempt, right, and VWAP. And you're now
 

2669
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,510
attempt, right, and VWAP. And you're now
going to see it. It's odd that they felt

2670
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
going to see it. It's odd that they felt
 

2671
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,870
going to see it. It's odd that they felt
the need to come back here one more

2672
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
the need to come back here one more
 

2673
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,950
the need to come back here one more

They do things in one single candle.

They do things in one single candle.

2723
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,870

mean, yeah, it's so risky. It's risky to

mean, yeah, it's so risky. It's risky to

take that honestly when we're being a
 

2727
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,390
take that honestly when we're being a

2728
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:22,400
directional move. But you can see they
 

2729
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,630
directional move. But you can see they
didn't want to trade up into the last

didn't want to trade up into the last

didn't want to trade up into the last

So any rejection of uh this area here

So any rejection of uh this area here
now will see lower prices. they reclaim

now will see lower prices. they reclaim

this then we'll use this liquidity to go

01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,270

to get back down to that previous day

2830
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:53,679
to get back down to that previous day
 

2831
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,750
to get back down to that previous day
high, which they've done. And you might

2832
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:55,760
high, which they've done. And you might
 

2833
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,270
high, which they've done. And you might
see bullish continuation. Like we said,

2834
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,280
see bullish continuation. Like we said,
 

2835
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,870
see bullish continuation. Like we said,
we can see an inverse head and shoulder

2836
01:19:58,870 --> 01:19:58,880
we can see an inverse head and shoulder
 

2837
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,630
we can see an inverse head and shoulder
if they reclaim that range above and we

2838
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:00,640
if they reclaim that range above and we
 

2839
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,030
if they reclaim that range above and we
can go again. But at the moment, what

2840
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:03,040
can go again. But at the moment, what
 

2841
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,709
can go again. But at the moment, what
I'd like to see is to see if there's

2842
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:04,719
I'd like to see is to see if there's
 

2843
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:17,669
I'd like to see is to see if there's
some refresh sellers in this market.

2844
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:17,679

 

2845
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,550

I've just got a load of

2846
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:20,560
I've just got a load of
 

2847
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:26,149
I've just got a load of
issues on Ninja Trader here firing off.

2848
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159

 

2849
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,149

Let me just close this down and reopen

2850
01:20:28,149 --> 01:20:28,159
Let me just close this down and reopen
 

2851
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:46,790
Let me just close this down and reopen
it. Give me a second, folks.

2852
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,800

 

2853
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:53,669

Come on, NT. Get open, please.

2854
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:53,679

 

2855
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,910

Nice, Troy. Nice work. Yeah, I didn't

2856
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:55,920
Nice, Troy. Nice work. Yeah, I didn't
 

2857
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,229
Nice, Troy. Nice work. Yeah, I didn't
catch it. And I just put a limit order

2858
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:58,239
catch it. And I just put a limit order
 

2859
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,709
catch it. And I just put a limit order
up here and I just got a load of error

2860
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:00,719
up here and I just got a load of error
 

2861
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,390
up here and I just got a load of error
messages. So now I'm a bit concerned

2862
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,400
messages. So now I'm a bit concerned
 

2863
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,430
messages. So now I'm a bit concerned
that my NT Oh great, it's put me in a

2864
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:05,440
that my NT Oh great, it's put me in a
 

2865
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,750
that my NT Oh great, it's put me in a
position. Has it

2866
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
position. Has it
 

2867
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:20,229
position. Has it
on one account? The [\h__\h]

2868
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:20,239

 

2869
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:37,669

Are you joking?

2870
01:21:37,669 --> 01:21:37,679

 

2871
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:39,510

Sorry folks. Just waiting for my NT to

2872
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
Sorry folks. Just waiting for my NT to
 

2873
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,590
Sorry folks. Just waiting for my NT to
reopen it. I can see it's put me in one

2874
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:41,600
reopen it. I can see it's put me in one
 

2875
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,310
reopen it. I can see it's put me in one
position and it won't open. There's the

2876
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:44,320
position and it won't open. There's the
 

2877
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,669
position and it won't open. There's the
failures, guys. You're going to give the

2878
01:21:45,669 --> 01:21:45,679
failures, guys. You're going to give the
 

2879
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,189
failures, guys. You're going to give the
whole thing back. This is what I was

2880
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:47,199
whole thing back. This is what I was
 

2881
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:51,030
whole thing back. This is what I was
warning you of.

2882
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040

 

2883
01:21:51,040 --> 01:22:21,910

Come on, market. Can you open please?

2884
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:21,920

 

2885
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:42,550

Oh, it's TPT causing the problems.

2886
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560

 

2887
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:54,950

That's weird.

2888
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960

 

2889
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,702

Where are they?

2890
01:22:58,702 --> 01:22:58,712

 

2891
01:22:58,712 --> 01:23:05,910

[sighs]

2892
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:05,920

 

2893
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:19,510

Sorry folks, I've got some issue here.

2894
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:19,520

 

2895
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,910

can't find my TPT accounts. I can't log

2896
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:21,920
can't find my TPT accounts. I can't log
 

2897
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,590
can't find my TPT accounts. I can't log
into TPT.

2898
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:25,600

 

2899
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,590

I It says I've got no accounts and I

2900
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
I It says I've got no accounts and I
 

2901
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,229
I It says I've got no accounts and I
have I've got three.

2902
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239

 

2903
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:41,110

I'll deal with it afterwards then.

2904
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:41,120

 

2905
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,669

Very bizarre. Anyone else having that?

2906
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:43,679
Very bizarre. Anyone else having that?
 

2907
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:49,030
Very bizarre. Anyone else having that?
It's TPT down today or anything via uh

2908

It's TPT down today or anything via uh
 

2909

It's TPT down today or anything via uh
trader bait?

2910
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:51,840
trader bait?
 

2911
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,990
trader bait?
Can't log I can't log on to it via Ninja

2912
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
Can't log I can't log on to it via Ninja
 

2913
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:02,310
Can't log I can't log on to it via Ninja
Trader at the moment.

2914
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:02,320

 

2915
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,070

Yours is all good. Okay. Maybe it's just

2916
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:04,080
Yours is all good. Okay. Maybe it's just
 

2917
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:33,510
Yours is all good. Okay. Maybe it's just
an issue my server somewhere.

2918
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:33,520

 

2919
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:51,910

That's bizarre.

2920
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:51,920

 

2921
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,550

So, my connection's gone on TPT. I

2922
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:54,560
So, my connection's gone on TPT. I
 

2923
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:13,510
So, my connection's gone on TPT. I
cannot log into it.

2924
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:13,520

 

2925
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:22,470

I'll deal with that mate, I guess.

2926
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480

 

2927
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,910

Okay. Well, we're holding previous day

2928
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
Okay. Well, we're holding previous day
 

2929
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,110
Okay. Well, we're holding previous day
high here. Sorry, I'm going to have to

2930
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,120
high here. Sorry, I'm going to have to
 

2931
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,790
high here. Sorry, I'm going to have to
get my head back in the game now. That's

2932
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:26,800
get my head back in the game now. That's
 

2933
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,350
get my head back in the game now. That's
I can't figure out what's gone on there.

2934
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:31,360

 

2935
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,270

Holding previous day high here. There's

2936
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,280
Holding previous day high here. There's
 

2937
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,430
Holding previous day high here. There's
the wash down to this point. This is

2938
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:35,440
the wash down to this point. This is
 

2939
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,430
the wash down to this point. This is
your breakout level. This is your daily

2940
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:37,440

this is what caused the squeeze. Here's

this is what caused the squeeze. Here's
 

2945
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,110
this is what caused the squeeze. Here's
your daily breakout. Here's your edge of

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,830
your daily breakout. Here's your edge of
volume. How we act here now becomes key.

If they reclaim this shelf here, all

If they reclaim this shelf here, all
right, if we reclaim this and build

01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
right, if we reclaim this and build
 

2959
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,870
right, if we reclaim this and build
liquidity out here, this would be the

2960
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:02,880
liquidity out here, this would be the
 

2961
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,550
liquidity out here, this would be the
move to go higher. This is your

2962
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
move to go higher. This is your
 

2963
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,669
move to go higher. This is your
overunder this level here. Now, bears

2964
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:07,679
overunder this level here. Now, bears
 

2965
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,669
overunder this level here. Now, bears
will want to defend to create a

01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:09,679
will want to defend to create a
 

2967
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,189
will want to defend to create a
rotation. That's their job right now.

2968
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:13,199
rotation. That's their job right now.
 

2969
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,110
rotation. That's their job right now.

and underneath previous day high as we
 

2971
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,390
and underneath previous day high as we
start getting underneath here. This will

2972
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,400
start getting underneath here. This will
 

2973
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,750
start getting underneath here. This will
be your fail breakout. This will be

be your fail breakout. This will be

But don't worry, I need to learn

But don't worry, I need to learn
 

2979
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,830
But don't worry, I need to learn
something new every day. I don't know

01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:25,840
something new every day. I don't know
 

2981
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,750
something new every day. I don't know
what I'm talking about. Haven't made

01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:27,760
what I'm talking about. Haven't made
 

2983
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,910
what I'm talking about. Haven't made
this absolutely abundantly clear all

this absolutely abundantly clear all
 

2985

You're good. Okay. [sighs]

Okay. So, if they keep failing this edge
here, they will expand range. You'd be

3004
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:57,120

3019
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,950
came from, but you can easily be a bid
up

3020
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:14,960
up
 

3021
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,870
up
in this market at some point. Let's have

3022
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:16,880

3023
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,950

a little look. VIX has found a bid is

01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:18,960
a little look. VIX has found a bid is
 

3025
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,750

01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:21,760
back over its New York open and it's
 

3027
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,590
back over its New York open and it's
trying to squeeze to close the gap back

3028
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:23,600
trying to squeeze to close the gap back
 

3029
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,990
trying to squeeze to close the gap back
to 1725s.

3030
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,000
to 1725s.
 

3031
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,189
to 1725s.
And if it does that, you'll see

3032
01:27:27,189 --> 01:27:27,199
And if it does that, you'll see
 

3033
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:45,189
And if it does that, you'll see
increased pressure on this market.

3034

this. So the rotation right now is
 

3047
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,229

01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:10,560
is the rotation. How we act here becomes
 

3055
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,629
is the rotation. How we act here becomes
key. If they reclaim it, bulls can take

3056
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:12,639
key. If they reclaim it, bulls can take
 

3057
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:20,629
key. If they reclaim it, bulls can take
control of the market again.

3058
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:20,639

 

3059
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,149

And we have an imbalance up here all the

And we have an imbalance up here all the
 

3061

And we have an imbalance up here all the
way up to 600. Same area that I talked

way up to 600. Same area that I talked
about before. All the way up to 600.

01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,950
about before. All the way up to 600.
There is a imbalance here from this big

to this gray box now. How we act into

3070
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:33,920
to this gray box now. How we act into
 

3071
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:40,070
to this gray box now. How we act into
this is pivotal.

3072
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,080

 

3073
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,790

He's an absolute joke.
 

3083
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,189
He's an absolute joke.
And I think if they don't pick a winner,

3084
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:57,199
And I think if they don't pick a winner,
 

3085

And I think if they don't pick a winner,

reclaim this range now. So if they hold

3148
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:27,840
reclaim this range now. So if they hold
 

3149
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,590
reclaim this range now. So if they hold
pullbacks into here now, bulls will take

3150
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:29,600
pullbacks into here now, bulls will take
 

3151
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,030
pullbacks into here now, bulls will take
over. All right, they hold pullbacks

3152
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:31,040
over. All right, they hold pullbacks
 

3153
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,629
over. All right, they hold pullbacks
into here now, they will look for that

3154
01:30:32,629 --> 01:30:32,639
into here now, they will look for that
 

3155
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,897
into here now, they will look for that
continuation I've been talking about.

01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,310

So you could I don't know maybe you can

3306
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:14,320
So you could I don't know maybe you can
 

3307
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,669
So you could I don't know maybe you can
even get a heat map on there. I don't

3308
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679
even get a heat map on there. I don't
 

3309
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:17,510
even get a heat map on there. I don't
know. I don't use it. But you can

3310
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:17,520
know. I don't use it. But you can
 

3311
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,229
know. I don't use it. But you can
definitely get

3312
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:20,239
definitely get
 

3313
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:22,790
definitely get
uh level two and footprints and volume

3314
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
uh level two and footprints and volume
 

3315

Don't just squeeze straight out here.

3322
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
Don't just squeeze straight out here.
 

3323
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:40,629
Don't just squeeze straight out here.
Come on.

3324
01:35:40,629 --> 01:35:40,639

 

3325
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:44,310

Well, squeeze out. It is new highs

3326
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,320
Well, squeeze out. It is new highs
 

3327
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,149
Well, squeeze out. It is new highs
coming.

3328
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
coming.
 

3329
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:49,270
coming.
You out.

3330
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,280
You out.

You out.
New highs coming here.

3332
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:54,320

 

3333
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,830

And once we get through this, I'd say

3334
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:55,840
And once we get through this, I'd say
 

3335
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,430
And once we get through this, I'd say
680 to 700. That's uh the next level.

3336
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
680 to 700. That's uh the next level.
 

3337
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,030
680 to 700. That's uh the next level.
It's an old point of control on a

3338
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:01,040
It's an old point of control on a
 

3339
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:16,790
It's an old point of control on a
weekly.

3340
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:16,800

 

3341
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,510

So, ball's successfully defending his

3342
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:19,520
So, ball's successfully defending his
 

3343
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:29,030
So, ball's successfully defending his
pivot.

3344
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040

 

3345
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,750

Honestly, this is going to go.

3346
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:31,760
Honestly, this is going to go.
 

3347
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:39,830
Honestly, this is going to go.
Such buggers, man. Here

3348
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:39,840

 

3349
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:45,830

it goes.

3350
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:45,840

 

3351
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,990

Will you pick me up first?

3352
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:50,000

 

3353
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,790

This is what we talked about earlier. I

3354
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:52,800
This is what we talked about earlier. I
 

3355
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,790
This is what we talked about earlier. I
said if it reclaims this and we build

3356
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:54,800
said if it reclaims this and we build
 

3357
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,390
said if it reclaims this and we build
this, we can go. Unfortunately, it's

3358
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
this, we can go. Unfortunately, it's
 

3359
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,070
this, we can go. Unfortunately, it's
done like a couple of tiny bars here.

3360
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:00,080
done like a couple of tiny bars here.
 

3361
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,830
done like a couple of tiny bars here.
This is the move versus this. This is

3362
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:01,840
This is the move versus this. This is
 

3363
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,350
This is the move versus this. This is
why I didn't want to buy up here. I

3364
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:03,360
why I didn't want to buy up here. I
 

3365
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,430
why I didn't want to buy up here. I
wanted to wait for a retest of this

3366
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:05,440
wanted to wait for a retest of this
 

3367
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,430
wanted to wait for a retest of this
daily level and then I was hoping to get

3368
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:07,440
daily level and then I was hoping to get
 

3369
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,229
daily level and then I was hoping to get
a higher low here to get get higher but

3370
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:10,239
a higher low here to get get higher but
 

3371
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,870
a higher low here to get get higher but
again this market just uh adamant in

3372
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
again this market just uh adamant in
 

3373
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,470
again this market just uh adamant in
squeezing and I'd say

3374
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:16,480
squeezing and I'd say
 

3375
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,750
squeezing and I'd say
680700 is the level and you've got

3376
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:19,760
680700 is the level and you've got
 

3377
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,430
680700 is the level and you've got
confluence here for a squeeze through it

3378
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:21,440
confluence here for a squeeze through it
 

3379
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,070
confluence here for a squeeze through it
into sort of 720s

3380
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:24,080
into sort of 720s
 

3381
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,430
into sort of 720s
measured move will get you all the way

3382
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:25,440
measured move will get you all the way
 

3383
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,149
measured move will get you all the way
up to 780. Where would 780 take us?

3384
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:28,159
up to 780. Where would 780 take us?
 

3385
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:33,669
up to 780. Where would 780 take us?
Well, 780 will take us through

3386
01:37:33,669 --> 01:37:33,679

 

3387
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:37,990

an old uh weekly value area high 770.

3388
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,000
an old uh weekly value area high 770.
 

3389
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,310
an old uh weekly value area high 770.
And we have liquidity resting at 825s,

3390
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:40,320
And we have liquidity resting at 825s,
 

3391
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,629
And we have liquidity resting at 825s,
827s. This thing is just squeezing.

3392
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
827s. This thing is just squeezing.
 

3393
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,629
827s. This thing is just squeezing.
Straight squeezing now. Nothing I can

3394
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
Straight squeezing now. Nothing I can
 

3395
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:47,510
Straight squeezing now. Nothing I can
do. It's gone. It's gone. This is the

3396
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:47,520
do. It's gone. It's gone. This is the
 

3397
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:52,550
do. It's gone. It's gone. This is the
market right now.

3398
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:52,560

 

3399
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,030

Won't pick me up today. finally wanted

3400
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,040
Won't pick me up today. finally wanted
 

3401
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,990
Won't pick me up today. finally wanted
to get pulled into it and it won't pick

3402
01:37:57,990 --> 01:37:58,000
to get pulled into it and it won't pick
 

3403
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,958
to get pulled into it and it won't pick
me up.

3404
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:01,968

 

3405
01:38:01,968 --> 01:38:06,870

[cough]

3406
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:06,880

 

3407
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,950

Yeah, go Mr. Market. Well, thanks very

3412
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:44,400

 

3413
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,990

still it goes. If you're long, you can

3414
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,000
still it goes. If you're long, you can
 

3415
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,550
still it goes. If you're long, you can
just hold on. Your TP1 was uh that

3416
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:48,560
just hold on. Your TP1 was uh that
 

3417
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,510
just hold on. Your TP1 was uh that
initial balance high. You're if you're

3418
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:51,520
initial balance high. You're if you're
 

3419
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,189
initial balance high. You're if you're
if you're already long, you can hold on.

3420
01:38:53,189 --> 01:38:53,199
if you're already long, you can hold on.
 

3421
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,950
if you're already long, you can hold on.
We get very very very thick. I'll show

3422
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:54,960
We get very very very thick. I'll show
 

3423
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,629
We get very very very thick. I'll show
you what I'm looking at in case you've

3424
01:38:56,629 --> 01:38:56,639
you what I'm looking at in case you've
 

3425
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,629
you what I'm looking at in case you've
forgotten from this morning. All right.

3426
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:58,639
forgotten from this morning. All right.
 

3427
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:01,109
forgotten from this morning. All right.
This is where we get thick. This is

3428
01:39:01,109 --> 01:39:01,119
This is where we get thick. This is
 

3429
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,629
This is where we get thick. This is
where we're currently trading at this

3430
01:39:02,629 --> 01:39:02,639
where we're currently trading at this
 

3431
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:04,870
where we're currently trading at this
green line. This is an old PC. We're

3432
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:04,880
green line. This is an old PC. We're
 

3433
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,870
green line. This is an old PC. We're
very, very thick in here. So, this is

3434
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:06,880
very, very thick in here. So, this is
 

3435
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,470
very, very thick in here. So, this is
why I wanted to buy. I didn't want to

3436
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:08,480
why I wanted to buy. I didn't want to
 

3437
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,669
why I wanted to buy. I didn't want to
buy in here. It's way too risky. I

3438
01:39:11,669 --> 01:39:11,679
buy in here. It's way too risky. I
 

3439
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,750
buy in here. It's way too risky. I
wanted to buy way cheaper all this

3440
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:13,760
wanted to buy way cheaper all this
 

3441
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,590
wanted to buy way cheaper all this
rotation and you can sell into it. So,

3442
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:15,600
rotation and you can sell into it. So,
 

3443
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,990
rotation and you can sell into it. So,
I'd say next TP

3444
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,000
I'd say next TP
 

3445
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,229
I'd say next TP
probably into this 80. You're pretty

3446
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
probably into this 80. You're pretty
 

3447
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,310
probably into this 80. You're pretty
much almost there. Once you get through

3448
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:22,320
much almost there. Once you get through
 

3449
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,990
much almost there. Once you get through
that, we've got liquidity resting at 25

3450
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,000
that, we've got liquidity resting at 25
 

3451
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,510
that, we've got liquidity resting at 25
725.

3452
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:29,520

 

3453
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,830

old value area 770. You can mark these

3454
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:31,840
old value area 770. You can mark these
 

3455
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:35,669
old value area 770. You can mark these
out. So I'd mark out

3456
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:35,679
out. So I'd mark out
 

3457
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,510
out. So I'd mark out
80s,

3458
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:37,520
80s,
 

3459
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,310
80s,
725,

3460
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:40,320
725,
 

3461

Would I have this areas 4hour supply? I

3556
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:53,600
Would I have this areas 4hour supply? I
 

3557
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,590
Would I have this areas 4hour supply? I
would imagine so based on I've got it as

3558
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:55,600
would imagine so based on I've got it as
 

3559
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,990
would imagine so based on I've got it as
a weekly supply and a daily supply and

3560
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,000
a weekly supply and a daily supply and
 

3561
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,430
a weekly supply and a daily supply and
yes I would imagine it's a 4 hour

3562
01:42:59,430 --> 01:42:59,440
yes I would imagine it's a 4 hour
 

3563
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,470
yes I would imagine it's a 4 hour
supply. But what I would say is it's not

3564
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:02,480
supply. But what I would say is it's not
 

3565
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,870
supply. But what I would say is it's not
that fresh. I mean it's fresh since when

3566
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:04,880
that fresh. I mean it's fresh since when
 

3567
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,510
that fresh. I mean it's fresh since when
did we create it? Monday the 10th all

3568
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:07,520
did we create it? Monday the 10th all
 

3569
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,310
did we create it? Monday the 10th all
the way into Thursday the 13th. So we

3570
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:10,320
the way into Thursday the 13th. So we
 

3571
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,790
the way into Thursday the 13th. So we
have three days of supply and this is

3572
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:12,800
have three days of supply and this is
 

3573
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,030
have three days of supply and this is
the first time testing it since we left

3574
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:15,040
the first time testing it since we left
 

3575
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,310
the first time testing it since we left
it on let's just say Thursday the 13th.

3576
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,320
it on let's just say Thursday the 13th.
 

3577
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,550
it on let's just say Thursday the 13th.
We le we left it. This is our first sort

3578
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:20,560
We le we left it. This is our first sort
 

3579
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:24,149
We le we left it. This is our first sort
of test of it since. But that supply

3580
01:43:24,149 --> 01:43:24,159
of test of it since. But that supply
 

3581
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,590
of test of it since. But that supply
that was created from the 10th to the

3582
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:25,600
that was created from the 10th to the
 

3583
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,669
that was created from the 10th to the
13th was the same supply that was

3584
01:43:27,669 --> 01:43:27,679
13th was the same supply that was
 

3585
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,470
13th was the same supply that was
created from the 4th to the 6th. So

3586
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:30,480
created from the 4th to the 6th. So
 

3587
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,669
created from the 4th to the 6th. So
while it's thick, it just depends. Are

3588
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:33,679
while it's thick, it just depends. Are
 

3589
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:35,830
while it's thick, it just depends. Are
there passive sellers sat here anymore?

3590
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:35,840
there passive sellers sat here anymore?
 

3591
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,830
there passive sellers sat here anymore?
Or are they, you know, have they had

3593
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,070

3594
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:40,080
their rotation for that weekly low that
 

3595
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,870
their rotation for that weekly low that
we had two weeks ago, right? Maybe they

3596
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:42,880
we had two weeks ago, right? Maybe they
 

3597
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,390
we had two weeks ago, right? Maybe they
exited down there. We're going to find

3598
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:44,400
exited down there. We're going to find
 

3599
01:43:44,400 --> 01:44:08,229

There's the breakout. Make it simple.
 

3617
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,390
There's the breakout. Make it simple.
It's a flag and go.

3618
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:28,400
It's a flag and go.
 

3619
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,990
It's a flag and go.
The problem is this, right? You're

3620
01:44:31,990 --> 01:44:32,000
The problem is this, right? You're
 

3621
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,709
The problem is this, right? You're
breaking out into

3622
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:34,719
breaking out into
 

3623
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,950
breaking out into
resistance, right? And we don't know.

3624
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:36,960
resistance, right? And we don't know.
 

3625
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,870
resistance, right? And we don't know.
Well, like I said, if it did this and

3626
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:38,880
Well, like I said, if it did this and
 

3627
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,430
Well, like I said, if it did this and
came under the breakout level, then

3628
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:41,440
came under the breakout level, then
 

3629
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,109
came under the breakout level, then
you'd get a collapse. We came back down

3630
01:44:43,109 --> 01:44:43,119
you'd get a collapse. We came back down
 

3631
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:44,709
you'd get a collapse. We came back down
to that breakout level. Remember this

3632
01:44:44,709 --> 01:44:44,719
to that breakout level. Remember this
 

3633
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:48,390
to that breakout level. Remember this
level here, 547 or whatever it is, it's

3634
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:48,400
level here, 547 or whatever it is, it's
 

3635
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:53,510
level here, 547 or whatever it is, it's
the same level.

3636
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:53,520

 

3637
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,669

It's this,

3638
01:44:55,669 --> 01:44:55,679
It's this,
 

3639
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,430
It's this,
right? That's your daily breakout.

3640
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:57,440
right? That's your daily breakout.
 

3641
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:01,510
right? That's your daily breakout.
Breakout, retest, held, singular move.

3642
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:01,520
Breakout, retest, held, singular move.
 

3643
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,350
Breakout, retest, held, singular move.
That's ugly when we do this. That's

3644
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
That's ugly when we do this. That's
 

3645
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,910
That's ugly when we do this. That's
ugly. You want it to do this so you can

3646
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:05,920
ugly. You want it to do this so you can
 

3647
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,629
ugly. You want it to do this so you can
join in for that move.

3648
01:45:08,629 --> 01:45:08,639
join in for that move.
 

3649
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,229
join in for that move.
I don't control the market. The market

3650
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:10,239
I don't control the market. The market
 

3651
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:11,669
I don't control the market. The market
will do whatever it is it wants to do.

3652
01:45:11,669 --> 01:45:11,679
will do whatever it is it wants to do.
 

3653
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,350
will do whatever it is it wants to do.
We can see the levels. We can see the

3654
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:13,360
We can see the levels. We can see the
 

3655
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:18,847
We can see the levels. We can see the
plays, but we can't control how it acts.

3656
01:45:18,847 --> 01:45:18,857
plays, but we can't control how it acts.
 

3657
01:45:18,857 --> 01:45:42,070
plays, but we can't control how it acts.
[cough]

3658
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:42,080

 

3659
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,910

Alex I'm seeing the same pattern these

3660
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:43,920
Alex I'm seeing the same pattern these
 

3661
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,870
Alex I'm seeing the same pattern these
days on ES sweep the H1

3662
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:46,880
days on ES sweep the H1
 

3663
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,350
days on ES sweep the H1
then sweep sweep the H1 high then sweep

3664
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:49,360
then sweep sweep the H1 high then sweep
 

3665
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,350
then sweep sweep the H1 high then sweep
the H1 low before making the move. I

3666
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:51,360
the H1 low before making the move. I
 

3667
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,750
the H1 low before making the move. I
mean that that is more a sign of of a

3668
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:53,760
mean that that is more a sign of of a
 

3669
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,510
mean that that is more a sign of of a
rotational market. It's actually not

3670
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:55,520
rotational market. It's actually not
 

3671
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:07,830
rotational market. It's actually not
that common to sweep both sides.

3672
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:07,840

 

3673
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:13,189

Bitcoin 7% move with extreme fear. Well,

3674
01:46:13,189 --> 01:46:13,199

 

3675
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:26,070

let's have a look.

3676
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:26,080

 

3677
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:30,310

I mean, it's coming to a key area

3678
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:30,320
I mean, it's coming to a key area
 

3679
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,550
I mean, it's coming to a key area
and this can price back up to here and

3680
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:32,560
and this can price back up to here and
 

3681
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,669
and this can price back up to here and
still find a lower high and be sold

3682
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:35,679
still find a lower high and be sold
 

3683
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:40,229
still find a lower high and be sold
into, right? Because this can still do

3684
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:40,239
into, right? Because this can still do
 

3685
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:42,550
into, right? Because this can still do
this and there's your neckline. So, you

3686
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:42,560
this and there's your neckline. So, you
 

3687
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,070
this and there's your neckline. So, you
know,

3688
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,080
know,
 

3689
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,669
know,
is this a demand level? Yeah,

3690
01:46:45,669 --> 01:46:45,679
is this a demand level? Yeah,
 

3691
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:48,390
is this a demand level? Yeah,
absolutely.

3692
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:48,400
absolutely.
 

3693
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,629
absolutely.
that, you know, Bitcoin really has got

3694
01:46:50,629 --> 01:46:50,639
that, you know, Bitcoin really has got
 

3695
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,950
that, you know, Bitcoin really has got
to reclaim this area here, 99. You might

3696
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:52,960
to reclaim this area here, 99. You might
 

3697
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,350
to reclaim this area here, 99. You might
as well call it 100,000. Uh, this can

3698
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:55,360
as well call it 100,000. Uh, this can
 

3699
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,109
as well call it 100,000. Uh, this can
just be a move back in for them to

3700
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:57,119
just be a move back in for them to
 

3701
01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:00,310
just be a move back in for them to
resell. Absolutely can. You know,

3702
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:00,320
resell. Absolutely can. You know,
 

3703
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,390
resell. Absolutely can. You know,
there's your higher low on a daily, but

3704
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:02,400
there's your higher low on a daily, but
 

3705
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,590
there's your higher low on a daily, but
uh I'd be very cautious in Bitcoin right

3706
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:05,600
uh I'd be very cautious in Bitcoin right
 

3707
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,669
uh I'd be very cautious in Bitcoin right
now. It's done its thousand day cycle

3708
01:47:07,669 --> 01:47:07,679
now. It's done its thousand day cycle
 

3709
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:09,510
now. It's done its thousand day cycle
like I talked about, you know, number of

3710
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:09,520
like I talked about, you know, number of
 

3711
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:12,149
like I talked about, you know, number of
weeks ago here. We expect the bearish

3712
01:47:12,149 --> 01:47:12,159
weeks ago here. We expect the bearish
 

3713
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,990
weeks ago here. We expect the bearish
move because it's had a bull trend for a

3714
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:14,000
move because it's had a bull trend for a
 

3715
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,510
move because it's had a bull trend for a
thousand days. That is the cycle in

3716
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:15,520
thousand days. That is the cycle in
 

3717
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,149
thousand days. That is the cycle in
Bitcoin. thousand day bull trend and

3718
01:47:18,149 --> 01:47:18,159
Bitcoin. thousand day bull trend and
 

3719
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:23,189
Bitcoin. thousand day bull trend and
then 80% give back.

3720
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:23,199

 

3721
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:26,870

So NASDAQ is saying one more retest

3722
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:26,880
So NASDAQ is saying one more retest
 

3723
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,390
So NASDAQ is saying one more retest
24,000.

3724
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,400
24,000.
 

3725
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,629
24,000.
Uh we're not coming down to 24,000

3726
01:47:30,629 --> 01:47:30,639
Uh we're not coming down to 24,000
 

3727
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:32,870
Uh we're not coming down to 24,000
anytime soon.

3728
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:32,880
anytime soon.
 

3729
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,510
anytime soon.
It would be nice, but uh it's a long way

3730
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
It would be nice, but uh it's a long way
 

3731
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:43,109
It would be nice, but uh it's a long way
away right now on the cues.

3732
01:47:43,109 --> 01:47:43,119

 

3733
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:44,629

Get back down into here. It's a long

3734
01:47:44,629 --> 01:47:44,639
Get back down into here. It's a long
 

3735
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:47,910
Get back down into here. It's a long
long long long long way away. But uh I

3736
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:47,920
long long long long way away. But uh I
 

3737
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,270
long long long long way away. But uh I
want to see how we act at 25,000 24,900.

3738
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:51,280
want to see how we act at 25,000 24,900.
 

3739
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,030
want to see how we act at 25,000 24,900.
I think that's the the more important

3740
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:53,040
I think that's the the more important
 

3741
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:57,830
I think that's the the more important
level. Do bulls defend that

3742
01:47:57,830 --> 01:47:57,840

 

3743
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:58,950

just like we talked about in the

3744
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:58,960
just like we talked about in the
 

3745
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,070
just like we talked about in the
newsletter. That's going to be the

3746
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:00,080
newsletter. That's going to be the
 

3747
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,470
newsletter. That's going to be the
level.

3748
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:02,480
level.
 

3749
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,990
level.
Okay. So, probably going to come back

3750
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:04,000
Okay. So, probably going to come back
 

3751
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,030
Okay. So, probably going to come back
down now to this area here unless

3752
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:07,040
down now to this area here unless
 

3753
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,709
down now to this area here unless
they're going to do a bull a bear trap

3754
01:48:08,709 --> 01:48:08,719
they're going to do a bull a bear trap
 

3755
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:11,189
they're going to do a bull a bear trap
under here. that this area here will be

3756
01:48:11,189 --> 01:48:11,199
under here. that this area here will be
 

3757
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:13,910
under here. that this area here will be
of interest to me if they step in to buy

3758
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:13,920
of interest to me if they step in to buy
 

3759
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,070
of interest to me if they step in to buy
that or not.

3760
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:16,080
that or not.
 

3761
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,669
that or not.
But we are now inside of initial

3762
01:48:17,669 --> 01:48:17,679
But we are now inside of initial
 

3763
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:19,030
But we are now inside of initial
balance. We can just go into a

3764
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:19,040
balance. We can just go into a
 

3765
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:20,790
balance. We can just go into a
rotational day. This is not a trending

3766
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:20,800
rotational day. This is not a trending
 

3767
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,310
rotational day. This is not a trending
market. You might all think it's a

3768
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:22,320
market. You might all think it's a
 

3769
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,070
market. You might all think it's a
trending market. We're in breakout. But

3770
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:24,080
trending market. We're in breakout. But
 

3771
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,709
trending market. We're in breakout. But
so far today, all we've done is create

3772
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:26,719
so far today, all we've done is create
 

3773
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:31,590
so far today, all we've done is create
rotation.

3774
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:31,600

 

3775
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,270

I've not traded not traded. Tyson

3776
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:35,280
I've not traded not traded. Tyson
 

3777
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,590
I've not traded not traded. Tyson
missed the short and then NT went down

3778
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:37,600
missed the short and then NT went down
 

3779
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,510
missed the short and then NT went down
for me. So, I couldn't get anything and

3780
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:39,520
for me. So, I couldn't get anything and
 

3781
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:40,870
for me. So, I couldn't get anything and
I wouldn't have got the long anyway to

3782
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:40,880
I wouldn't have got the long anyway to
 

3783
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:41,910
I wouldn't have got the long anyway to
be honest because it didn't come back

3784
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:41,920
be honest because it didn't come back
 

3785
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,390
be honest because it didn't come back
and give me the test of here. I think

3786
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:44,400
and give me the test of here. I think
 

3787
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,350
and give me the test of here. I think
there's probably more upside in this

3788
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:47,360
there's probably more upside in this
 

3789
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,990
there's probably more upside in this
market. It just depends how low does it

3790
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:50,000
market. It just depends how low does it
 

3791
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,189
market. It just depends how low does it
want to go right now

3792
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199
want to go right now
 

3793
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:58,870
want to go right now
before resuming that uh that uptrend.

3794
01:48:58,870 --> 01:48:58,880

 

3795
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:10,470

That might have just been it.

3796
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:10,480

 

3797
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,149

Nvidia is getting absolutely whacked

3798
01:49:12,149 --> 01:49:12,159
Nvidia is getting absolutely whacked
 

3799
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:13,669
Nvidia is getting absolutely whacked
here though, folks. I will tell you that

3800
01:49:13,669 --> 01:49:13,679
here though, folks. I will tell you that
 

3801
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:16,470
here though, folks. I will tell you that
much. So, it tried to reclaim like we

3803
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,669
much. So, it tried to reclaim like we
talked about the 90 uh 8450s and it got

3804
01:49:19,669 --> 01:49:19,679
talked about the 90 uh 8450s and it got
 

3805
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:27,030
talked about the 90 uh 8450s and it got
absolutely slammed.

3806
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,040

 

3807

they've just trapped bears on that
 

3827
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,990
they've just trapped bears on that

We'll see what it offers. Is there a way
of getting involved?

3832
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:08,560

 

3833
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:22,149

Looks very bullish right now.

3834
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:22,159

 

3835
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,669

Long off VWAP. Um the bottom VWAP or the

3836
01:50:25,669 --> 01:50:25,679
Long off VWAP. Um the bottom VWAP or the
 

3837

New York reclaim.

3838
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:27,840
New York reclaim.
 

3839
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,629
New York reclaim.
Yeah, this was nice.

3840
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:30,639
Yeah, this was nice.
 

3841
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:36,310
Yeah, this was nice.
I mean, even this break here,

3842
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:36,320

 

3843
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,709

but I mean, I really wanted this. I

3844
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:38,719
but I mean, I really wanted this. I
 

3845
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:40,950
but I mean, I really wanted this. I
wanted to buy that for this move. It's

3846
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:40,960
wanted to buy that for this move. It's
 

3847
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,550
wanted to buy that for this move. It's
just not come. It's done it now, but

3848
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:42,560
just not come. It's done it now, but
 

3849
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:45,270
just not come. It's done it now, but
that's uh that's just a better trap into

3850
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:45,280
that's uh that's just a better trap into
 

3851
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,109
that's uh that's just a better trap into
the low volume node, protect it, and go

3852
01:50:47,109 --> 01:50:47,119
the low volume node, protect it, and go
 

3853
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:49,910
the low volume node, protect it, and go
higher. So, looking for ways of joining

3854
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:49,920
higher. So, looking for ways of joining
 

3855
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:51,590
higher. So, looking for ways of joining
this to move higher at this point, but

3856
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:51,600
this to move higher at this point, but
 

3857
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:53,189
this to move higher at this point, but
uh we're running out of room because we

3858
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:53,199
uh we're running out of room because we
 

3859
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:56,149
uh we're running out of room because we
know that 680 is that old point of

3860
01:50:56,149 --> 01:50:56,159
know that 680 is that old point of
 

3861
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,310
know that 680 is that old point of
control.

3862
01:50:58,310 --> 01:50:58,320
control.
 

3863
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:10,229
control.
Nice work, Tyson.

3864
01:51:10,229 --> 01:51:10,239

 

3865
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,149

And video just flat now. It's just

3866
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:12,159
And video just flat now. It's just
 

3867
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:35,430
And video just flat now. It's just
stopped moving at these 83s.

3868
01:51:35,430 --> 01:51:35,440

 

3869
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,390

Apple looking good. Up almost 40% on

3870
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:38,400
Apple looking good. Up almost 40% on
 

3871
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,470
Apple looking good. Up almost 40% on
those commons.

3872
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:40,480
those commons.
 

3873
01:51:40,480 --> 01:52:02,550
those commons.
Still not sold those

3874
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:02,560

 

3875
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,270

Still this one's higher.

3876
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:05,280
Still this one's higher.
 

3877
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:10,790
Still this one's higher.
Was that last auction?

3878
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:10,800

 

3879
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,310

Yeah, it was strong sell day delta at

Yeah, it was strong sell day delta at
 

3881
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,709
Yeah, it was strong sell day delta at
68. I think we can take that out. It's

3882
01:52:16,709 --> 01:52:16,719
68. I think we can take that out. It's
 

3883
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:21,030
68. I think we can take that out. It's
potential to take that out

3884
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:21,040

 

3885
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:23,030

if we can go into a trend day. Big if

3886
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
if we can go into a trend day. Big if
 

3887
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,669
if we can go into a trend day. Big if
right now. I really want to buy down

right now. I really want to buy down
 

3889
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:32,950
right now. I really want to buy down
here.

3890
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:32,960

 

3891
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,669

Nvidia looks pretty weak.

3892
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
Nvidia looks pretty weak.
 

3893
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,830
Nvidia looks pretty weak.
It's just dripping back down towards it

3894
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:37,840
It's just dripping back down towards it
 

3895
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:46,470
It's just dripping back down towards it
New York open at the moment. Slowly

3896
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:46,480

 

3897
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,070

seeing aggressive selling in Nvidia

3898
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:48,080
seeing aggressive selling in Nvidia
 

3899
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,350
seeing aggressive selling in Nvidia
here. They've got to hold these lows

3900
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360
here. They've got to hold these lows
 

3901
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,189
here. They've got to hold these lows
for Nvidia otherwise the whole market

3902
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:53,199
for Nvidia otherwise the whole market
 

3903
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:59,830
for Nvidia otherwise the whole market
will rotate with it.

3904
01:52:59,830 --> 01:52:59,840

 

3905
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:03,350

We're currently trading around the 8263s

3906
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:03,360
We're currently trading around the 8263s
 

3907
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,470
We're currently trading around the 8263s
on Nvidia. New York open was 8176es

3908
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:06,480
on Nvidia. New York open was 8176es
 

3909
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,229
on Nvidia. New York open was 8176es
under that. Remember we gapped up on

3910
01:53:08,229 --> 01:53:08,239
under that. Remember we gapped up on
 

3911
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:10,950
under that. Remember we gapped up on
Nvidia. It can close the gap all the way

3912
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:10,960
Nvidia. It can close the gap all the way
 

3913
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,750
Nvidia. It can close the gap all the way
back down to 79s. It's possible.

3914
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:15,760
back down to 79s. It's possible.
 

3915
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,270
back down to 79s. It's possible.
So, if they don't find a bid soon on

3916
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:17,280
So, if they don't find a bid soon on
 

3917
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,430
So, if they don't find a bid soon on
Nvidia and it can drag the market down

3918
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:19,440
Nvidia and it can drag the market down
 

3919
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,550
Nvidia and it can drag the market down
with it, we start seeing a rotation out

3920
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:22,560
with it, we start seeing a rotation out
 

3921
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,070
with it, we start seeing a rotation out
of chips again. Remember, we're trading

3922
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:24,080
of chips again. Remember, we're trading
 

3923
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,990
of chips again. Remember, we're trading
in supply

3924
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:26,000
in supply
 

3925
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,830
in supply
and no doubt about it on the weekly.

3926
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:29,840
and no doubt about it on the weekly.
 

3927
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,430
and no doubt about it on the weekly.
I just want to see how we operate if we

3928
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:31,440
I just want to see how we operate if we
 

3929
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,750
I just want to see how we operate if we
can get down here.

3930
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:33,760
can get down here.
 

3931
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,149
can get down here.
Does it give me something to play off or

3932
01:53:36,149 --> 01:53:36,159
Does it give me something to play off or
 

3933
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:37,589
Does it give me something to play off or
we just going to see complete weakness

3934
01:53:37,589 --> 01:53:37,599
we just going to see complete weakness
 

3935
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:41,189
we just going to see complete weakness
and a complete rotation?

3936
01:53:41,189 --> 01:53:41,199
and a complete rotation?
 

3937
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:43,270
and a complete rotation?
So, IB to be up looks like it's about to

3938
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:43,280
So, IB to be up looks like it's about to
 

3939
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:54,629
So, IB to be up looks like it's about to
play out.

3940
01:53:54,629 --> 01:53:54,639

 

3941
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,790

There's BWAP.

3942
01:53:56,790 --> 01:53:56,800
There's BWAP.
 

3943
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,109
There's BWAP.
And how do we now operate then? Are we

3944
01:53:59,109 --> 01:53:59,119
And how do we now operate then? Are we
 

3945
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:01,750
And how do we now operate then? Are we
going to slice through this level?

3946
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:01,760
going to slice through this level?
 

3947
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:04,629
going to slice through this level?
Nvidia is getting absolutely clubbed. A

3948
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
Nvidia is getting absolutely clubbed. A
 

3949
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,550
Nvidia is getting absolutely clubbed. A
little bounce off VWAP, but I'm not

3950
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:06,560
little bounce off VWAP, but I'm not
 

3951
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,149
little bounce off VWAP, but I'm not
fully convinced watching Nvidia right

3952
01:54:08,149 --> 01:54:08,159
fully convinced watching Nvidia right
 

3953
01:54:08,159 --> 01:54:09,430
fully convinced watching Nvidia right
now. And that is starting to get

3954
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:09,440
now. And that is starting to get
 

3955
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:12,149
now. And that is starting to get
absolutely diced up

3956
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:12,159
absolutely diced up
 

3957
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:13,910
absolutely diced up
into its pre-market high here. It needs

3958
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:13,920
into its pre-market high here. It needs
 

3959
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,430
into its pre-market high here. It needs
to hold a bid here in video otherwise

3960
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:15,440
to hold a bid here in video otherwise
 

3961
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:20,470
to hold a bid here in video otherwise
it's going to be in trouble.

3962
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:20,480

 

3963
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,430

I just think we're going to keep

3964
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:21,440
I just think we're going to keep
 

3965
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:26,950
I just think we're going to keep
rotating. This is just ugly

3966
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:26,960

 

3967
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,109

because now we can get stuck here and do

3968
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:29,119
because now we can get stuck here and do
 

3969
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:31,030
because now we can get stuck here and do
this and then we can lose this or we can

3970
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,040
this and then we can lose this or we can
 

3971
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,830
this and then we can lose this or we can
gain this and it's just

3972
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
gain this and it's just
 

3973
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:40,629
gain this and it's just
oh it's just not not a good market.

3974
01:54:40,629 --> 01:54:40,639

 

3975
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:42,390

Not a good market. New lows here on

3976
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:42,400
Not a good market. New lows here on
 

3977
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,390
Not a good market. New lows here on
Nvidia.

3978
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,400
Nvidia.
 

3979
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,390
Nvidia.
Oh, I'm not going to buy this. This is

3980
01:54:46,390 --> 01:54:46,400
Oh, I'm not going to buy this. This is
 

3981
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,270
Oh, I'm not going to buy this. This is
too dangerous, man. This is way too

3982
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:49,280
too dangerous, man. This is way too
 

3983
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,030
too dangerous, man. This is way too
dangerous.

3984
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:51,040
dangerous.
 

3985
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:55,910
dangerous.
Think if anything, we might sell off.

3986
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:55,920

 

3987
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,310

We might sell off here. Big selling

3988
01:54:58,310 --> 01:54:58,320
We might sell off here. Big selling
 

3989
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:17,270
We might sell off here. Big selling
coming into the book.

3990
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,280

 

3991
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,070

This is the level they need to hold. But

3992
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:20,080
This is the level they need to hold. But
 

3993
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:24,629
This is the level they need to hold. But
because they built that shelf now,

3994
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:24,639
because they built that shelf now,
 

3995
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:26,870
because they built that shelf now,
everything has to be a scalp today. At

3996
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:26,880
everything has to be a scalp today. At
 

3997
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:32,149
everything has to be a scalp today. At
this point,

3998
01:55:32,149 --> 01:55:32,159

 

3999
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:33,830

VA coming right back down to its New

4000
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:33,840
VA coming right back down to its New
 

4001
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:37,510
VA coming right back down to its New
York open at this point, folks.

4002
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:37,520
York open at this point, folks.
 

4003
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:44,470
York open at this point, folks.
And it is still selling.

4004
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,480

 

4005
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,070

I don't think this is done selling this

4006
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:46,080
I don't think this is done selling this
 

4007
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,990
I don't think this is done selling this
market. If they retest this sort of

4008
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:48,000
market. If they retest this sort of
 

4009
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,990
market. If they retest this sort of
point of control area and it stays

4010
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:50,000
point of control area and it stays
 

4011
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,709
point of control area and it stays
heavy,

4012
01:55:52,709 --> 01:55:52,719
heavy,
 

4013
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:55,830
heavy,
we can rotate further again. But uh

4014
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:55,840
we can rotate further again. But uh
 

4015
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,990
we can rotate further again. But uh
yeah, having to be adaptable in this

4016
01:55:57,990 --> 01:55:58,000
yeah, having to be adaptable in this
 

4017
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,510
yeah, having to be adaptable in this
market to what I'm thinking it might do

4018
01:55:59,510 --> 01:55:59,520
market to what I'm thinking it might do
 

4019
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,350
market to what I'm thinking it might do
because

4020
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:01,360
because
 

4021
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:03,030
because
the environment is changing very very

4022
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:03,040
the environment is changing very very
 

4023
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,950
the environment is changing very very
quickly. But I don't think they're done

4024
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:04,960
quickly. But I don't think they're done
 

4025
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:07,510
quickly. But I don't think they're done
with this. We'll see. Bulls need to

4026
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:07,520
with this. We'll see. Bulls need to
 

4027
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,109
with this. We'll see. Bulls need to
defend this gray box. Bears need to

4028
01:56:09,109 --> 01:56:09,119
defend this gray box. Bears need to
 

4029
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:10,629
defend this gray box. Bears need to
defend this gray box. just can't make a

4030
01:56:10,629 --> 01:56:10,639
defend this gray box. just can't make a
 

4031
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:12,149
defend this gray box. just can't make a
decision until it gets outside one of

4032
01:56:12,149 --> 01:56:12,159
decision until it gets outside one of
 

4033
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:26,629
decision until it gets outside one of
those

4034
01:56:26,629 --> 01:56:26,639

 

4035
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:28,229

video trying to find a bid at that New

4036
01:56:28,229 --> 01:56:28,239
video trying to find a bid at that New
 

4037
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,229
video trying to find a bid at that New
York open and pre-market high. I'm still

4038
01:56:30,229 --> 01:56:30,239
York open and pre-market high. I'm still
 

4039
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:32,229
York open and pre-market high. I'm still
unconvinced on it. It was a big sell

4040
01:56:32,229 --> 01:56:32,239
unconvinced on it. It was a big sell
 

4041
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:34,149
unconvinced on it. It was a big sell
though. So, here we go. Retesting this

4042
01:56:34,149 --> 01:56:34,159
though. So, here we go. Retesting this
 

4043
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:35,510
though. So, here we go. Retesting this
level up here. Let's see if bear is

4044
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:35,520
level up here. Let's see if bear is
 

4045
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:36,950
level up here. Let's see if bear is
coming in to defend this or not or if

4046
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:36,960
coming in to defend this or not or if
 

4047
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,229
coming in to defend this or not or if
we're actually going to make new highs

4048
01:56:38,229 --> 01:56:38,239
we're actually going to make new highs
 

4049
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,229
we're actually going to make new highs
and weekly level. I don't think we're

4050
01:56:40,229 --> 01:56:40,239
and weekly level. I don't think we're
 

4051
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:41,990
and weekly level. I don't think we're
done selling at this point. Just well,

4052
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:42,000
done selling at this point. Just well,
 

4053
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,669
done selling at this point. Just well,
just based on what I'm looking at on the

4054
01:56:43,669 --> 01:56:43,679
just based on what I'm looking at on the
 

4055
01:56:43,679 --> 01:57:05,270
just based on what I'm looking at on the
tape, I think we're going to move lower.

4056
01:57:05,270 --> 01:57:05,280

 

4057
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,430

They're trying to bid. They are

4058
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:07,440
They're trying to bid. They are
 

4059
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:10,310
They're trying to bid. They are
attempting to bid. I'm not convinced.

4060
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:10,320
attempting to bid. I'm not convinced.
 

4061
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,229
attempting to bid. I'm not convinced.
I think they're going to get slammed on.

4062
01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:12,239
I think they're going to get slammed on.
 

4063
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:15,030
I think they're going to get slammed on.
Here we go.

4064
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:15,040
Here we go.
 

4065
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:26,470
Here we go.
There we go. There's Bwap.

4066
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:26,480

 

4067
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,149

There's more pain coming here. Here we

4068
01:57:28,149 --> 01:57:28,159
There's more pain coming here. Here we
 

4069
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:34,310
There's more pain coming here. Here we
go. Here's the pain.

4070
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:34,320

 

4071
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:35,830

Back down to where we broke out from

4072
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:35,840
Back down to where we broke out from
 

4073
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:40,310
Back down to where we broke out from
this imbalance here.

4074
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:40,320

 

4075
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:43,189

I'm still not convinced they're done. I

4076
01:57:43,189 --> 01:57:43,199
I'm still not convinced they're done. I
 

4077
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:44,709
I'm still not convinced they're done. I
think there's more pain coming here,

4078
01:57:44,709 --> 01:57:44,719
think there's more pain coming here,
 

4079
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:48,070
think there's more pain coming here,
folks. I'm not convinced they're done.

4080
01:57:48,070 --> 01:57:48,080
folks. I'm not convinced they're done.
 

4081
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:52,950
folks. I'm not convinced they're done.
Big exchange down there into 80.

4082
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:52,960
Big exchange down there into 80.
 

4083

Big exchange down there into 80.
Be watching VW up in 610. 610 was the

Be watching VW up in 610. 610 was the

Be watching VW up in 610. 610 was the

4095
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:19,030
think there's more pain in this. Again,
they're not done selling this. No way.

01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,430
box. Sorry, this here where we broke out
from. If we do this here, I wouldn't

consider that bullish. I'd consider that

consider that bullish. I'd consider that
 

4173
01:59:57,679 --> 01:59:59,830
consider that bullish. I'd consider that
building liquidity to go lower. And any

building liquidity to go lower. And any
 

4175
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,750
building liquidity to go lower. And any
rejection of this now can force their

rejection of this now can force their
 

4177
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:04,390
rejection of this now can force their
hand to move lower.

4178
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:04,400

4183
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:12,950

I think you're going to see some

4184
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:12,960
I think you're going to see some
 

4185
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:17,750
I think you're going to see some
liquidation starting. Here we go.

4187
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:19,669

They're looking to test 50s and then

02:00:19,669 --> 02:00:19,679
They're looking to test 50s and then
 

4189
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,270
They're looking to test 50s and then
underneath what was that previous day

4190
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:21,280
underneath what was that previous day
 

4191
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,669
underneath what was that previous day
high? 45. Weakness can really come

4192
02:00:23,669 --> 02:00:23,679
high? 45. Weakness can really come
 

4193
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:25,430
high? 45. Weakness can really come
underneath 45. And I'm not joking. And

4194
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:25,440
underneath 45. And I'm not joking. And
 

4195
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,510
underneath 45. And I'm not joking. And
that would be a failed look above after

4196
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:27,520
that would be a failed look above after
 

4197
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:30,470
that would be a failed look above after
one retest already. Here we go. Can we

4198
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:30,480
one retest already. Here we go. Can we
 

4199
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,310
one retest already. Here we go. Can we
get to 45s? And can we sell through it

4200
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:32,320
get to 45s? And can we sell through it
 

4201
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:33,910
get to 45s? And can we sell through it
now?

4202
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:33,920
now?
 

4203
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:37,669
now?
Come on, baby.

Some covering here into 45s. I still
 

4209
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:48,390
Some covering here into 45s. I still
think we're going to sell through it. I

4210
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:48,400
think we're going to sell through it. I
 

4211
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:49,750
think we're going to sell through it. I
think New York open is not out of the

4212
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:49,760
think New York open is not out of the
 

4213

think New York open is not out of the
question here. This is very strong.

Remember this is a straight cell. All

Remember this is a straight cell. All
 

4237

Remember this is a straight cell. All
right. Once they lost this, they

right. Once they lost this, they
 

4239
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,109
right. Once they lost this, they
defended this, they lost this, this is

cover point. And we can come all the way
 

4245
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:44,070
cover point. And we can come all the way
down. Honestly, it can keep selling.

4246
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:44,080
down. Honestly, it can keep selling.
 

4247
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:47,350

They would need to reclaim this for

They would need to reclaim this for
 

4255
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:54,790
They would need to reclaim this for
bulls to have a chance. And we're not

02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:54,800
bulls to have a chance. And we're not
 

4257

bulls to have a chance. And we're not
seeing that right now. [snorts]

Still think there's more weakness in

high and the open. Here we go. Here's
 

4325

high and the open. Here we go. Here's
trying to get them. We're trying to

4326
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:46,800
trying to get them. We're trying to
 

4327
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,870
trying to get them. We're trying to
force it.

4328
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
force it.
 

4329
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:49,990
force it.
Want to be careful. There's a lot of

4330
02:03:49,990 --> 02:03:50,000
Want to be careful. There's a lot of
 

4331
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,550
Want to be careful. There's a lot of
selling at those lows. That's twice now.

4332
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:52,560
selling at those lows. That's twice now.
 

4333
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:55,270
selling at those lows. That's twice now.
We've had a lot of selling uh from 30

4334
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:55,280
We've had a lot of selling uh from 30
 

4335
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,589
We've had a lot of selling uh from 30
and under. So, if sellers don't get

4336
02:03:57,589 --> 02:03:57,599
and under. So, if sellers don't get
 

4337
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:58,950
and under. So, if sellers don't get
their way there, they will probably get

4338
02:03:58,950 --> 02:03:58,960
their way there, they will probably get
 

4339
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,910
their way there, they will probably get
a squeeze back out to 70s. They just

4340
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:01,920
a squeeze back out to 70s. They just
 

4341
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,990
a squeeze back out to 70s. They just
tried twice

4342
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,000
tried twice
 

4343
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,149
tried twice
to sell the low.

4344
02:04:06,149 --> 02:04:06,159
to sell the low.
 

4345
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:08,149
to sell the low.
They almost had it and it got saved. So,

4346
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:08,159
They almost had it and it got saved. So,
 

4347
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:10,629
They almost had it and it got saved. So,
it's definitely a passive buyer down

4348
02:04:10,629 --> 02:04:10,639
it's definitely a passive buyer down
 

4349
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:13,189
it's definitely a passive buyer down
there at 30 right now. And I'd say how

4350
02:04:13,189 --> 02:04:13,199
there at 30 right now. And I'd say how
 

4351
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:15,030
there at 30 right now. And I'd say how
we operate at 70s is what's going to be

4352
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:15,040
we operate at 70s is what's going to be
 

4353
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:20,550
we operate at 70s is what's going to be
important.

their way. If they don't get their way,
 

4405
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,629
their way. If they don't get their way,
they get caught. They're trying again

4406
02:05:54,629 --> 02:05:54,639
they get caught. They're trying again
 

4407
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:56,310

it. If he moves out the way, it's going

4412
02:05:59,669 --> 02:05:59,679
it. If he moves out the way, it's going
 

4413
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:01,109
it. If he moves out the way, it's going
to be quite a nasty flush, I would

4414
02:06:01,109 --> 02:06:01,119
to be quite a nasty flush, I would
 

4415
02:06:01,119 --> 02:06:03,350

trying to soak. He's tried again. He's
 

4429
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:23,589
trying to soak. He's tried again. He's
loading up 30. He's added more in 20.

02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:18,709
the 90s. Come on, motherucker.
Here we come.

4562
02:10:18,709 --> 02:10:18,719
Here we come.

Here we come.
Come on. Come on. [laughter]

4564
02:10:28,069 --> 02:10:28,079

 

4565
02:10:28,079 --> 02:10:35,510

15 minute boss. Suck a nut, buddy.

4566
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:35,520

 

4567
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:47,830

[\h__\h] talking [\h__\h] to me all morning.

4568
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:47,840

 

4569
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,910

Next stop, initial balance low, GlobeEx

4570
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:49,920
Next stop, initial balance low, GlobeEx
 

4571
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:51,589
Next stop, initial balance low, GlobeEx
previous day value area high. We can

4572
02:10:51,589 --> 02:10:51,599
previous day value area high. We can
 

4573
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:52,950
previous day value area high. We can
drift all the way back into that gap

4574
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:52,960
drift all the way back into that gap
 

4575
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:55,189
drift all the way back into that gap
fill is not out the question. New low of

4576
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199
fill is not out the question. New low of
 

4577
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:59,189
fill is not out the question. New low of
day on Nvidia failed to reclaim what

4578
02:10:59,189 --> 02:10:59,199
day on Nvidia failed to reclaim what
 

4579
02:10:59,199 --> 02:11:01,669
day on Nvidia failed to reclaim what
lows. The New York lows failed to

4580
02:11:01,669 --> 02:11:01,679
lows. The New York lows failed to
 

4581
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:03,350
lows. The New York lows failed to
reclaim it. Came right back into it.

4582
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:03,360
reclaim it. Came right back into it.
 

4583
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,109
reclaim it. Came right back into it.
Like I said, watch for that retest of it

4584
02:11:05,109 --> 02:11:05,119
Like I said, watch for that retest of it
 

4585
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:06,629
Like I said, watch for that retest of it
to see if they sell it. We're in a

4586
02:11:06,629 --> 02:11:06,639
to see if they sell it. We're in a
 

4587
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:09,589
to see if they sell it. We're in a
one-stop market. I've said it as long as

4588
02:11:09,589 --> 02:11:09,599
one-stop market. I've said it as long as
 

4589
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:15,589
one-stop market. I've said it as long as
I can go on about it.

4590
02:11:15,589 --> 02:11:15,599

 

4591
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:17,669

There's your initial balance low. So TP

4592
02:11:17,669 --> 02:11:17,679
There's your initial balance low. So TP
 

4593
02:11:17,679 --> 02:11:20,470
There's your initial balance low. So TP
here. The next thing to hold on to is

4594
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:20,480
here. The next thing to hold on to is
 

4595
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,629
here. The next thing to hold on to is
these uh

4596
02:11:22,629 --> 02:11:22,639
these uh
 

4597
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:38,550
these uh
D50s.

4598
02:11:38,550 --> 02:11:38,560

 

4599
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:42,550

looking good. Looking really good here.

4600
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:42,560
looking good. Looking really good here.
 

4601
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:44,310
looking good. Looking really good here.
So, just hold on to your runners now and

4602
02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:44,320
So, just hold on to your runners now and
 

4603
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,830
So, just hold on to your runners now and
you should have paid yourself a ton of

4604
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:45,840
you should have paid yourself a ton of
 

4605
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,990
you should have paid yourself a ton of
money.

4606
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:48,000
money.
 

4607
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,629
money.
And until we reclaim previous day high,

4608
02:11:50,629 --> 02:11:50,639
And until we reclaim previous day high,
 

4609
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:52,950
And until we reclaim previous day high,
we are in a failed breakout and we are

4610
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:52,960
we are in a failed breakout and we are
 

4611
02:11:52,960 --> 02:12:18,709
we are in a failed breakout and we are
trading back into old range.

4612
02:12:18,709 --> 02:12:18,719

 

4613
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:21,350

All right. It was ready. It was planned

4614
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:21,360
All right. It was ready. It was planned
 

4615
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:25,109
All right. It was ready. It was planned
for. It's very aware of this move.

4616
02:12:25,109 --> 02:12:25,119
for. It's very aware of this move.
 

4617
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:26,950
for. It's very aware of this move.
You got lured in and suckered into

4618
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:26,960
You got lured in and suckered into
 

4619
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:29,910
You got lured in and suckered into
buying high today. You ignored

4620
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:29,920
buying high today. You ignored
 

4621
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:33,030
buying high today. You ignored
all that chunky two weeks worth of

4622
02:12:33,030 --> 02:12:33,040
all that chunky two weeks worth of
 

4623
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:36,069
all that chunky two weeks worth of
supply that we traded into up here.

4624
02:12:36,069 --> 02:12:36,079
supply that we traded into up here.
 

4625
02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:37,990
supply that we traded into up here.
It had a chance to trade higher, but it

4626
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:38,000
It had a chance to trade higher, but it
 

4627
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,950
It had a chance to trade higher, but it
didn't. So, we just have to be adaptable

4628
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:40,960
didn't. So, we just have to be adaptable
 

4629
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:45,109
didn't. So, we just have to be adaptable
to the tape. Two TPT evals pass 1,000 on

4630
02:12:45,109 --> 02:12:45,119
to the tape. Two TPT evals pass 1,000 on
 

4631
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:46,550
to the tape. Two TPT evals pass 1,000 on
the funded patient pays off. Thank you,

4632
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:46,560
the funded patient pays off. Thank you,
 

4633
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:48,550
the funded patient pays off. Thank you,
Alexander. Nice work, Chris. All right,

4634
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:48,560
Alexander. Nice work, Chris. All right,
 

4635
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,390
Alexander. Nice work, Chris. All right,
GlobeEx here, folks. All right, big

4636
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:50,400
GlobeEx here, folks. All right, big
 

4637
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:52,470
GlobeEx here, folks. All right, big
GlobeEx level. This is also a VWAP from

4638
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:52,480
GlobeEx level. This is also a VWAP from
 

4639
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,629
GlobeEx level. This is also a VWAP from
yesterday down here. So, I'm expecting

4640
02:12:54,629 --> 02:12:54,639
yesterday down here. So, I'm expecting
 

4641
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:56,950
yesterday down here. So, I'm expecting
some form of reaction here. Guess what?

4642
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:56,960
some form of reaction here. Guess what?
 

4643
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,950
some form of reaction here. Guess what?
Spy, I just got alert. Spy is crossing

4644
02:12:58,950 --> 02:12:58,960
Spy, I just got alert. Spy is crossing
 

4645
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,430
Spy, I just got alert. Spy is crossing
that 680 on the spy. That is a massive

4646
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:01,440
that 680 on the spy. That is a massive
 

4647
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:03,589
that 680 on the spy. That is a massive
gamma level. So, if they hold 680 on the

4648
02:13:03,589 --> 02:13:03,599
gamma level. So, if they hold 680 on the
 

4649
02:13:03,599 --> 02:13:05,030
gamma level. So, if they hold 680 on the
spy, that this would be a big cover

4650
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:05,040
spy, that this would be a big cover
 

4651
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:07,510
spy, that this would be a big cover
point. All right, there you go. All

4652
02:13:07,510 --> 02:13:07,520
point. All right, there you go. All
 

4653
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,350
point. All right, there you go. All
right, there's your gamma level on spy.

4654
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:09,360
right, there's your gamma level on spy.
 

4655
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:11,589
right, there's your gamma level on spy.
If they hold this, we will squeeze back

4656
02:13:11,589 --> 02:13:11,599
If they hold this, we will squeeze back
 

4657
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:13,990
If they hold this, we will squeeze back
up. If we trade below this, I'm telling

4658
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:14,000
up. If we trade below this, I'm telling
 

4659
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,709
up. If we trade below this, I'm telling
you now, this is a massive lookout below

4660
02:13:16,709 --> 02:13:16,719
you now, this is a massive lookout below
 

4661
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:18,709
you now, this is a massive lookout below
scenario. All right, this is a big gamma

4662
02:13:18,709 --> 02:13:18,719
scenario. All right, this is a big gamma
 

4663
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:20,790
scenario. All right, this is a big gamma
level on spy. If they sell this off,

4664
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:20,800
level on spy. If they sell this off,
 

4665
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,390
level on spy. If they sell this off,
this market's going to get really,

4666
02:13:22,390 --> 02:13:22,400
this market's going to get really,
 

4667
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:25,669
this market's going to get really,
really, really nasty. We went over this

4668
02:13:25,669 --> 02:13:25,679
really, really nasty. We went over this
 

4669
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:27,350
really, really nasty. We went over this
right in the at the morning before the

4670
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:27,360
right in the at the morning before the
 

4671
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:28,790
right in the at the morning before the
market open. We talked about it. is how

4672
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:28,800
market open. We talked about it. is how
 

4673
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,870
market open. We talked about it. is how
I know that just got crossed because I

4674
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:30,880
I know that just got crossed because I
 

4675
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:33,990
I know that just got crossed because I
set a price alert there.

4676
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:34,000
set a price alert there.
 

4677
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:42,310
set a price alert there.
Okay.

4678
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:42,320

 

4679
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:44,870

Well, at least if you're new here, you

4680
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:44,880
Well, at least if you're new here, you
 

4681
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,229
Well, at least if you're new here, you
can see that I know what I'm talking

4682
02:13:46,229 --> 02:13:46,239
can see that I know what I'm talking
 

4683
02:13:46,239 --> 02:13:50,310
can see that I know what I'm talking
about. This is not a guesswork.

4684
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:50,320
about. This is not a guesswork.
 

4685
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:53,270
about. This is not a guesswork.
This is all planned out before we get on

4686
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:53,280
This is all planned out before we get on
 

4687
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:55,030
This is all planned out before we get on
the charts. We plan all this out before

4688
02:13:55,030 --> 02:13:55,040
the charts. We plan all this out before
 

4689
02:13:55,040 --> 02:14:05,350
the charts. We plan all this out before
we get on the charts.

4690
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:05,360

 

4691
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:08,310

Still they sell it. So Globeex's now

4692
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:08,320
Still they sell it. So Globeex's now
 

4693
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:10,950
Still they sell it. So Globeex's now
tested here. London Hide just got

4694
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:10,960
tested here. London Hide just got
 

4695
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:14,870
tested here. London Hide just got
tested.

4696
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:14,880

 

4697
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:16,950

Where's the spiders?

4698
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:16,960
Where's the spiders?
 

4699
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:18,709
Where's the spiders?
We're underneath that gamma level. If

4700
02:14:18,709 --> 02:14:18,719
We're underneath that gamma level. If
 

4701
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:20,310
We're underneath that gamma level. If
they start losing this gamma level, it

4702
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:20,320
they start losing this gamma level, it
 

4703
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:23,990
they start losing this gamma level, it
can get really, really nasty.

4704
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:24,000
can get really, really nasty.
 

4705
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,669
can get really, really nasty.
And they are under it right now. I'm

4706
02:14:25,669 --> 02:14:25,679
And they are under it right now. I'm
 

4707
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:27,189
And they are under it right now. I'm
waiting to see if we get five minute bar

4708
02:14:27,189 --> 02:14:27,199
waiting to see if we get five minute bar
 

4709
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:29,669
waiting to see if we get five minute bar
close under it. 3 minutes left in this

4710
02:14:29,669 --> 02:14:29,679
close under it. 3 minutes left in this
 

4711
02:14:29,679 --> 02:14:32,470
close under it. 3 minutes left in this
5minute bar. It's a massive massive

4712
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:32,480
5minute bar. It's a massive massive
 

4713
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:38,629
5minute bar. It's a massive massive
level for hedge funds.

4714
02:14:38,629 --> 02:14:38,639

 

4715
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:40,470

Yeah, W's in chat if you caught any of

4716
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:40,480

4724
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:53,040

Uh, [sighs]
let's move you into the daily chart so

4784
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:12,320
let's move you into the daily chart so
 

4785
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:13,830
let's move you into the daily chart so
we can go back to what I was looking at

4786
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:13,840
we can go back to what I was looking at
 

4787
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:17,109
we can go back to what I was looking at
the beginning of the day.

4788
02:16:17,109 --> 02:16:17,119
the beginning of the day.
 

4789
02:16:17,119 --> 02:16:18,709
the beginning of the day.
Okay,

4790
02:16:18,709 --> 02:16:18,719
Okay,
 

4791
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:21,189
Okay,
this is the balance range, right? Two

4792
02:16:21,189 --> 02:16:21,199
this is the balance range, right? Two
 

4793
02:16:21,199 --> 02:16:24,149
this is the balance range, right? Two
weeks, one week, two weeks. Buyers still

4794
02:16:24,149 --> 02:16:24,159
weeks, one week, two weeks. Buyers still
 

4795
02:16:24,159 --> 02:16:28,550
weeks, one week, two weeks. Buyers still
stuck above here. This

4796
02:16:28,550 --> 02:16:28,560
stuck above here. This
 

4797
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,430
stuck above here. This
right here is a failed breakout on a

4798
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:31,440
right here is a failed breakout on a
 

4799
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:33,030
right here is a failed breakout on a
daily, isn't it? Because it's come above

4800
02:16:33,030 --> 02:16:33,040
daily, isn't it? Because it's come above
 

4801
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:34,629
daily, isn't it? Because it's come above
previous day high and we're coming back

4802
02:16:34,629 --> 02:16:34,639
previous day high and we're coming back
 

4803
02:16:34,639 --> 02:16:36,870
previous day high and we're coming back
inside. So, we can see sellside

4804
02:16:36,870 --> 02:16:36,880
inside. So, we can see sellside
 

4805
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:38,230
inside. So, we can see sellside
pressure. Where can we come to? I don't

4806
02:16:38,230 --> 02:16:38,240
pressure. Where can we come to? I don't
 

4807
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:40,549
pressure. Where can we come to? I don't
know where we come to today, but if we

4808
02:16:40,549 --> 02:16:40,559
know where we come to today, but if we
 

4809
02:16:40,559 --> 02:16:42,230
know where we come to today, but if we
have trapped a lot of buyers up there

4810
02:16:42,230 --> 02:16:42,240
have trapped a lot of buyers up there
 

4811
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:44,070
have trapped a lot of buyers up there
and they want to sell this, this has

4812
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:44,080
and they want to sell this, this has
 

4813
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:46,070
and they want to sell this, this has
been one straight move up. I said, "Yes,

4814
02:16:46,070 --> 02:16:46,080
been one straight move up. I said, "Yes,
 

4815
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,870
been one straight move up. I said, "Yes,
this is a higher low on a daily, but I

4816
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:48,880
this is a higher low on a daily, but I
 

4817
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:50,469
this is a higher low on a daily, but I
wouldn't really consider it much. I want

4818
02:16:50,469 --> 02:16:50,479
wouldn't really consider it much. I want
 

4819
02:16:50,479 --> 02:16:52,230
wouldn't really consider it much. I want
to see this market drift down into these

4820
02:16:52,230 --> 02:16:52,240
to see this market drift down into these
 

4821
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:54,070
to see this market drift down into these
900s like I've talked about and see if

4822
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:54,080
900s like I've talked about and see if
 

4823
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:55,990
900s like I've talked about and see if
buyers really want to defend that. Maybe

4824
02:16:55,990 --> 02:16:56,000
buyers really want to defend that. Maybe
 

4825
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,950
buyers really want to defend that. Maybe
a 50% pullback of the range and then if

4826
02:16:58,950 --> 02:16:58,960
a 50% pullback of the range and then if
 

4827
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:00,629
a 50% pullback of the range and then if
they defend it, we're off to the races.

4828
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:00,639
they defend it, we're off to the races.
 

4829
02:17:00,639 --> 02:17:01,910
they defend it, we're off to the races.
But remember, the macro environment

4830
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:01,920
But remember, the macro environment
 

4831
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:03,910
But remember, the macro environment
right now is not looking good. All

4832
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:03,920
right now is not looking good. All
 

4833
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:05,750
right now is not looking good. All
right, talked about it numerous weeks in

4834
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:05,760
right, talked about it numerous weeks in
 

4835
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,830
right, talked about it numerous weeks in
the newsletter. It's not looking good.

4836
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:07,840
the newsletter. It's not looking good.
 

4837
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,429
the newsletter. It's not looking good.
So, if we go to that higher time frame

4838
02:17:09,429 --> 02:17:09,439
So, if we go to that higher time frame
 

4839
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:12,309
So, if we go to that higher time frame
chart in the hourly, you can see this is

4840
02:17:12,309 --> 02:17:12,319
chart in the hourly, you can see this is
 

4841
02:17:12,319 --> 02:17:14,549
chart in the hourly, you can see this is
the thick area. All right. We don't want

4842
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:14,559
the thick area. All right. We don't want
 

4843
02:17:14,559 --> 02:17:16,950
the thick area. All right. We don't want
to be a new money long into this area.

4844
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:16,960
to be a new money long into this area.
 

4845
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:19,910
to be a new money long into this area.
We want to be a new money long down here

4846
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:19,920
We want to be a new money long down here
 

4847
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:21,750
We want to be a new money long down here
for the rotation in so we can take

4848
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:21,760
for the rotation in so we can take
 

4849
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,790
for the rotation in so we can take
profit and then hold some. Not in here

4850
02:17:24,790 --> 02:17:24,800
profit and then hold some. Not in here
 

4851
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:26,230
profit and then hold some. Not in here
getting trapped with all the people

4852
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:26,240
getting trapped with all the people
 

4853
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:30,464
getting trapped with all the people
today for the rotation back down.

4854
02:17:30,464 --> 02:17:30,474
today for the rotation back down.
 

4855
02:17:30,474 --> 02:17:39,110
today for the rotation back down.
[snorts]

4856
02:17:39,110 --> 02:17:39,120

 

4857
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:43,565

Okay.

4858
02:17:43,565 --> 02:17:43,575

 

4859
02:17:43,575 --> 02:17:46,309

>> [cough]

4860
02:17:46,309 --> 02:17:46,319

 

4861
02:17:46,319 --> 02:17:47,910

>> Still not got a fiveminute close under

4862
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:47,920
>> Still not got a fiveminute close under
 

4863
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:50,230
>> Still not got a fiveminute close under
680. I'd be careful now. They they've

4864
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:50,240
680. I'd be careful now. They they've
 

4865
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:51,830
680. I'd be careful now. They they've
attempted for the last five minutes and

4866
02:17:51,830 --> 02:17:51,840
attempted for the last five minutes and
 

4867
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:53,830
attempted for the last five minutes and
they're failing. All right. So big big

4868
02:17:53,830 --> 02:17:53,840
they're failing. All right. So big big
 

4869
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:55,910
they're failing. All right. So big big
gamma level. Might get a squeeze up out

4870
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:55,920
gamma level. Might get a squeeze up out
 

4871
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:57,750
gamma level. Might get a squeeze up out
of this. It can still be sold into after

4872
02:17:57,750 --> 02:17:57,760
of this. It can still be sold into after
 

4873
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,190
of this. It can still be sold into after
a squeeze out, but you might see a

4874
02:17:59,190 --> 02:17:59,200
a squeeze out, but you might see a
 

4875
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:02,070
a squeeze out, but you might see a
squeeze out out of this because I know

squeeze out out of this because I know
 

4877
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:04,230
squeeze out out of this because I know
that is a huge huge level. All right. I

4878
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:04,240
that is a huge huge level. All right. I
 

4879

Under 680 now. They might well let this
 

4899
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:37,589
Under 680 now. They might well let this
go. If they let this go and they can't

4900
02:18:37,589 --> 02:18:37,599
go. If they let this go and they can't
 

4901
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:39,910
go. If they let this go and they can't
defend it on spiders, I dread to think

4902
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:39,920
defend it on spiders, I dread to think
 

4903
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,830
defend it on spiders, I dread to think

4996
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:00,560
worries. But if we reclaim it, I'll just
 

4997
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:11,590

Here you go. Relief we just talked about

5058
02:23:03,110 --> 02:23:03,120
Here you go. Relief we just talked about
 

5059
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,349
Here you go. Relief we just talked about
that might happen at 680. And it can

5060
02:23:05,349 --> 02:23:05,359
that might happen at 680. And it can
 

5061
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:07,270
that might happen at 680. And it can
afford to come all the way up here 40s

5062
02:23:07,270 --> 02:23:07,280
afford to come all the way up here 40s
 

5063
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:09,750
afford to come all the way up here 40s
and even up here. So let's move this up

5064
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:09,760
and even up here. So let's move this up
 

5065
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:14,710
and even up here. So let's move this up
to here.

This has been a straight dump without

02:23:22,630 --> 02:23:22,640
This has been a straight dump without
 

5073
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,389
This has been a straight dump without
retesting anything. And there are stops

5074
02:23:24,389 --> 02:23:24,399
retesting anything. And there are stops
 

5075
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:27,110
retesting anything. And there are stops
above 83s and they can afford to drift

5076
02:23:27,110 --> 02:23:27,120
above 83s and they can afford to drift
 

5077
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:29,510
above 83s and they can afford to drift
back up above these 83s and come back

5078
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:29,520
back up above these 83s and come back
 

5079
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,110
back up above these 83s and come back
into this if they really want to and

5080
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:31,120
into this if they really want to and
 

5081
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:33,110
into this if they really want to and
then see if they want to resell that.

5082
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:33,120
then see if they want to resell that.
 

5083
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,870
then see if they want to resell that.
And we're well under previous day high

5084
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:34,880
And we're well under previous day high
 

5085
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:36,550
And we're well under previous day high
now. So they can afford to back test it

5086
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:36,560
now. So they can afford to back test it
 

5087
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:41,110
now. So they can afford to back test it
if they want to. Been a big strong sell.

5088
02:23:41,110 --> 02:23:41,120
if they want to. Been a big strong sell.
 

5089

VIX closed its gap as well by the way.
 

5091
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:46,550
VIX closed its gap as well by the way.
So VIX did close its gap.

5092
02:23:46,550 --> 02:23:46,560
So VIX did close its gap.
 

5093
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:47,910
So VIX did close its gap.
We're starting to see a bit of a squeeze

5094
02:23:47,910 --> 02:23:47,920
We're starting to see a bit of a squeeze
 

5095
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:58,630
We're starting to see a bit of a squeeze
out here.

5096
02:23:58,630 --> 02:23:58,640

 

5097
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:00,070

Nice protection of what is that?

5098
02:24:00,070 --> 02:24:00,080
Nice protection of what is that?
 

5099
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:02,950
Nice protection of what is that?
Previous day value high so far. If we

5100
02:24:02,950 --> 02:24:02,960
Previous day value high so far. If we
 

5101
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:04,870
Previous day value high so far. If we
lose previous day value high. All right.

5102
02:24:04,870 --> 02:24:04,880
lose previous day value high. All right.
 

5103
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:06,870
lose previous day value high. All right.
Here's the gap. If we lose this, this is

5104
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:06,880
Here's the gap. If we lose this, this is
 

5105
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:09,270
Here's the gap. If we lose this, this is
point control from yesterday, then we

5106
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:09,280
point control from yesterday, then we
 

5107
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:11,030
point control from yesterday, then we
should rotate all the way down here. All

5108
02:24:11,030 --> 02:24:11,040
should rotate all the way down here. All
 

5109
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:12,790
should rotate all the way down here. All
right. So, if we lose this, we should

5110
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:12,800
right. So, if we lose this, we should
 

5111
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:14,469
right. So, if we lose this, we should
rotate all the way down here for later

5112
02:24:14,469 --> 02:24:14,479
rotate all the way down here for later
 

5113
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:16,630
rotate all the way down here for later
in the day when I'm not here. Should be

5114
02:24:16,630 --> 02:24:16,640
in the day when I'm not here. Should be
 

5115
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:18,389
in the day when I'm not here. Should be
aware of that. If they hold this, then

5116
02:24:18,389 --> 02:24:18,399
aware of that. If they hold this, then
 

5117
02:24:18,399 --> 02:24:19,670
aware of that. If they hold this, then
we're going to create new range above

5118
02:24:19,670 --> 02:24:19,680
we're going to create new range above
 

5119
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,510
we're going to create new range above
it.

5120
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:21,520
it.
 

5121
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,070
it.
But this level here is what's key to me.

5122
02:24:24,070 --> 02:24:24,080
But this level here is what's key to me.
 

5123
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:25,910
But this level here is what's key to me.
Just call it 550 is actually previous

5124
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:25,920
Just call it 550 is actually previous
 

5125
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:36,630
Just call it 550 is actually previous
day high. That is a key level.

5126
02:24:36,630 --> 02:24:36,640

 

5127
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:38,550

I say that New York open as well will be

5128
02:24:38,550 --> 02:24:38,560
I say that New York open as well will be
 

5129
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:57,990
I say that New York open as well will be
key.

5130
02:24:57,990 --> 02:24:58,000

 

5131
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,389

trying to get up to that New York open.

5132
02:25:02,389 --> 02:25:02,399

 

5133
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:03,590

Trying to pop these stops and get up

5134
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:03,600
Trying to pop these stops and get up
 

5135
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:04,790
Trying to pop these stops and get up
into here. And if they can get through

5136
02:25:04,790 --> 02:25:04,800
into here. And if they can get through
 

5137
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:07,190
into here. And if they can get through
that, that's not unachievable. But flow

5138
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:07,200
that, that's not unachievable. But flow
 

5139
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:10,389
that, that's not unachievable. But flow
zones all pointing down.

5140
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,399
zones all pointing down.
 

5141
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:14,389
zones all pointing down.
Here's [cough]

5145
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:37,990

Rejection of New York open so far.

Still under previous day high. So, I
 

5167
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:25,190
Still under previous day high. So, I
want to see if we can retest that sort

want to see if we can retest that sort
 

5169
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,270
want to see if we can retest that sort
of previous day high area and see if

5170

of previous day high area and see if
 

5171

sellers come back in and defend that to
 

5173
02:27:29,439 --> 02:27:35,692
sellers come back in and defend that to
confirm the failed breakout.

retest that 680 gamma level and defend

5186
02:27:49,590 --> 02:27:49,600
retest that 680 gamma level and defend
 

5187
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:51,190
retest that 680 gamma level and defend
it, then they've done it. So, we've hit

5188
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,200
it, then they've done it. So, we've hit
 

5189
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:53,349
it, then they've done it. So, we've hit
a low hanging fruits. The only thing

5190
02:27:53,349 --> 02:27:53,359
a low hanging fruits. The only thing
 

5191
02:27:53,359 --> 02:27:55,030
a low hanging fruits. The only thing
left to do was to close the gap, which

5192
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:55,040
left to do was to close the gap, which
 

5193
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:56,950
left to do was to close the gap, which
we didn't do. Did we do it on the ES?

5194
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:56,960
we didn't do. Did we do it on the ES?
 

5195
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:58,150
we didn't do. Did we do it on the ES?
Yes, we did. All right. So, we had

5196
02:27:58,150 --> 02:27:58,160
Yes, we did. All right. So, we had
 

5197
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:59,590
Yes, we did. All right. So, we had
divergence there. We closed the gap on

5198
02:27:59,590 --> 02:27:59,600
divergence there. We closed the gap on
 

5199
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:04,070
divergence there. We closed the gap on
the ES. We didn't close it on the Q's.

02:28:04,070 --> 02:28:04,080
the ES. We didn't close it on the Q's.

5501
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:41,429
One more leg up into here. This is what
I'm waiting for. Waiting to see if we

5502
02:38:41,429 --> 02:38:41,439
I'm waiting for. Waiting to see if we
 

5503
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:43,670
I'm waiting for. Waiting to see if we
can get into here. If it offers me a

5504
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:43,680
can get into here. If it offers me a
 

5505
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:47,110
can get into here. If it offers me a
trade once we get into there.

5506
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:47,120
trade once we get into there.
 

5507
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:48,469
trade once we get into there.
Feel like I'm going to run out of time

5508
02:38:48,469 --> 02:38:48,479
Feel like I'm going to run out of time
 

5509
02:38:48,479 --> 02:38:50,150
Feel like I'm going to run out of time
though because it's taking so long. It's

5510
02:38:50,150 --> 02:38:50,160
though because it's taking so long. It's
 

5511
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:51,429
though because it's taking so long. It's
going to come into here into lunch,

5512
02:38:51,429 --> 02:38:51,439
going to come into here into lunch,
 

5513
02:38:51,439 --> 02:38:54,230
going to come into here into lunch,
which is not going to be ideal.

5514
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:54,240
which is not going to be ideal.
 

5515
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:59,910
which is not going to be ideal.
Can we get uno duo and a fedo?

5516
02:38:59,910 --> 02:38:59,920
Can we get uno duo and a fedo?
 

5517
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:04,469
Can we get uno duo and a fedo?
Should be nice. We'll see.

5518
02:39:04,469 --> 02:39:04,479
Should be nice. We'll see.
 

5519
02:39:04,479 --> 02:39:05,990
Should be nice. We'll see.
I think I'm going to run out of time.

5520
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:06,000
I think I'm going to run out of time.
 

5521
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:43,270
I think I'm going to run out of time.
Trump's talking, is he?

5522
02:39:43,270 --> 02:39:43,280

 

5523
02:39:43,280 --> 02:40:10,389

China.

5524
02:40:10,389 --> 02:40:10,399

 

5525
02:40:10,399 --> 02:40:15,510

That's such skewed uh stat saying that

5526
02:40:15,510 --> 02:40:15,520
That's such skewed uh stat saying that
 

5527
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:17,510
That's such skewed uh stat saying that
it's the biggest online sales we've ever

5528
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:17,520
it's the biggest online sales we've ever
 

5529
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:19,110
it's the biggest online sales we've ever
done for a Black Friday. It's also the

5530
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:19,120
done for a Black Friday. It's also the
 

5531
02:40:19,120 --> 02:40:21,590
done for a Black Friday. It's also the
most expensive Black Friday we've ever

5532
02:40:21,590 --> 02:40:21,600
most expensive Black Friday we've ever
 

5533
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:23,830
most expensive Black Friday we've ever
had. So, are you going to include

5534
02:40:23,830 --> 02:40:23,840
had. So, are you going to include
 

5535
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:26,309
had. So, are you going to include
inflation in that or we just going to

5536
02:40:26,309 --> 02:40:26,319
inflation in that or we just going to
 

5537
02:40:26,319 --> 02:40:47,910
inflation in that or we just going to
pretend inflation doesn't exist?

5538
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:47,920

 

5539
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:49,190

I think we're going to run out of time

5540
02:40:49,190 --> 02:40:49,200
I think we're going to run out of time
 

5541
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:51,270
I think we're going to run out of time
for the next trade. If he's talking and

5542
02:40:51,270 --> 02:40:51,280
for the next trade. If he's talking and
 

5543
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:53,110
for the next trade. If he's talking and
we got lunch coming up 7 minutes,

5544
02:40:53,110 --> 02:40:53,120
we got lunch coming up 7 minutes,
 

5545
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:54,309
we got lunch coming up 7 minutes,
probably just going to sit flat here on

5546
02:40:54,309 --> 02:40:54,319
probably just going to sit flat here on
 

5547
02:40:54,319 --> 02:40:56,070
probably just going to sit flat here on
the rest

5548
02:40:56,070 --> 02:40:56,080
the rest
 

5549
02:40:56,080 --> 02:41:20,870
the rest
and just

5550
02:41:20,870 --> 02:41:20,880

 

5551
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:22,309

you're down here much more. You're going

5552
02:41:22,309 --> 02:41:22,319
you're down here much more. You're going
 

5553
02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:24,469
you're down here much more. You're going
to pull the uh current value area load

5554
02:41:24,469 --> 02:41:24,479
to pull the uh current value area load
 

5555
02:41:24,479 --> 02:41:26,550
to pull the uh current value area load
down. Spending quite a bit of time here

5556
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:26,560
down. Spending quite a bit of time here
 

5557
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:42,389
down. Spending quite a bit of time here
now.

5558
02:41:42,389 --> 02:41:42,399

 

5559
02:41:42,399 --> 02:41:43,750

I think there should be a rule with

5560
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:43,760
I think there should be a rule with
 

5561
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:46,790
I think there should be a rule with
politics for how long

5562
02:41:46,790 --> 02:41:46,800
politics for how long
 

5563
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:49,510
politics for how long
you're allowed to be in power for before

5564
02:41:49,510 --> 02:41:49,520
you're allowed to be in power for before
 

5565
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:51,270
you're allowed to be in power for before
like you have to stop talking about the

5566
02:41:51,270 --> 02:41:51,280
like you have to stop talking about the
 

5567
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:54,230
like you have to stop talking about the
previous people. It's the same in the

5568
02:41:54,230 --> 02:41:54,240
previous people. It's the same in the
 

5569
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:56,150
previous people. It's the same in the
UK. Labour's still blaming everything on

5570
02:41:56,150 --> 02:41:56,160
UK. Labour's still blaming everything on
 

5571
02:41:56,160 --> 02:41:57,750
UK. Labour's still blaming everything on
the Conservatives. He's still blaming

5572
02:41:57,750 --> 02:41:57,760
the Conservatives. He's still blaming
 

5573
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:00,230
the Conservatives. He's still blaming
everything on Biden. It's like, how long

5574
02:42:00,230 --> 02:42:00,240
everything on Biden. It's like, how long
 

5575
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:02,309
everything on Biden. It's like, how long
do you need to be in power before, you

5576
02:42:02,309 --> 02:42:02,319
do you need to be in power before, you
 

5577
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:03,830
do you need to be in power before, you
know,

5578
02:42:03,830 --> 02:42:03,840
know,
 

5579
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:05,110
know,
let's focus on what we're doing now.

5580
02:42:05,110 --> 02:42:05,120
let's focus on what we're doing now.
 

5581
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:06,389
let's focus on what we're doing now.
It's not blame the people before

5582
02:42:06,389 --> 02:42:06,399
It's not blame the people before
 

5583
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:09,910
It's not blame the people before
anymore.

5584
02:42:09,910 --> 02:42:09,920

 

5585
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:12,469

It's just the easiest uh scapegoat for

5586
02:42:12,469 --> 02:42:12,479
It's just the easiest uh scapegoat for
 

5587
02:42:12,479 --> 02:42:13,670
It's just the easiest uh scapegoat for
everything. Whether it's true or not, it

5588
02:42:13,670 --> 02:42:13,680
everything. Whether it's true or not, it
 

5589
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:17,110
everything. Whether it's true or not, it
doesn't matter. It's just nonstop.

5590
02:42:17,110 --> 02:42:17,120
doesn't matter. It's just nonstop.
 

5591
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:19,190
doesn't matter. It's just nonstop.
He's talking about car car investment in

5592
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:19,200
He's talking about car car investment in
 

5593
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:52,469
He's talking about car car investment in
the US at the moment.

5594
02:42:52,469 --> 02:42:52,479

 

5595
02:42:52,479 --> 02:42:54,550

Direct quote from Trump. I'm right about

5596
02:42:54,550 --> 02:42:54,560
Direct quote from Trump. I'm right about
 

5597
02:42:54,560 --> 02:43:02,710
Direct quote from Trump. I'm right about
everything.

5598
02:43:02,710 --> 02:43:02,720

 

5599
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:03,990

All right. So, here's a retest of this

5600
02:43:03,990 --> 02:43:04,000
All right. So, here's a retest of this
 

5601
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,030
All right. So, here's a retest of this
level. I don't think I'm going to take

5602
02:43:05,030 --> 02:43:05,040
level. I don't think I'm going to take
 

5603
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:06,790
level. I don't think I'm going to take
this just because because of time. I'm

5604
02:43:06,790 --> 02:43:06,800
this just because because of time. I'm
 

5605
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:08,950
this just because because of time. I'm
running out of time now. But here's the

5606
02:43:08,950 --> 02:43:08,960
running out of time now. But here's the
 

5607
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,630
running out of time now. But here's the
level. The second leg. This is the

5608
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:10,640
level. The second leg. This is the
 

5609
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:12,950
level. The second leg. This is the
retest. How we act here, I think becomes

5610
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:12,960
retest. How we act here, I think becomes
 

5611
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:14,309
retest. How we act here, I think becomes
really important for the remainder of

5612
02:43:14,309 --> 02:43:14,319
really important for the remainder of
 

5613
02:43:14,319 --> 02:43:16,630
really important for the remainder of
the day. If we reclaim this, you're

5614
02:43:16,630 --> 02:43:16,640
the day. If we reclaim this, you're
 

5615
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:18,150
the day. If we reclaim this, you're
going to squeeze back into all of the

5616
02:43:18,150 --> 02:43:18,160
going to squeeze back into all of the
 

5617
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:20,870
going to squeeze back into all of the
range. If you reject this up here, then

5618
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:20,880
range. If you reject this up here, then
 

5619
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:24,070
range. If you reject this up here, then
I wouldn't rule out, if not a retest of

5620
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:24,080
I wouldn't rule out, if not a retest of
 

5621
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:26,950
I wouldn't rule out, if not a retest of
the lows, well, if not a new low, a

5622
02:43:26,950 --> 02:43:26,960
the lows, well, if not a new low, a
 

5623
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:28,469
the lows, well, if not a new low, a
retest of the low at the very least is

5624
02:43:28,469 --> 02:43:28,479
retest of the low at the very least is
 

5625
02:43:28,479 --> 02:43:30,630
retest of the low at the very least is
what I'm trying to say. Wouldn't rule

5626
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:30,640
what I'm trying to say. Wouldn't rule
 

5627
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:44,389
what I'm trying to say. Wouldn't rule
that out.

5628
02:43:44,389 --> 02:43:44,399

 

5629
02:43:44,399 --> 02:43:47,349

What's that previous day high again? 46

5630
02:43:47,349 --> 02:43:47,359
What's that previous day high again? 46
 

5631
02:43:47,359 --> 02:43:49,990
What's that previous day high again? 46
46 somewhere around there. We're

5632
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:50,000
46 somewhere around there. We're
 

5633
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,590
46 somewhere around there. We're
starting to see some reaction here. Some

5634
02:43:51,590 --> 02:43:51,600
starting to see some reaction here. Some
 

5635
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:52,790
starting to see some reaction here. Some
sellers trying to come in here and

5636
02:43:52,790 --> 02:43:52,800
sellers trying to come in here and
 

5637
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:55,429
sellers trying to come in here and
defend it.

5638
02:43:55,429 --> 02:43:55,439
defend it.
 

5639
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:57,030
defend it.
So, seeing that second leg, this is what

5640
02:43:57,030 --> 02:43:57,040
So, seeing that second leg, this is what
 

5641
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:59,030
So, seeing that second leg, this is what
I talked about, a second leg up. This is

5642
02:43:59,030 --> 02:43:59,040
I talked about, a second leg up. This is
 

5643
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:01,269
I talked about, a second leg up. This is
the area of interest for me, but that's

5644
02:44:01,269 --> 02:44:01,279
the area of interest for me, but that's
 

5645
02:44:01,279 --> 02:44:04,389
the area of interest for me, but that's
just timing wise. Four minutes left. Do

5646
02:44:04,389 --> 02:44:04,399
just timing wise. Four minutes left. Do
 

5647
02:44:04,399 --> 02:44:05,830
just timing wise. Four minutes left. Do
I really want to pull the trigger with 4

5648
02:44:05,830 --> 02:44:05,840
I really want to pull the trigger with 4
 

5649
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:28,870
I really want to pull the trigger with 4
minutes left into lunch?

5650
02:44:28,870 --> 02:44:28,880

 

5651
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:36,389

Slacking off power now.

5652
02:44:36,389 --> 02:44:36,399

 

5653
02:44:36,399 --> 02:45:08,309

about pattern rates. Getting rid of pal.

5654
02:45:08,309 --> 02:45:08,319

 

5655
02:45:08,319 --> 02:45:17,990

Big battle here on the on the butt.

5656
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:18,000

500,
 

5667
02:45:26,399 --> 02:45:28,230
500,
but I'd be very very careful. This is

5668
02:45:28,230 --> 02:45:28,240
but I'd be very very careful. This is
 

5669
02:45:28,240 --> 02:45:29,670
but I'd be very very careful. This is
the area where I'd be thinking about

02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:29,680
the area where I'd be thinking about
 

5671
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:31,429
the area where I'd be thinking about
getting short. So, I'd be very careful.

Those of you who are long off the

Those of you who are long off the

02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,790
Those of you who are long off the
rotation, you better have sold a big

5676
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:34,800
rotation, you better have sold a big
 

5677
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:43,750
rotation, you better have sold a big
chunk of your position.

5678
02:45:43,750 --> 02:45:43,760

Wow.
 

5695
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:23,110
Wow.
They're testing the edge of this range

5696
02:46:23,110 --> 02:46:23,120
They're testing the edge of this range
 

5697
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:27,429
They're testing the edge of this range
now, folks.

5698
02:46:27,429 --> 02:46:27,439

 

5699
02:46:27,439 --> 02:46:29,110

Seeing weak bit of weakness coming here.

5700
02:46:29,110 --> 02:46:29,120
Seeing weak bit of weakness coming here.
 

5701
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:30,230
Seeing weak bit of weakness coming here.
This is the edge of this range. If they

5702
02:46:30,230 --> 02:46:30,240
This is the edge of this range. If they
 

5703
02:46:30,240 --> 02:46:31,590
This is the edge of this range. If they
let go of this, they might trade to the

5704
02:46:31,590 --> 02:46:31,600
let go of this, they might trade to the
 

5705
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:33,349
let go of this, they might trade to the
other side of this range, sort of the

5706
02:46:33,349 --> 02:46:33,359
other side of this range, sort of the
 

5707
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:35,190
other side of this range, sort of the
90s. If they lose the 90s, you would not

5708
02:46:35,190 --> 02:46:35,200
90s. If they lose the 90s, you would not
 

5709
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:37,110
90s. If they lose the 90s, you would not
rule out a new lower day. I'm being

5710
02:46:37,110 --> 02:46:37,120
rule out a new lower day. I'm being
 

5711
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:39,830
rule out a new lower day. I'm being
deadly serious. If you lose the 90s, do

5712
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:39,840
deadly serious. If you lose the 90s, do
 

5713
02:46:39,840 --> 02:47:08,710
deadly serious. If you lose the 90s, do
not rule out a new lower day.

5714
02:47:08,710 --> 02:47:08,720

 

5715

Retested this. I think it's very, very

Retested this. I think it's very, very
 

5723
02:47:16,399 --> 02:47:18,790
Retested this. I think it's very, very
probable. We talked about this gray area

5724
02:47:18,790 --> 02:47:18,800
probable. We talked about this gray area
 

5725
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:20,550
probable. We talked about this gray area
here being the area where bears will

5726
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:20,560
here being the area where bears will
 

5727
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:36,230
here being the area where bears will
want to defend, didn't we?

5728
02:47:36,230 --> 02:47:36,240

 

5729

5733
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:55,429

They're trying to lift it. This is

5734
02:47:55,429 --> 02:47:55,439
They're trying to lift it. This is
 

5735
02:47:55,439 --> 02:48:07,590
They're trying to lift it. This is
interesting battle.

This is what you call a range rotating

5786
02:49:34,309 --> 02:49:34,319
This is what you call a range rotating
 

5787
02:49:34,319 --> 02:49:35,990
This is what you call a range rotating

There's your breakout.

02:49:38,399 --> 02:49:40,309
There's your breakout.
There's your trap. There's a straight

02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:40,319
There's your trap. There's a straight
 

5793
02:49:40,319 --> 02:49:42,150
There's your trap. There's a straight
reclaim. That's ugly. There's your

02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:42,160
reclaim. That's ugly. There's your
 

5795
02:49:42,160 --> 02:49:44,070
reclaim. That's ugly. There's your
failed move higher. And there's your

5796
02:49:44,070 --> 02:49:44,080
failed move higher. And there's your
 

5797
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:45,670
failed move higher. And there's your
straight puke. And now we're coming back

5798
02:49:45,670 --> 02:49:45,680
straight puke. And now we're coming back
 

5799
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:47,190
straight puke. And now we're coming back
to test. This is your pivot. This is

5800
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:47,200
to test. This is your pivot. This is
 

5801
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:49,030
to test. This is your pivot. This is
your your overunder for the day. Above

5802
02:49:49,030 --> 02:49:49,040
your your overunder for the day. Above
 

5803
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:51,349
your your overunder for the day. Above
this, bulls maybe can form some form of

5804
02:49:51,349 --> 02:49:51,359
this, bulls maybe can form some form of
 

5805
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:53,830
this, bulls maybe can form some form of
rotation. Below this, bears can try and

5806
02:49:53,830 --> 02:49:53,840
rotation. Below this, bears can try and
 

5807
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:57,110
rotation. Below this, bears can try and
test that down here. But edge is gone.

5808
02:49:57,110 --> 02:49:57,120
test that down here. But edge is gone.
 

5809
02:49:57,120 --> 02:49:58,870
test that down here. But edge is gone.
Like

5810
02:49:58,870 --> 02:49:58,880
Like
 

5811
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:00,150
Like
the edge is gone. And I wouldn't be

5812
02:50:00,150 --> 02:50:00,160
the edge is gone. And I wouldn't be
 

5813
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:01,670
the edge is gone. And I wouldn't be
surprised to see this just taper off

5814
02:50:01,670 --> 02:50:01,680
surprised to see this just taper off
 

5815
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:03,269
surprised to see this just taper off
again. The market doesn't it doesn't

5816
02:50:03,269 --> 02:50:03,279
again. The market doesn't it doesn't
 

5817
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:05,030
again. The market doesn't it doesn't
really know what it wants to do. That's

5818
02:50:05,030 --> 02:50:05,040
really know what it wants to do. That's
 

5819
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:07,190
really know what it wants to do. That's
what you've got to understand. Like do

5820
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:07,200
what you've got to understand. Like do
 

5821
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:10,230
what you've got to understand. Like do
you really want to be a new money long?

5822
02:50:10,230 --> 02:50:10,240
you really want to be a new money long?
 

5823
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:13,110
you really want to be a new money long?
Just think about institutions.

5824
02:50:13,110 --> 02:50:13,120
Just think about institutions.
 

5825
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:15,750
Just think about institutions.
Do you want to be a new money long when

5826
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:15,760
Do you want to be a new money long when
 

5827
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:18,630
Do you want to be a new money long when
all we've done is do that after that?

5828
02:50:18,630 --> 02:50:18,640
all we've done is do that after that?
 

5829
02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:20,630
all we've done is do that after that?
No.

5830
02:50:20,630 --> 02:50:20,640
No.
 

5831
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:22,870
No.
That is your new money long trigger. A

5832
02:50:22,870 --> 02:50:22,880
That is your new money long trigger. A
 

5833
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:25,429
That is your new money long trigger. A
hold down here. And that is the problem

5834
02:50:25,429 --> 02:50:25,439
hold down here. And that is the problem
 

5835
02:50:25,439 --> 02:50:27,349
hold down here. And that is the problem
that you're going to continue to see in

5836
02:50:27,349 --> 02:50:27,359
that you're going to continue to see in
 

5837
02:50:27,359 --> 02:50:29,030
that you're going to continue to see in
this market until they offer the

5838
02:50:29,030 --> 02:50:29,040
this market until they offer the
 

5839
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:31,750
this market until they offer the
pullback and we come to a decent level

5840
02:50:31,750 --> 02:50:31,760
pullback and we come to a decent level
 

5841
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:34,550
pullback and we come to a decent level
and we see big money and big inflow come

5842
02:50:34,550 --> 02:50:34,560
and we see big money and big inflow come
 

5843
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:36,790
and we see big money and big inflow come
in here. Then this is just going to keep

5844
02:50:36,790 --> 02:50:36,800
in here. Then this is just going to keep
 

5845
02:50:36,800 --> 02:50:38,469
in here. Then this is just going to keep
doing the same thing. Fail breakout,

5846
02:50:38,469 --> 02:50:38,479
doing the same thing. Fail breakout,
 

5847
02:50:38,479 --> 02:50:40,150
doing the same thing. Fail breakout,
failed breakout, fail breakout, failed

5848
02:50:40,150 --> 02:50:40,160
failed breakout, fail breakout, failed
 

5849
02:50:40,160 --> 02:50:41,269
failed breakout, fail breakout, failed
break. It's just going to keep doing the

5850
02:50:41,269 --> 02:50:41,279
break. It's just going to keep doing the
 

5851
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:42,710
break. It's just going to keep doing the
same thing. Rotation, rotation,

5852
02:50:42,710 --> 02:50:42,720
same thing. Rotation, rotation,
 

5853
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:44,469
same thing. Rotation, rotation,
rotation, rotation. And it's unfortunate

5854
02:50:44,469 --> 02:50:44,479
rotation, rotation. And it's unfortunate
 

5855
02:50:44,479 --> 02:50:46,550
rotation, rotation. And it's unfortunate
and it's very very common for December

5856
02:50:46,550 --> 02:50:46,560
and it's very very common for December
 

5857
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:49,110
and it's very very common for December
to see that. So, I'd be very very

5858
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:49,120
to see that. So, I'd be very very
 

5859
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:52,309
to see that. So, I'd be very very
cautious being too biased in this market

5860
02:50:52,309 --> 02:50:52,319
cautious being too biased in this market
 

5861
02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:55,269
cautious being too biased in this market
until you see some form of higher time

5862
02:50:55,269 --> 02:50:55,279
until you see some form of higher time
 

5863
02:50:55,279 --> 02:50:58,150
until you see some form of higher time
frame uh alignment. And what I mean by

5864
02:50:58,150 --> 02:50:58,160
frame uh alignment. And what I mean by
 

5865
02:50:58,160 --> 02:51:00,870
frame uh alignment. And what I mean by
that is a daily pullback which holds and

5866
02:51:00,870 --> 02:51:00,880
that is a daily pullback which holds and
 

5867
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:03,269
that is a daily pullback which holds and
an hourly pullback which confirms a long

5868
02:51:03,269 --> 02:51:03,279
an hourly pullback which confirms a long
 

5869
02:51:03,279 --> 02:51:05,510
an hourly pullback which confirms a long
or vice versa. Until you see that, I'd

5870
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:05,520
or vice versa. Until you see that, I'd
 

5871
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:09,030
or vice versa. Until you see that, I'd
be very very very cautious about getting

5872
02:51:09,030 --> 02:51:09,040
be very very very cautious about getting
 

5873
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:11,110
be very very very cautious about getting
overly bullish or overly bearish in the

5874
02:51:11,110 --> 02:51:11,120
overly bullish or overly bearish in the
 

5875
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:12,630
overly bullish or overly bearish in the
market. It will build liquidity until

5876
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:12,640
market. It will build liquidity until
 

5877
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:17,269
market. It will build liquidity until
it's finished. [snorts]

5878

5879
02:51:17,279 --> 02:51:19,670

5897
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:36,389
a look at some key levels and I'll set
some price alerts. I'll leave that price

5898
02:51:36,389 --> 02:51:36,399
some price alerts. I'll leave that price
 

5899
02:51:36,399 --> 02:51:38,469
some price alerts. I'll leave that price
alert on 680. That's going to continue

5900
02:51:38,469 --> 02:51:38,479
alert on 680. That's going to continue
 

5901
02:51:38,479 --> 02:51:40,309
alert on 680. That's going to continue
to be key. We're well above that now.

5902
02:51:40,309 --> 02:51:40,319
to be key. We're well above that now.
 

5903
02:51:40,319 --> 02:51:43,030
to be key. We're well above that now.
681 on the spiders. So that gamma level,

another sale for a little bit. Only

another sale for a little bit. Only
 

5917

02:51:55,670 --> 02:51:55,680
reason being they've extended this
 

5919
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:57,269
reason being they've extended this
twice. Okay, they've already twice

5920
02:51:57,269 --> 02:51:57,279
twice. Okay, they've already twice
 

5921
02:51:57,279 --> 02:52:02,200
twice. Okay, they've already twice
extended it. Take care.
