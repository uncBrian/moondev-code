you caught some of those overnight
longs. What a beautiful move for

12
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
longs. What a beautiful move for
 

13
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,430
longs. What a beautiful move for
continuation, right? Once we reclaimed

14
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
continuation, right? Once we reclaimed
 

15
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,589
continuation, right? Once we reclaimed
that nine sort of 20 level that we

16
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
that nine sort of 20 level that we
 

17
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,430
that nine sort of 20 level that we
talked about yesterday, old uh naked

18
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
talked about yesterday, old uh naked
 

19
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,189
talked about yesterday, old uh naked
point of control, we're now basing over

20
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
point of control, we're now basing over
 

21
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,469
point of control, we're now basing over
it and you can see where we're

22
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
it and you can see where we're
 

23
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,830
it and you can see where we're
attacking. All right, so we're going to

24
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
attacking. All right, so we're going to
 

25
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,909
attacking. All right, so we're going to
go over all the charts now all the way

26
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
go over all the charts now all the way
 

27
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,350
go over all the charts now all the way
top down analysis

28
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
top down analysis
 

29
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,029
top down analysis
and then I'll trade with you live into

00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
the daily,
 

35
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,950
the daily,
what do we have? Well, yesterday

36
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
what do we have? Well, yesterday
 

37
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,710
what do we have? Well, yesterday
gap down, opened up, drove higher,

gap down, opened up, drove higher,
 

39
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,710
gap down, opened up, drove higher,
closed near the highs. We expect what

40
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
closed near the highs. We expect what
 

41
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,629
closed near the highs. We expect what
continuation? What are the targets? You

42
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
continuation? What are the targets? You
 

43
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,029
continuation? What are the targets? You
can see all the stops here dating right

44
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
can see all the stops here dating right
 

45
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,350
can see all the stops here dating right
back to the 5th of November. Right back

46
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
back to the 5th of November. Right back
 

47
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,909
back to the 5th of November. Right back
here, we have a gap fill in here. All

48
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
here, we have a gap fill in here. All
 

49
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,670
here, we have a gap fill in here. All
right, especially on the ETF. So, I'll

50
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
right, especially on the ETF. So, I'll
 

51
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,749
right, especially on the ETF. So, I'll
go over it on QQQ. There is a gap fill

52
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
go over it on QQQ. There is a gap fill
 

53
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,510
go over it on QQQ. There is a gap fill
there that it might be looking to do to

54
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
there that it might be looking to do to
 

55
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,430
there that it might be looking to do to
be an efficient market. It doesn't need

56
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
be an efficient market. It doesn't need
 

57
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,550
be an efficient market. It doesn't need
to do it today, but it might be

58
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
to do it today, but it might be
 

59
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,230
to do it today, but it might be
something it wants to do. So, we have

60
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
something it wants to do. So, we have
 

61
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,430
something it wants to do. So, we have
all these stops. One, two, three, four,

62
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
all these stops. One, two, three, four,
 

63
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,430
all these stops. One, two, three, four,
five, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Even

64
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
five, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Even
 

65
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,270
five, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Even
this guy here has now been taken out 14.

66
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
this guy here has now been taken out 14.
 

67
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,629
this guy here has now been taken out 14.
All these stops here, these are daily

68
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
All these stops here, these are daily
 

69
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,950
All these stops here, these are daily
stops. All right, lots and lots and lots

70
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
stops. All right, lots and lots and lots
 

71
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,790
stops. All right, lots and lots and lots
of stops. Every time we come up here,

72
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
of stops. Every time we come up here,
 

73
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,629
of stops. Every time we come up here,
we've rejected. We've come up, we

74
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
we've rejected. We've come up, we
 

75
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,469
we've rejected. We've come up, we
rejected. We've come up, we've rejected.

76
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
rejected. We've come up, we've rejected.
 

77
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,550
rejected. We've come up, we've rejected.
But this is one, two, three. This is

78
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
But this is one, two, three. This is
 

79
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,350
But this is one, two, three. This is
time number four. All right, so imagine

80
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
time number four. All right, so imagine
 

81
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,150
time number four. All right, so imagine
if there are passive sellers, all right,

82
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
if there are passive sellers, all right,
 

83
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,150
if there are passive sellers, all right,
sat here unloading. How much more

84
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
sat here unloading. How much more
 

85
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,909
sat here unloading. How much more
inventory have they got to unload? I

86
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
inventory have they got to unload? I
 

87
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,430
inventory have they got to unload? I
would guess not very much. All right.

88
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
would guess not very much. All right.
 

89
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,790
would guess not very much. All right.
They've had three months, right, from

90
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
They've had three months, right, from
 

91
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,350
They've had three months, right, from
November 5th, November, December,

92
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
November 5th, November, December,
 

93
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,830
November 5th, November, December,
January coming up to so December,

94
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
January coming up to so December,
 

95
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,670
January coming up to so December,
January coming up into Feb. Three months

96
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
January coming up into Feb. Three months
 

97
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,310
January coming up into Feb. Three months
of unloading inventory there. It doesn't

98
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
of unloading inventory there. It doesn't
 

99
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,750
of unloading inventory there. It doesn't
mean it has to break through today, but

100
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
mean it has to break through today, but
 

101
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,509
mean it has to break through today, but
I would say it's a very, very good

102
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
I would say it's a very, very good
 

103
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,029
I would say it's a very, very good
chance at some point we're going to get

104
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
chance at some point we're going to get
 

105
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,790
chance at some point we're going to get
some form of breakout. Whether that

106
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
some form of breakout. Whether that
 

107
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,630
some form of breakout. Whether that
sustains or not is another thing. All

108
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
sustains or not is another thing. All
 

109
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,230
sustains or not is another thing. All
right. So, what we're looking for today,

110
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
right. So, what we're looking for today,
 

111
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,750
right. So, what we're looking for today,
we have this top Ballinger band. You can

112
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
we have this top Ballinger band. You can
 

113
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,829
we have this top Ballinger band. You can
see starting to point upside. Look at

114
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
see starting to point upside. Look at
 

115
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,829
see starting to point upside. Look at
the 5day turning around, starting to

116
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
the 5day turning around, starting to
 

117
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,990
the 5day turning around, starting to
come up through the 20-day. and we might

118
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
come up through the 20-day. and we might
 

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,710
come up through the 20-day. and we might
get one of these channels if we can

120
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
get one of these channels if we can
 

121
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,630
get one of these channels if we can
sustain a break and hold here and then

122
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
sustain a break and hold here and then
 

123
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,750
sustain a break and hold here and then
we can start to do this move for Q1. All

124
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
we can start to do this move for Q1. All
 

125
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,430
we can start to do this move for Q1. All
right, it's not what anyone expected,

126
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
right, it's not what anyone expected,
 

127
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,509
right, it's not what anyone expected,
but it's very much looks like how we're

128
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
but it's very much looks like how we're
 

129
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,190
but it's very much looks like how we're
setting up. The only other thing on the

130
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
setting up. The only other thing on the
 

131
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,430
setting up. The only other thing on the
daily we could potentially will look for

132
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
daily we could potentially will look for
 

133
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,990
daily we could potentially will look for
is a fail break, a gap fill, and then

134
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
is a fail break, a gap fill, and then
 

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,630
is a fail break, a gap fill, and then
this to be the false break and this move

136
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
this to be the false break and this move
 

137
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,389
this to be the false break and this move
here for the rest of Q1 and beyond. So,

138
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
here for the rest of Q1 and beyond. So,
 

139
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,910
here for the rest of Q1 and beyond. So,
lots to play for. This week will be

140
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
lots to play for. This week will be
 

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,590
lots to play for. This week will be
telling as we get into especially from

142
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
telling as we get into especially from
 

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,550
telling as we get into especially from
tomorrow onwards. All right, FOMC 97%

144
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
tomorrow onwards. All right, FOMC 97%
 

145
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,710
tomorrow onwards. All right, FOMC 97%
chance of no rate cut, but what's more

146
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
chance of no rate cut, but what's more
 

147
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,630
chance of no rate cut, but what's more
important is actually the MAG and what

148
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
important is actually the MAG and what
 

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,030
important is actually the MAG and what
happens afterwards. All right, let's go

150
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
happens afterwards. All right, let's go
 

151
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,550
happens afterwards. All right, let's go
down into the hourlys. We can look at

152
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
down into the hourlys. We can look at
 

153
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,829
down into the hourlys. We can look at
the profiles that are starting to

154
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
the profiles that are starting to
 

155
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,389
the profiles that are starting to
develop here. All right, so those of you

156
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
develop here. All right, so those of you
 

157
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,470
develop here. All right, so those of you
traded me with me yesterday will know we

158
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
traded me with me yesterday will know we
 

159
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,470
traded me with me yesterday will know we
were taking these longs. All right, we

160
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
were taking these longs. All right, we
 

161
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,070
were taking these longs. All right, we
were long yesterday for the push towards

162
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
were long yesterday for the push towards
 

163
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,389
were long yesterday for the push towards
this old naked point of control up into

164
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
this old naked point of control up into
 

165
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,030
this old naked point of control up into
here. I think it was 890s. That was it.

166
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
here. I think it was 890s. That was it.
 

167
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,829
here. I think it was 890s. That was it.
Was it 920s? It was 890s. All right. So,

168
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
Was it 920s? It was 890s. All right. So,
 

169
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,350
Was it 920s? It was 890s. All right. So,
our long yesterday was from here up into

170
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
our long yesterday was from here up into
 

171
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,910
our long yesterday was from here up into
this move into this guy here. We

172
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
this move into this guy here. We
 

173
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,829
this move into this guy here. We
completed that and then we were risk

174
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
completed that and then we were risk
 

175
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,470
completed that and then we were risk
off. And what you've had is a pullback

176
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
off. And what you've had is a pullback
 

177
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,590
off. And what you've had is a pullback
overnight, right? If we think about

178
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
overnight, right? If we think about
 

179
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,150
overnight, right? If we think about
previous week's value area high, this

180
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
previous week's value area high, this
 

181
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,230
previous week's value area high, this
guy right here, pullbacks overnight.

182
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
guy right here, pullbacks overnight.
 

183
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,790
guy right here, pullbacks overnight.
Surprise, surprise. Held previous week's

184
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
Surprise, surprise. Held previous week's
 

185
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,870
Surprise, surprise. Held previous week's
value area high. That was also previous

186
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
value area high. That was also previous
 

187
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,310
value area high. That was also previous
days value area high. So, you've got

188
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
days value area high. So, you've got
 

189
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,630
days value area high. So, you've got
confluence there. So if you were playing

190
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
confluence there. So if you were playing
 

191
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,389
confluence there. So if you were playing
in the uh Asian market, well there's

192
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
in the uh Asian market, well there's
 

193
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,310
in the uh Asian market, well there's
your long trigger and there's the

194
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
your long trigger and there's the
 

195
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,069
your long trigger and there's the
expansion. All right, you've taken out

196
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
expansion. All right, you've taken out
 

197
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,150
expansion. All right, you've taken out
all the key levels. Now we're start now

198
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
all the key levels. Now we're start now
 

199
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,310
all the key levels. Now we're start now
su successfully basing above that 890,

200
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
su successfully basing above that 890,
 

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,670
su successfully basing above that 890,
aren't we? All right, so we pulled under

202
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
aren't we? All right, so we pulled under
 

203
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,430
aren't we? All right, so we pulled under
it. We've got back above it and we're

204
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
it. We've got back above it and we're
 

205
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,790
it. We've got back above it and we're
starting to drive higher and we're

206
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
starting to drive higher and we're
 

207
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,949
starting to drive higher and we're
coming into supply here. So we don't

208
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
coming into supply here. So we don't
 

209
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,190
coming into supply here. So we don't
really want to be long here at the

210
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
really want to be long here at the
 

211
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,949
really want to be long here at the
highs. Unfortunately, what we've got

212
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
highs. Unfortunately, what we've got
 

213
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,190
highs. Unfortunately, what we've got
here setting up in the market is anyone

214
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
here setting up in the market is anyone
 

215
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,430
here setting up in the market is anyone
who was swing long, right? Anyone who

216
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
who was swing long, right? Anyone who
 

217
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,590
who was swing long, right? Anyone who
swing long from down here or even here

218
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
swing long from down here or even here
 

219
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,910
swing long from down here or even here
or even entered with us yesterday here.

220
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
or even entered with us yesterday here.
 

221
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,230
or even entered with us yesterday here.
All right, they have both things on

222
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
All right, they have both things on
 

223
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,230
All right, they have both things on
their side. Remember, they have location

224
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
their side. Remember, they have location
 

225
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,389
their side. Remember, they have location
and momentum. All right, we always talk

226
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
and momentum. All right, we always talk
 

227
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,389
and momentum. All right, we always talk
about that. Prime location, discount

228
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
about that. Prime location, discount
 

229
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,190
about that. Prime location, discount
location, great momentum. If we're long

230
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
location, great momentum. If we're long
 

231
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,710
location, great momentum. If we're long
today up here, unfortunately, we have no

232
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
today up here, unfortunately, we have no
 

233
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,190
today up here, unfortunately, we have no
location, but we have great momentum.

234
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
location, but we have great momentum.
 

235
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,550
location, but we have great momentum.
All right, so we don't have both these

236
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
All right, so we don't have both these
 

237
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,110
All right, so we don't have both these
things. So, we need to wait really for

238
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
things. So, we need to wait really for
 

239
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,710
things. So, we need to wait really for
some setups to come in. Now what that

240
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
some setups to come in. Now what that
 

241
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,190
some setups to come in. Now what that
will those be? Ideally it will be a back

242
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
will those be? Ideally it will be a back
 

243
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,790
will those be? Ideally it will be a back
test of some of these key levels. All

244
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
test of some of these key levels. All
 

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,069
test of some of these key levels. All
right so anything into here where we can

246
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
right so anything into here where we can
 

247
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,069
right so anything into here where we can
see some buyers stepping up some form of

248
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
see some buyers stepping up some form of
 

249
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,069
see some buyers stepping up some form of
absorption. This by the way is current

250
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
absorption. This by the way is current
 

251
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,230
absorption. This by the way is current
developing week profile. So you can see

252
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
developing week profile. So you can see
 

253
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,030
developing week profile. So you can see
we get thick in here from sort of 9:15

254
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
we get thick in here from sort of 9:15
 

255
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,550
we get thick in here from sort of 9:15
down to 865. Right? Anywhere in here

256
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
down to 865. Right? Anywhere in here
 

257
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,630
down to 865. Right? Anywhere in here
where we see buying absorption taking

258
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
where we see buying absorption taking
 

259
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,470
where we see buying absorption taking
place, sellers getting stuck, we can

260
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
place, sellers getting stuck, we can
 

261
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,150
place, sellers getting stuck, we can
look for this continuation higher as

262
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
look for this continuation higher as
 

263
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,590
look for this continuation higher as
long as it hasn't taken out all the

264
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
long as it hasn't taken out all the
 

265
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,230
long as it hasn't taken out all the
stops. If we fail in here, all right,

266
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
stops. If we fail in here, all right,
 

267
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,069
stops. If we fail in here, all right,
the next spot is these previous day

268
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
the next spot is these previous day
 

269
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,829
the next spot is these previous day
value area lows, previous week value,

270
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
value area lows, previous week value,
 

271
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,310
value area lows, previous week value,
area highs. All right, same kind of

272
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
area highs. All right, same kind of
 

273
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,310
area highs. All right, same kind of
thing. Looking for this. If we give this

274
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
thing. Looking for this. If we give this
 

275
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,069
thing. Looking for this. If we give this
whole thing back under here, you want to

276
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
whole thing back under here, you want to
 

277
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,910
whole thing back under here, you want to
be very careful. All right, if we do not

278
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
be very careful. All right, if we do not
 

279
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,630
be very careful. All right, if we do not
see absorption here, we can rotate all

280
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:52,640
see absorption here, we can rotate all
 

281
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,829
see absorption here, we can rotate all
the way back down. This can still be a

282
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
the way back down. This can still be a
 

283
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,389
the way back down. This can still be a
breakout retest, which can still be

284
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
breakout retest, which can still be
 

285
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,069
breakout retest, which can still be
absorbed. So, these are the areas I'm

286
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
absorbed. So, these are the areas I'm
 

287
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,470
absorbed. So, these are the areas I'm
interested in looking long in here,

288
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
interested in looking long in here,
 

289
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,310
interested in looking long in here,
potentially in here, but more likely on

290
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
potentially in here, but more likely on
 

291
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,310
potentially in here, but more likely on
a reclaim here. So this level here is

292
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
a reclaim here. So this level here is
 

293
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,030
a reclaim here. So this level here is
big for me. These sort of 920s and then

294
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
big for me. These sort of 920s and then
 

295
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,829
big for me. These sort of 920s and then
down here underneath that I become far

296
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
down here underneath that I become far
 

297
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,590
down here underneath that I become far
less interested in the bullish play. All

298
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
less interested in the bullish play. All
 

299
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,350
less interested in the bullish play. All
right. When will I be really

300
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
right. When will I be really
 

301
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,670
right. When will I be really
uninterested in the bullish play? If

302
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
uninterested in the bullish play? If
 

303
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,629
uninterested in the bullish play? If
right if we go and pop all these stops

304
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
right if we go and pop all these stops
 

305
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,910
right if we go and pop all these stops
if we I'm going to have to zoom this

306
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
if we I'm going to have to zoom this
 

307
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,389
if we I'm going to have to zoom this
back. This block up here. If we go and

308
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
back. This block up here. If we go and
 

309
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,150
back. This block up here. If we go and
pop all these and it hasn't given me an

310
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
pop all these and it hasn't given me an
 

311
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,230
pop all these and it hasn't given me an
entry right there's only something I can

312
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
entry right there's only something I can
 

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,550
entry right there's only something I can
wait for is a retest build out to go

314
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
wait for is a retest build out to go
 

315
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,870
wait for is a retest build out to go
higher. If we don't see that, if we see

316
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
higher. If we don't see that, if we see
 

317
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,190
higher. If we don't see that, if we see
this move, then I become far less

318
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
this move, then I become far less
 

319
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,470
this move, then I become far less
interested in it because it means we've

320
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
interested in it because it means we've
 

321
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,389
interested in it because it means we've
had a failed breakout and then a

322
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
had a failed breakout and then a
 

323
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,470
had a failed breakout and then a
rotation is probable again. All right,

324
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
rotation is probable again. All right,
 

325
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,550
rotation is probable again. All right,
so have to be aware of that. It's all

326
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
so have to be aware of that. It's all
 

327
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,389
so have to be aware of that. It's all
depend what do we take, when do we take

328
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
depend what do we take, when do we take
 

329
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,110
depend what do we take, when do we take
it, what's available. All right, moving

330
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
it, what's available. All right, moving
 

331
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,030
it, what's available. All right, moving
up into the five minute. You can see

332
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
up into the five minute. You can see
 

333
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,269
up into the five minute. You can see
this is the move we just talked about

334
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
this is the move we just talked about
 

335
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,430
this is the move we just talked about
the Asia move. There's your double

336
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
the Asia move. There's your double
 

337
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,509
the Asia move. There's your double
bottom, the reclaim and the drive.

338
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
bottom, the reclaim and the drive.
 

339
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,750
bottom, the reclaim and the drive.
London sideways. So we're waiting now.

340
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
London sideways. So we're waiting now.
 

341
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,509
London sideways. So we're waiting now.
Can we get a retest here? Do we see a

342
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
Can we get a retest here? Do we see a
 

343
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,310
Can we get a retest here? Do we see a
break and retest to buy? Um, I do want

344
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
break and retest to buy? Um, I do want
 

345
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,750
break and retest to buy? Um, I do want
to go through the ETFs and the cues

346
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
to go through the ETFs and the cues
 

347
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,190
to go through the ETFs and the cues
because they're going to be important

348
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
because they're going to be important
 

349
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,030
because they're going to be important
today.

350
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
today.
 

351
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,069
today.
Right. So, let's just take you on to the

352
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
Right. So, let's just take you on to the
 

353
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,670
Right. So, let's just take you on to the
cues up here.

354
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
cues up here.
 

355
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,430
cues up here.
Okay. One thing I want to be aware of is

356
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
Okay. One thing I want to be aware of is
 

357
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,949
Okay. One thing I want to be aware of is
this up here. All right. 632 is a gap

358
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
this up here. All right. 632 is a gap
 

359
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,509
this up here. All right. 632 is a gap
fill. Uh, move you out into an hourly.

360
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
fill. Uh, move you out into an hourly.
 

361
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,829
fill. Uh, move you out into an hourly.
You will see it.

362
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
You will see it.
 

363
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,829
You will see it.
Right. This is a big gap fill from I

364
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
Right. This is a big gap fill from I
 

365
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,030
Right. This is a big gap fill from I
think it was 5th of November. Yeah.

366
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040
think it was 5th of November. Yeah.
 

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,069
think it was 5th of November. Yeah.
Right. So this mark here, this close,

368
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
Right. So this mark here, this close,
 

369
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,750
Right. So this mark here, this close,
we've never filled this gap. All right.

370
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
we've never filled this gap. All right.
 

371
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,350
we've never filled this gap. All right.
The highest we've got is up into here

372
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
The highest we've got is up into here
 

373
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,550
The highest we've got is up into here
into the 26 or 276 27. All right. We're

374
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
into the 26 or 276 27. All right. We're
 

375
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,870
into the 26 or 276 27. All right. We're
comfortably inside that right now. This

376
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
comfortably inside that right now. This
 

377
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,949
comfortably inside that right now. This
is the gap fill. This was after hours.

378
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
is the gap fill. This was after hours.
 

379
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,750
is the gap fill. This was after hours.
The gap fill, the cash gap is to 632. So

380
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
The gap fill, the cash gap is to 632. So
 

381
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,829
The gap fill, the cash gap is to 632. So
I am aware of that as we come into it.

382
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
I am aware of that as we come into it.
 

383
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,150
I am aware of that as we come into it.
Hence why I've got a uh price alert

384
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
Hence why I've got a uh price alert
 

385
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,710
Hence why I've got a uh price alert
there marked out because this might be

386
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
there marked out because this might be
 

387
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,910
there marked out because this might be
it might be right that this is all

388
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
it might be right that this is all
 

389
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,069
it might be right that this is all
they're trying to do and that can be the

390
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
they're trying to do and that can be the
 

391
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,230
they're trying to do and that can be the
failed break. I'm not saying it is but I

392
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
failed break. I'm not saying it is but I
 

393
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,230
failed break. I'm not saying it is but I
need to be aware of this. It's a big

394
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
need to be aware of this. It's a big
 

395
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,069
need to be aware of this. It's a big
level for the market to be efficient. So

396
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
level for the market to be efficient. So
 

397
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,670
level for the market to be efficient. So
that's one thing I'm watching at

398
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
that's one thing I'm watching at
 

399
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,350
that's one thing I'm watching at
watching for for the Q's. It's not quite

400
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
watching for for the Q's. It's not quite
 

401
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,590
watching for for the Q's. It's not quite
so obvious on ENQ, but it's a very

402
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
so obvious on ENQ, but it's a very
 

403
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,990
so obvious on ENQ, but it's a very
obvious gap on the Q. So be aware of

404
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
obvious gap on the Q. So be aware of
 

405
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,629
obvious gap on the Q. So be aware of
that uh as we roll down these and go

406
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
that uh as we roll down these and go
 

407
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,470
that uh as we roll down these and go
through the ES and the spiders. Right,

408
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
through the ES and the spiders. Right,
 

409
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,110
through the ES and the spiders. Right,
ES getting very close for the breakout.

410
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
ES getting very close for the breakout.
 

411
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,670
ES getting very close for the breakout.
Right, not too far away right now. All

412
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
Right, not too far away right now. All
 

413
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,389
Right, not too far away right now. All
I'd say is check your sectors. Right,

414
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
I'd say is check your sectors. Right,
 

415
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,350
I'd say is check your sectors. Right,
healthcare very very weak. Uh, UNH was

416
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
healthcare very very weak. Uh, UNH was
 

417
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,269
healthcare very very weak. Uh, UNH was
weak off earnings. We saw healthcare not

418
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
weak off earnings. We saw healthcare not
 

419
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,949
weak off earnings. We saw healthcare not
really get going yesterday and this

420
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
really get going yesterday and this
 

421
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,949
really get going yesterday and this
morning as well. It is showing some

422
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
morning as well. It is showing some
 

423
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,829
morning as well. It is showing some
weakness. So, it might drag the market

424
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
weakness. So, it might drag the market
 

425
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,269
weakness. So, it might drag the market
not necessarily down, but it might stop

426
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
not necessarily down, but it might stop
 

427
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,350
not necessarily down, but it might stop
ES moving as much as it would want.

428
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
ES moving as much as it would want.
 

429
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,350
ES moving as much as it would want.
really depends if those other sectors,

430
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
really depends if those other sectors,
 

431
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,790
really depends if those other sectors,
obviously tech's worth a lot, but like

432
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
obviously tech's worth a lot, but like
 

433
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,470
obviously tech's worth a lot, but like
finance and stuff like that, if they

434
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,480
finance and stuff like that, if they
 

435
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,269
finance and stuff like that, if they
start to pick up some of the weight. Um,

436
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
start to pick up some of the weight. Um,
 

437
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,590
start to pick up some of the weight. Um,
SPY, same thing. All right, SPY, you are

438
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
SPY, same thing. All right, SPY, you are
 

439
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,269
SPY, same thing. All right, SPY, you are
very, very, very close to this all-time

440
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
very, very, very close to this all-time
 

441
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,629
very, very, very close to this all-time
high breakout. You can see I've got it

442
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
high breakout. You can see I've got it
 

443
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,710
high breakout. You can see I've got it
marked out here for alltime high. It's

444
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
marked out here for alltime high. It's
 

445
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,310
marked out here for alltime high. It's
worth setting price alerts for these

446
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
worth setting price alerts for these
 

447
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,069
worth setting price alerts for these
guys just so you can then see if it's a

448
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
guys just so you can then see if it's a
 

449
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,509
guys just so you can then see if it's a
fail break or not. Dixie getting

450
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
fail break or not. Dixie getting
 

451
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,030
fail break or not. Dixie getting
absolutely clapped like we've been

452
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
absolutely clapped like we've been
 

453
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,110
absolutely clapped like we've been
talking about for a long time. This is

454
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
talking about for a long time. This is
 

455
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,350
talking about for a long time. This is
the expected move coming right down back

456
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
the expected move coming right down back
 

457
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,910
the expected move coming right down back
inside. And uh the more this collapses,

458
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
inside. And uh the more this collapses,
 

459
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,269
inside. And uh the more this collapses,
well, the more rotation you're going to

460
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
well, the more rotation you're going to
 

461
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,430
well, the more rotation you're going to
see into safe havens like gold and

462
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
see into safe havens like gold and
 

463
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,430
see into safe havens like gold and
silver. I told you yesterday silver was

464
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
silver. I told you yesterday silver was
 

465
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,750
silver. I told you yesterday silver was
just a flush to be probably scooped up.

466
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
just a flush to be probably scooped up.
 

467
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,750
just a flush to be probably scooped up.
And well, look at that. All right,

468
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
And well, look at that. All right,
 

469
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,829
And well, look at that. All right,
there's no breakdown yet. Now, if we

470
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
there's no breakdown yet. Now, if we
 

471
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,750
there's no breakdown yet. Now, if we
have failed follow-through in the next

472
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
have failed follow-through in the next
 

473
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,590
have failed follow-through in the next
few sessions and we start to see, you

474
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
few sessions and we start to see, you
 

475
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,590
few sessions and we start to see, you
know, failing to make new highs, then

476
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
know, failing to make new highs, then
 

477
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,269
know, failing to make new highs, then
you can think about the backside move.

478
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
you can think about the backside move.
 

479
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,030
you can think about the backside move.
But yesterday was nothing more than a

480
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
But yesterday was nothing more than a
 

481
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,389
But yesterday was nothing more than a
pullback, guys. So, everyone got very

482
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
pullback, guys. So, everyone got very
 

483
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,590
pullback, guys. So, everyone got very
excited. Yes, there's a lot of

484
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
excited. Yes, there's a lot of
 

485
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,670
excited. Yes, there's a lot of
volatility, but until it proves

486
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
volatility, but until it proves
 

487
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,430
volatility, but until it proves
otherwise, all right, we are not

488
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
otherwise, all right, we are not
 

489
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,710
otherwise, all right, we are not
backside of the move. You're going to

490
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
backside of the move. You're going to
 

491
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,470
backside of the move. You're going to
need to see a failed break and starting

492
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
need to see a failed break and starting
 

493
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,069
need to see a failed break and starting
to see a collapse down. Same story on

494
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
to see a collapse down. Same story on
 

495
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,230
to see a collapse down. Same story on
gold. Still looks good. Still holding

496
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
gold. Still looks good. Still holding
 

497
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,069
gold. Still looks good. Still holding
all the time. Dixie's rotating off.

498
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
all the time. Dixie's rotating off.
 

499
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,829
all the time. Dixie's rotating off.
You're going to see safe haven moves

500
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
You're going to see safe haven moves
 

501
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,069
You're going to see safe haven moves
back into this. Are they due a pullback?

502
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
back into this. Are they due a pullback?
 

503
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,829
back into this. Are they due a pullback?
Absolutely. Of course they are. Full

504
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
Absolutely. Of course they are. Full
 

505
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,470
Absolutely. Of course they are. Full
Sigma moves yesterday. But, uh, you

506
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
Sigma moves yesterday. But, uh, you
 

507
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,230
Sigma moves yesterday. But, uh, you
know, we can only play what's in front

508
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
know, we can only play what's in front
 

509
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,790
know, we can only play what's in front
of us like I always tell you guys. VIX.

510
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
of us like I always tell you guys. VIX.
 

511
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,949
of us like I always tell you guys. VIX.
All right. VIX opening up in the mid

512
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
All right. VIX opening up in the mid
 

513
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,030
All right. VIX opening up in the mid
teens right here into some sort of old

514
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
teens right here into some sort of old
 

515
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,550
teens right here into some sort of old
support system here. Still sort of

516
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
support system here. Still sort of
 

517
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,910
support system here. Still sort of
holding this channel. We can probably

518
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
holding this channel. We can probably
 

519
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,430
holding this channel. We can probably
move this out a little bit. Something

520
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
move this out a little bit. Something
 

521
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,150
move this out a little bit. Something
like this. Right. Still in this channel,

522
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
like this. Right. Still in this channel,
 

523
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,389
like this. Right. Still in this channel,
right? We've had that big swipe. And

524
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
right? We've had that big swipe. And
 

525
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,990
right? We've had that big swipe. And
really, this is kind of no man's land.

526
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
really, this is kind of no man's land.
 

527
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,590
really, this is kind of no man's land.
This is grindy area. So, we'll have to

528
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
This is grindy area. So, we'll have to
 

529
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,749
This is grindy area. So, we'll have to
see what gets going on the VIX. Uh if we

530
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
see what gets going on the VIX. Uh if we
 

531
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,550
see what gets going on the VIX. Uh if we
look at the previous few days levels,

532
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
look at the previous few days levels,
 

533
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,990
look at the previous few days levels,
yeah, there's probably a pivot here. You

534
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
yeah, there's probably a pivot here. You
 

535
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,350
yeah, there's probably a pivot here. You
can see this was the gap fill we talked

536
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
can see this was the gap fill we talked
 

537
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,110
can see this was the gap fill we talked
about yesterday. I' I'd be watching a

538
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
about yesterday. I' I'd be watching a
 

539
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,790
about yesterday. I' I'd be watching a
break on VIX above 1620 1625. Maybe then

540
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
break on VIX above 1620 1625. Maybe then
 

541
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,629
break on VIX above 1620 1625. Maybe then
it gets going. Right, let's have a look

542
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
it gets going. Right, let's have a look
 

543
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,870
it gets going. Right, let's have a look
on the MAG.

544
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
on the MAG.
 

545
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,629
on the MAG.
All right, nice gap up on Apple. You can

546
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
All right, nice gap up on Apple. You can
 

547
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,870
All right, nice gap up on Apple. You can
see that red bar was resistance. So,

548
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
see that red bar was resistance. So,
 

549
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,230
see that red bar was resistance. So,
we're now going to use that as a

550
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
we're now going to use that as a
 

551
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,749
we're now going to use that as a
potential support mechanism. Remember,

552
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
potential support mechanism. Remember,
 

553
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,470
potential support mechanism. Remember,
I'm still long Apple on the swings,

554
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
I'm still long Apple on the swings,
 

555
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,550
I'm still long Apple on the swings,
right? Long from way down low in the

556
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
right? Long from way down low in the
 

557
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,069
right? Long from way down low in the
200s.

558
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
200s.
 

559
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,670
200s.
And we'll see we'll see if we can get

560
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
And we'll see we'll see if we can get
 

561
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,829
And we'll see we'll see if we can get
going. Now, this does now start to look

562
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
going. Now, this does now start to look
 

563
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,189
going. Now, this does now start to look
like what we've been talking about the

564
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
like what we've been talking about the
 

565
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,470
like what we've been talking about the
last few weeks. There's your build out

566
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
last few weeks. There's your build out
 

567
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,470
last few weeks. There's your build out
of liquidity. There's your fail to break

568
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
of liquidity. There's your fail to break
 

569
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,949
of liquidity. There's your fail to break
lower. If we can base out here, then

570
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
lower. If we can base out here, then
 

571
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,870
lower. If we can base out here, then
guess what we've got? And obviously this

572
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
guess what we've got? And obviously this
 

573
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,949
guess what we've got? And obviously this
week we have earnings season. So if we

574
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
week we have earnings season. So if we
 

575
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,629
week we have earnings season. So if we
can get going off good earnings, it's

576
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
can get going off good earnings, it's
 

577
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,629
can get going off good earnings, it's
got a shot. It has definitely got a

578
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:02,639
got a shot. It has definitely got a
 

579
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,590
got a shot. It has definitely got a
shot. Amazon,

580
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
shot. Amazon,
 

581
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,829
shot. Amazon,
same kind of story. Nice gap up. If we

582
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
same kind of story. Nice gap up. If we
 

583
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,630
same kind of story. Nice gap up. If we
zoom this out a little bit on Amazon,

584
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
zoom this out a little bit on Amazon,
 

585
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,029
zoom this out a little bit on Amazon,
right now holding above this gap,

586
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
right now holding above this gap,
 

587
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,230
right now holding above this gap,
building out the same kind of liquidity.

588
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
building out the same kind of liquidity.
 

589
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,789
building out the same kind of liquidity.
As long as it holds dips into 35s,

590
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
As long as it holds dips into 35s,
 

591
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,549
As long as it holds dips into 35s,
there's potential rotation higher.

592
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
there's potential rotation higher.
 

593
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,630
there's potential rotation higher.
Collapse 35 and it's a different

594
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
Collapse 35 and it's a different
 

595
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,949
Collapse 35 and it's a different
different story altogether, but 235s

596
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
different story altogether, but 235s
 

597
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,270
different story altogether, but 235s
will be a key level on Amazon for dips

598
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
will be a key level on Amazon for dips
 

599
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,830
will be a key level on Amazon for dips
to be holding. Goo another gap up there.

600
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
to be holding. Goo another gap up there.
 

601
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,270
to be holding. Goo another gap up there.
Nice drive higher. You're seeing the

602
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
Nice drive higher. You're seeing the
 

603
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,190
Nice drive higher. You're seeing the
same story across the tape here, folks.

604
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
same story across the tape here, folks.
 

605
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,350
same story across the tape here, folks.
All right. Failed to break lower. Build

606
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
All right. Failed to break lower. Build
 

607
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,750
All right. Failed to break lower. Build
out the liquidity. Can it break higher?

608
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
out the liquidity. Can it break higher?
 

609
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,590
out the liquidity. Can it break higher?
All right. This is story of the tape.

610
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
All right. This is story of the tape.
 

611
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,870
All right. This is story of the tape.
We're starting to see, remember we

612
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
We're starting to see, remember we
 

613
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,870
We're starting to see, remember we
talked about it November last year, we

614
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
talked about it November last year, we
 

615
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,310
talked about it November last year, we
saw rotation out of the MAG into, you

616
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
saw rotation out of the MAG into, you
 

617
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,789
saw rotation out of the MAG into, you
know, some of the Russell and uh more

618
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
know, some of the Russell and uh more
 

619
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,950

speculatory kind of broadening of the

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
speculatory kind of broadening of the
 

621
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,789
speculatory kind of broadening of the
market. Now we're seeing rotation back

622
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
market. Now we're seeing rotation back
 

623
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,230
market. Now we're seeing rotation back
into the MAG. Why? Because we have

624
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
into the MAG. Why? Because we have
 

625
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,750
into the MAG. Why? Because we have
earnings this week. They're positioning

626
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
earnings this week. They're positioning
 

627
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,110
earnings this week. They're positioning
early for earnings. Look at this

628
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
early for earnings. Look at this
 

629
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,190
early for earnings. Look at this
position early for earnings. Big

position. Look at Meta Go. I'm glad I'm

632
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
position. Look at Meta Go. I'm glad I'm
 

633
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,789

long in this one. This is an absolute

634
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
long in this one. This is an absolute
 

635
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,950
long in this one. This is an absolute
steam train that actually could do with

636
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
steam train that actually could do with
 

637
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,950
steam train that actually could do with
a healthy pullback here. All right, we

638
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
a healthy pullback here. All right, we
 

639
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,669
a healthy pullback here. All right, we
could do with a good pullback in meta um

640
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
could do with a good pullback in meta um
 

641
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,029
could do with a good pullback in meta um
before it gets going. We've got some

642
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
before it gets going. We've got some
 

643
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,990
before it gets going. We've got some
pivots up here. So, something like this

644
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
pivots up here. So, something like this
 

645
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,150
pivots up here. So, something like this
would interest me to add. Uh I'm long

646
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
would interest me to add. Uh I'm long
 

647
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,830
would interest me to add. Uh I'm long
from down here, folks. All right, those

in Discord will know I'm long from down

650
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
in Discord will know I'm long from down
 

651
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,750
in Discord will know I'm long from down
here. Sat through all of this. If we get

653
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,430

another pullback for an ad, I will add

654
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
another pullback for an ad, I will add
 

655
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,909
another pullback for an ad, I will add
on.

This is pretty expansive here. We need a

This is pretty expansive here. We need a

We're looking strong. Nvidia, same kind

680
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
We're looking strong. Nvidia, same kind
 

681
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,870
We're looking strong. Nvidia, same kind
of story. actually a little bit more

682
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
of story. actually a little bit more
 

683
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,710
of story. actually a little bit more
messy here on video because we built out

684
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
messy here on video because we built out
 

685
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,110
messy here on video because we built out
a huge amount of uh liquidity here last

686
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
a huge amount of uh liquidity here last
 

687
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,950
a huge amount of uh liquidity here last
year. If we zoom out of this, you can

688
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
year. If we zoom out of this, you can
 

689
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,750
year. If we zoom out of this, you can
see across here. All right, so needs to

690
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
see across here. All right, so needs to
 

691
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,909
see across here. All right, so needs to
get back in this range and do the dance

692
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
get back in this range and do the dance
 

693
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,990
get back in this range and do the dance
to open up. That's uh a little bit

694
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
to open up. That's uh a little bit
 

695
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,150
to open up. That's uh a little bit
messier to be honest. All right, because

696
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
messier to be honest. All right, because
 

697
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,310
messier to be honest. All right, because
you could argue that this is backside

698
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
you could argue that this is backside
 

699
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,789
you could argue that this is backside
here, right? So failures under here will

700
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
here, right? So failures under here will
 

701
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,870
here, right? So failures under here will
be a problem for Nvidia under 75, but

702
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
be a problem for Nvidia under 75, but
 

703
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,990
be a problem for Nvidia under 75, but
it's holding up all right right now.

704
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
it's holding up all right right now.
 

705
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,230
it's holding up all right right now.
It's not the prettiest chart, though.

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
It's not the prettiest chart, though.

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,029
It's not the prettiest chart, though.
Tesla.

Tesla.
Zoom out of this. That is a little bit

710
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
Zoom out of this. That is a little bit
 

711
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,658
Zoom out of this. That is a little bit
messy as well.

712
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:39,668

 

713
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:41,669

[snorts] This is your pivot on Tesla.

714
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
[snorts] This is your pivot on Tesla.
 

715
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,830
[snorts] This is your pivot on Tesla.
Here to here. Here's your box. So, they

716
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
Here to here. Here's your box. So, they
 

717
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,230
Here to here. Here's your box. So, they
want to hold above 30s and then they

718
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
want to hold above 30s and then they
 

719
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,990
want to hold above 30s and then they
need to get a break above 50s and a

720
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
need to get a break above 50s and a
 

721
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,750
need to get a break above 50s and a
hold. That's your pivot. It's actually a

722
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
hold. That's your pivot. It's actually a
 

723
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,669
hold. That's your pivot. It's actually a
bit messy. We're just boxed in. So, it's

724
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:51,679
bit messy. We're just boxed in. So, it's
 

725
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,750
bit messy. We're just boxed in. So, it's
probably if people are trying to play

726
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
probably if people are trying to play
 

727
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,870
probably if people are trying to play
momentum in that, they're probably

728
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
momentum in that, they're probably
 

729
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,510
momentum in that, they're probably
getting clapped both ways, right? as an

730
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
getting clapped both ways, right? as an
 

731
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,270
getting clapped both ways, right? as an
equally weighted mag. Let's have a look.

732
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
equally weighted mag. Let's have a look.
 

733
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,350
equally weighted mag. Let's have a look.
There you go. So, equal weighted mag

734
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,360
There you go. So, equal weighted mag
 

735
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,909
There you go. So, equal weighted mag
having a good January. All right. Up

736
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
having a good January. All right. Up
 

737
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,750
having a good January. All right. Up
into here. So, this is what we'd look

738
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
into here. So, this is what we'd look
 

739
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,990
into here. So, this is what we'd look
for on the mag and then this. It doesn't

740
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
for on the mag and then this. It doesn't
 

741
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,110
for on the mag and then this. It doesn't
have to be like that. It can just be

742
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
have to be like that. It can just be
 

743
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,029
have to be like that. It can just be
here and then go. But a little bit of a

744
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
here and then go. But a little bit of a
 

745
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,350
here and then go. But a little bit of a
buildout would be healthy for the mag if

746
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
buildout would be healthy for the mag if
 

747
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,430
buildout would be healthy for the mag if
we're going to get going. Right. Let's

748
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
we're going to get going. Right. Let's
 

749
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,789
we're going to get going. Right. Let's
have a look at some broader names. We've

750
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
have a look at some broader names. We've
 

751
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,470
have a look at some broader names. We've
got a couple minutes left. APGO

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
of box down here. Uh I would be
 

799
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,510
of box down here. Uh I would be
interested in I definitely don't want to

800
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
interested in I definitely don't want to
 

801
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,110
interested in I definitely don't want to
be long at the top. If it goes on a

802
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
be long at the top. If it goes on a
 

803
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,190
be long at the top. If it goes on a
squeeze without me, it is what it is.

804
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
squeeze without me, it is what it is.
 

805
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,710
squeeze without me, it is what it is.
Unless I can see something I'm really

806
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
Unless I can see something I'm really
 

807
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,070
Unless I can see something I'm really
interested in, it's going to be hard to

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
interested in, it's going to be hard to
 

809
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,070
interested in, it's going to be hard to
draw this high.

810

draw this high.
 

811
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,830

Does my indicator generate those buy and

812
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
Does my indicator generate those buy and
 

813
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,750
Does my indicator generate those buy and
sell arrows? It does indeed. Yes.

814
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760

 

815
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,909

All right. Just under a minute here.

816
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
All right. Just under a minute here.
 

817
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,590
All right. Just under a minute here.
What's the plan for today? We're above

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
What's the plan for today? We're above
 

819
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,909
What's the plan for today? We're above
previous value high and overnight close.

Looking for continuation sweep or fail

822
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
Looking for continuation sweep or fail
 

823
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,669
Looking for continuation sweep or fail
rotation. Yeah, exactly. We just went

824
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
rotation. Yeah, exactly. We just went
 

825
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,590
rotation. Yeah, exactly. We just went
over it, right? Dips into here. If they

826
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
over it, right? Dips into here. If they
 

827
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,750
over it, right? Dips into here. If they
hold somewhere into here. If they fail

828
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
hold somewhere into here. If they fail
 

829
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,830
hold somewhere into here. If they fail
that level, then possibly rotation back

830
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
that level, then possibly rotation back
 

831
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,909
that level, then possibly rotation back
down into here. But really somewhere in

832
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
down into here. But really somewhere in
 

833
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,390
down into here. But really somewhere in
here, right? I want to see something

834
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
here, right? I want to see something
 

835
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,549
here, right? I want to see something
like this. I want to see passive buyers

836
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
like this. I want to see passive buyers
 

837
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,830
like this. I want to see passive buyers
step up. I want to see aggressive

838
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
step up. I want to see aggressive
 

839
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,510
step up. I want to see aggressive
sellers get caught. If I don't see that

840
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
sellers get caught. If I don't see that
 

841
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,270
sellers get caught. If I don't see that
and they don't step up, we watch

842
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
and they don't step up, we watch
 

843
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,789
and they don't step up, we watch
previous days levels and if we've

844
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
previous days levels and if we've
 

845
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,070
previous days levels and if we've
collapsed under that, then we're going

846
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
collapsed under that, then we're going
 

847
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,350
collapsed under that, then we're going
to come right down into here. This would

848
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
to come right down into here. This would
 

849
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,029
to come right down into here. This would
be a short that I'd consider taking for

850
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
be a short that I'd consider taking for
 

851
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,190
be a short that I'd consider taking for
the counter trend

852
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
the counter trend
 

853
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,549
the counter trend
on a higher time frame. That would be

854
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
on a higher time frame. That would be
 

855
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,190
on a higher time frame. That would be
counter trend.

856
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
counter trend.
 

857
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,430
counter trend.
Let's see how we go, folks. Hopefully

858
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
Let's see how we go, folks. Hopefully
 

859
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,230
Let's see how we go, folks. Hopefully
market offers us something. Good luck,

860
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
market offers us something. Good luck,
 

861
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,750
market offers us something. Good luck,
everyone.

862
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760

 

863
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,830

See if this can flush down a little bit

864
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
See if this can flush down a little bit
 

865
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,430
See if this can flush down a little bit
for us for us to scoop something up.

866
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
for us for us to scoop something up.
 

867
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,430
for us for us to scoop something up.
Uh ES letting go of previous day high by

868
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,440
Uh ES letting go of previous day high by
 

869
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,549
Uh ES letting go of previous day high by
the way. I think that's previous day.

870
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
the way. I think that's previous day.
 

871
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,029
the way. I think that's previous day.
Yes. So gap fill on ES would be down to

872
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:33,039
Yes. So gap fill on ES would be down to
 

873
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,430
Yes. So gap fill on ES would be down to
981s. Gap fill for us by the way is all

874
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
981s. Gap fill for us by the way is all
 

875
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,909
981s. Gap fill for us by the way is all
the way down here. 850s. Long long way

876
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
the way down here. 850s. Long long way
 

877
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,909
the way down here. 850s. Long long way
away.

878
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919

879
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,029
away.
Mag all opening up green. So Tesla 0.11%

880
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,039
Mag all opening up green. So Tesla 0.11%
 

881
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,750
Mag all opening up green. So Tesla 0.11%
up. Nvidia 09%

882
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
up. Nvidia 09%
 

883
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,669
up. Nvidia 09%
up. Microsoft 0.71% up. Meta and Google

884

885
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,710
up. Microsoft 0.71% up. Meta and Google
both quarter% up. Amazon just uh about

886
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
both quarter% up. Amazon just uh about
 

887
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,230
both quarter% up. Amazon just uh about
third of a percent up, giving some back.

888
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
third of a percent up, giving some back.
 

889
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,590
third of a percent up, giving some back.
And uh Apple 150% up. So coming back

890
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
And uh Apple 150% up. So coming back
 

891
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,430
And uh Apple 150% up. So coming back
down towards previous day high right

892
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
down towards previous day high right
 

893
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,830
down towards previous day high right
now. And let's see if we can get into

894
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:01,840
now. And let's see if we can get into
 

895
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,190
now. And let's see if we can get into
some of these areas for us to start

896
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
some of these areas for us to start
 

897
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,909
some of these areas for us to start
bidding on. We'll be interested. Already

898
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
bidding on. We'll be interested. Already
 

899
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,549
bidding on. We'll be interested. Already
seeing some buyers try and step up here.

900
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
seeing some buyers try and step up here.
 

901
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,390
seeing some buyers try and step up here.
It's a big drive up already.

902
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,400
It's a big drive up already.
 

903
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,230
It's a big drive up already.
Buyers stepped in nice and early there.

904
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240
Buyers stepped in nice and early there.
 

905
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,110
Buyers stepped in nice and early there.
So, held the 55s. There's a seller here

906
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
So, held the 55s. There's a seller here
 

907
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,390
So, held the 55s. There's a seller here
at 95 and then all the way back up. So,

908
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
at 95 and then all the way back up. So,
 

909
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,750
at 95 and then all the way back up. So,
here comes the squeeze. So, they're

910
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
here comes the squeeze. So, they're
 

911
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,430
here comes the squeeze. So, they're
already trying it. So, it didn't even

912
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
already trying it. So, it didn't even
 

913
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,870
already trying it. So, it didn't even
get into our level. They've already

914
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
get into our level. They've already
 

915
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,830
get into our level. They've already
tried to absorb it.

916
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840

 

917
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,990

I'd be watching ES into VWAP and

918
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
I'd be watching ES into VWAP and
 

919
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,590
I'd be watching ES into VWAP and
previous day high here. If it starts to

920
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
previous day high here. If it starts to
 

921
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,270
previous day high here. If it starts to
base above, it's got squeeze potential.

922
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
base above, it's got squeeze potential.
 

923
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,110
base above, it's got squeeze potential.
Here we go. Right back to the upside.

924
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
Here we go. Right back to the upside.
 

925
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,470
Here we go. Right back to the upside.
Amazing. Didn't get anywhere near where

926
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480

985
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,390

VIX starting to get going. I want to be

986
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
VIX starting to get going. I want to be
 

987
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,070
VIX starting to get going. I want to be
careful here of the divergence. VIX

988
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,080
careful here of the divergence. VIX
 

989
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,990
careful here of the divergence. VIX
coming up to those 1620s. So if VIX

990
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
coming up to those 1620s. So if VIX
 

991
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,870
coming up to those 1620s. So if VIX
starts to break through these 1625s,

992
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
starts to break through these 1625s,
 

993
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,190
starts to break through these 1625s,
there's an upside move to 1650. market

994
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
there's an upside move to 1650. market
 

995
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,430
there's an upside move to 1650. market
will get weak or at least the ES will.

996
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
will get weak or at least the ES will.
 

997
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:19,669
will get weak or at least the ES will.
Let's see.

998
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679

 

999
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,549

Is there a day trade on silver? Um have

1000
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
Is there a day trade on silver? Um have
 

1001
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,950
Is there a day trade on silver? Um have
a look little look. Might be if there's

1002
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
a look little look. Might be if there's
 

1003
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:45,909
a look little look. Might be if there's
failed follow through.

1004
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919

 

1005
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,510

you're just stuck in GlobeEx. I mean,

1006
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
you're just stuck in GlobeEx. I mean,
 

1007
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,789
you're just stuck in GlobeEx. I mean,
I'd say if there's failed follow through

1008
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:48,799
I'd say if there's failed follow through
 

1009
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,149
I'd say if there's failed follow through
at 110s, maybe that's all all I would uh

1010
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,159
at 110s, maybe that's all all I would uh
 

1011
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,590
at 110s, maybe that's all all I would uh
consider playing off right now. But I

1012
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:53,600
consider playing off right now. But I
 

1013
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,110
consider playing off right now. But I
think, you know, that would be a counter

1014
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
think, you know, that would be a counter
 

1015
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,710
think, you know, that would be a counter
that would be looking for that early

1016
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
that would be looking for that early
 

1017
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:08,789
that would be looking for that early
move counter trend almost.

1018
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799

 

1019
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,070

00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,320
watch on the VIX. So just whipped the
 

1049
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,590
watch on the VIX. So just whipped the
low of day there and they got absorbed

1050
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
low of day there and they got absorbed
 

1051
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,950
low of day there and they got absorbed
again. Sellers currently stuck

1052
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
again. Sellers currently stuck
 

1053
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,190
again. Sellers currently stuck
underneath 67 on the day. Big seller was

1054
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,200
underneath 67 on the day. Big seller was
 

1055
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,830
underneath 67 on the day. Big seller was
at 73. So you could even say under 73,

1056
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,840
at 73. So you could even say under 73,
 

1057
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,909
at 73. So you could even say under 73,
but definitely under 67. It's where

1058
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
but definitely under 67. It's where
 

1059
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,510
but definitely under 67. It's where
sellers have come in heavy. You can see

1060
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:55,520
sellers have come in heavy. You can see
 

1061
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,789

it right here. This one. This one.

1062
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799

1063
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,590

Right. They keep coming piling in down
 

1065
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,350
Right. They keep coming piling in down

1066
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360

1067
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,390

1069
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,070
under sort of. There you go. Under 70.
I would say it's well 73 and 68 is where

1070
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
I would say it's well 73 and 68 is where
 

1071
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,590
I would say it's well 73 and 68 is where
they they're marketing very very

1072
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
they they're marketing very very
 

1073
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,830
they they're marketing very very
aggressively in here. So hopefully we

1074
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
aggressively in here. So hopefully we
 

1075
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,350
aggressively in here. So hopefully we
get a move lower. I'm not going to play

1076
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,360
get a move lower. I'm not going to play
 

1077
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,950
get a move lower. I'm not going to play
the short. I'm going to wait to see if

1078
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960
the short. I'm going to wait to see if
 

1079
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,110
the short. I'm going to wait to see if
we absorb down here. I'm going to try

1080
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
we absorb down here. I'm going to try
 

1081
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,710
we absorb down here. I'm going to try
and avoid that counter trend at the

1082
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
and avoid that counter trend at the
 

1083
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:41,110
and avoid that counter trend at the
moment.

1084
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,120

 

1085
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,830

Some absorption here again.

1086
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
Some absorption here again.
 

1087
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:51,350
Some absorption here again.
This moving lower.

1088
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,360

 

1089
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,950

Come on. Come down, baby.

1090
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960

 

1091
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,950

Interesting ES finding some strength

1092
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
Interesting ES finding some strength
 

1093
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,350
Interesting ES finding some strength
here when ES uh ENQ starting to make new

1094
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
here when ES uh ENQ starting to make new
 

1095
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,830
here when ES uh ENQ starting to make new
lows. A little bit of a mess out here.

1096
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
lows. A little bit of a mess out here.
 

1097
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,350
lows. A little bit of a mess out here.
I'm just going to have to wait for it to

1098
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
I'm just going to have to wait for it to
 

1099
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,230
I'm just going to have to wait for it to
figure itself out.

1100
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
figure itself out.
 

1101
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,830
figure itself out.
So, coming down to previous day high,

1102
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
So, coming down to previous day high,
 

1103
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,190
So, coming down to previous day high,
this red line. This is the area of

1104
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
this red line. This is the area of
 

1105
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,710
this red line. This is the area of
interest down here. Previous day value

1106
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:12,720
interest down here. Previous day value
 

1107
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,909
interest down here. Previous day value
area high, previous day point of

1108
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
area high, previous day point of
 

1109
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,510
area high, previous day point of
control, and this big block. Anywhere

1110
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,520
control, and this big block. Anywhere
 

1111
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,789
control, and this big block. Anywhere
down here where I start to see

1112
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
down here where I start to see
 

1113
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,310
down here where I start to see
absorption on the tape, I'll be

1114
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,320
absorption on the tape, I'll be
 

1115
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,470
absorption on the tape, I'll be
interested in getting long, especially

1116
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
interested in getting long, especially
 

1117
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,430
interested in getting long, especially
if we can trap and start to curl and go.

1118
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
if we can trap and start to curl and go.
 

1119
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,029
if we can trap and start to curl and go.
But want to be careful if we stay heavy.

1120
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039
But want to be careful if we stay heavy.
 

1121
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,870
But want to be careful if we stay heavy.
Obviously, I won't bid on it.

1122
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
Obviously, I won't bid on it.
 

1123
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,510
Obviously, I won't bid on it.
Here we go. This is better. So, if you

1124
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:31,520
Here we go. This is better. So, if you
 

1125
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,710
Here we go. This is better. So, if you
did take this counter trend short,

1126
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:32,720
did take this counter trend short,
 

1127
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,909
did take this counter trend short,
you're looking good. Down into these

1128
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
you're looking good. Down into these
 

1129
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,590
you're looking good. Down into these
boxes are your targets is previous day

1130
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:35,600
boxes are your targets is previous day
 

1131
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,750
boxes are your targets is previous day
high, this red line. So, you would be

1132
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:37,760
high, this red line. So, you would be
 

1133
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,470
high, this red line. So, you would be
cover one here. Previous day value area

1134
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
cover one here. Previous day value area
 

1135
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,389
cover one here. Previous day value area
high be cover 2, previous day point of

1136
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
high be cover 2, previous day point of
 

1137
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,750
high be cover 2, previous day point of
control. Anything beyond that is an

1138
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
control. Anything beyond that is an
 

1139
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,269

absolute gift for you guys. I'm looking

absolute gift for you guys. I'm looking
 

1141
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,710
absolute gift for you guys. I'm looking
to get long in these areas if I see

1142
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
to get long in these areas if I see
 

1143
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,029
to get long in these areas if I see
sellers get trapped. All right. If I see

1144
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039
sellers get trapped. All right. If I see
 

1145
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,669

VIX going for that uh 25 break. It's

1148
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559

1149
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,870
VIX going for that uh 25 break. It's
currently trading at 1623. So you want

1150
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:58,880
currently trading at 1623. So you want
 

1151
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,230
currently trading at 1623. So you want
to be careful if VIX starts to get

1152
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
to be careful if VIX starts to get
 

1153
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,669
to be careful if VIX starts to get
going. There'd be a bigger flush in this

1154
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
going. There'd be a bigger flush in this
 

1155

So into previous day highs. They are

1164
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
So into previous day highs. They are
 

1165
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,389
So into previous day highs. They are
offering bids down at 98.95. So

1166

hopefully we can trade a little bit

1168
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
hopefully we can trade a little bit
 

1169
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,870
hopefully we can trade a little bit
lower first in towards this blue block.

1170
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:20,880
lower first in towards this blue block.
 

1171
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,630
lower first in towards this blue block.
Gap fills all the way down here if they

1172
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
Gap fills all the way down here if they
 

1173

Gap fills all the way down here if they
really want to do a gap fill.

1174
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320

 

1175
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,990

Come on. Almost at previous day value
area high. So this is your TP2 if you

1178
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
area high. So this is your TP2 if you
 

1179
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,830
area high. So this is your TP2 if you
took the short.

1180
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
took the short.
 

1181
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,430
took the short.
I'm going to wait to see if we can trap

1182
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
I'm going to wait to see if we can trap
 

1183
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:51,990

So, it is previous day value area high

1192
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
So, it is previous day value area high
 

1193
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,710
So, it is previous day value area high
now tagged coming into my level of

And now it's all about how we act when

not fully confirm that breakout yet on
 

1205
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:24,549
not fully confirm that breakout yet on
the VIX. Just right into a pivot.

1206
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559

 

1207
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,190

Still don't think we've swept enough.
 

1211
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:46,630
Still don't think we've swept enough.
Still think there's one more leg down.

1212
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:46,640

 

1213
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,710

Come on, give a swipe first. Don't go

Come on, give a swipe first. Don't go
 

1215
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,389
Come on, give a swipe first. Don't go
and drive straight out of the gate. Come

1216
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:50,399
and drive straight out of the gate. Come
 

1217
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:55,669
and drive straight out of the gate. Come
further down.

1218
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679

 

1219
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,830

I'd say the big sellers came in at 38.
40s is the level, but I want us to move

1224
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,120
40s is the level, but I want us to move
 

1225
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,310
40s is the level, but I want us to move
lower first. Really, I would write

1226
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:06,320
lower first. Really, I would write
 

1227
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,389
lower first. Really, I would write
really like some sort of nice auction

1228

really like some sort of nice auction
 

1229
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,070
really like some sort of nice auction
down here where we trap lots near the

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
down here where we trap lots near the
 

1231
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,269
down here where we trap lots near the
lows.

1232
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279

 

1233
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,350

So, I'd be high from yesterday. Not too

1234
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
So, I'd be high from yesterday. Not too
 

1235
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,070
So, I'd be high from yesterday. Not too
far away for a spy either.

1236
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
far away for a spy either.
 

1237
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,470
far away for a spy either.
Come on. One more leg, please. Come

Come on. One more leg, please. Come
 

1239
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,950
Come on. One more leg, please. Come
down. Not playing this short, by the

1240
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
down. Not playing this short, by the
 

1241
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,789
down. Not playing this short, by the
way. Want to make that clear. I'm

1242
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:26,799
way. Want to make that clear. I'm
 

1243
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,230
way. Want to make that clear. I'm
looking to play the long back upside.

1244
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
looking to play the long back upside.
 

1245
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,149
looking to play the long back upside.
All right. Watching these 40s. See

1246
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
All right. Watching these 40s. See
 

1247
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,149
All right. Watching these 40s. See
sellers redefend 40s. It's a big level.

1248
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
sellers redefend 40s. It's a big level.
 

1249
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,909
sellers redefend 40s. It's a big level.
We can see them trying to offer at 40

1250
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
We can see them trying to offer at 40
 

1251
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,990
We can see them trying to offer at 40
again.

1252
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,000
again.
 

1253
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,710
again.
Value area low on the current session is

1254
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
Value area low on the current session is
 

1255
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,029
Value area low on the current session is
42. So I guess if we go back inside all

1256
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
42. So I guess if we go back inside all
 

1257
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,110
42. So I guess if we go back inside all
of that. I want to see more excess

1258
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
of that. I want to see more excess
 

1259
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,310
of that. I want to see more excess
though. I'd like to see more sellers

1260
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
though. I'd like to see more sellers
 

1261
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,990
though. I'd like to see more sellers
down here. C before I think about this

1262
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
down here. C before I think about this
 

1263
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,830
down here. C before I think about this
long. We are starting to build some

1264
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
long. We are starting to build some
 

1265
00:31:47,840 --> 00:32:01,830
long. We are starting to build some
volume around here.

1266
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840

 

1267
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,950

So, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, all gone red.

1268
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
So, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, all gone red.
 

1269
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,389
So, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, all gone red.
But we're coming into that level, this

1270
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:06,399
But we're coming into that level, this
 

1271
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,710
But we're coming into that level, this
box where I think there's potential for

1272
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
box where I think there's potential for
 

1273
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,430
box where I think there's potential for
us to bid on if we can trap sellers. If

1274
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,440
us to bid on if we can trap sellers. If
 

1275
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,549
us to bid on if we can trap sellers. If
we don't, then they're going to come and

1276
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
we don't, then they're going to come and
 

1277
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,190
we don't, then they're going to come and
reflush down here. And if they let go of

1278
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
reflush down here. And if they let go of
 

1279
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,389
reflush down here. And if they let go of
this, then there's definitely a short

1280
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
this, then there's definitely a short
 

1281
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,630
this, then there's definitely a short
all the way down into 725. That was the

1282
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,640
all the way down into 725. That was the
 

1283
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,149
all the way down into 725. That was the
level we broke out from. But watching

1284
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:20,159
level we broke out from. But watching
 

1285
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,750
level we broke out from. But watching
this level again, they're tapping into

1286
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
this level again, they're tapping into
 

1287
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,669
this level again, they're tapping into
40s again. Watching for a trigger long

1288
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
40s again. Watching for a trigger long
 

1289
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,789
40s again. Watching for a trigger long
if they're going to let this start to

1290
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:24,799
if they're going to let this start to
 

1291
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,909
if they're going to let this start to
really get going now. 40s, 40s, 40s.

1292
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:27,919
really get going now. 40s, 40s, 40s.
 

1293
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,590
really get going now. 40s, 40s, 40s.
Here we go. They're now rebidding.

1294
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
Here we go. They're now rebidding.
 

1295
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,870
Here we go. They're now rebidding.
Trying to force the squeeze through the

40s in a small piece here.
 

1299
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,789
40s in a small piece here.
And we re offer through here and come up

1300
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:36,799
And we re offer through here and come up
 

1301
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,710
And we re offer through here and come up
to 55s. Here we go. Starting to join

1302
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
to 55s. Here we go. Starting to join
 

1303
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,470
to 55s. Here we go. Starting to join
this for the squeeze. Peeling some off

1304
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:40,480
this for the squeeze. Peeling some off
 

1305
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,269
this for the squeeze. Peeling some off
straight away in case they defend 55s.

1306
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279

 

1307
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,950

Nice.

1308
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:46,960
Nice.
 

1309
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,430
Nice.
An imbalance here up to 55. So buyers

1310
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
An imbalance here up to 55. So buyers
 

1311
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,830
An imbalance here up to 55. So buyers
now have got to step in and hold 40s.

1312
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
now have got to step in and hold 40s.
 

1313
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,590
now have got to step in and hold 40s.
Here we go. Right. All right, let's see

1314
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
Here we go. Right. All right, let's see
 

1315
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,310
Here we go. Right. All right, let's see
if we can get up to the New York VWAP

1316
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
if we can get up to the New York VWAP
 

1317
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,669
if we can get up to the New York VWAP
into flow zones. Make sure you pay

1318
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
into flow zones. Make sure you pay
 

1319
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,430
into flow zones. Make sure you pay
yourself. They can come back in and

1320
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:01,440
yourself. They can come back in and
 

1321
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,190
yourself. They can come back in and
defend this if it's too early. We

1322
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
defend this if it's too early. We
 

1323
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,950
defend this if it's too early. We
haven't had a pullback that's held yet.

1324
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:04,960
haven't had a pullback that's held yet.
 

1325
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,470
haven't had a pullback that's held yet.
Remember, this is just a straight

Remember, this is just a straight
 

1327
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,870
Remember, this is just a straight

1328
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:12,880

 

1329
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,350

Watching the New York open on ES. If it

Watching the New York open on ES. If it
 

1333
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,549
Watching the New York open on ES. If it
trades through that, we'll get a giant

1334
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
trades through that, we'll get a giant
 

1335
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,430
trades through that, we'll get a giant
squeeze out. But this is the four the 55

1336
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
squeeze out. But this is the four the 55
 

1337
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,269
squeeze out. But this is the four the 55
level that we just talked about. Sellers

1338
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:23,279
level that we just talked about. Sellers
 

1339
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,509
level that we just talked about. Sellers
just reoffered at 55s through this. The

1340
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:25,519
just reoffered at 55s through this. The
 

1341
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,070
just reoffered at 55s through this. The
next imbalance is at 62s

next imbalance is at 62s
 

1343
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,310
next imbalance is at 62s
and then we're at VW.

00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320
and then we're at VW.
 

1345
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,710

1355
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,549
Let's go. Let's go. Little piece left

now. And if we continue to squeeze and
 

1357
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,470

If we can continue to squeeze and start
 

1361
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,098
If we can continue to squeeze and start

1401
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,950

that good, I'll be honest. But that 40

1402
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:46,960
that good, I'll be honest. But that 40
 

1403
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,270
that good, I'll be honest. But that 40
trigger was the key, right? The 40

1404
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,280
trigger was the key, right? The 40
 

1405
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,430
trigger was the key, right? The 40
trigger was the key. Once they got stuck

1406
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440
trigger was the key. Once they got stuck
 

1407
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,869
trigger was the key. Once they got stuck
at 40, that was it. So tiny tiny tiny

1408
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
at 40, that was it. So tiny tiny tiny
 

1409
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,829
at 40, that was it. So tiny tiny tiny
size left. Now that's uh 40 50 point

1410
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
size left. Now that's uh 40 50 point
 

1411
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,630
size left. Now that's uh 40 50 point
trade there.

1412
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:00,640

Remember, we have not held a pullback

1418
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
Remember, we have not held a pullback
 

1419
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,190
Remember, we have not held a pullback
yet. I want to be that clear. Be clear.

1420
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
yet. I want to be that clear. Be clear.
 

1421
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,710
yet. I want to be that clear. Be clear.
I don't love the auction at the low.

1422
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:10,720
I don't love the auction at the low.
 

1423
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,710
I don't love the auction at the low.
There wasn't that many call, but a

1424
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
There wasn't that many call, but a
 

1425
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,550
There wasn't that many call, but a
pullback can come down here and hold. So

1426
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:14,560
pullback can come down here and hold. So
 

1427
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,630
pullback can come down here and hold. So
if this is just leg one and they want to

1428
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:16,640
if this is just leg one and they want to
 

1429
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,630
if this is just leg one and they want to
do a leg two and then do this, they can

1430
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
do a leg two and then do this, they can
 

1431
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,150
do a leg two and then do this, they can
also do that. But so far we look good.

1432
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,160
also do that. But so far we look good.
 

1433
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,069
also do that. But so far we look good.

You just hold hold a runner now. Should
 

1435

flip this over otherwise I'll stop out
 

1447
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,670
flip this over otherwise I'll stop out
on these runners.

1448
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:41,680

New York open. Absolutely pivotal. Same
on ES pivotal pivotal area.

1452
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:58,720

 

1453
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,870

Nice guys. Well done everyone. All
right, coming back to down towards this

1456
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
right, coming back to down towards this
 

1457
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,790
right, coming back to down towards this
sort of 40 area.

1458
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
sort of 40 area.
 

1459
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,270
sort of 40 area.
So we did have sellers uh earlier in the

1460
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
So we did have sellers uh earlier in the
 

1461
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,390
So we did have sellers uh earlier in the
day, 47 down to 43 and then the next

1462
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:10,400
day, 47 down to 43 and then the next
 

1463
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,430
day, 47 down to 43 and then the next
block was down at 30. So, I'd say 47

1464
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,440
block was down at 30. So, I'd say 47
 

1465
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,990
block was down at 30. So, I'd say 47
down to 43. If buyers absorb that,

1466
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,000
down to 43. If buyers absorb that,
 

1467
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,310
down to 43. If buyers absorb that,
they've got a shot. Otherwise, it's

1468
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
they've got a shot. Otherwise, it's
 

1469
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,790
they've got a shot. Otherwise, it's
going to be these 30s.

1470
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
going to be these 30s.
 

1471
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,430
going to be these 30s.
Otherwise, it's going to be the 30s.

1472
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440

 

1473
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,349

ES looks strong here. It's trying to get

this or not.
Let's have a quick look at the MA. So

1482
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,240
Let's have a quick look at the MA. So
 

1483
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,150
Let's have a quick look at the MA. So

the MAG as we approach earning season.

1492
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
the MAG as we approach earning season.
 

1493

to get up to high day and then take out

1702
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:00,400
to get up to high day and then take out
 

1703
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,550
to get up to high day and then take out
all these stops. I'd love to get up to

1704
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,560
all these stops. I'd love to get up to
 

1705
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,790
all these stops. I'd love to get up to
basically 26,50.

1706
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800
basically 26,50.
 

1707
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,470
basically 26,50.
It's where I'd love to get up to. So, if

1708
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
It's where I'd love to get up to. So, if
 

1709
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,870
It's where I'd love to get up to. So, if
we can get this trade to go, which is

1710
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
we can get this trade to go, which is
 

1711

00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
what I'm looking to do here. Partial's
 

1713
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,550
what I'm looking to do here. Partial's
on the way, obviously. Where's my long

1714
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
on the way, obviously. Where's my long
 

1715
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,750
on the way, obviously. Where's my long
trigger? Right from 40s, right? If we

1716
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:15,760
trigger? Right from 40s, right? If we
 

1717
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,150
trigger? Right from 40s, right? If we
can get up to the top side of this box,

1718
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,160
can get up to the top side of this box,
 

1719
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,309
can get up to the top side of this box,
it would be fantastic. Partial's on the

it would be fantastic. Partial's on the
way, of course.

1722
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440

 

1723
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,030

We got to get through this value area

1724
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,040
We got to get through this value area
 

1725
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,550
We got to get through this value area
high on the session. Let's go. We've got

1726
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:28,560
high on the session. Let's go. We've got
 

1727
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,150
high on the session. Let's go. We've got
an imbalance here into 90. Lower time

1728
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
an imbalance here into 90. Lower time
 

1729
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,230
an imbalance here into 90. Lower time
frame now. Go a little spike into 94.

1730
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240
frame now. Go a little spike into 94.
 

1731
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:39,349
frame now. Go a little spike into 94.
Let's go. Come on, baby. Let's go.

1733
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,790

That's why I said I'm bullish today.

1734
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:40,800
That's why I said I'm bullish today.
 

1735
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,870
That's why I said I'm bullish today.
Protrend is bullish. I want to buy dips

1736
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:42,880
Protrend is bullish. I want to buy dips
 

1737
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,270
Protrend is bullish. I want to buy dips
off the key levels once sellers get

1738
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
off the key levels once sellers get
 

1739
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,750
off the key levels once sellers get
stuck.

1740
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:49,760

 

1741
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,390

Okay, so into what is this here? Is this

1748
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
Okay, so into what is this here? Is this
 

1749
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,470
Okay, so into what is this here? Is this
developing profile? Yeah, current week's

1750
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
developing profile? Yeah, current week's
 

1751
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,670
developing profile? Yeah, current week's
developing edge is basically 26,6.

1752
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:05,680
developing edge is basically 26,6.
 

1753
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,950
developing edge is basically 26,6.
This right here is current week's

1754
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
This right here is current week's
 

1755
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,030
This right here is current week's
developing profile. We want to expand

1756
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,040
developing profile. We want to expand
 

1757
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,470
developing profile. We want to expand
this. We want to move this blue line

1758
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,480
this. We want to move this blue line
 

1759
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,790
this. We want to move this blue line
higher with us now, right? And if we

1760
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
higher with us now, right? And if we
 

1761
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,790
higher with us now, right? And if we
look at the hourlies, you can see why I

1762
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:14,800
look at the hourlies, you can see why I
 

1763
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,910
look at the hourlies, you can see why I
was looking at and what I was looking

1764
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:15,920
was looking at and what I was looking
 

1765
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,670
was looking at and what I was looking
at. We went over all of this pre-market,

1766
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:17,680
at. We went over all of this pre-market,
 

1767
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,030
at. We went over all of this pre-market,
right? We were looking for dips to hold

1768
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,040
right? We were looking for dips to hold
 

1769
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,349
right? We were looking for dips to hold
versus this key level here. Dips to

1770
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:23,359
versus this key level here. Dips to
 

1771
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,510
versus this key level here. Dips to
hold, right? The old naked point of

1772
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
hold, right? The old naked point of
 

1773
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,829
hold, right? The old naked point of
control, this big bump. All right. And

1774
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
control, this big bump. All right. And
 

1775
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,589
control, this big bump. All right. And
we're looking to take out these stops

1776
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
we're looking to take out these stops
 

1777
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,069
we're looking to take out these stops
here now. All right. These stops here.

1778
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:32,079
here now. All right. These stops here.
 

1779
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,069
here now. All right. These stops here.
And if we get a squeeze, those will run

1780
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,079
And if we get a squeeze, those will run
 

1781
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,790
And if we get a squeeze, those will run
us up all the way up to 26,100.

1782
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:36,800
us up all the way up to 26,100.
 

1783
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,230
us up all the way up to 26,100.
And what's the very top of this? and

1784
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,240
And what's the very top of this? and
 

1785
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,630
And what's the very top of this? and
we'll just call it 26,150.

1786
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:40,640
we'll just call it 26,150.
 

1787
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,349
we'll just call it 26,150.
So, if we squeeze through 26,50, we've

1788
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:43,359
So, if we squeeze through 26,50, we've
 

1789
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,190
So, if we squeeze through 26,50, we've
got another 100 point higher potentially

1790
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
got another 100 point higher potentially
 

1791
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,870
got another 100 point higher potentially
setting up. Here we go.

1792
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:50,880

 

1793
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,390

How many other channels were telling you

1794
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400
How many other channels were telling you
 

1795
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,390
How many other channels were telling you
to short this today? I reckon lots of

1796
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:54,400
to short this today? I reckon lots of
 

1797
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:02,790
to short this today? I reckon lots of
them.

1798
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:02,800

 

1799
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,710

Here we go, folks. Here we go, folks.

1800
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720

 

1801
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,309

All right. So, you can take partial into

1802
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
All right. So, you can take partial into
 

1803
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,829
All right. So, you can take partial into
this current New York hive day if you

1804
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
this current New York hive day if you
 

1805
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,670
this current New York hive day if you
want if you haven't paid yourself enough

1806
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:13,680
want if you haven't paid yourself enough
 

1807
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,150
want if you haven't paid yourself enough
already. My expectation is that we can

1808
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160
already. My expectation is that we can
 

1809
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,069
already. My expectation is that we can
move higher hopefully. Well, just

1810
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,079
move higher hopefully. Well, just
 

1811
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,990
move higher hopefully. Well, just
remember we've got that 10:00 print. So,

1812
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
remember we've got that 10:00 print. So,
 

1813
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,150
remember we've got that 10:00 print. So,
you will want to move your stop at least

1814
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,160
you will want to move your stop at least
 

1815
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,069
you will want to move your stop at least
to protect you break even at the very

1816
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
to protect you break even at the very
 

1817
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,349
to protect you break even at the very
minimum. Here we go. Let's go. Are we

1818
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
minimum. Here we go. Let's go. Are we
 

1819
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,510
minimum. Here we go. Let's go. Are we
going to get 112 points here? And if we

1820
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
going to get 112 points here? And if we
 

1821
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,829
going to get 112 points here? And if we
can get 112, then you know if we can

1822
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:31,839
can get 112, then you know if we can
 

1823
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,470
can get 112, then you know if we can
squeeze this is possible today, folks.

1824
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,480
squeeze this is possible today, folks.
 

1825
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,470
squeeze this is possible today, folks.
145 is possible today. if we can get

1826
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
145 is possible today. if we can get
 

1827
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,935
145 is possible today. if we can get
going. So that's ultimate target.

1828
00:44:40,935 --> 00:44:40,945
going. So that's ultimate target.
 

1829
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:43,109
going. So that's ultimate target.
[snorts]

1830
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119

 

1831
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,790

Can we get long here? No, I would not

1832
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:44,800
Can we get long here? No, I would not
 

1833
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,550
Can we get long here? No, I would not
advise getting long here. You need now a

1834
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:46,560
advise getting long here. You need now a
 

1835
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,150
advise getting long here. You need now a
breakout and a pullback that holds. You

1836
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:48,160
breakout and a pullback that holds. You
 

1837
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,510
breakout and a pullback that holds. You
don't want to you do not want to get

1838
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:49,520
don't want to you do not want to get
 

1839
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,990
don't want to you do not want to get
long, right? Think about this move here.

1840
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,000
long, right? Think about this move here.
 

1841
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,270
long, right? Think about this move here.
All the dips have held. You don't want

1842
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:53,280
All the dips have held. You don't want
 

1843
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,870
All the dips have held. You don't want
to get long into high of day. Yes,

1844
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:54,880
to get long into high of day. Yes,
 

1845
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,069
to get long into high of day. Yes,
there's an argument. It will squeeze

1846
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:56,079
there's an argument. It will squeeze
 

1847
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,910
there's an argument. It will squeeze
higher. But your location there is not

1848
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,920
higher. But your location there is not
 

1849
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,349
higher. But your location there is not
very good for the longs. It's the same

1850
00:44:59,349 --> 00:44:59,359
very good for the longs. It's the same
 

1851
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,950
very good for the longs. It's the same
reason I didn't long at the open. We

1852
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
reason I didn't long at the open. We
 

1853
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,349
reason I didn't long at the open. We
waited for this, didn't we? I said, I'm

We got a little bit of an imbalance. You

1912
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
We got a little bit of an imbalance. You
 

1913
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,990
We got a little bit of an imbalance. You
want buyers to absorb now into 26,07.

1915
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,349

Ideally 26,09 but 26,07

1921
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,550

Ideally, we just squeeze out and we hit

1922
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:34,560
Ideally, we just squeeze out and we hit
 

1923
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,710
Ideally, we just squeeze out and we hit
our target before we get into this 10:00

1924
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:36,720
our target before we get into this 10:00

Give me the target before the news and
then we can just hold a tiny piece in

1930
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
then we can just hold a tiny piece in
 

1931
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,589
then we can just hold a tiny piece in
case. Remember, I'm trying to get into

1932
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
case. Remember, I'm trying to get into
 

1933
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,750
case. Remember, I'm trying to get into
here. Squeeze above this. I will look

1934
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:45,760
here. Squeeze above this. I will look
 

1935
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,470
here. Squeeze above this. I will look
for this next red box. Right. We now

1936
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:48,480
for this next red box. Right. We now
 

1937
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,190
for this next red box. Right. We now
want buyers must defend this. We do not

1938
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
want buyers must defend this. We do not
 

1939
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,870
want buyers must defend this. We do not
want acceptance under this. We want

1940
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:52,880
want acceptance under this. We want
 

1941
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,349
want acceptance under this. We want
this. Ideally, just take this out. Don't

1942
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
this. Ideally, just take this out. Don't
 

1943
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,790
this. Ideally, just take this out. Don't
be a dick for a tick, by the way. All

1944
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
be a dick for a tick, by the way. All
 

1945
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,550
be a dick for a tick, by the way. All
right. If you want to take like most of

1946
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
right. If you want to take like most of
 

1947
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,470
right. If you want to take like most of
your profit here, like 80%, take it off.

1948
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:00,480
your profit here, like 80%, take it off.
 

1949
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,630
your profit here, like 80%, take it off.
And then I'm going to look to see if we

1950
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
And then I'm going to look to see if we
 

1951
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,390
And then I'm going to look to see if we
use these stops. If we get all these

1952
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:04,400
use these stops. If we get all these
 

1953
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,390
use these stops. If we get all these
stops run, we might get an absurd

1954
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:06,400
stops run, we might get an absurd
 

1955
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,750
stops run, we might get an absurd
squeeze out into here, which would be

1956
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:07,760
squeeze out into here, which would be
 

1957
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,309
squeeze out into here, which would be
fantastic. All right. So, but my stop

1958
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:10,319
fantastic. All right. So, but my stop
 

1959
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,910
fantastic. All right. So, but my stop
now, I will be defending this level

1960
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:11,920
now, I will be defending this level
 

1961
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,270
now, I will be defending this level
here. I do not want to see 26,7 go. So,

1962
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
here. I do not want to see 26,7 go. So,
 

1963
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,069
here. I do not want to see 26,7 go. So,
at least move it to 26,000. Here we go.

1964
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:18,079
at least move it to 26,000. Here we go.

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,150
trading well now, wait until we get into
a protrend. And yesterday was the first

2002
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,160
a protrend. And yesterday was the first
 

2003
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,990
a protrend. And yesterday was the first
day we got protrend on the breakout, and

2004
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
day we got protrend on the breakout, and
 

2005
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,589
day we got protrend on the breakout, and
today we're getting the same kind of

2006
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
today we're getting the same kind of
 

2007
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,550
today we're getting the same kind of
move. So much easier. I cannot tell you

I want you to understand how we move and

2036
00:48:59,430 --> 00:48:59,440
I want you to understand how we move and
 

2037
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,109
I want you to understand how we move and
why we move. All right. That's that's

2038
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:01,119
why we move. All right. That's that's
 

2039
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,549
why we move. All right. That's that's
all that really matters. Even if you

2040
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
all that really matters. Even if you
 

2041
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,109
all that really matters. Even if you
didn't catch this today, you understand

2042
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,119
didn't catch this today, you understand
 

2043
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,990
didn't catch this today, you understand
how we move and why we move.

2044
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,000

 

2045
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,829

Inside bar trigger. It wasn't really an

2046
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
Inside bar trigger. It wasn't really an
 

2047
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,910
Inside bar trigger. It wasn't really an
inside bar trigger today. um because we

2048
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:13,920
inside bar trigger today. um because we
 

2049
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,510
inside bar trigger today. um because we
were actually opening up outside, right?

2050
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:15,520
were actually opening up outside, right?
 

2051
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,230
were actually opening up outside, right?
So, it was a continuation. All it was

2052
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:18,240
So, it was a continuation. All it was
 

2053
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,030
So, it was a continuation. All it was
was,

2054
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,040
was,
 

2055
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,470
was,
let me just move this up and try and

2056
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:22,480
let me just move this up and try and
 

2057
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,670
let me just move this up and try and
manage it if I'm going to teach you. All

2058
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:23,680
manage it if I'm going to teach you. All
 

2059
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,190
manage it if I'm going to teach you. All
right. If you were here the last few

2060
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
right. If you were here the last few
 

2061
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,630
right. If you were here the last few
days, you will know that we talked

2062
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,640
days, you will know that we talked
 

2063
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,230
days, you will know that we talked
about,

2064
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,240
about,
 

2065
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,630
about,
right? If a daily is starting to do

2066
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640
right? If a daily is starting to do
 

2067
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,150
right? If a daily is starting to do
this,

2068
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,160
this,
 

2069
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,910
this,
an hourly is doing this,

2070
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920

 

2071
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,670

and like a five minute or one minute is

2072
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:39,680
and like a five minute or one minute is
 

2073
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:47,510
and like a five minute or one minute is
doing this, right?

2074
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520

 

2075
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,069

Does that make sense? Right? We were at

2076
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
Does that make sense? Right? We were at
 

2077
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,950
Does that make sense? Right? We were at
this point. We were here today. Right?

2078
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960
this point. We were here today. Right?
 

2079
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,990
this point. We were here today. Right?
So, we were opening up here. The morning

2080
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:56,000
So, we were opening up here. The morning
 

2081
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,069
So, we were opening up here. The morning
pullback was this. We were looking to

2082
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
pullback was this. We were looking to
 

2083
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,710
pullback was this. We were looking to
buy this, buy this, buy this. Right? We

2084
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:00,720
buy this, buy this, buy this. Right? We
 

2085
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,790
buy this, buy this, buy this. Right? We
wanted this pullback, this pullback to

2086
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:02,800
wanted this pullback, this pullback to
 

2087
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,870
wanted this pullback, this pullback to
continue higher. All right? That's what

2088
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:04,880
continue higher. All right? That's what
 

2089
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,109
continue higher. All right? That's what
we were looking to do today off a key

2090
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:07,119
we were looking to do today off a key
 

2091
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,270
we were looking to do today off a key
level. All right? So, we had a support

2092
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,280
level. All right? So, we had a support
 

2093
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,549
level. All right? So, we had a support
system here to buy off, right? Based on

2094
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:12,559
system here to buy off, right? Based on
 

2095
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,990
system here to buy off, right? Based on
the previous day, there was a support

2096
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:14,000
the previous day, there was a support
 

2097
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,589
the previous day, there was a support
system here to buy off based on the

2098
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599
system here to buy off based on the
 

2099
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,710
system here to buy off based on the
previous day. So, we were playing the

2100
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:16,720
previous day. So, we were playing the
 

2101
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,790
previous day. So, we were playing the
lower time frame. Pull back in, get

2102
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:18,800
lower time frame. Pull back in, get
 

2103
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,630
lower time frame. Pull back in, get
long. Let's go. All right. What did that

2104
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,640
long. Let's go. All right. What did that
 

2105
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,030
long. Let's go. All right. What did that
look like?

2106
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,040
look like?
 

2107
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:38,549
look like?
If we zoom this out to like an hourly.

2108
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:38,559

 

2109
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,630

Let's draw out what this hourly look

2110
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:40,640
Let's draw out what this hourly look
 

2111
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,670
Let's draw out what this hourly look
like.

2112
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680

 

2113
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,589

So, where's the pullback long? Here it

2114
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:47,599
So, where's the pullback long? Here it
 

2115
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,910
So, where's the pullback long? Here it
is. Where did we get long? After we

2116
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
is. Where did we get long? After we
 

2117
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,670
is. Where did we get long? After we
confirmed and held that, where are we

2118
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:51,680
confirmed and held that, where are we
 

2119
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,349
confirmed and held that, where are we
looking for? break a structure into

2120
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:53,359
looking for? break a structure into
 

2121
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,030
looking for? break a structure into
these. Right? It's super simple, right?

2122
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
these. Right? It's super simple, right?
 

2123
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,270
these. Right? It's super simple, right?
We get long here for this move here. If

2124
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,280
We get long here for this move here. If
 

2125
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,950
We get long here for this move here. If
it didn't hold there, we'd get long

2126
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
it didn't hold there, we'd get long
 

2127
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,630
it didn't hold there, we'd get long
here. If it didn't hold there, we would

2128
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,640
here. If it didn't hold there, we would
 

2129
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,230
here. If it didn't hold there, we would
have probably got short there and then

2130
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
have probably got short there and then
 

2131
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,990
have probably got short there and then
got long here for the protrend. But the

2132
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,000
got long here for the protrend. But the
 

2133
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,230
got long here for the protrend. But the
protrend, look how we're moving. Doom

2134
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,240
protrend, look how we're moving. Doom
 

2135
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,390
protrend, look how we're moving. Doom
doom doom. We're going to expect higher

2136
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:10,400
doom doom. We're going to expect higher
 

2137
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,750
doom doom. We're going to expect higher
until it proves otherwise.

2138
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:15,760

 

2139
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,430

Right? So, if they base over this now,

2140
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:17,440
Right? So, if they base over this now,
 

2141
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,030
Right? So, if they base over this now,
the last chance is a squeeze up. You've

2142
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,040
the last chance is a squeeze up. You've
 

2143
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,390
the last chance is a squeeze up. You've
got news coming in here. I would move

2144
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400
got news coming in here. I would move
 

2145
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,069
got news coming in here. I would move
your stop nice and tight now if I was

2146
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
your stop nice and tight now if I was
 

2147
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,510
your stop nice and tight now if I was
you. You do not want to get wicked out

2148
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:23,520
you. You do not want to get wicked out
 

2149
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,069
you. You do not want to get wicked out
on news.

2150
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:26,079
on news.
 

2151
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,910
on news.
We have just had the low hanging fruit.

2152
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
We have just had the low hanging fruit.
 

2153
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,270
We have just had the low hanging fruit.
The only thing left is all the way up

2154
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,280
The only thing left is all the way up
 

2155
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:36,390
The only thing left is all the way up
here. Either way, we're locking it in.

2156

into some of the MAG. Why? Because we've

2308
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:33,760
into some of the MAG. Why? Because we've
 

2309
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,030
into some of the MAG. Why? Because we've
got earnings this week. So, they're

2310
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,040
got earnings this week. So, they're
 

2311
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,470
got earnings this week. So, they're
putting some risk on into earnings.

2312
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:36,480
putting some risk on into earnings.
 

2313
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,750
putting some risk on into earnings.
They're positioning themselves into

2314
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:37,760
They're positioning themselves into
 

2315
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,270
They're positioning themselves into
earnings in case we have blowout

2316
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,280
earnings in case we have blowout
 

2317
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,950
earnings in case we have blowout
earnings. Because if we do have blowout

2318
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
earnings. Because if we do have blowout
 

2319
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,950
earnings. Because if we do have blowout
earnings, then there's a good chance NQ

00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,960
earnings, then there's a good chance NQ
 

2321

2328
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:53,119

2329
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,510

this morning. All right? Even if we're

00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
this morning. All right? Even if we're
 

2331
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,030
this morning. All right? Even if we're
just going to be an efficient market and

2332
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,040
just going to be an efficient market and
 

2333
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,109
just going to be an efficient market and
fail, there's a reason for the market to

2334
00:55:59,109 --> 00:55:59,119
fail, there's a reason for the market to
 

2335
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,430
fail, there's a reason for the market to
try and come up to 32 to fill this old

2336
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:01,440
try and come up to 32 to fill this old
 

2337
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,829

Maybe the market then fails there. Maybe

2340
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
Maybe the market then fails there. Maybe
 

2341
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,190
Maybe the market then fails there. Maybe
it's just trying to be efficient and we

2342
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
it's just trying to be efficient and we
 

2343
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,390
it's just trying to be efficient and we
get an alltime fail, a huge stop hunt,

00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,400
get an alltime fail, a huge stop hunt,
 

2345

fill the gap and fail. I don't know. But

00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
fill the gap and fail. I don't know. But
 

2347
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,309
fill the gap and fail. I don't know. But
all I do know is we are positioned long

2471
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,670
front of 55 for this move down here.
Buyers will want to absorb this big fat

2472
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:39,680
Buyers will want to absorb this big fat
 

2473
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,789
Buyers will want to absorb this big fat
block here. Remember when we were here,

2474
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
block here. Remember when we were here,
 

2475
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,069
block here. Remember when we were here,
I said, "Come on, I don't want to be

2476
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:42,079
I said, "Come on, I don't want to be
 

2477
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,230
I said, "Come on, I don't want to be
here too long because in here, we can do

2478
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:44,240
here too long because in here, we can do
 

2479
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,150
here too long because in here, we can do
this." But again, what have we done

2480
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,160
this." But again, what have we done
 

2481
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,549
this." But again, what have we done
today? Lowhanging fruit. Boom. Boom.

2482
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:48,559
today? Lowhanging fruit. Boom. Boom.
 

2483
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,069
today? Lowhanging fruit. Boom. Boom.
Just like yesterday, low hanging fruit

00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:50,079
Just like yesterday, low hanging fruit
 

2485
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,230
Just like yesterday, low hanging fruit
trade.

2486
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:52,240
trade.
 

2487
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,069
trade.
Money's made, right? Most of you should

2488
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:54,079
Money's made, right? Most of you should
 

2489

have made your money. And we can see
what else we set up with now.

2492
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:03,920

 

2493
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,069

only verbal abuse because that's what

2494
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:06,079
only verbal abuse because that's what
 

2495
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,870
only verbal abuse because that's what
he's into. I don't know talking about

2496
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:08,880
he's into. I don't know talking about
 

2497
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,190
he's into. I don't know talking about
Alex, you showed the trapped sellers

2498
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:11,200
Alex, you showed the trapped sellers
 

2499
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,950
Alex, you showed the trapped sellers
when they entered the trade. I think you

2500
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:12,960
when they entered the trade. I think you
 

2501
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,549
when they entered the trade. I think you
mentioned that it didn't look great, but

2502
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:14,559
mentioned that it didn't look great, but
 

2503
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,150
mentioned that it didn't look great, but
it was good enough. What was the trigger

2504
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,160
it was good enough. What was the trigger
 

2505
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,150
it was good enough. What was the trigger
at 40? The 40 was the trigger because

2506
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:18,160
at 40? The 40 was the trigger because
 

2507
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,349
at 40? The 40 was the trigger because
that's where the uh sellers were caught,

2508
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
that's where the uh sellers were caught,
 

2509
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,390
that's where the uh sellers were caught,
right? So if you if you look down there

2510
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:24,400
right? So if you if you look down there
 

2511
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,030
right? So if you if you look down there
at the time, we had a big big selling

2512
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:27,040
at the time, we had a big big selling
 

2513
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,349
at the time, we had a big big selling
coming in underneath. Well, at the time

2514
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:29,359
coming in underneath. Well, at the time
 

2515
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,349
coming in underneath. Well, at the time
it was like 30 and under was big

2516
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:31,359
it was like 30 and under was big
 

2517
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,870
it was like 30 and under was big
selling. In fact, let me just get you on

2518
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
selling. In fact, let me just get you on
 

2519
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:42,230
selling. In fact, let me just get you on
here and then just show you.

2520
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,240

 

2521
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,829

All right, this right here, right, this

2522
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:45,839
All right, this right here, right, this
 

2523
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,470
All right, this right here, right, this
was the aggressive selling delta

2524
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,480
was the aggressive selling delta
 

2525
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,510
was the aggressive selling delta
all here.

2526
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,520

 

2527
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,270

The reason I didn't like the low of day

2528
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:55,280
The reason I didn't like the low of day
 

2529
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,270
The reason I didn't like the low of day
was I would have rather this been sell

2530
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:57,280
was I would have rather this been sell
 

2531
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,670
was I would have rather this been sell
as well with a passive buyer rather than

2532
00:59:59,670 --> 00:59:59,680
as well with a passive buyer rather than
 

2533
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,349
as well with a passive buyer rather than
just a turnaround. But you know they

2534
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:01,359
just a turnaround. But you know they
 

2535
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,349
just a turnaround. But you know they
obviously got caught. So if we look at

2536
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:03,359
obviously got caught. So if we look at
 

2537
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,589
obviously got caught. So if we look at
here 40s right all of this most of this

2538
01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:07,599
here 40s right all of this most of this
 

2539
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,829
here 40s right all of this most of this
is sell volume under here. We're

2540
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
is sell volume under here. We're
 

2541
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,510
is sell volume under here. We're
absorbing the tape once we broke over

2542
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:11,520
absorbing the tape once we broke over
 

2543
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,190
absorbing the tape once we broke over
and held. That was your confirmation as

2544
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,200
and held. That was your confirmation as
 

2545
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,950
and held. That was your confirmation as
well. Selling here got caught again at

2546
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:14,960
well. Selling here got caught again at
 

2547
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,030
well. Selling here got caught again at
the low of this candle. So trap sellers

2548
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,040
the low of this candle. So trap sellers
 

2549
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,789
the low of this candle. So trap sellers
here. some trap sellers here trying to

2550
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:18,799
here. some trap sellers here trying to
 

2551
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,710
here. some trap sellers here trying to
force that rotation back down in and

2552
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
force that rotation back down in and
 

2553
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,589
force that rotation back down in and
then we trade away from it. All right,

2554
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
then we trade away from it. All right,
 

2555
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,670
then we trade away from it. All right,
we're coming right back up to those 53s

2556
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:25,680
we're coming right back up to those 53s
 

2557
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,150
we're coming right back up to those 53s
that we just talked about.

2558
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
that we just talked about.
 

2559
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,750
that we just talked about.
All right, this imbalance, you can see

2560
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
All right, this imbalance, you can see
 

2561
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,589
All right, this imbalance, you can see
where they stepped in 53s. There you go.

2562
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:31,599
where they stepped in 53s. There you go.
 

2563
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,030
where they stepped in 53s. There you go.
We just talked about it. So, here's your

2564
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,040
We just talked about it. So, here's your
 

2565
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,750
We just talked about it. So, here's your
sell side imbalance into here. Sellers

2566
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:35,760
sell side imbalance into here. Sellers
 

2567
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,990
sell side imbalance into here. Sellers
will want to defend 53s. If they fail to

2568
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,000
will want to defend 53s. If they fail to
 

2569
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,030
will want to defend 53s. If they fail to
defend 53s, all right, then this is

2570
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,040
defend 53s, all right, then this is
 

2571
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,829
defend 53s, all right, then this is
possible up to the 26,000 and 26,045s,

2572
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:45,839
possible up to the 26,000 and 26,045s,
 

2573
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,510
possible up to the 26,000 and 26,045s,
is it? or 49s, can't remember. I'm going

2574
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
is it? or 49s, can't remember. I'm going
 

2575
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,789
is it? or 49s, can't remember. I'm going
to have to look on the other chart.

2576
01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:48,799
to have to look on the other chart.
 

2577
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,789
to have to look on the other chart.
Right. So, sellers will want to defend

2578
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:50,799
Right. So, sellers will want to defend
 

2579
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,630
Right. So, sellers will want to defend
this area here. If we make that make

2580
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:52,640
this area here. If we make that make
 

2581
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,390
this area here. If we make that make
sense with volume, the gray box, right?

2582
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
sense with volume, the gray box, right?
 

2583
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,870
sense with volume, the gray box, right?
Sellers will want to defend up to 53s.

2584
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
Sellers will want to defend up to 53s.
 

2585
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,430
Sellers will want to defend up to 53s.
We can do it here. There you go. Up to

2586
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,440
We can do it here. There you go. Up to
 

2587
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,589
We can do it here. There you go. Up to
53. Sellers must defend this. If they

2588
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
53. Sellers must defend this. If they
 

2589
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,430
53. Sellers must defend this. If they
fail to defend that, there's a bigger

2590
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:03,440
fail to defend that, there's a bigger
 

2591
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,670
fail to defend that, there's a bigger
squeeze for 26,100,

2592
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
squeeze for 26,100,
 

2593
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,230
squeeze for 26,100,
26,45s.

2594
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:08,240
26,45s.
 

2595
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:15,030
26,45s.
All right.

2596
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:15,040

 

2597
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,710

Do you anchor your volume profile to

2598
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:16,720
Do you anchor your volume profile to
 

2599
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,990
Do you anchor your volume profile to
9:30 every day or just let it rip? So 9

2600
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:20,000
9:30 every day or just let it rip? So 9
 

2601
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,630
9:30 every day or just let it rip? So 9
9:30 each day for the current developing

2602
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:22,640
9:30 each day for the current developing
 

2603
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,750
9:30 each day for the current developing
profile and then for the daily

2604
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:25,760
profile and then for the daily
 

2605
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,589
profile and then for the daily
developing profile and then I do the

2606
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:27,599
developing profile and then I do the
 

2607
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,109
developing profile and then I do the
Sunday open uh each week for the weekly

2608
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:31,119
Sunday open uh each week for the weekly
 

2609
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,710
Sunday open uh each week for the weekly
developing profile. So if you have a

2610
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:32,720
developing profile. So if you have a
 

2611
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,510
developing profile. So if you have a
look right now,

2612
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:35,520
look right now,
 

2613
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,829
look right now,
here we go. Squeeze is on here folks. If

2614
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:37,839
here we go. Squeeze is on here folks. If
 

2615
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:42,069
here we go. Squeeze is on here folks. If
you have a look right now, right, this

2616
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:42,079
you have a look right now, right, this
 

2617
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,390
you have a look right now, right, this
is your probably should have traded off

2618
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:44,400
is your probably should have traded off
 

2619
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,829
is your probably should have traded off
that. I've only just noticed that. That

2620
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:45,839
that. I've only just noticed that. That
 

2621
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,109
that. I've only just noticed that. That
is my bad. This is the current

2622
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:47,119
is my bad. This is the current
 

2623
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,950
is my bad. This is the current
developing weekly profile, right? And

2624
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:48,960
developing weekly profile, right? And
 

2625
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,789
developing weekly profile, right? And
we've just held that dip into the weekly

2626
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
we've just held that dip into the weekly
 

2627
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,630
we've just held that dip into the weekly
profile value area high. So, they're

2628
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:52,640
profile value area high. So, they're
 

2629
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,710
profile value area high. So, they're
trying to come into here now. Probably

2630
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:54,720
trying to come into here now. Probably
 

2631
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,670
trying to come into here now. Probably
should have just added in that. That is

2632
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:57,680
should have just added in that. That is
 

2633
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,510
should have just added in that. That is
actually pretty poor for me. I didn't

2634
01:01:59,510 --> 01:01:59,520
actually pretty poor for me. I didn't
 

2635
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,630
actually pretty poor for me. I didn't
notice it until just now. Anyways, is

2636
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:02,640
notice it until just now. Anyways, is
 

2637
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,470
notice it until just now. Anyways, is
what it is. So, they're trying to Now we

2638
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:04,480
what it is. So, they're trying to Now we
 

2639
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,670
what it is. So, they're trying to Now we
we got to be careful because you're in

2640
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:05,680
we got to be careful because you're in
 

2641
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,670
we got to be careful because you're in
three drives here. One, two, three. So,

2642
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,680
three drives here. One, two, three. So,
 

2643
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,750
three drives here. One, two, three. So,
at some point you might see that repull

2644
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:09,760
at some point you might see that repull
 

2645
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,510
at some point you might see that repull
down again, but these these are the

2646
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520
down again, but these these are the
 

2647
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:17,430
down again, but these these are the
targets now. Red boxes are the targets.

2648
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:17,440

 

2649
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,270

Here's the resqueeze. Here we go. All

2650
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,280
Here's the resqueeze. Here we go. All
 

2651
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,270
Here's the resqueeze. Here we go. All
right. So, it's on. It's on like Donkey

2652
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,280
right. So, it's on. It's on like Donkey
 

2653
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,950
right. So, it's on. It's on like Donkey
Kong today. It's on like Donkey Kong.

2654
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:26,960

 

2655
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,630

It is on like Donkey Kong. Yeah, you

2656
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640
It is on like Donkey Kong. Yeah, you
 

2657
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,829
It is on like Donkey Kong. Yeah, you
could have gone long down here in the

2658
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:29,839
could have gone long down here in the
 

2659
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,190
could have gone long down here in the
flow zones. You could have gone long on

2660
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,200
flow zones. You could have gone long on
 

2661
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,870
flow zones. You could have gone long on
the reclaim. If they especially if they

2662
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,880
the reclaim. If they especially if they
 

2663
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,430
the reclaim. If they especially if they
hold now if they now hold this level I

2664
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,440
hold now if they now hold this level I
 

2665
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,549
hold now if they now hold this level I
think they're just going to squeeze this

2666
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559
think they're just going to squeeze this
 

2667
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,309
think they're just going to squeeze this
high now. Every the shorts are so caught

2668
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:38,319
high now. Every the shorts are so caught
 

2669
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:44,318
high now. Every the shorts are so caught
here. They're trying to fight the tape.

2670
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:44,328

 

2671
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:47,750

[snorts]

2672
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:47,760

 

2673
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,750

This is the best process focus stream

2674
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:49,760
This is the best process focus stream
 

2675
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,270
This is the best process focus stream
I've landed on today. Thanks again. Oh,

2676
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,280
I've landed on today. Thanks again. Oh,
 

2677
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,549
I've landed on today. Thanks again. Oh,
thanks for joining. Thanks for the kind

01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:52,559
thanks for joining. Thanks for the kind
 

2679

thanks for joining. Thanks for the kind
words. Alex, is there a way to recognize

2680
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:55,440
words. Alex, is there a way to recognize
 

2681
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,430
words. Alex, is there a way to recognize
trap participants on a candle chart or

2682
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:57,440
trap participants on a candle chart or
 

2683
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,630
trap participants on a candle chart or
does that require reading of the

2684
01:02:58,630 --> 01:02:58,640
does that require reading of the
 

2685
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,670
does that require reading of the
footprint? Yeah, not really. um Rome

2686
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
footprint? Yeah, not really. um Rome
 

2687
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,270
footprint? Yeah, not really. um Rome
very hard to see that on a candle chart

2688
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:03,280
very hard to see that on a candle chart
 

2689
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,470
very hard to see that on a candle chart
because you don't have the information

2690
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,480
because you don't have the information
 

2691
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,750
because you don't have the information
within it. Um so you can understand that

2692
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:07,760
within it. Um so you can understand that
 

2693
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,589
within it. Um so you can understand that
like we pivot over this you can make the

2694
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
like we pivot over this you can make the
 

2695
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,190
like we pivot over this you can make the
assumption but you can't see the

2696
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:11,200
assumption but you can't see the
 

2697
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,910
assumption but you can't see the
specific levels within it right so but

2698
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:13,920
specific levels within it right so but
 

2699
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,349
specific levels within it right so but
like candles are still useful but you

2700
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:15,359
like candles are still useful but you
 

2701
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,109
like candles are still useful but you
just can't see the specific levels you

2702
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:17,119
just can't see the specific levels you
 

2703
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,750
just can't see the specific levels you
see a lot of sellers stepping up here 75

2704
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:19,760
see a lot of sellers stepping up here 75
 

2705
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,870
see a lot of sellers stepping up here 75
80 85s you can see it on bookmap above

2706
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:22,880
80 85s you can see it on bookmap above
 

2707
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,029
80 85s you can see it on bookmap above
me right now all right lots of sellers

2708
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
me right now all right lots of sellers
 

2709
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,990
me right now all right lots of sellers
trying to defend this area right right

2710
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:28,000
trying to defend this area right right
 

2711
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,750
trying to defend this area right right
here you can see it but we if we keep

2712
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:29,760
here you can see it but we if we keep
 

2713
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,430
here you can see it but we if we keep
adding liquidity let's have a look above

2714
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
adding liquidity let's have a look above
 

2715
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,109
adding liquidity let's have a look above
if we're into key levels yet they're

2716
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:33,119
if we're into key levels yet they're
 

2717
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,150
if we're into key levels yet they're
still up there let's see if there's

2718
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
still up there let's see if there's
 

2719
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:38,390
still up there let's see if there's
anyone at 145 5s there is right 135 145

2720
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
anyone at 145 5s there is right 135 145
 

2721
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,470
anyone at 145 5s there is right 135 145
even above. So we're trying to drive

2722
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:40,480
even above. So we're trying to drive
 

2723
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,589
even above. So we're trying to drive
higher today but you can see these

2724
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
higher today but you can see these
 

2725
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,349
higher today but you can see these
sellers here starting to stack up. So

2726
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
sellers here starting to stack up. So
 

2727
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,390
sellers here starting to stack up. So
next push into there you probably

2728
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,400
next push into there you probably
 

2729
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,069
next push into there you probably
wouldn't be a bad idea to take profit if

2730
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:48,079
wouldn't be a bad idea to take profit if
 

2731
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,789
wouldn't be a bad idea to take profit if
you just retook this long. Not all of it

2732
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
you just retook this long. Not all of it
 

2733
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,109
you just retook this long. Not all of it
but like lock some in. I'm not in this

2734
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:53,119
but like lock some in. I'm not in this
 

2735
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,789
but like lock some in. I'm not in this
anymore folks. Like I said if this dip

2736
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:54,799
anymore folks. Like I said if this dip
 

2737
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,430
anymore folks. Like I said if this dip
holds you could argue there's a reason

2738
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:57,440
holds you could argue there's a reason
 

2739
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,750
holds you could argue there's a reason
to get long here if this dip holds. But

2740
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
to get long here if this dip holds. But
 

2741
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,870
to get long here if this dip holds. But
we are we would be buying very very high

2742
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:02,880
we are we would be buying very very high
 

2743
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,230
we are we would be buying very very high
in premium now.

2744
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:06,240
in premium now.
 

2745
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,670
in premium now.
bit like yesterday if you remember

2746
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
bit like yesterday if you remember
 

2747
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:12,470
bit like yesterday if you remember
yesterday. Same kind of story.

2748
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480

 

2749
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,470

Um,

2750
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:14,480
Um,
 

2751
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:24,549
Um,
it's all right. It's all right.

2752
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:24,559

 

2753
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,870

There's another naked PC. Is there on

2754
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:26,880
There's another naked PC. Is there on
 

2755
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,710
There's another naked PC. Is there on
ES710? Okay, that's good to know.

2756
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
ES710? Okay, that's good to know.
 

2757
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,150
ES710? Okay, that's good to know.
Thanks, mate. I haven't got that marked

What time frame is the footprint chart?

2817
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,670
they're going to do, right? Let's just
deal with it when it happens. We don't

01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:35,680
deal with it when it happens. We don't
 

2819
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,670

um it's not as accurate. You can't zoom
 

2917
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,789
um it's not as accurate. You can't zoom
in and zoom out, but if you're just

2918
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
in and zoom out, but if you're just
 

2919
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,789
in and zoom out, but if you're just
looking for the levels of where passive

2920
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
looking for the levels of where passive
 

2921
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,349
looking for the levels of where passive
participants are, it can be very useful,

2922
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
participants are, it can be very useful,
 

2923
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,630
participants are, it can be very useful,
especially if you're just starting to

2924
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,640
especially if you're just starting to
 

2925
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,230
especially if you're just starting to
learn.

2926
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,240
learn.
 

2927
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,990

Weeble just added a footprint feature on

2928
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:48,000
Weeble just added a footprint feature on
 

2929
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,270
Weeble just added a footprint feature on
desktop app. Oh, nice.

2930
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:51,280
desktop app. Oh, nice.
 

2931
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,750
desktop app. Oh, nice.
Yeah, I think I still like Weeble. Like

2932
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:53,760
Yeah, I think I still like Weeble. Like
 

2933
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,190
Yeah, I think I still like Weeble. Like
I want to buy them cheap. I think uh

2934
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:57,200
I want to buy them cheap. I think uh
 

2935
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,630
I want to buy them cheap. I think uh
there's an argument to buy them.

2936
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:58,640
there's an argument to buy them.
 

2937
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,789
there's an argument to buy them.
Currently trading at 762s today. I've

2938
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
Currently trading at 762s today. I've
 

2939
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,270
Currently trading at 762s today. I've
always got them on my watch list.

2940
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:03,280
always got them on my watch list.
 

2941
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,870
always got them on my watch list.
All right, still holding here. There is

2942
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:04,880
All right, still holding here. There is
 

2943
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,470
All right, still holding here. There is
still an argument for this to base and

2944
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:06,480
still an argument for this to base and
 

2945
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,430
still an argument for this to base and
go higher. All right. So 26,100 26,55.

2946
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:11,440
go higher. All right. So 26,100 26,55.
 

2947
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,109
go higher. All right. So 26,100 26,55.
So again, I'm not buying up here. I'm

2948
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
So again, I'm not buying up here. I'm
 

2949
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,109
So again, I'm not buying up here. I'm
out of position now. We we got this long

2950
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:15,119
out of position now. We we got this long
 

2951
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,030
out of position now. We we got this long
from down here to here. We just wait now

2952
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,040
from down here to here. We just wait now
 

2953
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,110
from down here to here. We just wait now
and see.

2954
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:19,120
and see.
 

2955
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,189
and see.
But if if you're if you're interested,

2956
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,199
But if if you're if you're interested,
 

2957
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,630
But if if you're if you're interested,
there's an argument to take here. I

2958
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:22,640
there's an argument to take here. I
 

2959
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,789
there's an argument to take here. I
would just be somewhat cautious. If we

2960
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:24,799
would just be somewhat cautious. If we
 

2961
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,110
would just be somewhat cautious. If we
lose this gray box, right? If we lose

2962
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:27,120
lose this gray box, right? If we lose
 

2963
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,189
lose this gray box, right? If we lose
this gray box, this is where all the

2964
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:29,199
this gray box, this is where all the
 

2965
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:31,349
this gray box, this is where all the
volume will come in. And you'll see this

2966
01:08:31,349 --> 01:08:31,359
volume will come in. And you'll see this
 

2967
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,510
volume will come in. And you'll see this
probably into low volume node. And if

2968
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
probably into low volume node. And if
 

2969
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,789
probably into low volume node. And if
they really want to pivot down into

2970
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
they really want to pivot down into
 

2971
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,870
they really want to pivot down into
these, they will these shelves down

2972
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
these, they will these shelves down
 

2973
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,309
these, they will these shelves down
here. So, this is why you got to be very

2974
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,319
here. So, this is why you got to be very
 

2975
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,070
here. So, this is why you got to be very
careful. If they lose this, there's a

2976
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,080
careful. If they lose this, there's a
 

2977
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,709
careful. If they lose this, there's a
quite a nasty drop in it. But so far,

2978
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:42,719
quite a nasty drop in it. But so far,
 

2979
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,870
quite a nasty drop in it. But so far,
they've done it once, they've reclaimed.

2980
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
they've done it once, they've reclaimed.
 

2981
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,470
they've done it once, they've reclaimed.

get long now. We've hit my targets. I

2986
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,000
get long now. We've hit my targets. I
 

2987
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,669
get long now. We've hit my targets. I
will need uh need to see a lot of

participants trapped to convince me to
 

2991
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,110
participants trapped to convince me to
get long. Now, VIX getting absolutely

2992
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,120
get long. Now, VIX getting absolutely
 

2993
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,510
get long. Now, VIX getting absolutely
crushed. So, remember 1625 we said was

2994
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,520
crushed. So, remember 1625 we said was
 

2995
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,749
crushed. So, remember 1625 we said was
the pivot pivot for VIX to break above

2996
01:08:59,749 --> 01:08:59,759
the pivot pivot for VIX to break above
 

2997
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,110
the pivot pivot for VIX to break above
and hold. This is why it's so important

2998
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:01,120
and hold. This is why it's so important
 

2999
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,070
and hold. This is why it's so important
you understand all these key pivots.

3000
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,080
you understand all these key pivots.
 

3001
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,910
you understand all these key pivots.
1625, we went over this in the

3002
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:05,920
1625, we went over this in the
 

3003
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,510
1625, we went over this in the
pre-market right here. Look what

3004
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
pre-market right here. Look what
 

3005
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,030
pre-market right here. Look what
happened once we got through it. All we

3006
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:09,040
happened once we got through it. All we
 

3007
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,749
happened once we got through it. All we
did was sweep it and then get completely

3008
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:11,759
did was sweep it and then get completely
 

3009
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,349
did was sweep it and then get completely
crushed. All right, this is helping the

3010
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:13,359
crushed. All right, this is helping the
 

3011
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,390

the blue is also passive participants,
 

3099
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,750
the blue is also passive participants,
right? So, anything horizontal is

3100
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:03,760

3107
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,669

market higher. So, you can see he came

3108
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:09,679
market higher. So, you can see he came
 

3109
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,830
market higher. So, you can see he came
in at 70, then 75, then moved to 80.

3110
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:11,840

3116
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:18,719
spoofer up here at 95. So this guy at 95
 

3117

01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,120
on bookmap. How do you tell someone's a
 

3245

3249
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,070
above you, if they're above price,
they're a seller. And if they're below

01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:36,080
they're a seller. And if they're below
 

3251
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,910
they're a seller. And if they're below
price, they're a buyer because you it

3252
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
price, they're a buyer because you it
 

3253

means they're a limit order on the book.

3254
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:39,360
means they're a limit order on the book.
 

3255
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,709
means they're a limit order on the book.
And you can only put a limit order on

3256
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:40,719
And you can only put a limit order on
 

3257
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:53,030
And you can only put a limit order on
the book that way.

3258
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,040

 

3259
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,709

How do you know if the same player

3260
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:54,719
How do you know if the same player
 

3261
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,229
How do you know if the same player
pulling re-entering? It is an

3262
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:56,239
pulling re-entering? It is an
 

3263
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,310
pulling re-entering? It is an
assumption, but you can kind of see it

3264
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:58,320
assumption, but you can kind of see it
 

3265
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,709
assumption, but you can kind of see it
because they come off and they come on

3266
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:00,719
because they come off and they come on
 

3267
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,350
because they come off and they come on
back on at another level with the same

3268
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:03,360
back on at another level with the same
 

3269
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,669
back on at another level with the same
size, right? So, it's like jostling of

3270
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:05,679
size, right? So, it's like jostling of
 

3271
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,630
size, right? So, it's like jostling of
size. So, if I show you

3272
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
size. So, if I show you
 

3273
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,950
size. So, if I show you
here, right? If you see this player

3274
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
here, right? If you see this player
 

3275
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,430
here, right? If you see this player
here, he comes off and he comes back on.

3276
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,440
here, he comes off and he comes back on.
 

3277
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,669
here, he comes off and he comes back on.
So, he's like 15 lot here or something

3278
01:15:15,669 --> 01:15:15,679
So, he's like 15 lot here or something
 

3279
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,590
So, he's like 15 lot here or something
and he comes back on here with like a 15

3280
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:17,600
and he comes back on here with like a 15
 

3281
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,870
and he comes back on here with like a 15
lot. There you go. So, he comes off for

3282
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:18,880
lot. There you go. So, he comes off for
 

3283
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,550
lot. There you go. So, he comes off for
like a couple seconds, he comes back on,

3284
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:20,560
like a couple seconds, he comes back on,
 

3285
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,550
like a couple seconds, he comes back on,
he gets filled here, right? So, these

3286
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560
he gets filled here, right? So, these
 

3287
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,709
he gets filled here, right? So, these
sellers are holding price down at 75. We

3288
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:24,719
sellers are holding price down at 75. We
 

3289
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:25,750
sellers are holding price down at 75. We
talked about this and now you're

3290
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:25,760
talked about this and now you're
 

3291
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,669
talked about this and now you're
starting to get the break below here.

3292
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
starting to get the break below here.
 

3293
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,630
starting to get the break below here.
You need to be very careful here. Now,

3294
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:30,640
You need to be very careful here. Now,
 

3295
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,070
You need to be very careful here. Now,
this is where the sellers need to now

3296
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
this is where the sellers need to now
 

3297
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,830
this is where the sellers need to now
defend. They keep coming in. They're now

3298
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
defend. They keep coming in. They're now
 

3299
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,430
defend. They keep coming in. They're now
attempting to defend it. This is the

3300
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
attempting to defend it. This is the
 

3301
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,510
attempting to defend it. This is the
gray box and they want to see a break

3302
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:37,520
gray box and they want to see a break
 

3303
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,229
gray box and they want to see a break
away from this level. This is where they

3304
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:40,239
away from this level. This is where they
 

3305
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,510
away from this level. This is where they
came in earlier. So, if we make that

3306
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:41,520
came in earlier. So, if we make that
 

3307
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,910
came in earlier. So, if we make that
make sense on here, this is where

3308
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:43,920
make sense on here, this is where
 

3309
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,470
make sense on here, this is where
sellers came in earlier. Remember the

3310
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,480
sellers came in earlier. Remember the
 

3311
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,470
sellers came in earlier. Remember the
53s? They got stuck. We dipped below,

3312
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:48,480
53s? They got stuck. We dipped below,
 

3313
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,630
53s? They got stuck. We dipped below,
they got squeezed out. They will try and

3314
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
they got squeezed out. They will try and
 

3315
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,430
they got squeezed out. They will try and
get under this again to get this move.

3316
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:53,440
get under this again to get this move.
 

3317
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,189
get under this again to get this move.
Buyers will just keep wanting to absorb

3318
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:55,199
Buyers will just keep wanting to absorb
 

3319
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,870
Buyers will just keep wanting to absorb
this. The more sellers that get stuck

3320
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:56,880
this. The more sellers that get stuck
 

3321
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,590
this. The more sellers that get stuck
here without this, the more squeeze

3322
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
here without this, the more squeeze
 

3323
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:24,070
here without this, the more squeeze
potential this market gets.

3324

01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:26,480
happens when they market buy? Well, we
 

3377
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,350
happens when they market buy? Well, we
get increased energy upside. All right,

3378
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:29,360
get increased energy upside. All right,
 

3379
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,510
get increased energy upside. All right,
it's not to say that we don't do that

3380
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520
it's not to say that we don't do that
 

3381
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,669
it's not to say that we don't do that
and then institutions sell that. All

3382
01:17:33,669 --> 01:17:33,679
and then institutions sell that. All
 

3383
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,270
and then institutions sell that. All
right, use the market buyers to sell

3384
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
right, use the market buyers to sell
 

3385
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,590
right, use the market buyers to sell
into and rotate back down. But we we're

3386
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:37,600
into and rotate back down. But we we're
 

3387
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,790
into and rotate back down. But we we're
not going to be the guys picking the

3388
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:38,800
not going to be the guys picking the
 

3389
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,470
not going to be the guys picking the
top. We let the institutions do that. If

3390
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:40,480
top. We let the institutions do that. If
 

3391
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,990
top. We let the institutions do that. If
they want to do that move there, we're

3392
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,000
they want to do that move there, we're
 

3393
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,430
they want to do that move there, we're
joining it after a failed breakout.

3394
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
joining it after a failed breakout.
 

3395
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,990
joining it after a failed breakout.
Well, right now what we know is that we

3396
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:46,000
Well, right now what we know is that we
 

3397
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,630
Well, right now what we know is that we
ran stops down here. We reclaimed this

3398
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:48,640
ran stops down here. We reclaimed this
 

3399
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,910
ran stops down here. We reclaimed this
week. We reclaimed SMAs. We are heading

3400
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:51,920
week. We reclaimed SMAs. We are heading
 

3401
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,070
week. We reclaimed SMAs. We are heading
for these stops. All right? And if they

3402
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:54,080
for these stops. All right? And if they
 

3403
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,910
for these stops. All right? And if they
get above and base and we are going to

3404
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
get above and base and we are going to
 

3405
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,350
get above and base and we are going to
go because we've got a huge amount. We

3406
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:57,360
go because we've got a huge amount. We
 

3407
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,550
go because we've got a huge amount. We
talked about it yesterday. Think about

3408
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,560
talked about it yesterday. Think about
 

3409
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,910
talked about it yesterday. Think about
this market as boxed in basically in

3410
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
this market as boxed in basically in
 

3411
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,590
this market as boxed in basically in
let's just call it here. All right?

3412
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
let's just call it here. All right?
 

3413
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,189
let's just call it here. All right?
We're boxed in in there or certainly to

3414
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:05,199
We're boxed in in there or certainly to
 

3415
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,189
We're boxed in in there or certainly to
here. All right. Since November. Look

3416
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:07,199
here. All right. Since November. Look
 

3417
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,750
here. All right. Since November. Look
below, fail, reclaim. Look below, fail,

3418
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
below, fail, reclaim. Look below, fail,
 

3419
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,030
below, fail, reclaim. Look below, fail,
reclaim. top side, bottom side, top

3420
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
reclaim. top side, bottom side, top
 

3421
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,430
reclaim. top side, bottom side, top
side. If we break out over here,

3422
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440
side. If we break out over here,
 

3423
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,430
side. If we break out over here,
everyone who's short in here is going to

3424
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:17,440
everyone who's short in here is going to
 

3425
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,350
everyone who's short in here is going to
get stuck, which means we are likely to

3426
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:19,360
get stuck, which means we are likely to
 

3427
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,270
get stuck, which means we are likely to
get some upside energy. Now, the only

3428
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:21,280
get some upside energy. Now, the only
 

3429
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,270
get some upside energy. Now, the only
way that will fail is if institutional

3430
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,280
way that will fail is if institutional
 

3431
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,790
way that will fail is if institutional
sellers, right, position, let's say we

3432
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:28,800
sellers, right, position, let's say we
 

3433
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,669
sellers, right, position, let's say we
have all three months worth of energy go

3434
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:31,679
have all three months worth of energy go
 

3435
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,910
have all three months worth of energy go
buy side on a stopout. Let's just say

3436
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
buy side on a stopout. Let's just say
 

3437
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,110
buy side on a stopout. Let's just say
that happens. If there is huge selling,

3438
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,120
that happens. If there is huge selling,
 

3439
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,510
that happens. If there is huge selling,
they will pair off against that and

3440
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:39,520
they will pair off against that and
 

3441
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,189
they will pair off against that and
that's when you will get like huge

3442
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:41,199
that's when you will get like huge
 

3443
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,990
that's when you will get like huge
aggressive buys and and price not move

3444
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:44,000
aggressive buys and and price not move
 

3445
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,870
aggressive buys and and price not move
higher and then and only then will we

3446
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:46,880
higher and then and only then will we
 

3447
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,470
higher and then and only then will we
get this move here. But if that doesn't

3448
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:48,480
get this move here. But if that doesn't
 

3449
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,790
get this move here. But if that doesn't
happen then we are likely to just

3450
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:50,800
happen then we are likely to just
 

3451
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,110
happen then we are likely to just
continue this right main trend.

3452
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
continue this right main trend.
 

3453
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,390
continue this right main trend.
Those are the opportunities in the

3454
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:56,400
Those are the opportunities in the
 

3455
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,149
Those are the opportunities in the
market. But yeah, I I watch these. These

3456
01:18:58,149 --> 01:18:58,159
market. But yeah, I I watch these. These
 

3457
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:59,350
market. But yeah, I I watch these. These
are very important. That's why we've got

3458
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,360
are very important. That's why we've got
 

3459
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,110
are very important. That's why we've got
the red box. You can see the red box is

3460
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
the red box. You can see the red box is
 

3461
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,110
the red box. You can see the red box is
right to the high of these. very very

3462
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
right to the high of these. very very
 

3463
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,070
right to the high of these. very very
important how we act in them.

3464
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:06,080
important how we act in them.
 

3465
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,590
important how we act in them.
Probably the most important thing daily

3466
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:07,600
Probably the most important thing daily
 

3467
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,510
Probably the most important thing daily
levels. All right, back to the bottom of

3468
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:09,520
levels. All right, back to the bottom of
 

3469
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,030
levels. All right, back to the bottom of
the gray box. Sellers still trying to

3470
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:11,040
the gray box. Sellers still trying to
 

3471
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,030
the gray box. Sellers still trying to
defend these 53s. You can see it's a

3472
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:13,040
defend these 53s. You can see it's a
 

3473
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,470
defend these 53s. You can see it's a
huge huge level. Let's have a little

3474
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,480
huge huge level. Let's have a little
 

3475
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,790
huge huge level. Let's have a little
zoom in into this. So, they've defended

3476
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:16,800
zoom in into this. So, they've defended
 

3477
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,229
zoom in into this. So, they've defended
it again here. You can see they've come

3478
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:18,239
it again here. You can see they've come
 

3479
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,390
it again here. You can see they've come
in flying again here. They just want to

3480
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,400
in flying again here. They just want to
 

3481
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,990
in flying again here. They just want to
keep this heavy and if they can start to

3482
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:22,000
keep this heavy and if they can start to
 

3483
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,390
keep this heavy and if they can start to
pivot underneath this, they've got some

3484
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:24,400
pivot underneath this, they've got some
 

3485
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,470
pivot underneath this, they've got some
uh buy side imbalances to clean up. If

3486
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:26,480
uh buy side imbalances to clean up. If
 

3487
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,470
uh buy side imbalances to clean up. If
we start reclaiming, then obviously

3488
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:28,480
we start reclaiming, then obviously
 

3489
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,070
we start reclaiming, then obviously
squeeze is on. So, I'm leaving this

3490
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:30,080
squeeze is on. So, I'm leaving this
 

3491
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,990
squeeze is on. So, I'm leaving this
alone right now. Like I said, I don't

3492
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:32,000
alone right now. Like I said, I don't
 

3493
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,310
alone right now. Like I said, I don't
want to buy in premium. We got to We had

3494
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:34,320
want to buy in premium. We got to We had
 

3495
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,149
want to buy in premium. We got to We had
to buy in premium today anyway, but we

3496
01:19:36,149 --> 01:19:36,159
to buy in premium today anyway, but we
 

3497
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,669
to buy in premium today anyway, but we
bought as close as close to yesterday's

3498
01:19:39,669 --> 01:19:39,679
bought as close as close to yesterday's
 

3499
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:41,350
bought as close as close to yesterday's
uh fair fair value as possible.

3500
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:41,360
uh fair fair value as possible.
 

3501
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,709
uh fair fair value as possible.
Remember, this is yesterday's fair

3502
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:42,719
Remember, this is yesterday's fair
 

3503
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,830
Remember, this is yesterday's fair
value.

3504
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:45,840

 

3505
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,310

This is yesterday's premium, and this

3506
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,320
This is yesterday's premium, and this
 

3507
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,830
This is yesterday's premium, and this
would be overnight discount. So, we

3508
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:49,840
would be overnight discount. So, we
 

3509
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,070
would be overnight discount. So, we
bought as cheap as we could today to get

3510
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
bought as cheap as we could today to get
 

3511
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,750
bought as cheap as we could today to get
up into here. But I don't really want to

3512
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760
up into here. But I don't really want to
 

3513
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,070
up into here. But I don't really want to
buy expensive to sell more expensive if

3514
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:56,080
buy expensive to sell more expensive if
 

3515
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:01,590
buy expensive to sell more expensive if
I can avoid it.

3516
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:01,600

 

3517
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:06,435

This was the trade today.

3518
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:06,445

 

3519
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:10,470

[snorts]

3520
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:10,480

 

3521
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,149

Will you consider short down to 40s? Uh,

3522
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
Will you consider short down to 40s? Uh,
 

3523
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:15,910
Will you consider short down to 40s? Uh,
what are you saying? Down to 40s. If it

3524
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:15,920
what are you saying? Down to 40s. If it
 

3525
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,630
what are you saying? Down to 40s. If it
comes down to 40s, um,

3526
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:18,640
comes down to 40s, um,
 

3527
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,790
comes down to 40s, um,
I'm not,

3528
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:20,800
I'm not,
 

3529
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,630
I'm not,
but this

3530
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:24,640
but this
 

3531
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,189
but this
is a valid trade.

3532
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:27,199
is a valid trade.
 

3533
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,590
is a valid trade.
All right. If you move away and you fail

3534
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:29,600
All right. If you move away and you fail
 

3535
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,669
All right. If you move away and you fail
to reclaim and buyers get stuck in

3536
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:31,679
to reclaim and buyers get stuck in
 

3537
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,830
to reclaim and buyers get stuck in
there, that is a valid trade or at least

3538
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
there, that is a valid trade or at least
 

3539
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,870
there, that is a valid trade or at least
into this pivot here. But just remember,

3540
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:36,880
into this pivot here. But just remember,
 

3541
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,870
into this pivot here. But just remember,
right, we are bullish in momentum. That

3542
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:38,880
right, we are bullish in momentum. That
 

3543
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,030
right, we are bullish in momentum. That
can be a counter trend that is scooped

3544
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:41,040
can be a counter trend that is scooped
 

3545
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,590
can be a counter trend that is scooped
again to go higher, right?

Two-leg move down is most of the time

3606
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:09,280
Two-leg move down is most of the time
 

3607
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,910
Two-leg move down is most of the time
they do or even three leg down as

3608
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
they do or even three leg down as
 

3609
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,110
they do or even three leg down as
possible. Yeah, they can do multiple

3610
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:13,120
possible. Yeah, they can do multiple
 

3611
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,870
possible. Yeah, they can do multiple
legs, but two leg is a very common

3612
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:14,880
legs, but two leg is a very common
 

3613
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,310
legs, but two leg is a very common
trade.

3614

3615
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,870

If you think about it as well, when we

3616
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:20,880
If you think about it as well, when we
 

3617
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,550
If you think about it as well, when we
think about

3618
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,560
think about
 

3619
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,189
think about
trading markets, right, we want one of

3620
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:25,199
trading markets, right, we want one of
 

3621
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,510
trading markets, right, we want one of
the first two pullbacks, right? These

3622
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:27,520
the first two pullbacks, right? These
 

3623
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,390
the first two pullbacks, right? These
are these are very probable. Once we get

3624
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
are these are very probable. Once we get
 

3625
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,750
are these are very probable. Once we get
to here, this can happen very often,

3626
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:33,760
to here, this can happen very often,
 

3627
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,830
to here, this can happen very often,
right? So, you want to be looking for

3628
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:35,840
right? So, you want to be looking for
 

3629
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,189
right? So, you want to be looking for
the first and second leg on the

3630
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
the first and second leg on the
 

3631
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,910
the first and second leg on the
pullback. They're the safest entries.

3632
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:39,920
pullback. They're the safest entries.
 

3633
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,950
pullback. They're the safest entries.
First and second, the third leg, but

3634
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:42,960
First and second, the third leg, but
 

3635
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,390
First and second, the third leg, but
they don't get anywhere with it even on

3636
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:44,400
they don't get anywhere with it even on
 

3637
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,229
they don't get anywhere with it even on
a lower time frame. Doesn't mean it

3638
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:46,239
a lower time frame. Doesn't mean it
 

3639
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,709
a lower time frame. Doesn't mean it
can't, but the first and second leg are

3640
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:48,719
can't, but the first and second leg are
 

3641
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:51,510
can't, but the first and second leg are
like the main parts of the wave. Even on

3642
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:51,520
like the main parts of the wave. Even on
 

3643
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,270
like the main parts of the wave. Even on
higher time frame, the same thing. It's

3644
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:53,280
higher time frame, the same thing. It's
 

3645
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,390
higher time frame, the same thing. It's
why we had to be a little bit careful.

3646
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:56,400
why we had to be a little bit careful.
 

3647
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,669
why we had to be a little bit careful.
You could argue the breakout was

3648
01:22:57,669 --> 01:22:57,679
You could argue the breakout was
 

3649
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,149
You could argue the breakout was
yesterday. Yesterday's pullback or

3650
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:00,159
yesterday. Yesterday's pullback or
 

3651
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,310
yesterday. Yesterday's pullback or
overnight pullback was the first leg.

3652
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:02,320
overnight pullback was the first leg.
 

3653
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,470
overnight pullback was the first leg.
Today's pullback was the second leg this

3654
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480
Today's pullback was the second leg this
 

3655
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,510
Today's pullback was the second leg this
morning on an hourly chart after the

3656
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
morning on an hourly chart after the
 

3657
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,149
morning on an hourly chart after the
breakout. So, the next pullback you kind

3658
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
breakout. So, the next pullback you kind
 

3659
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:14,550
breakout. So, the next pullback you kind
of need to be careful.

3660
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:14,560

 

3661
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,950

Would you use zero DTE call options for

01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,430
Would you use zero DTE call options for
the move we took? No, I don't trade

3664
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:19,440
the move we took? No, I don't trade

a big green bubble, all that means is
 

3683
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,270

activity. What matters is what happens,

3686
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,000
activity. What matters is what happens,
 

3687
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,510
activity. What matters is what happens,
right? So, if we've got a lot of market

3688
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:43,520
right? So, if we've got a lot of market
 

3689
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,030
right? So, if we've got a lot of market
buying activity, it means there's a

3690
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:45,040
buying activity, it means there's a
 

3691
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,189
buying activity, it means there's a
passive seller the other side. If price

3692
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:47,199
passive seller the other side. If price
 

3693
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,350
passive seller the other side. If price
doesn't move higher, it means that big

3694
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:49,360
doesn't move higher, it means that big
 

3695
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,270
doesn't move higher, it means that big
buyer just got caught and price will

3696
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
buyer just got caught and price will
 

3697
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,590
buyer just got caught and price will
move lower away from his price. Right?

3698
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
move lower away from his price. Right?
 

3699
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,750
move lower away from his price. Right?
It's always it trading is about the

3700
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:55,760
It's always it trading is about the
 

3701
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,350
It's always it trading is about the
reaction. Whether you're looking at a

3702
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:57,360
reaction. Whether you're looking at a
 

3703
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,110
reaction. Whether you're looking at a
key level, whether you're looking at

3704
01:23:59,110 --> 01:23:59,120
key level, whether you're looking at
 

3705
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:03,110
key level, whether you're looking at
delta, it's about noticing something but

We're going to try and take out this
 

3737
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,750
We're going to try and take out this
pivot and come up to these highs into

3738
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,760
pivot and come up to these highs into
 

3739
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,950
pivot and come up to these highs into
this limit order of 75. If we break 75,

3740
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
this limit order of 75. If we break 75,
 

3741
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,950
this limit order of 75. If we break 75,
what's going to happen? probably some

3742
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:38,960
what's going to happen? probably some
 

3743
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,950
what's going to happen? probably some
con kind of squeeze because oh that's

3744
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
con kind of squeeze because oh that's
 

3745
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,470
con kind of squeeze because oh that's
not the line I wanted because we have

3746
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
not the line I wanted because we have
 

3747
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,030
not the line I wanted because we have
right the top of the auction here

3748
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:47,040
right the top of the auction here
 

3749
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,189
right the top of the auction here
sellers will try and defend this so if

3750
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
sellers will try and defend this so if
 

3751
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,270
sellers will try and defend this so if
we get over this level you will probably

3752
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:51,280
we get over this level you will probably
 

3753
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,950
we get over this level you will probably
see a squeeze out and search for

3754
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:52,960
see a squeeze out and search for
 

3755
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,950
see a squeeze out and search for
liquidity up to 100 probably all right

3756
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:54,960
liquidity up to 100 probably all right
 

3757
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,110
liquidity up to 100 probably all right
so it's it's about telling the story

3758
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,120
so it's it's about telling the story
 

3759
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,510
so it's it's about telling the story
who's involved so we just had lots of

3760
01:24:59,510 --> 01:24:59,520
who's involved so we just had lots of
 

3761
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,229
who's involved so we just had lots of
market buying activity here price at the

3762
01:25:02,229 --> 01:25:02,239
market buying activity here price at the
 

3763
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,669
market buying activity here price at the
moment is not moving higher so we know

3764
01:25:03,669 --> 01:25:03,679
moment is not moving higher so we know
 

3765
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,189
moment is not moving higher so we know
passive selling keeps happening at

3766
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:05,199
passive selling keeps happening at
 

3767
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,470
passive selling keeps happening at
around these 65 levels Okay, so these

3768
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:08,480
around these 65 levels Okay, so these
 

3769
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,350
around these 65 levels Okay, so these
guys here are still defending. Do I have

3770
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:11,360
guys here are still defending. Do I have
 

3771
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,030
guys here are still defending. Do I have
an arrow line here? I don't know if I

3772
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:13,040
an arrow line here? I don't know if I
 

3773
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,870
an arrow line here? I don't know if I
do. These guys here are still trying to

3774
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:16,880
do. These guys here are still trying to
 

3775
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,149
do. These guys here are still trying to
redefend price here. And if they get

3776
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:20,159
redefend price here. And if they get
 

3777
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:22,149
redefend price here. And if they get
squeezed out, we will probably lift and

3778
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:22,159
squeezed out, we will probably lift and
 

3779
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:27,990
squeezed out, we will probably lift and
come up to 75s.

3780
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:28,000

 

3781
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,350

Right. Other thing we should note now

3782
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
Right. Other thing we should note now
 

3783
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,430
Right. Other thing we should note now
folks is you are now inside your initial

3784
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:31,440
folks is you are now inside your initial
 

3785

folks is you are now inside your initial
balance. You can see this uh shelf is

3786
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:33,520
balance. You can see this uh shelf is
 

3787
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,350
balance. You can see this uh shelf is
getting thicker and thicker and thicker

3788
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:35,360
getting thicker and thicker and thicker
 

3789
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,950
getting thicker and thicker and thicker
and thicker. This is your sentiment for

01:25:38,629 --> 01:25:38,639
the day is this shelf right here. All
 

3793
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:41,030
the day is this shelf right here. All
right. So price starts to move away from

3794
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:41,040
right. So price starts to move away from
 

3795
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,110
right. So price starts to move away from
here. We talked about you might get a

3796
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
here. We talked about you might get a
 

3797
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:51,830
here. We talked about you might get a
squeeze out.

3798
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:51,840

 

3799
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,510

Row layout ticks per row. I have it set

3804
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:01,520
Row layout ticks per row. I have it set
 

3805
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,510
Row layout ticks per row. I have it set
to two. If you want to do number of

3806
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,520
to two. If you want to do number of
 

3807
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,310
to two. If you want to do number of
rows, I would do this to 1,00. Right?

3808
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:06,320
rows, I would do this to 1,00. Right?
 

3809
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,550
rows, I would do this to 1,00. Right?
And then it will look like that. Right?

3810
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:08,560
And then it will look like that. Right?
 

3811
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,950
And then it will look like that. Right?
So either way, however you want to do

3812
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:10,960
So either way, however you want to do
 

3813
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,550
So either way, however you want to do
it, either work. I've just been doing

3814
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:12,560
it, either work. I've just been doing
 

3815
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,070
it, either work. I've just been doing
ticks per row. This matches my

3816
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:14,080
ticks per row. This matches my
 

3817
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,350
ticks per row. This matches my
footprint. That's why I have it like

3818
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,360
footprint. That's why I have it like
 

3819
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,990
footprint. That's why I have it like
this. Right? And then I have it. The

3820
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,000
this. Right? And then I have it. The
 

3821
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:26,149
this. Right? And then I have it. The
only other thing I change.

3822
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:26,159

 

3823
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,830

Everything else stays the same. I just

3824
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
Everything else stays the same. I just
 

3825
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,390
Everything else stays the same. I just
have it moved to the right hand side.

3826
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:30,400
have it moved to the right hand side.
 

3827
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,350
have it moved to the right hand side.
Where's that input?

3828
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:33,360
Where's that input?
 

3829
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,110
Where's that input?
Can't even see it now. Placement.

3830
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:35,120
Can't even see it now. Placement.
 

3831
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,390
Can't even see it now. Placement.
Placement. Right. That's the only other

3832
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:36,400
Placement. Right. That's the only other
 

3833
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,590
Placement. Right. That's the only other
thing I changed. And then I just have

3834
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:37,600
thing I changed. And then I just have
 

3835
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,390
thing I changed. And then I just have
point of control up and down volume gray

3836
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,400
point of control up and down volume gray
 

3837
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,790
point of control up and down volume gray
and value area blue. Right. Here comes

3838
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:42,800
and value area blue. Right. Here comes
 

3839
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,310
and value area blue. Right. Here comes
IB high. So the squeeze is on. They're

3840
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:44,320
IB high. So the squeeze is on. They're
 

3841
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,149
IB high. So the squeeze is on. They're
coming back to those 75s. We just talked

3842
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:46,159
coming back to those 75s. We just talked
 

3843
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,990
coming back to those 75s. We just talked
about this on bookmap. So if we think

3844
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:48,000
about this on bookmap. So if we think
 

3845
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,550
about this on bookmap. So if we think
about what we just went over, if sellers

3846
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:50,560
about what we just went over, if sellers
 

3847
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,910
about what we just went over, if sellers
can't defend here and we get the squeeze

3848
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920
can't defend here and we get the squeeze
 

3849
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,750
can't defend here and we get the squeeze
out, we'll revisit this up here. And we

3850
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
out, we'll revisit this up here. And we
 

3851
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,270
out, we'll revisit this up here. And we
should now squeeze through and come and

3852
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
should now squeeze through and come and
 

3853
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,709
should now squeeze through and come and
clean out all this liquidity which is

3854
01:26:56,709 --> 01:26:56,719
clean out all this liquidity which is
 

3855
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:59,430
clean out all this liquidity which is
being added above into 85 and possibly

3856
01:26:59,430 --> 01:26:59,440
being added above into 85 and possibly
 

3857
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,870
being added above into 85 and possibly
up into these hundreds. This is where

3858
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:00,880
up into these hundreds. This is where
 

3859
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,310
up into these hundreds. This is where
sellers are sitting looking to get

3860
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:02,320
sellers are sitting looking to get
 

3861
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,750
sellers are sitting looking to get
filled. So these are probably buyers to

3862
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:03,760
filled. So these are probably buyers to
 

3863
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,470
filled. So these are probably buyers to
be honest just looking to fill and uh

3864
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,480
be honest just looking to fill and uh
 

3865
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:11,669
be honest just looking to fill and uh
take some profits on this squeeze up.

3866
01:27:11,669 --> 01:27:11,679

 

3867
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,669

So gray box defended and here's the

3868
01:27:13,669 --> 01:27:13,679
So gray box defended and here's the
 

3869
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:14,790
So gray box defended and here's the
squeeze up. So here's your initial

3870
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:14,800
squeeze up. So here's your initial
 

3871
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:23,350
squeeze up. So here's your initial
balance high. Yes, trying to join in.

3872
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,360

 

3873
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,990

So, here we go. Here's 75s.

3874
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,000
So, here we go. Here's 75s.
 

3875
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,350
So, here we go. Here's 75s.
So, they've just taken a load of stops

3876
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:27,360
So, they've just taken a load of stops
 

3877
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,709
So, they've just taken a load of stops
here. And the question is, can they lift

3878
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:28,719
here. And the question is, can they lift
 

3879
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,590
here. And the question is, can they lift
this any higher now?

3880
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:31,600
this any higher now?
 

3881
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,590
this any higher now?
Is there a lift any higher?

3882
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:35,600
Is there a lift any higher?
 

3883
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,430
Is there a lift any higher?
And through 85s and 90s, and then you're

3884
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
And through 85s and 90s, and then you're
 

3885
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,229
And through 85s and 90s, and then you're
looking for 100. And then 100 is the red

3886
01:27:40,229 --> 01:27:40,239
looking for 100. And then 100 is the red
 

3887
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,310
looking for 100. And then 100 is the red
box. Yeah. And then through 100, 150.

3888
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,320
box. Yeah. And then through 100, 150.
 

3889
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,070
box. Yeah. And then through 100, 150.
All the stops, the last lot of stops are

3890
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:44,080
All the stops, the last lot of stops are
 

3891
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:50,629
All the stops, the last lot of stops are
at 145. I think it actually is.

3892
01:27:50,629 --> 01:27:50,639

 

3893
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:51,830

It's trying to get through that or

3894
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:51,840
It's trying to get through that or
 

3895
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,510
It's trying to get through that or
trying to approach that high of day. Um

3896
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:53,520
trying to approach that high of day. Um
 

3897
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,790
trying to approach that high of day. Um
I forget your name, but one of you

3898
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,800
I forget your name, but one of you
 

3899
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,149
I forget your name, but one of you
pointed out there's a naked point of

3900
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:56,159
pointed out there's a naked point of
 

3901
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,390
pointed out there's a naked point of
control at 70.10. So it's worth watching

3902
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:58,400
control at 70.10. So it's worth watching
 

3903
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,629
control at 70.10. So it's worth watching
that. You still have gap fill potential.

3904
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:00,639
that. You still have gap fill potential.
 

3905
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,390
that. You still have gap fill potential.
Remember spy trying to fill that gap up

3906
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:02,400
Remember spy trying to fill that gap up
 

3907
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,709
Remember spy trying to fill that gap up
to 696.

3908
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:04,719
to 696.
 

3909
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:10,950
to 696.
So spy is trying to fill a gap up to 696

3910
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:10,960

 

3911
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,750

and Q's are trying to fill a gap up to

3912
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:13,760
and Q's are trying to fill a gap up to
 

3913
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,390
and Q's are trying to fill a gap up to
632s. Right? If we're going to do that

3914
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:16,400
632s. Right? If we're going to do that
 

3915
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,310
632s. Right? If we're going to do that
today, it's a big if, but if we're going

3916
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:18,320
today, it's a big if, but if we're going
 

3917
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:27,910
today, it's a big if, but if we're going
to do that today,

3918
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:27,920

 

3919
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,830

Tyson's just absolutely on a heater

3920
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:29,840
Tyson's just absolutely on a heater
 

3921
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,310
Tyson's just absolutely on a heater
right now. Just locked in another $4,000

3922
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:32,320
right now. Just locked in another $4,000
 

3923
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,629
right now. Just locked in another $4,000
today. Nice work, buddy.

3924
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,639
today. Nice work, buddy.
 

3925
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,470
today. Nice work, buddy.
Here we go. So, squeeze is on. So, let's

3926
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:38,480
Here we go. So, squeeze is on. So, let's
 

3927
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,590
Here we go. So, squeeze is on. So, let's
see if we can lift out to the hundreds

3928
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,600
see if we can lift out to the hundreds
 

3929
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,270
see if we can lift out to the hundreds
and then if we get through hundreds,

3930
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:43,280
and then if we get through hundreds,
 

3931
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,229
and then if we get through hundreds,
150.

3932
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:46,239
150.
 

3933
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,750
150.
So, this is your target here. If we can

3934
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:47,760
So, this is your target here. If we can
 

3935
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,070
So, this is your target here. If we can
get up to the hundreds, then 150. I've

3936
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,080
get up to the hundreds, then 150. I've
 

3937
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,910
get up to the hundreds, then 150. I've
got my eyes on the ETFs as well for you

3938
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:51,920
got my eyes on the ETFs as well for you
 

3939
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,910
got my eyes on the ETFs as well for you
guys. Uh, you're getting very close to

3940
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:53,920
guys. Uh, you're getting very close to
 

3941
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,070
guys. Uh, you're getting very close to
that naked point of control on ES that

3942
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,080
that naked point of control on ES that
 

3943
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,990
that naked point of control on ES that
one of you pointed out. You were just

3944
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
one of you pointed out. You were just
 

3945
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,669
one of you pointed out. You were just
three ticks away there. So, maybe some

3946
01:28:59,669 --> 01:28:59,679
three ticks away there. So, maybe some
 

3947
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:16,310
three ticks away there. So, maybe some
resistance there on ES. Worth noting.

3948
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:16,320

 

3949
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,070

So let's see what if we go back to boot

3950
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,080
So let's see what if we go back to boot
 

3951
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,750
So let's see what if we go back to boot
map so you can see what we were looking

3952
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:19,760
map so you can see what we were looking
 

3953
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,270
map so you can see what we were looking
at.

3954
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
at.
 

3955
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,310
at.
Defended traded through sellers came in

3956
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:24,320
Defended traded through sellers came in
 

3957
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,990
Defended traded through sellers came in
got absorbed at that same level this

3958
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:26,000
got absorbed at that same level this
 

3959
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,470
got absorbed at that same level this
horizontal level and we will will now

3960
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:28,480
horizontal level and we will will now
 

3961
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,030
horizontal level and we will will now
try and lift up. So sellers are out of

3962
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,040
try and lift up. So sellers are out of
 

3963
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,390
try and lift up. So sellers are out of
money. All right. All the time we're

3964
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:32,400
money. All right. All the time we're
 

3965
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,910
money. All right. All the time we're
above this 75s, they're out of the

3966
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:33,920
above this 75s, they're out of the
 

3967
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,430
above this 75s, they're out of the
money. And the targets here are 100.

3968
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:35,440
money. And the targets here are 100.
 

3969
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,790
money. And the targets here are 100.
Let's see if anyone's on the tape at

3970
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:36,800
Let's see if anyone's on the tape at
 

3971
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,149
Let's see if anyone's on the tape at
145. Yeah, 125 and 150. There you go.

3972
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
145. Yeah, 125 and 150. There you go.
 

3973
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,990
145. Yeah, 125 and 150. There you go.
145, 150. So they're looking at the same

3974
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,000
145, 150. So they're looking at the same
 

3975
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,030
145, 150. So they're looking at the same
targets as me, these guys on the book.

3976
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:45,040
targets as me, these guys on the book.
 

3977
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:48,070
targets as me, these guys on the book.
So all the time we're above 75s. Now you

3978
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:48,080
So all the time we're above 75s. Now you
 

3979
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,510
So all the time we're above 75s. Now you
actually want to see buyers just come in

3980
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:49,520
actually want to see buyers just come in
 

3981
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,350
actually want to see buyers just come in
here and just defend this. You don't I I

3982
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:51,360
here and just defend this. You don't I I
 

3983
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,709
here and just defend this. You don't I I
wouldn't want to see this roll back down

3984
01:29:52,709 --> 01:29:52,719
wouldn't want to see this roll back down
 

3985
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,790
wouldn't want to see this roll back down
to 60s. If I if I was long, I'm not

3986
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:54,800
to 60s. If I if I was long, I'm not

4003
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,229
normally takes like three months or
something, but I mean if they've done

4004
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:20,239
something, but I mean if they've done
 

4005
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,669
something, but I mean if they've done
that, don't worry about it. Don't buy

4006
01:30:21,669 --> 01:30:21,679
that, don't worry about it. Don't buy
 

4007
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,910
that, don't worry about it. Don't buy

4013
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,870
you've got lots of PAS in the money. So,
just lock those in and then uh use some

just lock those in and then uh use some
 

4015

>> Sorry guys, it slowed down a bit. So,
 

4141
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,629
>> Sorry guys, it slowed down a bit. So,
you know,

4142
01:33:56,629 --> 01:33:56,639
you know,
 

4143
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,390
you know,
can't do much. Just calling what I can

4144
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:58,400
can't do much. Just calling what I can
 

4145
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:07,510
can't do much. Just calling what I can
see at the moment.

4146
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:07,520

 

4147
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,430

And they lift this. I think you're going

4148
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:09,440
And they lift this. I think you're going
 

4149
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,950
And they lift this. I think you're going
to get it. They're now adding liquidity

4150
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:10,960
to get it. They're now adding liquidity
 

4151
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,950
to get it. They're now adding liquidity
higher at 115. I think you're going to

4152
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:12,960
higher at 115. I think you're going to
 

4153
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,310
higher at 115. I think you're going to
get it, folks.

4154
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:16,320
get it, folks.
 

4155
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,750
get it, folks.
Just don't be too aggressive at the

4156
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760
Just don't be too aggressive at the
 

4157
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:23,030
Just don't be too aggressive at the
highs though. Just manage your position.

4158
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,040

 

4159
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,030

Your trade to downside. If you are

4160
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:25,040
Your trade to downside. If you are
 

4161
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,270
Your trade to downside. If you are
adamant on trading downside, I would I

4162
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,280
adamant on trading downside, I would I
 

4163
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,870
adamant on trading downside, I would I
would say you need to leave this volume

4164
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:28,880
would say you need to leave this volume
 

4165
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,750
would say you need to leave this volume
shelf. I would not be thinking short,

4166
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:31,760
shelf. I would not be thinking short,
 

4167
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,550
shelf. I would not be thinking short,
right, until you get under here. That's

4168
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:34,560
right, until you get under here. That's
 

4169
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,310
right, until you get under here. That's
your short. I really would not be

4170
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:36,320
your short. I really would not be
 

4171
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,790
your short. I really would not be
thinking short above that unless we like

4172
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:38,800
thinking short above that unless we like
 

4173
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,229
thinking short above that unless we like
come up here, spike, leave volume

4174
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:42,239
come up here, spike, leave volume
 

4175
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:43,590
come up here, spike, leave volume
trapped here. Right? If we have

4176
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:43,600
trapped here. Right? If we have
 

4177
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,830
trapped here. Right? If we have
something like this,

4178
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:45,840
something like this,
 

4179
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,350
something like this,
right, then maybe there's a short from

4180
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:47,360
right, then maybe there's a short from
 

4181
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,830
right, then maybe there's a short from
here to here and the rotation would be

4182
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:49,840
here to here and the rotation would be
 

4183
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,189
here to here and the rotation would be
there. And then if you found acceptance

4184
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:51,199
there. And then if you found acceptance
 

4185
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:52,550
there. And then if you found acceptance
lower, there'd be an add-on. But

4186
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:52,560
lower, there'd be an add-on. But
 

4187
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,110
lower, there'd be an add-on. But
otherwise, do not fight this tape, guys.

01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:55,120
otherwise, do not fight this tape, guys.

They're all in a video on my YouTube. I
posted it maybe last weekend.

Just just go on my YouTube, go to recent
 

4207

01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:33,360

 

4209
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,629

Understand everything beside volume

4210
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:34,639
Understand everything beside volume
 

4211
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:36,070
Understand everything beside volume
profile. So, I'll buy the volume profile

4212
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:36,080
profile. So, I'll buy the volume profile
 

4213
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,189
profile. So, I'll buy the volume profile
course. Thanks so much. Hey, you're

01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:37,199
course. Thanks so much. Hey, you're
 

4215
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,189
course. Thanks so much. Hey, you're
welcome. Look forward to working with

4216
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
welcome. Look forward to working with
 

4217
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:42,229
welcome. Look forward to working with
you. Right. Still buyers still trying to

4218
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239
you. Right. Still buyers still trying to
 

4219
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,310
you. Right. Still buyers still trying to
absorb here in front of 75. They're just

4220
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,320
absorb here in front of 75. They're just
 

4221
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,830
absorb here in front of 75. They're just
looking to get this shove up and fill

4222
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:45,840
looking to get this shove up and fill
 

4223
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,590
looking to get this shove up and fill
all these sellers up into 15s at the

4224
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:47,600
all these sellers up into 15s at the
 

4225
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,229
all these sellers up into 15s at the
moment. They've got to absorb over 75.

4226
01:35:50,229 --> 01:35:50,239
moment. They've got to absorb over 75.
 

4227
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:51,990
moment. They've got to absorb over 75.
I'd feel somewhat uncomfortable if they

4228
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:52,000
I'd feel somewhat uncomfortable if they
 

4229
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,430
I'd feel somewhat uncomfortable if they
can't do that. Even though there's a

4230
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:53,440
can't do that. Even though there's a
 

4231
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,030
can't do that. Even though there's a
shelf, technically they can hold all the

4232
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:55,040
shelf, technically they can hold all the
 

4233
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,110
shelf, technically they can hold all the
way down here. You know, if you bought

4234
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:57,120
way down here. You know, if you bought
 

4235
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,430
way down here. You know, if you bought
this break from here, you just want them

4236
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
this break from here, you just want them
 

4237
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,430
this break from here, you just want them
to resqueeze this above the IB. You want

4238
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
to resqueeze this above the IB. You want
 

4239
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,629
to resqueeze this above the IB. You want
them to shove it up. You don't really

4240
01:36:02,629 --> 01:36:02,639
them to shove it up. You don't really
 

4241
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:04,149
them to shove it up. You don't really
want them to collapse back down into

4242
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:04,159
want them to collapse back down into
 

4243
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,070
want them to collapse back down into
here again.

4244
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:06,080
here again.
 

4245
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,350
here again.
Like we talked about, you need to be

4246
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:07,360
Like we talked about, you need to be
 

4247
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,189
Like we talked about, you need to be
careful because we're on a three drive

4248
01:36:09,189 --> 01:36:09,199
careful because we're on a three drive
 

4249
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:10,950
careful because we're on a three drive
on the hourly and we're also on a three

4250
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:10,960
on the hourly and we're also on a three
 

4251
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,470
on the hourly and we're also on a three
drive on lower time frame. So if we

4252
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:12,480
drive on lower time frame. So if we
 

4253
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,870
drive on lower time frame. So if we
think about this lower time frame one,

4254
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
think about this lower time frame one,
 

4255
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:22,310
think about this lower time frame one,
two, three, if we go to an hourly

4256
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320

 

4257
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,669

since the breakout, we're going to

4258
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
since the breakout, we're going to
 

4259
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,669
since the breakout, we're going to
consider this the breakout.

4260
01:36:27,669 --> 01:36:27,679

 

4261
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:29,910

One, two, three. So you want to be

4262
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:29,920
One, two, three. So you want to be
 

4263
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,229
One, two, three. So you want to be
careful. You want to be careful. Doesn't

4264
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:32,239
careful. You want to be careful. Doesn't
 

4265
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:33,510
careful. You want to be careful. Doesn't
mean it can't go higher. It just means

4266
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
mean it can't go higher. It just means
 

4267
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:40,629
mean it can't go higher. It just means
the probability starts to become lower.

4268
01:36:40,629 --> 01:36:40,639

 

4269
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,910

Uh, they're rolling fibs.

4270
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:43,920
Uh, they're rolling fibs.
 

4271
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,910
Uh, they're rolling fibs.
They're rolling. Rolling fibs. The flow

4272
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:45,920
They're rolling. Rolling fibs. The flow
 

4273

They're rolling. Rolling fibs. The flow

Someone's flashing 80s. Fifth time he's

Someone's flashing 80s. Fifth time he's

01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,070
What time of tea would I recommend for
better concentration? I I prefer like

4448
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:32,080
better concentration? I I prefer like
 

4449
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,070
better concentration? I I prefer like
stress relief tees than concentration

4450
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:34,080
stress relief tees than concentration
 

4451
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,709
stress relief tees than concentration
tees. I don't know. Uh if you want to

4452
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:36,719
tees. I don't know. Uh if you want to
 

4453
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:37,990
tees. I don't know. Uh if you want to
know what I have, I just have like a

4454
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:38,000
know what I have, I just have like a
 

4455
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,750
know what I have, I just have like a
stress relief tee and I have here's the

4456
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,760
stress relief tee and I have here's the
 

4457
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,350
stress relief tee and I have here's the
pullback into this shelf here. So just

4458
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:41,360
pullback into this shelf here. So just
 

4459
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,910
pullback into this shelf here. So just
be careful here. Especially if ES

4460
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:43,920
be careful here. Especially if ES
 

4461
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:47,030
be careful here. Especially if ES
collapses back down under those tens. Uh

4462
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:47,040
collapses back down under those tens. Uh
 

4463
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,950
collapses back down under those tens. Uh
is it tens? Yeah, tens and sevens for

4464
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:48,960
is it tens? Yeah, tens and sevens for
 

4465
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,709
is it tens? Yeah, tens and sevens for
the ES.

4466
01:42:50,709 --> 01:42:50,719
the ES.
 

4467
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:52,470
the ES.
So flush coming back down to this gray

4468
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:52,480
So flush coming back down to this gray
 

4469
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,550
So flush coming back down to this gray
box. Maybe remember the shorts will

4470
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:54,560
box. Maybe remember the shorts will
 

4471
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,350
box. Maybe remember the shorts will
happen. All right. If we lose this,

4472
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,360
happen. All right. If we lose this,
 

4473
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,430
happen. All right. If we lose this,
right, if we lose this area, you want to

4474
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:01,440
right, if we lose this area, you want to
 

4475
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,030
right, if we lose this area, you want to
be very careful of a fail break like

4476
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:03,040
be very careful of a fail break like
 

4477
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,750
be very careful of a fail break like
here. But if we lose this, that can

4478
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:05,760
here. But if we lose this, that can
 

4479
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,310
here. But if we lose this, that can
happen. But we're very bullish overall.

4480
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:08,320
happen. But we're very bullish overall.
 

4481
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,750
happen. But we're very bullish overall.
We got so close there. We missed it by

4482
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:11,760
We got so close there. We missed it by
 

4483
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:17,016
We got so close there. We missed it by
six ticks. They missed the 100 by.

4484
01:43:17,016 --> 01:43:17,026

 

4485
01:43:17,026 --> 01:43:22,790

[cough]

4486
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:22,800

 

4487
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,310

Q still haven't filled their gap. The

4488
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,320
Q still haven't filled their gap. The
 

4489
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,870
Q still haven't filled their gap. The
gap on the cues is still up at 632. So,

4490
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:26,880
gap on the cues is still up at 632. So,
 

4491
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,830
gap on the cues is still up at 632. So,
we hit a high today of 631.63. Still not

4492
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:29,840
we hit a high today of 631.63. Still not
 

4493
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,669
we hit a high today of 631.63. Still not
filled the gap. Here's your IB.

4494
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:33,679
filled the gap. Here's your IB.
 

4495
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:44,310
filled the gap. Here's your IB.
Here's the IB.

4496
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:44,320

 

4497
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,229

Do I use ticks for my chart? Uh, no. I

4498
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:46,239
Do I use ticks for my chart? Uh, no. I
 

4499
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,950
Do I use ticks for my chart? Uh, no. I
just trade off the minute chart.

4500
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:48,960
just trade off the minute chart.
 

4501
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,870
just trade off the minute chart.
Yep. Live stream every day, Monday to

Friday, 9:15 Eastern time. time we do
pre-market prep into the open and then

4506
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:55,360
pre-market prep into the open and then
 

4507
01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:00,950
pre-market prep into the open and then
trade into lunch.

4508
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:00,960

 

4509
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,790

Uh Evan, yeah, I don't when did you win?

4510
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:04,800
Uh Evan, yeah, I don't when did you win?
 

4511
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,590
Uh Evan, yeah, I don't when did you win?
If you won recently, it will be uh next

4512
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:07,600
If you won recently, it will be uh next
 

4513
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,430
If you won recently, it will be uh next
month. If you won like back end of last

4514
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
month. If you won like back end of last
 

4515
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,790
month. If you won like back end of last
year, there's normally like about two

4516
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:12,800
year, there's normally like about two
 

4517
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:21,862
year, there's normally like about two
months on them.

4518
01:44:21,862 --> 01:44:21,872

 

4519
01:44:21,872 --> 01:44:23,189

[laughter]

4520
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:23,199
[laughter]
 

4521
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:28,629
[laughter]
Love that comment, Sean.

4522
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:28,639

 

4523
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:30,709

Nice, man. I'm glad I'm glad we're

4524
01:44:30,709 --> 01:44:30,719
Nice, man. I'm glad I'm glad we're
 

4525
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:33,189
Nice, man. I'm glad I'm glad we're
aligned. All right, so support systems

4526
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:33,199
aligned. All right, so support systems
 

4527
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:34,550
aligned. All right, so support systems
down here. Here's your initial balance.

4528
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:34,560
down here. Here's your initial balance.
 

4529
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,149
down here. Here's your initial balance.
This is the support system. If buyers

4530
01:44:36,149 --> 01:44:36,159
This is the support system. If buyers
 

4531
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,709
This is the support system. If buyers
lose this support system, then there's

4532
01:44:38,709 --> 01:44:38,719
lose this support system, then there's
 

4533
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:40,870
lose this support system, then there's
an argument for lower prices. Again, the

4534
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:40,880
an argument for lower prices. Again, the
 

4535
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,109
an argument for lower prices. Again, the
big sellers today came in at 47 and at

4536
01:44:43,109 --> 01:44:43,119
big sellers today came in at 47 and at
 

4537
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,590
big sellers today came in at 47 and at
34. 47 and at 34. Those are the big

4538
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:45,600
34. 47 and at 34. Those are the big
 

4539
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,590
34. 47 and at 34. Those are the big
levels for um Vpo today is at down at 48

4540
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:49,600
levels for um Vpo today is at down at 48
 

4541
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,510
levels for um Vpo today is at down at 48
right down here. So how we act in around

4542
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:51,520
right down here. So how we act in around
 

4543
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,669
right down here. So how we act in around
this gray box will be will become very

4544
01:44:53,669 --> 01:44:53,679
this gray box will be will become very
 

4545
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:56,149
this gray box will be will become very
very important

4546
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:56,159
very important
 

4547
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,910
very important
and I would not be back. So remember we

4548
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:57,920
and I would not be back. So remember we
 

4549
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,310
and I would not be back. So remember we
said three drives one two three. So I

4550
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:00,320
said three drives one two three. So I
 

4551
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,070
said three drives one two three. So I
said be very cautious trading this third

4552
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:02,080
said be very cautious trading this third
 

4553
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,070
said be very cautious trading this third
one. It's the same on the hourly. If we

4554
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,080
one. It's the same on the hourly. If we
 

4555
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,669
one. It's the same on the hourly. If we
start to get under here there is an

4556
01:45:05,669 --> 01:45:05,679
start to get under here there is an
 

4557
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,270
start to get under here there is an
argument for a backside move. There's

4558
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:07,280
argument for a backside move. There's
 

4559
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,189
argument for a backside move. There's
also an argument to do very similar to

4560
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:09,199
also an argument to do very similar to
 

4561
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:11,109
also an argument to do very similar to
what we did yesterday which is just to

4562
01:45:11,109 --> 01:45:11,119
what we did yesterday which is just to
 

4563
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:12,870
what we did yesterday which is just to
trade around a core for a bit. All right

4564
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:12,880
trade around a core for a bit. All right
 

4565
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,310
trade around a core for a bit. All right
if they want to base up here for a bit

4566
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:14,320
if they want to base up here for a bit
 

4567
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,910
if they want to base up here for a bit
and wait for earnings tomorrow they can

4568
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:15,920
and wait for earnings tomorrow they can
 

4569
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,870
and wait for earnings tomorrow they can
also do that. Here's the gray box tagged

4570
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:18,880
also do that. Here's the gray box tagged
 

4571
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:35,030
also do that. Here's the gray box tagged
into the top of this shelf.

4572
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:35,040

 

4573
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,709

This is just this volume profile,

4574
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:36,719
This is just this volume profile,
 

4575
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,030
This is just this volume profile,
anchored volume profile.

4576
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,040
anchored volume profile.
 

4577
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,870
anchored volume profile.
It's not an indicator. It's a drawing

4578
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:40,880
It's not an indicator. It's a drawing
 

4579
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:44,229
It's not an indicator. It's a drawing
tool. It's it's here. Uh yeah, it's just

4580
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
tool. It's it's here. Uh yeah, it's just
 

4581
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:45,750
tool. It's it's here. Uh yeah, it's just
a drawing tool. So, gray box being

4582
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:45,760
a drawing tool. So, gray box being
 

4583
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:50,629
a drawing tool. So, gray box being
defended so far. Back to IB we go.

4584
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639

 

4585
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:52,070

They might rotate for a bit here while

4586
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:52,080
They might rotate for a bit here while
 

4587
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:53,750
They might rotate for a bit here while
they make their minds up of what next.

4588
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:53,760
they make their minds up of what next.
 

4589
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,990
they make their minds up of what next.
It's very possible.

4590
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000

 

4591
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,629

Do I think we still get 26,100? It's

4592
01:46:00,629 --> 01:46:00,639
Do I think we still get 26,100? It's
 

4593
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,070
Do I think we still get 26,100? It's
possible. It really depends what happens

4594
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:02,080
possible. It really depends what happens
 

4595
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:07,109
possible. It really depends what happens
in and around this core level.

4596
01:46:07,109 --> 01:46:07,119

 

4597
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:08,629

Not like there was a huge amount ex

4598
01:46:08,629 --> 01:46:08,639
Not like there was a huge amount ex
 

4599
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:12,470
Not like there was a huge amount ex
excess at the high day.

4600
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:12,480
excess at the high day.
 

4601
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,990
excess at the high day.
Looks so much like yesterday. It does,

See if they give one more leg down and
 

4613
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:36,229
See if they give one more leg down and
if they scoop it for another go or not.

4614
01:46:36,229 --> 01:46:36,239

 

4615
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:37,510

You got remember they can be done with

01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,000
it. Like we hit low hanging fruit. My
 

4619
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,830
it. Like we hit low hanging fruit. My
target was hit here earlier today. Right

4620
01:46:41,830 --> 01:46:41,840
target was hit here earlier today. Right
 

4621
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,750
target was hit here earlier today. Right
here. The runner I got knocked out.

4622
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:43,760
here. The runner I got knocked out.
 

4623
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,430
here. The runner I got knocked out.
Runner. Next target would have been here

4624
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:45,440
Runner. Next target would have been here
 

4625
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,870
Runner. Next target would have been here
and the final target would have been the

4626
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:46,880
and the final target would have been the
 

4627
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,390
and the final target would have been the
top of this red box. All right, so we

4628
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:48,400
top of this red box. All right, so we
 

4629
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,430
top of this red box. All right, so we
hit low hanging fruit hit runner runner.

4630
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:51,440
hit low hanging fruit hit runner runner.
 

4631
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,790
hit low hanging fruit hit runner runner.
You almost hit runner. I mean, you're

4632
01:46:52,790 --> 01:46:52,800
You almost hit runner. I mean, you're
 

4633
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,430
You almost hit runner. I mean, you're
six ticks away. Like I always say, don't

4634
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:55,440
six ticks away. Like I always say, don't
 

4635
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,510
six ticks away. Like I always say, don't
be a dick. 40 ticks. Six ticks is

4636
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:57,520
be a dick. 40 ticks. Six ticks is
 

4637
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:02,070
be a dick. 40 ticks. Six ticks is
absolutely nothing.

4638
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:02,080

 

4639
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,030

How do I determine the position and size

4640
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,040
How do I determine the position and size
 

4641
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,510
How do I determine the position and size
of the box on the chart?

4642
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:07,520
of the box on the chart?
 

4643
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,070
of the box on the chart?
You see this profile? Where do we get

4644
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
You see this profile? Where do we get
 

4645
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,830
You see this profile? Where do we get
thick here? So where's the box on that

4646
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:13,840
thick here? So where's the box on that
 

4647
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,109
thick here? So where's the box on that
shelf? Right. Nice hard shelf, right? So

4648
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:17,119
shelf? Right. Nice hard shelf, right? So
 

4649
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:19,030
shelf? Right. Nice hard shelf, right? So
this is where

4650
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:19,040
this is where
 

4651
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,030
this is where
we have had a lot of volume building

4652
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:21,040
we have had a lot of volume building
 

4653
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,910
we have had a lot of volume building
out. So buyers will want to defend this

4654
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:23,920
out. So buyers will want to defend this
 

4655
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,990
out. So buyers will want to defend this
volume. Sellers will want to get under

4656
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:26,000
volume. Sellers will want to get under
 

4657
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,830
volume. Sellers will want to get under
and use the volume to go lower. So

4658
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:27,840
and use the volume to go lower. So
 

4659
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,669
and use the volume to go lower. So
that's why the box is this thick. It's

4660
01:47:29,669 --> 01:47:29,679
that's why the box is this thick. It's
 

4661
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:35,089
that's why the box is this thick. It's
based on the profile.

4662
01:47:35,089 --> 01:47:35,099

is probable. I don't think I'm going to
 

4709

01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:34,320
play the shorts today, but I'm telling
 

4711
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,470
play the shorts today, but I'm telling
you now, if we let go of this, a

4712

you now, if we let go of this, a
 

4713
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,750
you now, if we let go of this, a
rotation from 50s basically to 26 flat

4714
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:39,760
rotation from 50s basically to 26 flat
 

4715
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,430
rotation from 50s basically to 26 flat
is very probable. There's a 50 point

4716
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:41,440
is very probable. There's a 50 point
 

4717
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,070
is very probable. There's a 50 point
trade there if we do it, if you want it.

4718
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:44,080
trade there if we do it, if you want it.
 

4719
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,350
trade there if we do it, if you want it.
I'm not saying you have to take it. It's

01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:45,360
I'm not saying you have to take it. It's
 

4721
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,189
I'm not saying you have to take it. It's
the counter trend trade. It's the

4722
01:48:47,189 --> 01:48:47,199
the counter trend trade. It's the
 

4723
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:49,270
the counter trend trade. It's the
hardest trade on the book, right? It's a

4724
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:49,280
hardest trade on the book, right? It's a
 

4725
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,750
hardest trade on the book, right? It's a
counter trend to what's going on, but

01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:51,760
counter trend to what's going on, but
 

4727
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,910
counter trend to what's going on, but
it's very probable if we let go of that

4728
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:53,920
it's very probable if we let go of that
 

4729
01:48:53,920 --> 01:49:05,430
it's very probable if we let go of that
shell.

4730
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:05,440

 

4731
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,470

What are the red boxes? Uh supply,

01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:08,480
What are the red boxes? Uh supply,
 

4733
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,470
What are the red boxes? Uh supply,
potential supply.

4734
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:12,480

 

4735
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,229

Yeah, just that one trade, mate. That's
 

4737
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:23,109
Yeah, just that one trade, mate. That's
all I took.

4738
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119

 

4739
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:25,030

Yes, volume profile on the right hand

4740
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:25,040
Yes, volume profile on the right hand
 

4741
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,030
Yes, volume profile on the right hand
side starts at the 9:30. You have it

4742
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,040
side starts at the 9:30. You have it
 

4743
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:31,270
side starts at the 9:30. You have it
anchored to 930.

4744
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:31,280

 

4745
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,950

Can we use high volume nodes as support

4746
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:32,960
Can we use high volume nodes as support
 

4747
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,430
Can we use high volume nodes as support
and resistance? Yes, you can. You can.

4748
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:35,440
and resistance? Yes, you can. You can.
 

4749
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,189
and resistance? Yes, you can. You can.
They can act as support down here. You

4750
01:49:37,189 --> 01:49:37,199
They can act as support down here. You
 

4751
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:38,870
They can act as support down here. You
can also use low volume nodes. By the

4752
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:38,880
can also use low volume nodes. By the
 

4753
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,470
can also use low volume nodes. By the
way, it can also actually act very nice

4754
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:42,480
way, it can also actually act very nice
 

4755
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,550
way, it can also actually act very nice
if it's like a first dip in especially

4756
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
if it's like a first dip in especially
 

4757
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,070
if it's like a first dip in especially
if you think about a low volume node as

4758
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:46,080
if you think about a low volume node as
 

4759
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,390
if you think about a low volume node as
like an imbalance, right? Let's let's

4760
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:48,400
like an imbalance, right? Let's let's
 

4761
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,109
like an imbalance, right? Let's let's
imagine like we hadn't done backside,

4762
01:49:51,109 --> 01:49:51,119
imagine like we hadn't done backside,
 

4763
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:53,270
imagine like we hadn't done backside,
right? And we just had this node here.

4764
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,280
right? And we just had this node here.
 

4765
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,910
right? And we just had this node here.
Let's imagine this. This dip in here can

4766
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:55,920
Let's imagine this. This dip in here can
 

4767
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,750
Let's imagine this. This dip in here can
be really good because the buyers are

4768
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:57,760
be really good because the buyers are
 

4769
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,629
be really good because the buyers are
waiting to be picked up.

4770
01:50:00,629 --> 01:50:00,639
waiting to be picked up.
 

4771
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:02,790
waiting to be picked up.
Not now. Well, it's actually it actually

4772
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:02,800
Not now. Well, it's actually it actually
 

4773
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,550
Not now. Well, it's actually it actually
is a really key level now, but not

4774
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:04,560
is a really key level now, but not
 

4775
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,990
is a really key level now, but not
because of that. Actually, because of

4776
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:06,000
because of that. Actually, because of
 

4777
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:16,709
because of that. Actually, because of
the higher time frame.

4778
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:16,719

 

4779
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:19,669

Thanks, Jay. Okay, back to that IB. So,

4780
01:50:19,669 --> 01:50:19,679
Thanks, Jay. Okay, back to that IB. So,
 

4781
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,430
Thanks, Jay. Okay, back to that IB. So,
I would just be careful here if you're a

4782
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:21,440
I would just be careful here if you're a
 

4783
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,030
I would just be careful here if you're a
buyer. If they have failure to follow

4784
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:23,040
buyer. If they have failure to follow
 

4785
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:27,510
buyer. If they have failure to follow
through here, it's a big if.

4786
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:27,520
through here, it's a big if.
 

4787
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,629
through here, it's a big if.
Sellers will try and hold this here or

4788
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:30,639
Sellers will try and hold this here or
 

4789
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,950
Sellers will try and hold this here or
this rotation like this. This this is a

4790
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:32,960
this rotation like this. This this is a
 

4791
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,189
this rotation like this. This this is a
much safer entry than this here. This

4792
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:35,199
much safer entry than this here. This
 

4793
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:38,070
much safer entry than this here. This
can still absorb off this and try and

4794
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:38,080
can still absorb off this and try and
 

4795
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,149
can still absorb off this and try and
complete the rotation. Absolutely can do

4796
01:50:40,149 --> 01:50:40,159
complete the rotation. Absolutely can do
 

4797
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:41,750
complete the rotation. Absolutely can do
that. But you are now in a battle of

4798
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:41,760
that. But you are now in a battle of
 

4799
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:45,669
that. But you are now in a battle of
premium. Right. This is your battle.

4800
01:50:45,669 --> 01:50:45,679
premium. Right. This is your battle.
 

4801
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,669
premium. Right. This is your battle.
Buy still defending this gray box for

Buy still defending this gray box for
 

4803
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:49,350
Buy still defending this gray box for
now.

4804
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:49,360
now.
 

4805
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,109
now.
We have a sellside imbalance all the way

4806
01:50:51,109 --> 01:50:51,119
We have a sellside imbalance all the way
 

4807
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:52,950
We have a sellside imbalance all the way
up to 87s.

4808
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:52,960
up to 87s.
 

4809
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,310
up to 87s.
Just zoom this in. Where did those

4810
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:54,320
Just zoom this in. Where did those
 

4811
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,950
Just zoom this in. Where did those
sellers come in? They came in at 80 and

4812
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:56,960
sellers come in? They came in at 80 and
 

4813
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,790
sellers come in? They came in at 80 and
87s. Yeah. So, sellers will want to

4814
01:50:58,790 --> 01:50:58,800
87s. Yeah. So, sellers will want to
 

4815
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,350
87s. Yeah. So, sellers will want to
defend 87s. Through 87s, they will start

4816
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,360
defend 87s. Through 87s, they will start
 

4817
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:11,830
defend 87s. Through 87s, they will start
to get caught potentially.

4818
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:11,840

 

4819
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,669

Take care, Graity. Yeah, it's not been

4820
01:51:13,669 --> 01:51:13,679
Take care, Graity. Yeah, it's not been
 

4821
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:15,830
Take care, Graity. Yeah, it's not been
nice since we broken out. It's been much

4822
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:15,840
nice since we broken out. It's been much

01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:36,639
Did ES just hold those tens? It did.
 

4831
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:38,790
Did ES just hold those tens? It did.
Yes. Just hold that old naked PC. Just

4832
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:38,800
Yes. Just hold that old naked PC. Just
 

4833
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,109
Yes. Just hold that old naked PC. Just
went wick to wick and held. You might

4834
01:51:41,109 --> 01:51:41,119
went wick to wick and held. You might
 

4835
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:45,109
went wick to wick and held. You might
get it here. It might go for you.

4836
01:51:45,109 --> 01:51:45,119
get it here. It might go for you.
 

4837
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:52,950
get it here. It might go for you.
You might get a squeeze here. ENQ

4839
01:51:52,960 --> 01:52:00,229

is my bread and butter that

4840
01:52:00,229 --> 01:52:00,239

 

4841
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:02,390

much love, Alex. Made 1,000 bucks with

4842
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:02,400
much love, Alex. Made 1,000 bucks with
 

4843
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,790
much love, Alex. Made 1,000 bucks with
the entry long. Appreciate it. Nice.

4844
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:04,800
the entry long. Appreciate it. Nice.
 

4845
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,070
the entry long. Appreciate it. Nice.
Okay, we're coming up to the top of the

4846
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,080
Okay, we're coming up to the top of the
 

4847
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:12,550
Okay, we're coming up to the top of the
hour. So, new hourly bar incoming here

4848
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:12,560

 

4849
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,790

in 5 seconds. I might get a bit of

4850
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:14,800
in 5 seconds. I might get a bit of
 

4851
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,470
in 5 seconds. I might get a bit of
injection of liquidity into this. Here

4852
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:16,480
injection of liquidity into this. Here
 

4853
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,790
injection of liquidity into this. Here
we go. See if they do anything with it

4854
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:18,800
we go. See if they do anything with it
 

4855
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,790
we go. See if they do anything with it
like lift it. And they try. They are

4856
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:20,800
like lift it. And they try. They are
 

4857
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,669
like lift it. And they try. They are
trying. And we said imbalance is up to

4858
01:52:23,669 --> 01:52:23,679
trying. And we said imbalance is up to
 

4859
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:26,470
trying. And we said imbalance is up to
87s. ES looks like it wants a new high

4860
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:26,480
87s. ES looks like it wants a new high
 

4861
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,149
87s. ES looks like it wants a new high
here. ENQ might very well join and you

4862
01:52:28,149 --> 01:52:28,159
here. ENQ might very well join and you
 

4863
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:30,470
here. ENQ might very well join and you
might get that 100 now if they can get

4864
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,480
might get that 100 now if they can get
 

4865
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,550
might get that 100 now if they can get
through this. You what you will not want

4866
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:32,560
through this. You what you will not want
 

4867
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,430
through this. You what you will not want
to see as a buyer is it fail this level

4868
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:35,440
to see as a buyer is it fail this level
 

4869
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,510
to see as a buyer is it fail this level
here, right? The 87s, right? Because

4870
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:37,520
here, right? The 87s, right? Because
 

4871
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,109
here, right? The 87s, right? Because
that will be failure to follow through

4872
01:52:39,109 --> 01:52:39,119
that will be failure to follow through
 

4873
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:43,030
that will be failure to follow through
and that can lead to this move here.

4874
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:43,040
and that can lead to this move here.
 

4875
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,270
and that can lead to this move here.
Here we go. 86 87s. This is testing the

4876
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:45,280
Here we go. 86 87s. This is testing the
 

4877
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,830
Here we go. 86 87s. This is testing the
imbalance. we just talked about

4878
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:47,840
imbalance. we just talked about
 

4879
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,709
imbalance. we just talked about
right up to here. 87s.

4880
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:50,719
right up to here. 87s.
 

4881
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:52,950
right up to here. 87s.
Can they lift through 88s? They can.

4882
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:52,960
Can they lift through 88s? They can.
 

4883
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,629
Can they lift through 88s? They can.
They are trying. They want to get to the

4884
01:52:54,629 --> 01:52:54,639
They are trying. They want to get to the
 

4885
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:57,270
They are trying. They want to get to the
100. New alltime highs on uh SPY again.

4886
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:57,280
100. New alltime highs on uh SPY again.
 

4887
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:01,189
100. New alltime highs on uh SPY again.
New high high day breakout

4888
01:53:01,189 --> 01:53:01,199
New high high day breakout
 

4889
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:03,430
New high high day breakout
into this imbalance here. Here's the 88.

4890
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
into this imbalance here. Here's the 88.
 

4891
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,030
into this imbalance here. Here's the 88.
Can they lift this for a new alltime

4892
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:05,040
Can they lift this for a new alltime
 

4893
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:08,070
Can they lift this for a new alltime
high? Can you get any more through here?

4894
01:53:08,070 --> 01:53:08,080
high? Can you get any more through here?
 

4895
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,750
high? Can you get any more through here?
So, this is the level that sellers are

4896
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:09,760
So, this is the level that sellers are
 

4897
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:13,189
So, this is the level that sellers are
trying to defend.

4898
01:53:13,189 --> 01:53:13,199

 

4899
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:14,550

And if they get through here, you'll get

4900
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:14,560
And if they get through here, you'll get
 

4901
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,629
And if they get through here, you'll get
100 and then maybe 150s.

4902
01:53:18,629 --> 01:53:18,639
100 and then maybe 150s.
 

4903
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,709
100 and then maybe 150s.
This is a big big level for sellers to

4904
01:53:20,709 --> 01:53:20,719
This is a big big level for sellers to
 

4905
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:23,030
This is a big big level for sellers to
defend here. Huge level. If buyers

4906
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,040
defend here. Huge level. If buyers
 

4907
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,870
defend here. Huge level. If buyers
cannot get a higher day break here, this

4908
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:24,880
cannot get a higher day break here, this
 

4909
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,709
cannot get a higher day break here, this
will be a fail failure to follow through

4910
01:53:26,709 --> 01:53:26,719
will be a fail failure to follow through
 

4911
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:35,830
will be a fail failure to follow through
in my mind.

4912
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:35,840

 

4913
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,830

Will I announce when I get in a trade? I

4914
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:37,840
Will I announce when I get in a trade? I
 

4915
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:42,149
Will I announce when I get in a trade? I
mean,

4916
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:42,159

 

4917
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,990

I I don't know if I could have made it

4918
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:44,000
I I don't know if I could have made it
 

4919
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,149
I I don't know if I could have made it
more obvious today. I told you where I

4920
01:53:46,149 --> 01:53:46,159
more obvious today. I told you where I
 

4921
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:48,550
more obvious today. I told you where I
was looking to buy pre-market. I told

4922
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:48,560
was looking to buy pre-market. I told
 

4923
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,709
was looking to buy pre-market. I told
you where sellers were stuck and I told

4924
01:53:50,709 --> 01:53:50,719
you where sellers were stuck and I told
 

4925
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:52,550
you where sellers were stuck and I told
you through 40s would be a squeeze

4926
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:52,560
you through 40s would be a squeeze
 

4927
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,070
you through 40s would be a squeeze
trigger. I mean,

4928
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:56,080
trigger. I mean,
 

4929
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,070
trigger. I mean,
there's literally like I'm telling you

4930
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:58,080
there's literally like I'm telling you
 

4931
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:01,109
there's literally like I'm telling you
when I did it like

4932
01:54:01,109 --> 01:54:01,119
when I did it like
 

4933
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:02,390
when I did it like
there's nothing for me to do up here.

4934
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:02,400
there's nothing for me to do up here.
 

4935
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,709
there's nothing for me to do up here.
I'm not looking to buy in premium for

4936
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:04,719
I'm not looking to buy in premium for
 

4937
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,310
I'm not looking to buy in premium for
the rotation up. It's not a trade that

4938
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:06,320
the rotation up. It's not a trade that
 

4939
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,990
the rotation up. It's not a trade that
I'm looking for today. I was looking for

4940
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:08,000
I'm looking for today. I was looking for
 

4941
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,669
I'm looking for today. I was looking for
this trade today. That's what I prepared

4942
01:54:09,669 --> 01:54:09,679
this trade today. That's what I prepared
 

4943
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,270
this trade today. That's what I prepared
for. That's what I hit. I would have

4944
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:11,280
for. That's what I hit. I would have
 

4945
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,109
for. That's what I hit. I would have
loved to been holding a runner for the

4946
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:13,119
loved to been holding a runner for the
 

4947
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:15,189
loved to been holding a runner for the
continuation. But remember, I bought

4948
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:15,199
continuation. But remember, I bought
 

4949
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:19,589
continuation. But remember, I bought
today at 29 25,940.

4950
01:54:19,589 --> 01:54:19,599
today at 29 25,940.
 

4951
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:22,470
today at 29 25,940.
I don't want to be buying all the way up

4952
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:22,480
I don't want to be buying all the way up
 

4953
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:28,470
I don't want to be buying all the way up
here. Now,

4954
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:28,480

 

4955
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,070

it's not a trade that I'm looking to

4956
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:30,080
it's not a trade that I'm looking to
 

4957
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:33,589
it's not a trade that I'm looking to
take.

4958
01:54:33,589 --> 01:54:33,599

 

4959
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:35,270

Doesn't mean it can't go higher. It's

4960
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:35,280
Doesn't mean it can't go higher. It's
 

4961
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,950
Doesn't mean it can't go higher. It's
just not a trade that I'm looking to

4962
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:36,960
just not a trade that I'm looking to
 

4963
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,550
just not a trade that I'm looking to
take.

4964
01:54:38,550 --> 01:54:38,560
take.
 

4965
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:42,390
take.
Can I show bookm? Isn't Is it not on me?

4966
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:42,400
Can I show bookm? Isn't Is it not on me?
 

4967
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,910
Can I show bookm? Isn't Is it not on me?
You want it bigger, you mean? There you

4968
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:43,920
You want it bigger, you mean? There you
 

4969
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:50,790
You want it bigger, you mean? There you
go.

4970
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:50,800

 

4971
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,629

These same levels of interest, right?

4972
01:54:52,629 --> 01:54:52,639
These same levels of interest, right?
 

4973
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:55,430
These same levels of interest, right?
This was the breakout they held. This is

4974
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:55,440
This was the breakout they held. This is
 

4975
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,870
This was the breakout they held. This is
now looking like failure to follow

4976
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:56,880
now looking like failure to follow
 

4977
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,270
now looking like failure to follow
through. And underneath this will be a

4978
01:54:59,270 --> 01:54:59,280
through. And underneath this will be a
 

4979
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:03,830
through. And underneath this will be a
problem if they come underneath that.

4980
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:03,840

 

4981
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:07,030

back to this like mini shelf here. 70s

4982
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:07,040
back to this like mini shelf here. 70s
 

4983
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,790
back to this like mini shelf here. 70s
again.

4984
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:08,800
again.
 

4985
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,950
again.
I would be very very careful if they

4986
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:10,960
I would be very very careful if they
 

4987
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,510
I would be very very careful if they
start to rotate this and let go. Very

4988
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:13,520
start to rotate this and let go. Very
 

4989
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,390
start to rotate this and let go. Very
very very careful here.

4990
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:18,400

 

4991
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:37,430

Is it a dangerous point here?

4992
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:37,440

 

4993
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,229

It's messy. VIX keeps approaching

4994
01:55:40,229 --> 01:55:40,239
It's messy. VIX keeps approaching
 

4995
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:41,910
It's messy. VIX keeps approaching
previous day low. If VIX starts trading

4996
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:41,920
previous day low. If VIX starts trading
 

4997
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,470
previous day low. If VIX starts trading
inside previous day low, we might

4998
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,480
inside previous day low, we might
 

4999
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,990
inside previous day low, we might
struggle for a bigger breakout. If it

5000
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,000
struggle for a bigger breakout. If it
 

5001
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:53,270
struggle for a bigger breakout. If it
keeps rejecting it, might be all right.

5002
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:53,280

 

5003
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,270

Yeah, all the bookmap setups all in the

5004
01:55:55,270 --> 01:55:55,280
Yeah, all the bookmap setups all in the
 

5005
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,910
Yeah, all the bookmap setups all in the
volume profile course, right? So, volume

5006
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:57,920
volume profile course, right? So, volume
 

5007
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,270
volume profile course, right? So, volume
profile and order flow course. So, go

5008
01:55:59,270 --> 01:55:59,280
profile and order flow course. So, go
 

5009
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,990
profile and order flow course. So, go
over a bookmint volume profiles, how to

5010
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:02,000
over a bookmint volume profiles, how to
 

5011
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:11,990
over a bookmint volume profiles, how to
trade them, everything's in that course.

5012
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:12,000

 

5013
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,750

Sorry, I wasn't in chat earlier. You

5014
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:13,760
Sorry, I wasn't in chat earlier. You
 

5015
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,830
Sorry, I wasn't in chat earlier. You
mentioned your play before the open. No,

5016
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:15,840
mentioned your play before the open. No,
 

5017
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,830
mentioned your play before the open. No,
no play before before. There was no play

5018
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:17,840
no play before before. There was no play
 

5019
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,430
no play before before. There was no play
before the open. Just the just this

5020
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:19,440
before the open. Just the just this
 

5021
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:22,149
before the open. Just the just this
drive. I was saying we talked about why

5022
01:56:22,149 --> 01:56:22,159
drive. I was saying we talked about why
 

5023
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:23,830
drive. I was saying we talked about why
I was looking for this before the open.

5024
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:23,840
I was looking for this before the open.
 

5025
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,589
I was looking for this before the open.
This is what I was planned out for

5026
01:56:25,589 --> 01:56:25,599
This is what I was planned out for
 

5027
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:27,589
This is what I was planned out for
before the open. Right. So, we talked

5028
01:56:27,589 --> 01:56:27,599
before the open. Right. So, we talked
 

5029
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:31,589
before the open. Right. So, we talked
about it on stream and

5030
01:56:31,589 --> 01:56:31,599
about it on stream and
 

5031
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:34,390
about it on stream and
right here. Talked about it right here,

5032
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:34,400
right here. Talked about it right here,
 

5033
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,310
right here. Talked about it right here,
right in Discord. Right. This is what I

5034
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:36,320
right in Discord. Right. This is what I
 

5035
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,790
right in Discord. Right. This is what I
was looking for. And possibly later on

5036
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:38,800
was looking for. And possibly later on
 

5037
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,390
was looking for. And possibly later on
in the week, if we can find acceptance

5038
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:40,400
in the week, if we can find acceptance
 

5039
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,109
in the week, if we can find acceptance
above 26,120, which is what we're trying

5040
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:43,119
above 26,120, which is what we're trying
 

5041
01:56:43,119 --> 01:56:45,109
above 26,120, which is what we're trying
to get up into here, above this, maybe

5042
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:45,119
to get up into here, above this, maybe
 

5043
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:57,430
to get up into here, above this, maybe
there's a continuation trade.

5044
01:56:57,430 --> 01:56:57,440

 

5045
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:59,030

What did I use for confirmation? Just

5046
01:56:59,030 --> 01:56:59,040
What did I use for confirmation? Just
 

5047
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,270
What did I use for confirmation? Just
the sellers that got trapped at the lows

5048
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:01,280
the sellers that got trapped at the lows
 

5049
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,669
the sellers that got trapped at the lows
today. So down here, sellers got trapped

5050
01:57:03,669 --> 01:57:03,679
today. So down here, sellers got trapped
 

5051
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:06,310
today. So down here, sellers got trapped
underneath the 40, right? So, they got

5052
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,320
underneath the 40, right? So, they got
 

5053
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:09,669
underneath the 40, right? So, they got
trapped.

5054
01:57:09,669 --> 01:57:09,679

 

5055
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:12,070

It wasn't the best. I would have liked a

5056
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:12,080
It wasn't the best. I would have liked a
 

5057
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,350
It wasn't the best. I would have liked a
better a better auction, but you can see

5058
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:13,360
better a better auction, but you can see
 

5059
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:15,430
better a better auction, but you can see
where I've marked it out, right? These

5060
01:57:15,430 --> 01:57:15,440
where I've marked it out, right? These
 

5061
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:16,629
where I've marked it out, right? These
sellers got trapped. There's there's

5062
01:57:16,629 --> 01:57:16,639
sellers got trapped. There's there's
 

5063
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:19,270
sellers got trapped. There's there's
your 40, right? Big sellers came in.

5064
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:19,280
your 40, right? Big sellers came in.
 

5065
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,270
your 40, right? Big sellers came in.
Delta flipped from negative to positive

5066
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:21,280
Delta flipped from negative to positive
 

5067
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,550
Delta flipped from negative to positive
and then we held and we held the

5068
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:22,560
and then we held and we held the
 

5069
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,229
and then we held and we held the
pullback. That was another seller got

5070
01:57:24,229 --> 01:57:24,239
pullback. That was another seller got
 

5071
01:57:24,239 --> 01:57:26,070
pullback. That was another seller got
trapped again here at 45. So, that was a

5072
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:26,080
trapped again here at 45. So, that was a
 

5073
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:32,950
trapped again here at 45. So, that was a
confirmation.

5074
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:32,960

 

5075
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,470

It's what I always want to see. If if

5076
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:34,480
It's what I always want to see. If if
 

5077
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,149
It's what I always want to see. If if
we're coming into a demand level and

5078
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:36,159
we're coming into a demand level and
 

5079
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:37,910
we're coming into a demand level and
sellers get trapped down there, that's

5080
01:57:37,910 --> 01:57:37,920
sellers get trapped down there, that's
 

5081
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,470
sellers get trapped down there, that's
when I'm like, "Yeah, we're going."

5082
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:40,480
when I'm like, "Yeah, we're going."
 

5083
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,629
when I'm like, "Yeah, we're going."
Right. This thing is trying to break

5084
01:57:42,629 --> 01:57:42,639
Right. This thing is trying to break
 

5085
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:48,149
Right. This thing is trying to break
out. It's trying to get up to the 100.

5086
01:57:48,149 --> 01:57:48,159

 

5087

Yes, it's trying to get going
 

5089
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,990
Yes, it's trying to get going
back to that key level again. Can we get

5090
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:54,000
back to that key level again. Can we get
 

5091
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,830
back to that key level again. Can we get
acceptance? You should really squeeze

5092
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:55,840
acceptance? You should really squeeze
 

5093
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,430
acceptance? You should really squeeze
through the 100 now and start going, but

5094
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:57,440
through the 100 now and start going, but
 

5095
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,109

it's struggling. They keep unloading
 

5097
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:01,350
it's struggling. They keep unloading

01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:30,149
Here they go. So, they're going to try
again at the hundreds. Is the liquidity

5120
01:58:30,149 --> 01:58:30,159
again at the hundreds. Is the liquidity
 

5121
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:31,990
again at the hundreds. Is the liquidity
above? Yeah, liquidity stacked all the

5122
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:32,000
above? Yeah, liquidity stacked all the
 

5123
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,669
above? Yeah, liquidity stacked all the
way up to 10, 15s, and even 25s now. So

5124
01:58:35,669 --> 01:58:35,679
way up to 10, 15s, and even 25s now. So
 

5125

They're still stacked there, but you got
 

5237
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:29,830
They're still stacked there, but you got
liquidity higher.

5239
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:31,589

Just watch the VIX. It's the only thing

5240
02:01:31,589 --> 02:01:31,599
Just watch the VIX. It's the only thing
 

5241
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:33,270
Just watch the VIX. It's the only thing
I'd say right now. VIX trading right at

5242
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:33,280
I'd say right now. VIX trading right at
 

5243
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,790
I'd say right now. VIX trading right at
previous day low. If it's VIX start

5244
02:01:34,790 --> 02:01:34,800
previous day low. If it's VIX start
 

5245
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,550
previous day low. If it's VIX start
squeeze through that, you might see a

5246
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:36,560
squeeze through that, you might see a
 

5247
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,070
squeeze through that, you might see a
bit of weakness coming to ES, which

5248
02:01:38,070 --> 02:01:38,080
bit of weakness coming to ES, which
 

5249
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:40,390
bit of weakness coming to ES, which
would not be ideal for where we are

5250
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:40,400
would not be ideal for where we are
 

5251
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:47,750
would not be ideal for where we are
placed timing wise on MQ.

There was no reason to to be short down

yeah, it will be these up here.
We can put some lines on these.

5440
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:37,920
We can put some lines on these.
 

5441
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:56,870
We can put some lines on these.
This block here,

5442
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:56,880

 

5443
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,990

that's what we're looking to trade to.

5444
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:00,000
that's what we're looking to trade to.
 

5445
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,750
that's what we're looking to trade to.
These are all the stops. So there's one

5446
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:01,760
These are all the stops. So there's one
 

5447
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,589
These are all the stops. So there's one
lot of stops here at 100 and then

5448
02:07:03,589 --> 02:07:03,599
lot of stops here at 100 and then
 

5449
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:05,830
lot of stops here at 100 and then
through that into 20s then through that

5450
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:05,840
through that into 20s then through that
 

5451
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,470
through that into 20s then through that
into 30s and then through that into 45s.

5452
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:08,480
into 30s and then through that into 45s.
 

5453
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:10,470
into 30s and then through that into 45s.
Right? These are all stops. All right.

5454
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:10,480
Right? These are all stops. All right.
 

5455
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:14,390
Right? These are all stops. All right.
So swing stops are here here and here.

5456
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:14,400
So swing stops are here here and here.
 

5457
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:16,709
So swing stops are here here and here.
Ultimately here over here. All right. If

5458
02:07:16,709 --> 02:07:16,719
Ultimately here over here. All right. If
 

5459
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:19,189
Ultimately here over here. All right. If
we base and hold then over this the rest

5460
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:19,199
we base and hold then over this the rest
 

5461
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:20,790
we base and hold then over this the rest
of the week we are going to be very very

5462
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:20,800
of the week we are going to be very very
 

5463
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,629
of the week we are going to be very very
bullish. If we do a fail breakout and

5464
02:07:22,629 --> 02:07:22,639
bullish. If we do a fail breakout and
 

5465
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:25,589
bullish. If we do a fail breakout and
start losing I mean depends how we build

5466
02:07:25,589 --> 02:07:25,599
start losing I mean depends how we build
 

5467
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:27,669
start losing I mean depends how we build
out profile then we can think about a

5468
02:07:27,669 --> 02:07:27,679
out profile then we can think about a
 

5469
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:29,750
out profile then we can think about a
rotation later in the week. But this is

5470
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:29,760
rotation later in the week. But this is
 

5471
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:30,790
rotation later in the week. But this is
where we're trying to get to. If you

5472
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:30,800
where we're trying to get to. If you
 

5473
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:32,390
where we're trying to get to. If you
read the weekly newsletter, you will

5474
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:32,400
read the weekly newsletter, you will
 

5475
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,229
read the weekly newsletter, you will
know where we're trying to get to. You

5476
02:07:34,229 --> 02:07:34,239
know where we're trying to get to. You
 

5477
02:07:34,239 --> 02:07:35,510
know where we're trying to get to. You
absolutely know already where we're

5478
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:35,520
absolutely know already where we're
 

5479
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:38,870
absolutely know already where we're
trying to get to.

5480
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:38,880

 

5481
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,589

This is making it ridiculously hard to

5482
02:07:41,589 --> 02:07:41,599
This is making it ridiculously hard to
 

5483
02:07:41,599 --> 02:07:53,350
This is making it ridiculously hard to
move that extra T. It's only 125 lot.

5484
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:53,360

 

5485
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:54,550

Getting stuck here. The longer you're

5486
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:54,560
Getting stuck here. The longer you're
 

5487
02:07:54,560 --> 02:08:06,390
Getting stuck here. The longer you're
stuck here, the worse it is.

5488
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:06,400

 

5489
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,990

How to use imbalances on the footprint

5490
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:08,000
How to use imbalances on the footprint
 

5491
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,030
How to use imbalances on the footprint
for your trading? Well, you just got to

5492
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,040
for your trading? Well, you just got to
 

5493
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,589
for your trading? Well, you just got to
think all in imbalance is where is where

5494
02:08:11,589 --> 02:08:11,599
think all in imbalance is where is where
 

5495
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:13,589
think all in imbalance is where is where
we got very we got very very aggressive

5496
02:08:13,589 --> 02:08:13,599
we got very we got very very aggressive
 

5497
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:18,069
we got very we got very very aggressive
very very quickly. So, if we think about

5498
02:08:18,069 --> 02:08:18,079
very very quickly. So, if we think about
 

5499
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:21,510
very very quickly. So, if we think about
this, right, this big move, it means

5500
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:21,520
this, right, this big move, it means
 

5501
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:23,189
this, right, this big move, it means
there'd be limit orders still sat there

5502
02:08:23,189 --> 02:08:23,199
there'd be limit orders still sat there
 

5503
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:24,950
there'd be limit orders still sat there
waiting to get filled. So, they got

5504
02:08:24,950 --> 02:08:24,960
waiting to get filled. So, they got
 

5505
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:26,470
waiting to get filled. So, they got
filled and then we trade higher. So

5506
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
filled and then we trade higher. So
 

5507
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,669
filled and then we trade higher. So
that's how you would use an imbalance.

5508
02:08:27,669 --> 02:08:27,679
that's how you would use an imbalance.
 

5509
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:28,950
that's how you would use an imbalance.
I'm just using that as an example

5510
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:28,960
I'm just using that as an example
 

5511
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:31,990
I'm just using that as an example
assuming there's an imbalance in there,

5512
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:32,000
assuming there's an imbalance in there,
 

5513
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,910
assuming there's an imbalance in there,
right? So they can be areas of

5514
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:33,920
right? So they can be areas of
 

5515
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:36,470
right? So they can be areas of
attraction where the market wants to

5516
02:08:36,470 --> 02:08:36,480
attraction where the market wants to
 

5517
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,069
attraction where the market wants to
move to where where they're resting

5518
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:38,079
move to where where they're resting
 

5519
02:08:38,079 --> 02:08:40,550
move to where where they're resting
orders still waiting to get picked up.

5520
02:08:40,550 --> 02:08:40,560
orders still waiting to get picked up.
 

5521
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:54,149
orders still waiting to get picked up.
Come on, just swipe it. Jeez,

5522
02:08:54,149 --> 02:08:54,159

5531
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:07,109
That guy just got taken out.
All right, so you've hit next TP. We

5532
02:09:07,109 --> 02:09:07,119
All right, so you've hit next TP. We
 

5533
02:09:07,119 --> 02:09:08,790
All right, so you've hit next TP. We
hopefully should squeeze up here to like

5534
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:08,800
hopefully should squeeze up here to like
 

5535
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:11,270
hopefully should squeeze up here to like
15s and above. Here you go. That's what

5642
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:46,079
next target
 

5643
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:48,950
next target
is probably here. 20s

5644
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:48,960
is probably here. 20s
 

5645
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:52,390
is probably here. 20s
and 27s and then 36s. All right, that's

5646
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:52,400
and 27s and then 36s. All right, that's

it. That's your target. Look at the
[clears throat] expansion.

5650
02:11:56,149 --> 02:11:56,159
[clears throat] expansion.
 

5651
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:58,550
[clears throat] expansion.
Where is this low?

5652
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:58,560
Where is this low?
 

5653
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,550
Where is this low?
Very similar to what we did on ENQ. Same

5654
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:00,560
Very similar to what we did on ENQ. Same
 

5655
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:01,910
Very similar to what we did on ENQ. Same
kind of setup. Buying the dips this

5656
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:01,920
kind of setup. Buying the dips this
 

5657
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,589
kind of setup. Buying the dips this
morning.

5658
02:12:03,589 --> 02:12:03,599
morning.
 

5659
02:12:03,599 --> 02:12:07,430
morning.
You're at the 1618. So it's TP1 24s 24s

5660
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:07,440
You're at the 1618. So it's TP1 24s 24s
 

5661
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:11,350
You're at the 1618. So it's TP1 24s 24s
25s next. So liquidity here 1618 is the

5662
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:11,360
25s next. So liquidity here 1618 is the
 

5663
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,109
25s next. So liquidity here 1618 is the
same level as this liquidity here into

5664
02:12:13,109 --> 02:12:13,119
same level as this liquidity here into
 

5665
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:16,390
same level as this liquidity here into
sort of 17s big TP here. Next level for

5666
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:16,400
sort of 17s big TP here. Next level for
 

5667
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:19,350
sort of 17s big TP here. Next level for
a measured move will be into 24s and

5668
02:12:19,350 --> 02:12:19,360
a measured move will be into 24s and
 

5669
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:21,990
a measured move will be into 24s and
then liquidity sat there at 27s and then

5670
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:22,000
then liquidity sat there at 27s and then
 

5671
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,950
then liquidity sat there at 27s and then
look 2618 is the all-time high. All

5672
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:24,960
look 2618 is the all-time high. All
 

5673
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,470
look 2618 is the all-time high. All
right, it is also set up there with

5674
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:26,480
right, it is also set up there with
 

5675
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,470
right, it is also set up there with
liquidity. So the fibs are matching very

5676
02:12:28,470 --> 02:12:28,480
liquidity. So the fibs are matching very
 

5677
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:30,870
liquidity. So the fibs are matching very
very well with where resting stops are

5678
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:30,880
very well with where resting stops are
 

5679
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:36,149
very well with where resting stops are
right now. Very very well.

5680
02:12:36,149 --> 02:12:36,159

 

5681
02:12:36,159 --> 02:12:38,069

I mean, what do I know? I I don't know

5682
02:12:38,069 --> 02:12:38,079
I mean, what do I know? I I don't know
 

5683
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:41,430
I mean, what do I know? I I don't know
anything.

5684
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:41,440

 

5685
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,669

I have no idea what I'm doing. It's just

5686
02:12:43,669 --> 02:12:43,679
I have no idea what I'm doing. It's just
 

5687
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:47,109
I have no idea what I'm doing. It's just
It's just pure luck. I just I just hope.

5688
02:12:47,109 --> 02:12:47,119

Starting to see a little bit of weakness
 

5851
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,550
Starting to see a little bit of weakness
at these highs here, folks. So, still

5852
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:34,560
at these highs here, folks. So, still
 

5853
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:37,990
at these highs here, folks. So, still
bullish overall, but definitely seeing

bullish overall, but definitely seeing
 

5855
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,550
bullish overall, but definitely seeing
some weakness here as you start to lose

some weakness here as you start to lose
 

5857

some weakness here as you start to lose
this level. All right, there is

5858
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:42,000
this level. All right, there is
 

5859
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,990
this level. All right, there is
potential for a rotation back down at

02:20:43,990 --> 02:20:44,000
potential for a rotation back down at
 

5861
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,270
potential for a rotation back down at
some point. I'm not playing shorts

5873

Dave, you were here. Why didn't you

5874
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:18,800
Dave, you were here. Why didn't you
 

5875
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:26,150
Dave, you were here. Why didn't you
reply? Dave, what happened?

5876
02:21:26,150 --> 02:21:26,160

 

5877
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:28,469

I will honor it for you. Even though you

You're welcome. No worries.
 

5895

You're welcome. No worries.
You're welcome.

5896
02:21:56,469 --> 02:21:56,479

 

5897
02:21:56,479 --> 02:22:02,550

What do I think of 26,077

5898
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:02,560

 

5899
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:04,630

just around the IB? I mean, it's a it's

5900
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:04,640
just around the IB? I mean, it's a it's
 

5901
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:07,830
just around the IB? I mean, it's a it's
an interesting level.

5902
02:22:07,830 --> 02:22:07,840
an interesting level.
 

5903
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,990
an interesting level.
It's definitely

5904
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:10,000
It's definitely
 

5905
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,910
It's definitely
a pivot.

5906
02:22:11,910 --> 02:22:11,920
a pivot.
 

5907
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:15,110
a pivot.
The short will come underneath.

5908
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:15,120
The short will come underneath.
 

5909
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:17,510
The short will come underneath.
We might we can very easily do this for

5910
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:17,520
We might we can very easily do this for
 

5911
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:18,950
We might we can very easily do this for
the rest of the day. Look how we bu

5912
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:18,960
the rest of the day. Look how we bu
 

5913
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:20,469
the rest of the day. Look how we bu
building out volume here. Look how thin

5914
02:22:20,469 --> 02:22:20,479
building out volume here. Look how thin
 

5915
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:23,750
building out volume here. Look how thin
we are under here.

5916
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:23,760
we are under here.
 

5917
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,550
we are under here.
We can easily do this. If we start to

5918
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:26,560
We can easily do this. If we start to
 

5919
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,870
We can easily do this. If we start to
lose that that rotation under can

5920
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:28,880
lose that that rotation under can
 

5921
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:30,790
lose that that rotation under can
happen. I certainly don't want to be

5922
02:22:30,790 --> 02:22:30,800
happen. I certainly don't want to be
 

5923
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:32,710
happen. I certainly don't want to be
long up here.

5924
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:32,720
long up here.
 

5925
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:34,870
long up here.
Certainly not.

5926
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:34,880
Certainly not.
 

5927
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:38,070
Certainly not.
But we're starting to see

5928
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:38,080
But we're starting to see
 

5929
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,510
But we're starting to see
what was the top of that auction look

5930
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:39,520
what was the top of that auction look
 

5931
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:40,950
what was the top of that auction look
like. It was probably quite good, I

5932
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:40,960
like. It was probably quite good, I
 

5933
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:46,389
like. It was probably quite good, I
would imagine.

5934
02:22:46,389 --> 02:22:46,399

 

5935
02:22:46,399 --> 02:22:47,910

It's a pretty good high auction up

5936
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:47,920
It's a pretty good high auction up
 

5937
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:50,469
It's a pretty good high auction up
there.

5938
02:22:50,469 --> 02:22:50,479
there.
 

5939
02:22:50,479 --> 02:22:54,710
there.
Some buyers caught up here.

5940
02:22:54,710 --> 02:22:54,720

 

5941
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:57,429

So, if they can't reclaim that,

5942
02:22:57,429 --> 02:22:57,439
So, if they can't reclaim that,
 

5943
02:22:57,439 --> 02:22:59,990
So, if they can't reclaim that,
just came down to that imbalance. They

5944
02:22:59,990 --> 02:23:00,000
just came down to that imbalance. They
 

5945
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,750
just came down to that imbalance. They
can't reclaim that and you start to see

5946
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:01,760
can't reclaim that and you start to see
 

5947
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:04,230
can't reclaim that and you start to see
a backside fade

5948
02:23:04,230 --> 02:23:04,240
a backside fade
 

5949
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:06,230
a backside fade
under here is what's gets important.

5950
02:23:06,230 --> 02:23:06,240
under here is what's gets important.
 

5951
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:08,630
under here is what's gets important.
Until that point, not really, but uh we

5952
02:23:08,630 --> 02:23:08,640
Until that point, not really, but uh we
 

5953
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:10,550
Until that point, not really, but uh we
will see. You just got to remember if

5954
02:23:10,550 --> 02:23:10,560
will see. You just got to remember if
 

5955
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:12,710
will see. You just got to remember if
you're going to try and short today, you

5956
02:23:12,710 --> 02:23:12,720
you're going to try and short today, you
 

5957
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:14,550
you're going to try and short today, you
are trying to play the higher time frame

5958
02:23:14,550 --> 02:23:14,560
are trying to play the higher time frame
 

5959
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:16,070
are trying to play the higher time frame
pullback leg. It's the literally the

5960
02:23:16,070 --> 02:23:16,080
pullback leg. It's the literally the
 

5961
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:18,389
pullback leg. It's the literally the
hardest thing you can do, but it is

5962
02:23:18,389 --> 02:23:18,399
hardest thing you can do, but it is
 

5963
02:23:18,399 --> 02:23:23,990
hardest thing you can do, but it is
potentially going to set up.

5964
02:23:23,990 --> 02:23:24,000

 

5965
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,830

Dave paid a sub as well. Yeah. Well,

5966
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:25,840
Dave paid a sub as well. Yeah. Well,
 

5967
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:29,349
Dave paid a sub as well. Yeah. Well,
Dave's winning one. He's winning one.

5968
02:23:29,349 --> 02:23:29,359
Dave's winning one. He's winning one.
 

5969
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:31,429
Dave's winning one. He's winning one.
We we will honor people who are who come

5970
02:23:31,429 --> 02:23:31,439
We we will honor people who are who come
 

5971
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:33,510
We we will honor people who are who come
back.

5972
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:33,520
back.
 

5973
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:35,510
back.
It's the short scenario. Now, it's only

5974
02:23:35,510 --> 02:23:35,520
It's the short scenario. Now, it's only
 

5975
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:37,750
It's the short scenario. Now, it's only
if Yeah. I mean, one thing I would say

5976
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:37,760
if Yeah. I mean, one thing I would say
 

5977
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:39,830
if Yeah. I mean, one thing I would say
is we are running out of room on the

5978
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:39,840
is we are running out of room on the
 

5979
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,070
is we are running out of room on the
daily, right? Those who have done the

5980
02:23:42,070 --> 02:23:42,080
daily, right? Those who have done the
 

5981
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:44,469
daily, right? Those who have done the
course will understand this.

5982
02:23:44,469 --> 02:23:44,479
course will understand this.
 

5983
02:23:44,479 --> 02:23:45,910
course will understand this.
Look where we are on the daily. Forget

5984
02:23:45,910 --> 02:23:45,920
Look where we are on the daily. Forget
 

5985
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:48,469
Look where we are on the daily. Forget
the red box. We're very close to this

5986
02:23:48,469 --> 02:23:48,479
the red box. We're very close to this
 

5987
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:50,150
the red box. We're very close to this
top ballinger. There isn't much room

5988
02:23:50,150 --> 02:23:50,160
top ballinger. There isn't much room
 

5989
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:52,150
top ballinger. There isn't much room
left. Now,

5990
02:23:52,150 --> 02:23:52,160
left. Now,
 

5991
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:55,349
left. Now,
arguably, we can poke outside of it like

5992
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:55,359
arguably, we can poke outside of it like
 

5993
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:56,790
arguably, we can poke outside of it like
we have done down here. Like, this is

5994
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:56,800
we have done down here. Like, this is
 

5995
02:23:56,800 --> 02:24:00,870
we have done down here. Like, this is
quite a big move outside of it.

5996
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:00,880
quite a big move outside of it.
 

5997
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:02,389
quite a big move outside of it.
The best thing that the market could do

5998
02:24:02,389 --> 02:24:02,399
The best thing that the market could do
 

5999
02:24:02,399 --> 02:24:03,990
The best thing that the market could do
would just be to go sideways for a day

6000
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:04,000
would just be to go sideways for a day
 

6001
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,550
would just be to go sideways for a day
or two and let this Ballinger and five

6002
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:06,560
or two and let this Ballinger and five
 

6003
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:09,429
or two and let this Ballinger and five
days start to do this and then this can

6004
02:24:09,429 --> 02:24:09,439
days start to do this and then this can
 

6005
02:24:09,439 --> 02:24:13,670
days start to do this and then this can

it already priced in? Are we pushing
 

6241
02:29:34,479 --> 02:29:36,070
it already priced in? Are we pushing
because we're pricing it in early? Is it

6242
02:29:36,070 --> 02:29:36,080
because we're pricing it in early? Is it
 

6243
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:37,910

VIX wants to go 1586s.
 

6255
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,750

6263
02:30:00,479 --> 02:30:02,469
looking at that pivot from what 10 1010
this morning.

6264
02:30:02,469 --> 02:30:02,479
this morning.
 

6265
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:03,910
this morning.
It's just trading. You got to understand

6266
02:30:03,910 --> 02:30:03,920
It's just trading. You got to understand
 

6267
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:06,550

it's trading around the pivot from uh

6268
02:30:06,550 --> 02:30:06,560
it's trading around the pivot from uh
 

6269
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:08,550
it's trading around the pivot from uh
yesterday at the moment and it's can't

6270
02:30:08,550 --> 02:30:08,560
yesterday at the moment and it's can't
 

6271
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:10,070
yesterday at the moment and it's can't
get acceptance back through previous day

6272
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:10,080
get acceptance back through previous day
 

6273
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:11,590
get acceptance back through previous day
low. If it finds acceptance back through

6274
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:11,600
low. If it finds acceptance back through
 

6275
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:13,190
low. If it finds acceptance back through
previous day low for a squeeze back out

6276
02:30:13,190 --> 02:30:13,200
previous day low for a squeeze back out
 

6277
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,349
previous day low for a squeeze back out
on the VIX, then maybe this market would

6278
02:30:15,349 --> 02:30:15,359
on the VIX, then maybe this market would
 

6279
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:16,710
on the VIX, then maybe this market would
get weak. But we're not seeing that

6280
02:30:16,710 --> 02:30:16,720
get weak. But we're not seeing that
 

6281
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:19,349
get weak. But we're not seeing that
right now. We're in a slow, grindy

6282
02:30:19,349 --> 02:30:19,359
right now. We're in a slow, grindy
 

6283
02:30:19,359 --> 02:30:20,950

market. You don't want to fade a slow,

6284
02:30:20,950 --> 02:30:20,960
market. You don't want to fade a slow,
 

6285

This is the one, right? My brain can't
 

6299
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:48,150
This is the one, right? My brain can't
work. This is the one which has a big

6300
02:30:48,150 --> 02:30:48,160
work. This is the one which has a big
 

6301
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:52,790
work. This is the one which has a big
Bitcoin holding. Is that right?

6302
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:52,800

 

6303
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,159

Can't even do that pivot properly.

6304
02:30:54,159 --> 02:30:54,169
Can't even do that pivot properly.
 

6305

I mean if they don't get liquidated

6310
02:31:04,550 --> 02:31:04,560
I mean if they don't get liquidated
 

6311
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:31,830
I mean if they don't get liquidated
weak at the moment

6312

02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:36,080

midpoint of that block. It's very
 

6319
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:41,510
midpoint of that block. It's very
interesting.

6320
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,520
interesting.
 

6321
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:44,550
interesting.
152s.

6322
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:44,560

 

6323
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:46,710

Yeah. Um I'm not surprised they're

6324
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:46,720
Yeah. Um I'm not surprised they're
 

6325
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:49,590
Yeah. Um I'm not surprised they're
interested in it. It's if a hold of 152s

6326
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:49,600
interested in it. It's if a hold of 152s
 

6327
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,750
interested in it. It's if a hold of 152s
risking 102s.

6328
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:51,760
risking 102s.
 

6329
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:58,389
risking 102s.
Uh, and a reclaim of we go mid to mid.

6330
02:31:58,389 --> 02:31:58,399

 

6331
02:31:58,399 --> 02:32:01,190

Yeah, there's a trade here. A 152 to a

6332
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:01,200
Yeah, there's a trade here. A 152 to a
 

6333
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,469
Yeah, there's a trade here. A 152 to a
384 trade is possible.

6334
02:32:04,469 --> 02:32:04,479
384 trade is possible.
 

6335
02:32:04,479 --> 02:32:06,309
384 trade is possible.
It's possible, but it really depends on

6336
02:32:06,309 --> 02:32:06,319
It's possible, but it really depends on
 

6337
02:32:06,319 --> 02:32:10,630
It's possible, but it really depends on
BTC. And I'm not convinced

6338
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:10,640
BTC. And I'm not convinced
 

6339
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:13,750
BTC. And I'm not convinced
that this thing's out of the woods yet.

6340
02:32:13,750 --> 02:32:13,760
that this thing's out of the woods yet.
 

6341
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:17,190
that this thing's out of the woods yet.
This has now turned resistance.

6342
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:17,200
This has now turned resistance.
 

6343
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:22,150
This has now turned resistance.
We've only done a single leg.

6344
02:32:22,150 --> 02:32:22,160

 

6345
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:24,230

There has been big institutional buying,

6346
02:32:24,230 --> 02:32:24,240
There has been big institutional buying,
 

6347
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,790
There has been big institutional buying,
but if we see weakness, step in here,

6348
02:32:26,790 --> 02:32:26,800
but if we see weakness, step in here,
 

6349
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:27,990
but if we see weakness, step in here,
all right, we've built out a lot of

6350
02:32:27,990 --> 02:32:28,000
all right, we've built out a lot of
 

6351
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,830
all right, we've built out a lot of
liquidity now there. If they can't do

6352
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:29,840
liquidity now there. If they can't do
 

6353
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:31,910
liquidity now there. If they can't do
this move, there's only one place we're

6354
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:31,920
this move, there's only one place we're
 

6355
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:34,389
this move, there's only one place we're
going, and that is a wash of this. And

6356
02:32:34,389 --> 02:32:34,399
going, and that is a wash of this. And
 

6357
02:32:34,399 --> 02:32:36,630
going, and that is a wash of this. And
that's what would worry me on MSTR is

6358
02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:36,640
that's what would worry me on MSTR is
 

6359
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:39,830
that's what would worry me on MSTR is
that if this gets weak,

6360
02:32:39,830 --> 02:32:39,840
that if this gets weak,
 

6361
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:42,870
that if this gets weak,
it's so pinned on uh

6362
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:42,880
it's so pinned on uh
 

6363
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:44,950
it's so pinned on uh
if this gets weak, this will do the

6364
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:44,960
if this gets weak, this will do the
 

6365
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:47,670
if this gets weak, this will do the
same. It'll come for these

6366
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:47,680
same. It'll come for these
 

6367
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:51,990
same. It'll come for these
into the 100

6368
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:52,000

 

6369
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,910

I don't love exposure to crypto. It's

6370
02:32:53,910 --> 02:32:53,920
I don't love exposure to crypto. It's
 

6371
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:56,950
I don't love exposure to crypto. It's
just me personally, but uh I do have

6372
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:56,960
just me personally, but uh I do have
 

6373
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:59,510
just me personally, but uh I do have
some exposure, but like not on a I'd

6374
02:32:59,510 --> 02:32:59,520
some exposure, but like not on a I'd
 

6375
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:02,790
some exposure, but like not on a I'd
rather trade like wait and and take I

6376
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:02,800
rather trade like wait and and take I
 

6377
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:05,590
rather trade like wait and and take I
bet when it's ready.

6378
02:33:05,590 --> 02:33:05,600
bet when it's ready.
 

6379
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:08,950
bet when it's ready.
I would still love this into here.

6380
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:08,960
I would still love this into here.
 

6381
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:13,270
I would still love this into here.
Remember, this is the like 1,00 1,00

6382
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:13,280
Remember, this is the like 1,00 1,00
 

6383
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:15,190
Remember, this is the like 1,00 1,00
1,000 plus day cycle. There's the

6384
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:15,200
1,000 plus day cycle. There's the
 

6385
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:17,830
1,000 plus day cycle. There's the
pullback we need. We want up to 70% of a

6386
02:33:17,830 --> 02:33:17,840
pullback we need. We want up to 70% of a
 

6387
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:23,110
pullback we need. We want up to 70% of a
pullback so far of the high we've seen

6388
02:33:23,110 --> 02:33:23,120

 

6389
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:27,030

33. We went up to 70.

6390
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:27,040
33. We went up to 70.
 

6391
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,550
33. We went up to 70.
And let me check let me check if that's

6392
02:33:28,550 --> 02:33:28,560
And let me check let me check if that's
 

6393
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:40,790
And let me check let me check if that's
measured to BTC correctly

6394
02:33:40,790 --> 02:33:40,800

 

6395
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:44,070

up to 70. Oh my gosh, that would be

6396
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:44,080
up to 70. Oh my gosh, that would be
 

6397
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:47,349
up to 70. Oh my gosh, that would be
colossal. I can't see that happening.

6398
02:33:47,349 --> 02:33:47,359
colossal. I can't see that happening.
 

6399
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:50,150
colossal. I can't see that happening.
Cannot see that happening.

6400
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,160
Cannot see that happening.
 

6401
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:52,389
Cannot see that happening.
Never know though. What would the

6402
02:33:52,389 --> 02:33:52,399
Never know though. What would the
 

6403
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:57,030
Never know though. What would the
measured move be there?

6404
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:57,040

 

6405
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:59,526

Oh, it's [\h__\h] possible.

6406
02:33:59,526 --> 02:33:59,536
Oh, it's [\h__\h] possible.
 

6407
02:33:59,536 --> 02:34:00,469
Oh, it's [\h__\h] possible.
[laughter]

6408
02:34:00,469 --> 02:34:00,479
[laughter]
 

6409
02:34:00,479 --> 02:34:01,990
[laughter]
It's possible. I mean, that is an

6410
02:34:01,990 --> 02:34:02,000
It's possible. I mean, that is an
 

6411
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,190
It's possible. I mean, that is an
average move on a sale, 70% which would

6412
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:05,200
average move on a sale, 70% which would
 

6413
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:07,750
average move on a sale, 70% which would
take you to the 161. Yeah, that's a

6414
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:07,760
take you to the 161. Yeah, that's a
 

6415
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:09,510
take you to the 161. Yeah, that's a
leave alone for me until it pro it's

6416
02:34:09,510 --> 02:34:09,520
leave alone for me until it pro it's
 

6417
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:10,870
leave alone for me until it pro it's
going to have to reclaim. I'd rather buy

6418
02:34:10,870 --> 02:34:10,880
going to have to reclaim. I'd rather buy
 

6419
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:13,590
going to have to reclaim. I'd rather buy
late on a reclaim than anything else.

6420
02:34:13,590 --> 02:34:13,600
late on a reclaim than anything else.
 

6421
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:41,190
late on a reclaim than anything else.
For me personally,

6422
02:34:41,190 --> 02:34:41,200

 

6423
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:42,950

Riley,

6424
02:34:42,950 --> 02:34:42,960
Riley,
 

6425
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:48,389
Riley,
I L Y

6426
02:34:48,389 --> 02:34:48,399

 

6427
02:34:48,399 --> 02:34:50,870

that is [\h__\h] thin.

6428
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:50,880
that is [\h__\h] thin.
 

6429
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:52,870
that is [\h__\h] thin.
Is that gapping up off some news or is

6430
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:52,880
Is that gapping up off some news or is
 

6431
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:59,349
Is that gapping up off some news or is
that had earnings

6432
02:34:59,349 --> 02:34:59,359

 

6433
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:05,270

that I mean there's no volume in this?

6434
02:35:05,270 --> 02:35:05,280

 

6435
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:18,870

What is this?

6436
02:35:18,870 --> 02:35:18,880

 

6437
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:21,030

It looks good.

6438
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:21,040
It looks good.
 

6439
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:25,030
It looks good.
Very thin though.

6440
02:35:25,030 --> 02:35:25,040

 

6441
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:27,830

I was looking for this gap. Phil, you've

6442
02:35:27,830 --> 02:35:27,840
I was looking for this gap. Phil, you've
 

6443
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:32,230
I was looking for this gap. Phil, you've
got to trade up to

6444
02:35:32,230 --> 02:35:32,240

 

6445
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,750

me. Just clean this up. Make sure there

6446
02:35:33,750 --> 02:35:33,760
me. Just clean this up. Make sure there
 

6447
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:39,910
me. Just clean this up. Make sure there
is a gap.

6448
02:35:39,910 --> 02:35:39,920

 

6449
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:41,270

Yeah, it's look it's looking to trade

6450
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,280
Yeah, it's look it's looking to trade
 

6451
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,429
Yeah, it's look it's looking to trade
into this ledge at 1450s. I'll be

6452
02:35:43,429 --> 02:35:43,439
into this ledge at 1450s. I'll be
 

6453
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:44,630
into this ledge at 1450s. I'll be
looking for that. I'll be watching

6454
02:35:44,630 --> 02:35:44,640
looking for that. I'll be watching
 

6455
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:47,110
looking for that. I'll be watching
twelves and 1450. Where are you trading

6456
02:35:47,110 --> 02:35:47,120
twelves and 1450. Where are you trading
 

6457
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:48,790
twelves and 1450. Where are you trading
right now? So, yeah, you want to watch

6458
02:35:48,790 --> 02:35:48,800
right now? So, yeah, you want to watch
 

6459
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:50,389
right now? So, yeah, you want to watch
12elves as your next spot. Did it get

6460
02:35:50,389 --> 02:35:50,399
12elves as your next spot. Did it get
 

6461
02:35:50,399 --> 02:35:51,910
12elves as your next spot. Did it get
stuck there? Yeah, just shy of it. There

6462
02:35:51,910 --> 02:35:51,920
stuck there? Yeah, just shy of it. There
 

6463
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:53,750
stuck there? Yeah, just shy of it. There
you go. So, I'll be watching twelves and

6464
02:35:53,750 --> 02:35:53,760
you go. So, I'll be watching twelves and
 

6465
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:55,750
you go. So, I'll be watching twelves and
1450s. If you get acceptance over 12,

6466
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:55,760
1450s. If you get acceptance over 12,
 

6467
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:57,510
1450s. If you get acceptance over 12,
you're looking for 1450s. Over that,

6468
02:35:57,510 --> 02:35:57,520
you're looking for 1450s. Over that,
 

6469
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:59,990
you're looking for 1450s. Over that,
you're looking for 21s.

6470
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:00,000
you're looking for 21s.
 

6471
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,270
you're looking for 21s.
But it's very thin. No volume in that in

6472
02:36:03,270 --> 02:36:03,280
But it's very thin. No volume in that in
 

6473
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:15,750
But it's very thin. No volume in that in

02:38:00,150 --> 02:38:00,160
Okay. Starting to leave this gray box.
 

6543
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:01,910

Sorry. I need to focus in here. You're
starting to potentially leave the gray

6546
02:38:03,349 --> 02:38:03,359
starting to potentially leave the gray
 

6547
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:05,110
starting to potentially leave the gray
box. So, if you're interested in the

6548
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:05,120
box. So, if you're interested in the
 

6549
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:07,349
box. So, if you're interested in the
counter trend trade is now setting up.

6550
02:38:07,349 --> 02:38:07,359
counter trend trade is now setting up.
 

6551
02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:08,710
counter trend trade is now setting up.
All right. All the time is staying heavy

6552
02:38:08,710 --> 02:38:08,720
All right. All the time is staying heavy
 

6553
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:11,270
All right. All the time is staying heavy
under here. There's a rotation. Um I

6554
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:11,280
under here. There's a rotation. Um I
 

6555
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:13,910
under here. There's a rotation. Um I
would be watching into sort of 74s and

6556
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:13,920
would be watching into sort of 74s and
 

6557
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:15,750
would be watching into sort of 74s and
then 62s

6558
02:38:15,750 --> 02:38:15,760
then 62s
 

6559
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:18,790
then 62s
and then 45s. All right. So, if if you

6560
02:38:18,790 --> 02:38:18,800
and then 45s. All right. So, if if you
 

6561
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:19,910
and then 45s. All right. So, if if you
want to play this short, I am not

6562
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:19,920
want to play this short, I am not
 

6563
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:21,030
want to play this short, I am not
playing this short because it's counter

6564
02:38:21,030 --> 02:38:21,040
playing this short because it's counter
 

6565
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:22,790
playing this short because it's counter
trend. If you want to play this mean

6566
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:22,800
trend. If you want to play this mean
 

6567
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:24,070
trend. If you want to play this mean
reversion short, this was the trigger.

6568
02:38:24,070 --> 02:38:24,080
reversion short, this was the trigger.
 

6569
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:26,389
reversion short, this was the trigger.
It was the gray box rejection. It is

6570
02:38:26,389 --> 02:38:26,399
It was the gray box rejection. It is
 

6571
02:38:26,399 --> 02:38:28,469
It was the gray box rejection. It is
here.

6572
02:38:28,469 --> 02:38:28,479
here.
 

6573
02:38:28,479 --> 02:38:29,910
here.
Not let me put this on for you. It's so

6574
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:29,920
Not let me put this on for you. It's so
 

6575
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:33,030
Not let me put this on for you. It's so
annoying. It is here. All right. To

6576
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:33,040
annoying. It is here. All right. To
 

6577
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:36,870
annoying. It is here. All right. To
here, right, that is your TP1. TP2 is

6578
02:38:36,870 --> 02:38:36,880
here, right, that is your TP1. TP2 is
 

6579
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:39,030
here, right, that is your TP1. TP2 is
top of gray box. TP3 all the way down

6580
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:39,040
top of gray box. TP3 all the way down
 

6581
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:40,870
top of gray box. TP3 all the way down
here. This is possible. It is possible

6582
02:38:40,870 --> 02:38:40,880
here. This is possible. It is possible
 

6583
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:43,750
here. This is possible. It is possible
we come down into this area. Definitely

6584
02:38:43,750 --> 02:38:43,760
we come down into this area. Definitely
 

6585
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:45,670
we come down into this area. Definitely
possible. But like I said, this is the

6586
02:38:45,670 --> 02:38:45,680
possible. But like I said, this is the
 

6587
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:46,950
possible. But like I said, this is the
hardest trade in the book. It's a

6588
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:46,960
hardest trade in the book. It's a
 

6589
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:48,630
hardest trade in the book. It's a
counter trend trade. It might well do it

6590
02:38:48,630 --> 02:38:48,640
counter trend trade. It might well do it
 

6591
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:50,550
counter trend trade. It might well do it
for you. So if you're if you've been

6592
02:38:50,550 --> 02:38:50,560
for you. So if you're if you've been
 

6593
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:52,710
for you. So if you're if you've been
waiting for that trade, it's now leaving

6594
02:38:52,710 --> 02:38:52,720
waiting for that trade, it's now leaving
 

6595
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:55,030
waiting for that trade, it's now leaving
that volume for you. So TP1 about to hit

6596
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:55,040
that volume for you. So TP1 about to hit
 

6597
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:58,710
that volume for you. So TP1 about to hit
already into IB high, right? So TP1 is

6598
02:38:58,710 --> 02:38:58,720
already into IB high, right? So TP1 is
 

6599
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:03,450
already into IB high, right? So TP1 is
IB high right here.

6600
02:39:03,450 --> 02:39:03,460

 

6601
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:16,790

6603
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:18,230

Remember, you're counter trend. So, you

6604
02:39:18,230 --> 02:39:18,240
Remember, you're counter trend. So, you
 

6605
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:21,270
Remember, you're counter trend. So, you
need to be uh like more aggressive

6606
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:21,280
need to be uh like more aggressive
 

6607
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,349
need to be uh like more aggressive
with your take profit and more

6608
02:39:23,349 --> 02:39:23,359
with your take profit and more
 

6609
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:25,110
with your take profit and more
aggressive with like managing the

02:39:25,110 --> 02:39:25,120
aggressive with like managing the
 

6611
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,070
aggressive with like managing the
positions as in like move the stop.

6612
02:39:28,070 --> 02:39:28,080
positions as in like move the stop.
 

6613
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:29,830
positions as in like move the stop.
Don't be sitting in something hoping

6614
02:39:29,830 --> 02:39:29,840
Don't be sitting in something hoping
 

6615
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:31,750
Don't be sitting in something hoping
because if it wants to stop here and go

6616
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:31,760
because if it wants to stop here and go
 

6617
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:33,429
because if it wants to stop here and go
all the way back up, it will cuz it's a

6618
02:39:33,429 --> 02:39:33,439
all the way back up, it will cuz it's a
 

6619
02:39:33,439 --> 02:39:34,950
all the way back up, it will cuz it's a
counter trend trade. We don't know how

6620
02:39:34,950 --> 02:39:34,960
counter trend trade. We don't know how
 

6621
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:42,550
counter trend trade. We don't know how
far that pullback's going to go.

6622
02:39:42,550 --> 02:39:42,560

 

6623
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:45,190

Uh, a UK. It's just the anchored volume

6624
02:39:45,190 --> 02:39:45,200
Uh, a UK. It's just the anchored volume
 

6625

Took the trade and you're already out.

6628
02:39:50,469 --> 02:39:50,479
Took the trade and you're already out.
 

6629
02:39:50,479 --> 02:39:54,150
Took the trade and you're already out.
There you go.

6630
02:39:54,150 --> 02:39:54,160

 

6631
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:56,870

ES single prints and C period.

6632
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:56,880
ES single prints and C period.
 

6633
02:39:56,880 --> 02:40:01,270
ES single prints and C period.
Uh, I haven't got my TPO on on the ES.

6634
02:40:01,270 --> 02:40:01,280
Uh, I haven't got my TPO on on the ES.
 

6635
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:03,030
Uh, I haven't got my TPO on on the ES.
Um,

6636
02:40:03,030 --> 02:40:03,040
Um,
 

6637
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:39,590
Um,
I'm not going to put it on. Where is it?

6638
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:39,600

 

6639
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:58,630

Yeah.

6640
02:40:58,630 --> 02:40:58,640

 

6641
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:00,389

All right. So, if they retest this and

6642
02:41:00,389 --> 02:41:00,399
All right. So, if they retest this and
 

6643
02:41:00,399 --> 02:41:02,230
All right. So, if they retest this and
stay heavy, there will be a rotation. If

6644
02:41:02,230 --> 02:41:02,240
stay heavy, there will be a rotation. If
 

6645
02:41:02,240 --> 02:41:03,510
stay heavy, there will be a rotation. If
they reclaim this, it will be a trap

6646
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:03,520
they reclaim this, it will be a trap
 

6647
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:04,710
they reclaim this, it will be a trap
like earlier. Remember, overall, you're

6648
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:04,720
like earlier. Remember, overall, you're
 

6649
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:06,950
like earlier. Remember, overall, you're
bullish. So, be careful with this. But

6650
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:06,960
bullish. So, be careful with this. But
 

6651
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:09,349
bullish. So, be careful with this. But
if they retest this and stay heavy, you

6652
02:41:09,349 --> 02:41:09,359
if they retest this and stay heavy, you
 

6653
02:41:09,359 --> 02:41:10,790
if they retest this and stay heavy, you
should then try and get down into this

6654
02:41:10,790 --> 02:41:10,800
should then try and get down into this
 

6655
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:13,990
should then try and get down into this
next block down here. This is your TP2.

6656
02:41:13,990 --> 02:41:14,000
next block down here. This is your TP2.
 

6657
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,910
next block down here. This is your TP2.
Okay? So, you basically hit TP1, which

6658
02:41:15,910 --> 02:41:15,920
Okay? So, you basically hit TP1, which
 

6659
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:18,469
Okay? So, you basically hit TP1, which
was this purple bar, right? This is your

6660
02:41:18,469 --> 02:41:18,479
was this purple bar, right? This is your
 

6661
02:41:18,479 --> 02:41:20,309
was this purple bar, right? This is your
next one. You do not want a reclaim of

6662
02:41:20,309 --> 02:41:20,319
next one. You do not want a reclaim of
 

6663
02:41:20,319 --> 02:41:23,030
next one. You do not want a reclaim of
gray box. Gray gray box reclaim will be

6664
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:23,040
gray box. Gray gray box reclaim will be
 

6665
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:24,550
gray box. Gray gray box reclaim will be
squeezed back out. This is why I don't

6666
02:41:24,550 --> 02:41:24,560
squeezed back out. This is why I don't
 

6667
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:26,309
squeezed back out. This is why I don't
take these trades. They're counter trend

6668
02:41:26,309 --> 02:41:26,319
take these trades. They're counter trend
 

6669
02:41:26,319 --> 02:41:28,230
take these trades. They're counter trend
trades. They're the hardest trade in the

6670
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:28,240
trades. They're the hardest trade in the
 

6671
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:29,510
trades. They're the hardest trade in the
book. Like I said, you got to be very

6672
02:41:29,510 --> 02:41:29,520
book. Like I said, you got to be very
 

6673
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:33,670
book. Like I said, you got to be very
aggressive with your stop. [snorts] No.

6674
02:41:33,670 --> 02:41:33,680
aggressive with your stop. [snorts] No.
 

6675
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:36,230
aggressive with your stop. [snorts] No.
No. I've I've said all day I do I'm not

6677
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:37,670
No. I've I've said all day I do I'm not
playing counter trend in the breakout

6678
02:41:37,670 --> 02:41:37,680

make that very clear. I've said the
 

6687

make that very clear. I've said the
whole time I'm not playing the counter

whole time I'm not playing the counter
 

6689

Remember, we talked about this being an
 

6721

Remember, we talked about this being an
option if they can't do this.

option if they can't do this.

02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:34,230
option if they can't do this.
This is your pivot which created this

6724
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:34,240
This is your pivot which created this
 

6725
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:35,910
This is your pivot which created this
high. This is the pullback. They've

6726
02:42:35,910 --> 02:42:35,920
high. This is the pullback. They've
 

6727
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:37,590
high. This is the pullback. They've
rebid it. If they do this, they can

6728
02:42:37,590 --> 02:42:37,600
rebid it. If they do this, they can
 

6729
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:39,910
rebid it. If they do this, they can
continue higher. Why I'm not fading it.

6730
02:42:39,910 --> 02:42:39,920
continue higher. Why I'm not fading it.
 

6731
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:41,910
continue higher. Why I'm not fading it.
For me, there's no trade setup. Now, if

02:42:41,910 --> 02:42:41,920
For me, there's no trade setup. Now, if
 

6733
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:44,710
For me, there's no trade setup. Now, if
I was still in this long from down here

6734
02:42:44,710 --> 02:42:44,720
I was still in this long from down here
 

6735
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:46,150
I was still in this long from down here
without getting knocked out and small

6736
02:42:46,150 --> 02:42:46,160
without getting knocked out and small
 

6737
02:42:46,160 --> 02:42:47,750
without getting knocked out and small
size, I'd be willing to just sit in this

6738
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:47,760
size, I'd be willing to just sit in this
 

6739
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:49,670
size, I'd be willing to just sit in this
and try and get all the way up into this

6740
02:42:49,670 --> 02:42:49,680
and try and get all the way up into this
 

6741
02:42:49,680 --> 02:43:01,590

target here at 145s.

The volume node moved up. Um,

6746
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:08,000
The volume node moved up. Um,
 

6747
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:09,590
The volume node moved up. Um,
not really. Kind of same area. I guess

6748
02:43:09,590 --> 02:43:09,600
not really. Kind of same area. I guess
 

6749
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:12,950
not really. Kind of same area. I guess
you could argue it's 96es.

6750
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:12,960
you could argue it's 96es.
 

6751
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:15,830
you could argue it's 96es.
Maybe a little bit here to be fair. Oh,

6752
02:43:15,830 --> 02:43:15,840
Maybe a little bit here to be fair. Oh,
 

6753
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:18,150
Maybe a little bit here to be fair. Oh,
don't move that one. This one. Maybe a

6754
02:43:18,150 --> 02:43:18,160
don't move that one. This one. Maybe a
 

6755
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:34,389
don't move that one. This one. Maybe a
bit more like this.

6756

02:43:34,399 --> 02:43:37,270

ES looks a bit dangerous here to me. VIX

6758
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:37,280
ES looks a bit dangerous here to me. VIX
 

6759
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:39,349
ES looks a bit dangerous here to me. VIX
has reclaimed previous day low. Might go

6760
02:43:39,349 --> 02:43:39,359
has reclaimed previous day low. Might go
 

6761
02:43:39,359 --> 02:43:41,270
has reclaimed previous day low. Might go
for a little squeeze out on the VIX. If

6762
02:43:41,270 --> 02:43:41,280
for a little squeeze out on the VIX. If
 

6763
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:43,349
for a little squeeze out on the VIX. If
it does, ES might start dropping. Do we

6764
02:43:43,349 --> 02:43:43,359
it does, ES might start dropping. Do we
 

6765
02:43:43,359 --> 02:43:46,230
it does, ES might start dropping. Do we
have unison here with the market? I'll

6766
02:43:46,230 --> 02:43:46,240
have unison here with the market? I'll
 

6767

have unison here with the market? I'll

6817
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:17,750

Can I give you a brief overview of how

6818
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:17,760
Can I give you a brief overview of how
 

6819
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:19,910
Can I give you a brief overview of how
prop concepts work across multiple firms

6820
02:45:19,910 --> 02:45:19,920
prop concepts work across multiple firms
 

6821
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:21,590
prop concepts work across multiple firms
and accounts? Yeah, you just use Well,

6822
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:21,600
and accounts? Yeah, you just use Well,
 

6823
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:23,590
and accounts? Yeah, you just use Well,
assuming I would not do it unless you're

6824
02:45:23,590 --> 02:45:23,600
assuming I would not do it unless you're
 

6825
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:25,110
assuming I would not do it unless you're
profitable, but if you're profitable,

6826
02:45:25,110 --> 02:45:25,120
profitable, but if you're profitable,
 

6827
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:27,349
profitable, but if you're profitable,
you just use a trade copier. My personal

6828
02:45:27,349 --> 02:45:27,359
you just use a trade copier. My personal
 

6829
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:29,510
you just use a trade copier. My personal
one I use is affordable indicators. All

6830
02:45:29,510 --> 02:45:29,520
one I use is affordable indicators. All
 

6831
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:30,710
one I use is affordable indicators. All
right. And then you link them all

6832
02:45:30,710 --> 02:45:30,720
right. And then you link them all
 

6833
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:32,550
right. And then you link them all
together. You take one trade and it

6834
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:32,560
together. You take one trade and it
 

6835
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,150
together. You take one trade and it
copies across them all. That that's how

6836
02:45:34,150 --> 02:45:34,160
copies across them all. That that's how
 

6837
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:40,309
copies across them all. That that's how
you leverage your accounts together.

6838
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:40,319

 

6839
02:45:40,319 --> 02:45:44,630

day low Ballinger band and almost got

6868
02:46:29,910 --> 02:46:29,920
day low Ballinger band and almost got
 

6869
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:32,790
day low Ballinger band and almost got
down into the 200 day. No, too low. We

6870
02:46:32,790 --> 02:46:32,800
down into the 200 day. No, too low. We
 

6871
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:36,070
down into the 200 day. No, too low. We
go up into 20-day. If we get acceptance

6872
02:46:36,070 --> 02:46:36,080
go up into 20-day. If we get acceptance
 

6873
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:37,990
go up into 20-day. If we get acceptance
through this up to 50day and this high

6874
02:46:37,990 --> 02:46:38,000
through this up to 50day and this high
 

6875
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,750
through this up to 50day and this high
volume node up here and by that point,

6876
02:46:39,750 --> 02:46:39,760
volume node up here and by that point,
 

6877
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:41,110
volume node up here and by that point,
this will probably be down there and

6878
02:46:41,110 --> 02:46:41,120
this will probably be down there and
 

6879
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:42,710
this will probably be down there and
then we'll have to do this for a bit and

6880
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:42,720
then we'll have to do this for a bit and
 

6881
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:44,070
then we'll have to do this for a bit and
then see if they open up for

6882
02:46:44,070 --> 02:46:44,080
then see if they open up for
 

6883
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:45,590
then see if they open up for
acceleration or if they want to come

6884
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:45,600
acceleration or if they want to come
 

6885
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:48,230
acceleration or if they want to come
back and tag. I'm long from 220, I think

6886
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:48,240
back and tag. I'm long from 220, I think
 

6887
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:51,429
back and tag. I'm long from 220, I think
it is. So, I'm long from down

6888
02:46:51,429 --> 02:46:51,439
it is. So, I'm long from down
 

6889
02:46:51,439 --> 02:46:53,190
it is. So, I'm long from down
I think it was here or was it August? It

6890
02:46:53,190 --> 02:46:53,200
I think it was here or was it August? It
 

6891
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:56,070
I think it was here or was it August? It
might be 202. I think it's 202s. So, I'm

6892
02:46:56,070 --> 02:46:56,080
might be 202. I think it's 202s. So, I'm
 

6893
02:46:56,080 --> 02:46:59,429
might be 202. I think it's 202s. So, I'm
long from down here, right? And I did

6894
02:46:59,429 --> 02:46:59,439
long from down here, right? And I did
 

6895
02:46:59,439 --> 02:47:01,510
long from down here, right? And I did
not sell. It's a long-term position. I'm

6896
02:47:01,510 --> 02:47:01,520
not sell. It's a long-term position. I'm
 

6897
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:03,429

looking to hold that, hoping for one of
 

6899
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:06,790
looking to hold that, hoping for one of
these. We'll see. I might have taken

6900
02:47:06,790 --> 02:47:06,800
these. We'll see. I might have taken
 

6901
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:09,590
these. We'll see. I might have taken
like a couple

6902

6937
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:58,870

So, we did very well from that last

6938
02:47:58,870 --> 02:47:58,880
So, we did very well from that last
 

6939
02:47:58,880 --> 02:48:02,469
So, we did very well from that last
year. Our biggest winner was uh was that

02:48:02,469 --> 02:48:02,479
year. Our biggest winner was uh was that
 

6941
02:48:02,479 --> 02:48:05,269
year. Our biggest winner was uh was that
um what was it called? One I just called

out open 500 plus% on that. We got last

6944
02:48:08,710 --> 02:48:08,720
out open 500 plus% on that. We got last
 

6945

6949
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:26,469

Short still valid? I mean

6950
02:48:26,469 --> 02:48:26,479
Short still valid? I mean
 

6951
02:48:26,479 --> 02:48:28,230
Short still valid? I mean
technically it's counter trend.

6952
02:48:28,230 --> 02:48:28,240
technically it's counter trend.
 

6953
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:31,349
technically it's counter trend.
Technically yes. Like for me it's not a

02:48:31,349 --> 02:48:31,359
Technically yes. Like for me it's not a
 

6955
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:33,830
Technically yes. Like for me it's not a
trade I would take. Technically yes. You

6956
02:48:33,830 --> 02:48:33,840
trade I would take. Technically yes. You
 

6957
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:35,510
trade I would take. Technically yes. You
haven't traded the other side of it. But

6958
02:48:35,510 --> 02:48:35,520
haven't traded the other side of it. But
 

6959
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:38,230
haven't traded the other side of it. But
I would be very very very very very

6960
02:48:38,230 --> 02:48:38,240
I would be very very very very very
 

6961
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:40,230
I would be very very very very very
concerned that we don't lift because

6962
02:48:40,230 --> 02:48:40,240
concerned that we don't lift because
 

6963
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:42,070
concerned that we don't lift because
this is your swing low. This is swing

6964
02:48:42,070 --> 02:48:42,080
this is your swing low. This is swing
 

6965
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:43,590
this is your swing low. This is swing
high. This is a pullback which is

6966
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:43,600
high. This is a pullback which is
 

6967
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,429
high. This is a pullback which is
holding. But technically if you are

6968
02:48:45,429 --> 02:48:45,439
holding. But technically if you are
 

6969
02:48:45,439 --> 02:48:47,670
holding. But technically if you are
adamant in trading this short all the

02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:47,680
adamant in trading this short all the

time you can reject that. You can be

6972
02:48:49,190 --> 02:48:49,200
time you can reject that. You can be
 

6973
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:50,870
time you can reject that. You can be
looking for this move here. It's just

6974
02:48:50,870 --> 02:48:50,880
looking for this move here. It's just
 

6975
02:48:50,880 --> 02:48:52,389
looking for this move here. It's just
you're running out of time into launch

6976
02:48:52,389 --> 02:48:52,399
you're running out of time into launch
 

6977
02:48:52,399 --> 02:48:54,070
you're running out of time into launch
here. And remember, they've got targets

6978
02:48:54,070 --> 02:48:54,080
here. And remember, they've got targets
 

6979
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:56,950
here. And remember, they've got targets
above. They have targets above. It's you

6980
02:48:56,950 --> 02:48:56,960
above. They have targets above. It's you
 

6981
02:48:56,960 --> 02:48:58,790

basically came to TP1. You basically

6982
02:48:58,790 --> 02:48:58,800
basically came to TP1. You basically
 

6983
02:48:58,800 --> 02:49:00,790
basically came to TP1. You basically
came to 74 and defended it. So, if we

6984
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:00,800
came to 74 and defended it. So, if we
 

6985
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:02,950
came to 74 and defended it. So, if we
keep defending the initial balance, then

6986
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:02,960
keep defending the initial balance, then
 

6987
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:05,110
keep defending the initial balance, then
we're potentially in trend higher,

6988
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:05,120
we're potentially in trend higher,
 

6989
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:07,190
we're potentially in trend higher,
aren't we? Right. If we keep defending

6990
02:49:07,190 --> 02:49:07,200
aren't we? Right. If we keep defending
 

6991
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:10,150
aren't we? Right. If we keep defending
IB, we're in trend higher scenario. But

6992
02:49:10,150 --> 02:49:10,160
IB, we're in trend higher scenario. But
 

6993
02:49:10,160 --> 02:49:12,070
IB, we're in trend higher scenario. But
there is potential for a deeper

6994
02:49:12,070 --> 02:49:12,080
there is potential for a deeper
 

6995
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:13,429
there is potential for a deeper
pullback. It's not something I would

6996
02:49:13,429 --> 02:49:13,439
pullback. It's not something I would
 

6997
02:49:13,439 --> 02:49:15,429
pullback. It's not something I would
play personally, but it's up to you guys

6998
02:49:15,429 --> 02:49:15,439
play personally, but it's up to you guys
 

6999
02:49:15,439 --> 02:49:17,846
play personally, but it's up to you guys
to manage your own positions.

So I do Forex, but I'm also looking at

7004
02:49:21,269 --> 02:49:21,279
So I do Forex, but I'm also looking at
 

7005
02:49:21,279 --> 02:49:24,630
So I do Forex, but I'm also looking at
future prop firms. So I want to know

7006
02:49:24,630 --> 02:49:24,640
future prop firms. So I want to know
 

7007
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:27,110
future prop firms. So I want to know
that in Forex there is pips. How can I

7008
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:27,120
that in Forex there is pips. How can I
 

7009
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:29,030
that in Forex there is pips. How can I
calculate pips and futures? Ticks,

7010
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:29,040
calculate pips and futures? Ticks,
 

7011
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:31,030
calculate pips and futures? Ticks,
they're in ticks. All right. So

7012
02:49:31,030 --> 02:49:31,040
they're in ticks. All right. So
 

7013
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:33,030
they're in ticks. All right. So
depending on what you're trading will

7014
02:49:33,030 --> 02:49:33,040
depending on what you're trading will
 

7015
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:34,630
depending on what you're trading will
depending how many ticks there are per

7016
02:49:34,630 --> 02:49:34,640
depending how many ticks there are per
 

7017
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:36,550
depending how many ticks there are per
point and how many how much that's

7018
02:49:36,550 --> 02:49:36,560
point and how many how much that's
 

7019
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:39,670
point and how many how much that's
worth. Yeah. So in NQ it's four ticks a

7020
02:49:39,670 --> 02:49:39,680
worth. Yeah. So in NQ it's four ticks a
 

7021
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:47,349
worth. Yeah. So in NQ it's four ticks a
point.

Yeah, CVD is showing more aggressive

7046
02:50:22,469 --> 02:50:22,479
Yeah, CVD is showing more aggressive
 

7047

Yeah, CVD is showing more aggressive
sellers stepping in here for sure. It's

7048
02:50:24,790 --> 02:50:24,800
sellers stepping in here for sure. It's
 

7049
02:50:24,800 --> 02:50:26,870
sellers stepping in here for sure. It's
It's trying. We're failing to make Did

7050
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:26,880
It's trying. We're failing to make Did
 

7051
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:28,630
It's trying. We're failing to make Did
CVD make a new high when we made a new

7052
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:28,640
CVD make a new high when we made a new
 

7053
02:50:28,640 --> 02:50:30,309
CVD make a new high when we made a new
high? No. So, there's passive selling up

7054
02:50:30,309 --> 02:50:30,319
high? No. So, there's passive selling up
 

7055
02:50:30,319 --> 02:50:32,550
high? No. So, there's passive selling up
here. CVD is telling us that there's

7056
02:50:32,550 --> 02:50:32,560
here. CVD is telling us that there's
 

7057
02:50:32,560 --> 02:50:34,150
here. CVD is telling us that there's
passive selling up here and that

7058
02:50:34,150 --> 02:50:34,160
passive selling up here and that
 

7059
02:50:34,160 --> 02:50:36,070
passive selling up here and that
aggressive sellers are trying to step in

7060
02:50:36,070 --> 02:50:36,080
aggressive sellers are trying to step in
 

7061
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:37,830
aggressive sellers are trying to step in
here. At the moment, we've not got a

7062
02:50:37,830 --> 02:50:37,840
here. At the moment, we've not got a
 

7063
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:41,910
here. At the moment, we've not got a
breakdown, though. We're going to need

7064
02:50:41,910 --> 02:50:41,920
breakdown, though. We're going to need
 

7065
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:43,990
breakdown, though. We're going to need
see absorption versus here which is

7066
02:50:43,990 --> 02:50:44,000
see absorption versus here which is
 

7067
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,150
see absorption versus here which is
here. So this is a very big highly

7068
02:50:46,150 --> 02:50:46,160
here. So this is a very big highly
 

7069
02:50:46,160 --> 02:50:49,349
here. So this is a very big highly
contested area as we know it's not like

7070
02:50:49,349 --> 02:50:49,359
contested area as we know it's not like
 

7071
02:50:49,359 --> 02:50:51,030
contested area as we know it's not like
I said it's not a trade I would look to

7072
02:50:51,030 --> 02:50:51,040
I said it's not a trade I would look to
 

7073
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:53,429
I said it's not a trade I would look to
take. It's just something that might

7074
02:50:53,429 --> 02:50:53,439
take. It's just something that might
 

7075
02:50:53,439 --> 02:50:59,030
take. It's just something that might
happen. It might set up.

7076
02:50:59,030 --> 02:50:59,040

 

7077
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:00,469

What does defending initial balance

7078
02:51:00,469 --> 02:51:00,479
What does defending initial balance
 

7079
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:02,469
What does defending initial balance
mean? It means that they're unwilling to

7080
02:51:02,469 --> 02:51:02,479
mean? It means that they're unwilling to
 

7081
02:51:02,479 --> 02:51:03,990
mean? It means that they're unwilling to
trade under this purple line that they

7082
02:51:03,990 --> 02:51:04,000
trade under this purple line that they
 

7083
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,790
trade under this purple line that they
keep trying to soak this purple line. So

7084
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:06,800
keep trying to soak this purple line. So
 

7085
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:08,950
keep trying to soak this purple line. So
if you get if you're short here, you

7086
02:51:08,950 --> 02:51:08,960
if you get if you're short here, you
 

7087
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:11,190
if you get if you're short here, you
need to take profit into this partial

7088
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:11,200
need to take profit into this partial
 

7089
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:12,950
need to take profit into this partial
into this because you know it's a key

7090
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:12,960
into this because you know it's a key
 

7091
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:16,469
into this because you know it's a key
level. Then here, then here, and then if

7092
02:51:16,469 --> 02:51:16,479
level. Then here, then here, and then if
 

7093
02:51:16,479 --> 02:51:17,990
level. Then here, then here, and then if
you get under this, you've got all these

7094
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:18,000
you get under this, you've got all these
 

7095
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:22,630
you get under this, you've got all these
VWAPs, right? All these VWOPS

7096
02:51:22,630 --> 02:51:22,640
VWAPs, right? All these VWOPS
 

7097
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:25,030
VWAPs, right? All these VWOPS
might be asking a lot for that. We'll

7098
02:51:25,030 --> 02:51:25,040
might be asking a lot for that. We'll
 

7099
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:26,630
might be asking a lot for that. We'll
have to see if the market wants to give

7100
02:51:26,630 --> 02:51:26,640
have to see if the market wants to give
 

7101
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:28,630
have to see if the market wants to give
back and take profit into lunch, which

7102
02:51:28,630 --> 02:51:28,640
back and take profit into lunch, which
 

7103
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:36,309
back and take profit into lunch, which
you're now one minute away from.

7104
02:51:36,309 --> 02:51:36,319

 

7105
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:37,750

You showed on YouTube that you can get

7106
02:51:37,750 --> 02:51:37,760
You showed on YouTube that you can get
 

7107
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:39,110
You showed on YouTube that you can get
orderflow for free. Does it work with

7108
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:39,120
orderflow for free. Does it work with
 

7109
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:41,110
orderflow for free. Does it work with
Rhythmic Apex? Uh, no. Not with

7110
02:51:41,110 --> 02:51:41,120
Rhythmic Apex? Uh, no. Not with
 

7111
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:42,469
Rhythmic Apex? Uh, no. Not with
Rhythmic. Not that I know of, unless

7112
02:51:42,469 --> 02:51:42,479
Rhythmic. Not that I know of, unless
 

7113
02:51:42,479 --> 02:51:45,510
Rhythmic. Not that I know of, unless
they offer it. Um, you will need to use

7114
02:51:45,510 --> 02:51:45,520
they offer it. Um, you will need to use
 

7115
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:50,150
they offer it. Um, you will need to use
it with uh trade of eight setting.

7116
02:51:50,150 --> 02:51:50,160
it with uh trade of eight setting.
 

7117
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:52,150
it with uh trade of eight setting.
How do I know where IB is? It's the

7118
02:51:52,150 --> 02:51:52,160
How do I know where IB is? It's the
 

7119
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:53,990
How do I know where IB is? It's the
highest and the lowest point of the

7120
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:54,000
highest and the lowest point of the
 

7121
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,190
highest and the lowest point of the
first hour of trading in New York.

7122
02:51:57,190 --> 02:51:57,200
first hour of trading in New York.
 

7123
02:51:57,200 --> 02:52:00,630
first hour of trading in New York.
So, the high and low 9:30 to 10:30. So,

7124
02:52:00,630 --> 02:52:00,640
So, the high and low 9:30 to 10:30. So,
 

7125
02:52:00,640 --> 02:52:02,150
So, the high and low 9:30 to 10:30. So,
here's the short. It is starting to play

7126
02:52:02,150 --> 02:52:02,160
here's the short. It is starting to play
 

7127
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:03,990
here's the short. It is starting to play
out. So again, TP1 will be this purple

7128
02:52:03,990 --> 02:52:04,000
out. So again, TP1 will be this purple
 

7129
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:15,750
out. So again, TP1 will be this purple
line, then the top of the gray box.

7130
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:15,760

 

7131
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:18,550

So you're coming into purple line here.

7132
02:52:18,550 --> 02:52:18,560
So you're coming into purple line here.
 

7133
02:52:18,560 --> 02:52:21,750
So you're coming into purple line here.
So TP1 is here, here or hereabouts, and

7134
02:52:21,750 --> 02:52:21,760
So TP1 is here, here or hereabouts, and
 

7135
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:33,590
So TP1 is here, here or hereabouts, and
underneath that gray box.

7136
02:52:33,590 --> 02:52:33,600

 

7137
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:35,670

So this is second trade starting to

7138
02:52:35,670 --> 02:52:35,680
So this is second trade starting to
 

7139
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:37,349
So this is second trade starting to
potentially play out, but you must

7140
02:52:37,349 --> 02:52:37,359
potentially play out, but you must
 

7141
02:52:37,359 --> 02:52:43,030
potentially play out, but you must
respect this level here.

7142
02:52:43,030 --> 02:52:43,040

 

7143
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:47,670

I just delete that. There's your TP1.

7144
02:52:47,670 --> 02:52:47,680
I just delete that. There's your TP1.
 

7145
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:51,830
I just delete that. There's your TP1.
All right. And your TP2 is here.

7146
02:52:51,830 --> 02:52:51,840
All right. And your TP2 is here.
 

7147
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:53,910
All right. And your TP2 is here.
Is this developing profile as well? Yes,

7148
02:52:53,910 --> 02:52:53,920
Is this developing profile as well? Yes,
 

7149
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:56,550
Is this developing profile as well? Yes,
it is. So blue line and gray box very

7150
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:56,560
it is. So blue line and gray box very
 

7151
02:52:56,560 --> 02:52:59,269
it is. So blue line and gray box very
very key. This is TP2. I would not have

7152
02:52:59,269 --> 02:52:59,279
very key. This is TP2. I would not have
 

7153
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:01,190
very key. This is TP2. I would not have
expectations below that. If you get very

7154
02:53:01,190 --> 02:53:01,200
expectations below that. If you get very
 

7155
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:03,349
expectations below that. If you get very
lucky, you will come down. We have a low

7156
02:53:03,349 --> 02:53:03,359
lucky, you will come down. We have a low
 

7157
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:05,590
lucky, you will come down. We have a low
volume node down here. If you got very

7158
02:53:05,590 --> 02:53:05,600
volume node down here. If you got very
 

7159
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:08,150
volume node down here. If you got very
very very lucky today, you would get

7160
02:53:08,150 --> 02:53:08,160
very very lucky today, you would get
 

7161
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:10,230
very very lucky today, you would get
this move here. But I think it's more

7162
02:53:10,230 --> 02:53:10,240
this move here. But I think it's more
 

7163
02:53:10,240 --> 02:53:13,349
this move here. But I think it's more
likely that they just try and trap

7164
02:53:13,349 --> 02:53:13,359
likely that they just try and trap
 

7165
02:53:13,359 --> 02:53:16,469
likely that they just try and trap
and keep you locked in in between here

7166
02:53:16,469 --> 02:53:16,479
and keep you locked in in between here
 

7167
02:53:16,479 --> 02:53:18,550
and keep you locked in in between here
and here. All right. And the rotation

7168
02:53:18,550 --> 02:53:18,560
and here. All right. And the rotation
 

7169
02:53:18,560 --> 02:53:21,030
and here. All right. And the rotation
might happen here for the afternoon. You

7170
02:53:21,030 --> 02:53:21,040
might happen here for the afternoon. You
 

7171
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:26,790
might happen here for the afternoon. You
can see volume being built out.

7172
02:53:26,790 --> 02:53:26,800

 

7173
02:53:26,800 --> 02:53:29,510

So TP2 is here. You've basically hit

7174
02:53:29,510 --> 02:53:29,520
So TP2 is here. You've basically hit
 

7175
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:30,870
So TP2 is here. You've basically hit
TP1. I'm going to consider that you've

7176
02:53:30,870 --> 02:53:30,880
TP1. I'm going to consider that you've
 

7177
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:32,150
TP1. I'm going to consider that you've
hit it because you're only a point away.

7178
02:53:32,150 --> 02:53:32,160
hit it because you're only a point away.
 

7179
02:53:32,160 --> 02:53:34,150
hit it because you're only a point away.
I'll try and stick with you for the next

7180
02:53:34,150 --> 02:53:34,160
I'll try and stick with you for the next
 

7181
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:35,910
I'll try and stick with you for the next
minute or two. I do have to walk my dog,

7182
02:53:35,910 --> 02:53:35,920
minute or two. I do have to walk my dog,
 

7183
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:41,269
minute or two. I do have to walk my dog,
but just in case you get it.

7184
02:53:41,269 --> 02:53:41,279

 

7185
02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:42,950

VIX starting to go through that pivot

7186
02:53:42,950 --> 02:53:42,960
VIX starting to go through that pivot
 

7187
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:45,030
VIX starting to go through that pivot
now. So trading back towards the 16s

7188
02:53:45,030 --> 02:53:45,040
now. So trading back towards the 16s
 

7189
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:46,950
now. So trading back towards the 16s
now. Like we talked about once VIX

7190
02:53:46,950 --> 02:53:46,960
now. Like we talked about once VIX
 

7191
02:53:46,960 --> 02:53:48,710
now. Like we talked about once VIX
reclaims previous day low there's a

7192
02:53:48,710 --> 02:53:48,720
reclaims previous day low there's a
 

7193
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:50,710
reclaims previous day low there's a
chance for more weakness. If we to think

7194
02:53:50,710 --> 02:53:50,720
chance for more weakness. If we to think
 

7195
02:53:50,720 --> 02:53:53,269
chance for more weakness. If we to think
about VIX we used it as the reclaim.

7196
02:53:53,269 --> 02:53:53,279
about VIX we used it as the reclaim.
 

7197
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:55,349
about VIX we used it as the reclaim.
Once VIX reclaimed the green line there

7198
02:53:55,349 --> 02:53:55,359
Once VIX reclaimed the green line there
 

7199
02:53:55,359 --> 02:53:57,429
Once VIX reclaimed the green line there
you go reclaim a green line squeezes up.

7200
02:53:57,429 --> 02:53:57,439
you go reclaim a green line squeezes up.
 

7201
02:53:57,439 --> 02:53:59,429
you go reclaim a green line squeezes up.
We see weakness come back into the

7202
02:53:59,429 --> 02:53:59,439
We see weakness come back into the
 

7203
02:53:59,439 --> 02:54:02,070
We see weakness come back into the
market.

7204
02:54:02,070 --> 02:54:02,080
market.
 

7205
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:03,990
market.
So purple line still holding for now

7206
02:54:03,990 --> 02:54:04,000
So purple line still holding for now

02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,950
So purple line still holding for now

knocked out my runners. I would have
 

7217
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:19,269
knocked out my runners. I would have
loved to have held for a bit more.

7218
02:54:19,269 --> 02:54:19,279
loved to have held for a bit more.
 

7219
02:54:19,279 --> 02:54:21,750
loved to have held for a bit more.

7227
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:31,590
Right. So, two hit. This one's pretty
much hit TP1. If you have wanted to take

7228
02:54:31,590 --> 02:54:31,600
much hit TP1. If you have wanted to take
 

7229
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:33,510

the day. I do not love counter trends.
 

7233
02:54:35,359 --> 02:54:36,550
the day. I do not love counter trends.
They're the hardest trade in the book.

7234
02:54:36,550 --> 02:54:36,560
They're the hardest trade in the book.
 

7235
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:38,710
They're the hardest trade in the book.
But there you go. It is there. Uh, I

7236
02:54:38,710 --> 02:54:38,720
But there you go. It is there. Uh, I
 

7237
02:54:38,720 --> 02:54:40,230
But there you go. It is there. Uh, I
would be very cautious now for the

7238
02:54:40,230 --> 02:54:40,240
would be very cautious now for the
 

7239
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:42,070
would be very cautious now for the
rotation. the rotation between sort of

7240
02:54:42,070 --> 02:54:42,080
rotation. the rotation between sort of
 

7241
02:54:42,080 --> 02:54:44,309
rotation. the rotation between sort of
26,092

7242
02:54:44,309 --> 02:54:44,319
26,092
 

7243
02:54:44,319 --> 02:54:48,309
26,092
and 26,62 or 26,046es.

7244
02:54:48,309 --> 02:54:48,319
and 26,62 or 26,046es.
 

7245
02:54:48,319 --> 02:54:50,389
and 26,62 or 26,046es.
So I would imagine

7246
02:54:50,389 --> 02:54:50,399
So I would imagine
 

7247
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:52,630
So I would imagine
we might fill in some of this and do a

7248
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:52,640
we might fill in some of this and do a
 

7249
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:54,389
we might fill in some of this and do a
bit of a dance here. All right, weakness

7250
02:54:54,389 --> 02:54:54,399
bit of a dance here. All right, weakness
 

7251
02:54:54,399 --> 02:54:56,389
bit of a dance here. All right, weakness
can come if we start losing this. All

7252
02:54:56,389 --> 02:54:56,399
can come if we start losing this. All
 

7253
02:54:56,399 --> 02:54:57,910
can come if we start losing this. All
right, there can be a fail breakout and

7254
02:54:57,910 --> 02:54:57,920
right, there can be a fail breakout and
 

7255
02:54:57,920 --> 02:54:59,990
right, there can be a fail breakout and
a claim back inside. But if we lose

7256
02:54:59,990 --> 02:55:00,000
a claim back inside. But if we lose
 

7257
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,070
a claim back inside. But if we lose
this, you will see weakness come in the

7258
02:55:02,070 --> 02:55:02,080
this, you will see weakness come in the
 

7259
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:05,030
this, you will see weakness come in the
market. I am somewhat skeptical. I think

7260
02:55:05,030 --> 02:55:05,040
market. I am somewhat skeptical. I think
 

7261
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:06,710
market. I am somewhat skeptical. I think
you might find that you spend most the

7262
02:55:06,710 --> 02:55:06,720
you might find that you spend most the
 

7263
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:08,710
you might find that you spend most the
rest of the day in here unless they get

7264
02:55:08,710 --> 02:55:08,720
rest of the day in here unless they get
 

7265
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:10,389
rest of the day in here unless they get
very very bullish and go for these stops

7266
02:55:10,389 --> 02:55:10,399
very very bullish and go for these stops
 

7267
02:55:10,399 --> 02:55:12,870
very very bullish and go for these stops
above. These are the the areas above. So

7268
02:55:12,870 --> 02:55:12,880
above. These are the the areas above. So
 

7269
02:55:12,880 --> 02:55:14,389
above. These are the the areas above. So
if you're aiming for higher if you're

7270
02:55:14,389 --> 02:55:14,399
if you're aiming for higher if you're
 

7271
02:55:14,399 --> 02:55:16,710
if you're aiming for higher if you're
still holding your TP should be sort of

7272
02:55:16,710 --> 02:55:16,720
still holding your TP should be sort of
 

7273
02:55:16,720 --> 02:55:19,429
still holding your TP should be sort of
117 to 124,

7274
02:55:19,429 --> 02:55:19,439
117 to 124,
 

7275
02:55:19,439 --> 02:55:22,630
117 to 124,
130 to 134 and then this high of 146,

7276
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:22,640
130 to 134 and then this high of 146,
 

7277
02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:26,950
130 to 134 and then this high of 146,
right? TP1 now hit on this downside move

7278
02:55:26,950 --> 02:55:26,960
right? TP1 now hit on this downside move
 

7279
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:28,870
right? TP1 now hit on this downside move
and uh I'm going to go and walk my dog.

7280
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:28,880
and uh I'm going to go and walk my dog.
 

7281
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:30,950
and uh I'm going to go and walk my dog.
