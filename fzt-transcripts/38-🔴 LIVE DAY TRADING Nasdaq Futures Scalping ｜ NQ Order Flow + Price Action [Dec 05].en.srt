00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,390

Okay team, welcome back. Happy Friday.

2
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400

 

3
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,309

Happy Friday. Can't wait to get this

4
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
Happy Friday. Can't wait to get this
 

5
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,949
Happy Friday. Can't wait to get this
week over. To be honest, it's been a bit

6
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
week over. To be honest, it's been a bit
 

7
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,350
week over. To be honest, it's been a bit
of a drag for price action this week.

8
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
of a drag for price action this week.
 

9
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,869
of a drag for price action this week.
So, let's just see what we get at the

10
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
So, let's just see what we get at the
 

11
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,710
So, let's just see what we get at the
moment. More of the same. All right. So,

12
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
moment. More of the same. All right. So,
 

13
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,710
moment. More of the same. All right. So,
what are we seeing? Well, we've been

14
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
what are we seeing? Well, we've been
 

15
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,190
what are we seeing? Well, we've been
boxed in and every look above

16
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
boxed in and every look above
 

17
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,189
boxed in and every look above
uh sort of the 85s or into the 85s on

18
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
uh sort of the 85s or into the 85s on
 

19
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,469
uh sort of the 85s or into the 85s on
SPY has been uh sold into. Right. So, I

20
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
SPY has been uh sold into. Right. So, I
 

21
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,150
SPY has been uh sold into. Right. So, I
wouldn't normally care about this, but I

22
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
wouldn't normally care about this, but I
 

23
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,590
wouldn't normally care about this, but I
know the gamma levels like I keep

24
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
know the gamma levels like I keep
 

25
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,270
know the gamma levels like I keep
talking about up there have been

26
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
talking about up there have been
 

27
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,270
talking about up there have been
massive. So, I'll be watching to see if

28
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
massive. So, I'll be watching to see if
 

29
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,310
massive. So, I'll be watching to see if
we get over 85 and base over 85 because

30
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
we get over 85 and base over 85 because
 

31
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,550
we get over 85 and base over 85 because
if we do that, we go into positive GABA

32
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
if we do that, we go into positive GABA
 

33
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,550
if we do that, we go into positive GABA
and maybe there's a squeeze on the spy

34
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
and maybe there's a squeeze on the spy
 

35
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,310
and maybe there's a squeeze on the spy
and that might drag the market up with

36
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
and that might drag the market up with
 

37
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,550
and that might drag the market up with
us. Until that point, we keep trading

38
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
us. Until that point, we keep trading
 

39
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,909
us. Until that point, we keep trading
back inside. If we look at the cues,

40
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919

 

41
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,830

we have relative weakness. All right.

42
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
we have relative weakness. All right.
 

43
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,909
we have relative weakness. All right.
So, you can see versus just pull this

44
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
So, you can see versus just pull this
 

45
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,990
So, you can see versus just pull this
down for you. You can see versus the

46
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
down for you. You can see versus the
 

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,550
down for you. You can see versus the
spy, we are failing to break out above

48
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
spy, we are failing to break out above
 

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,230
spy, we are failing to break out above
these levels and fill. We have an old

50
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
these levels and fill. We have an old
 

51
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,990
these levels and fill. We have an old
gap up here, right? An RTH gap that we

52
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
gap up here, right? An RTH gap that we
 

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,430
gap up here, right? An RTH gap that we
have not come up and filled. We haven't

54
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
have not come up and filled. We haven't
 

55
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,790
have not come up and filled. We haven't
tested any of this true supply up here.

56
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
tested any of this true supply up here.
 

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,430
tested any of this true supply up here.
So, relative weakness and you can see

58
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
So, relative weakness and you can see
 

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,029
So, relative weakness and you can see
we're just in this slow uptrend.

60
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
we're just in this slow uptrend.
 

61
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,550
we're just in this slow uptrend.
All right, it was steep and it's just

62
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
All right, it was steep and it's just
 

63
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,189
All right, it was steep and it's just
slowed right down. Okay, but we're still

64
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
slowed right down. Okay, but we're still
 

65
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,469
slowed right down. Okay, but we're still
technically bullish. Uh I'm

66
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
technically bullish. Uh I'm
 

67
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,310
technically bullish. Uh I'm
cautiously bullish. Let's just put it

68
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
cautiously bullish. Let's just put it
 

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,550
cautiously bullish. Let's just put it
that way. I'm cautiously bullish. I've

70
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
that way. I'm cautiously bullish. I've
 

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,150
that way. I'm cautiously bullish. I've
been talking about much more bullish if

72
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
been talking about much more bullish if
 

73
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,749
been talking about much more bullish if
we can come down and hold a higher low

74
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
we can come down and hold a higher low
 

75
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,070
we can come down and hold a higher low
there. Um so I want to be very very

76
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
there. Um so I want to be very very
 

77
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,270
there. Um so I want to be very very
cautious. We have one week, two week of

78
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
cautious. We have one week, two week of
 

79
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,270
cautious. We have one week, two week of
a balance range. This week in a balance

80
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
a balance range. This week in a balance
 

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,749
a balance range. This week in a balance
range. this is your area. Until they

82
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
range. this is your area. Until they
 

83
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,029
range. this is your area. Until they
reclaim that, then for me, it's just a

84
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
reclaim that, then for me, it's just a
 

85
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,150
reclaim that, then for me, it's just a
poor location to be buying from. Um,

86
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
poor location to be buying from. Um,
 

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,150
poor location to be buying from. Um,
down here is where I'm interested

88
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
down here is where I'm interested
 

89
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,150
down here is where I'm interested
longterm. And you can see the volume

90
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
longterm. And you can see the volume
 

91
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,629
longterm. And you can see the volume
still low uh but we still drift higher.

92
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
still low uh but we still drift higher.
 

93
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,909
still low uh but we still drift higher.
And uh I'm going to get into that

94
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
And uh I'm going to get into that
 

95
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,390
And uh I'm going to get into that
because I spent a bit of time looking at

96
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
because I spent a bit of time looking at
 

97
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,870
because I spent a bit of time looking at
the charts uh yesterday to just go

98
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
the charts uh yesterday to just go
 

99
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,990
the charts uh yesterday to just go
through that cumulative delta.

100
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
through that cumulative delta.
 

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,310
through that cumulative delta.
Okay, can you guys see everything here?

102
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
Okay, can you guys see everything here?
 

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,150
Okay, can you guys see everything here?
Oh, sorry folks. It's not what I wanted

104
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
Oh, sorry folks. It's not what I wanted
 

105
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,710
Oh, sorry folks. It's not what I wanted
to do.

106
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720

 

107
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,309

Make this bigger for you guys. There you

108
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
Make this bigger for you guys. There you
 

109
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,629
Make this bigger for you guys. There you
go. All right. Hourlys.

110
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
go. All right. Hourlys.
 

111
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,390
go. All right. Hourlys.
We can still see the hourlys are holding

112
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
We can still see the hourlys are holding
 

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,870
We can still see the hourlys are holding
higher lows and we keep holding these

114
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
higher lows and we keep holding these
 

115
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,550
higher lows and we keep holding these
pivots.

116
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
pivots.
 

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,309
pivots.
Okay. So, if we zoom out

118
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
Okay. So, if we zoom out
 

119
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,150
Okay. So, if we zoom out
this edge of previous week value and

120
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
this edge of previous week value and
 

121
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,749
this edge of previous week value and
this old balance range, two weeks

122
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
this old balance range, two weeks
 

123
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,189
this old balance range, two weeks
balance range, we keep absorbing on it.

124
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
balance range, we keep absorbing on it.
 

125
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,230
balance range, we keep absorbing on it.
Okay. So this pin high

126
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
Okay. So this pin high
 

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,070
Okay. So this pin high
right all right became a key level over

128
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
right all right became a key level over
 

129
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,350
right all right became a key level over
under we came over it we drifted under

130
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
under we came over it we drifted under
 

131
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,350
under we came over it we drifted under
it on Tuesday absorbed closed back over

132
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
it on Tuesday absorbed closed back over
 

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,749
it on Tuesday absorbed closed back over
it came back to it against Wednesday

134
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
it came back to it against Wednesday
 

135
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,070
it came back to it against Wednesday
double bottom reabsorbed went over it

136
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
double bottom reabsorbed went over it
 

137
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,469
double bottom reabsorbed went over it
came back to the same level yesterday

138
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
came back to the same level yesterday
 

139
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,870
came back to the same level yesterday
reabsorbed back over it and we're making

140
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
reabsorbed back over it and we're making
 

141
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,629
reabsorbed back over it and we're making
this higher low here. All right that's

142
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
this higher low here. All right that's
 

143
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,270
this higher low here. All right that's
the channel right now. It's not pretty.

144
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
the channel right now. It's not pretty.
 

145
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,189
the channel right now. It's not pretty.
Um it's starting to get tighter and

146
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
Um it's starting to get tighter and
 

147
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,550
Um it's starting to get tighter and
tighter. All right. If you want to think

148
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
tighter. All right. If you want to think
 

149
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,950
tighter. All right. If you want to think
about this as a range, if we think about

150
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
about this as a range, if we think about
 

151
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,830
about this as a range, if we think about
from

152
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
from
 

153
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,110
from
where's Monday's close,

154
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
where's Monday's close,
 

155
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,230
where's Monday's close,
okay, Monday's close, that's your sort

156
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
okay, Monday's close, that's your sort
 

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,790
okay, Monday's close, that's your sort
of range on Tuesday, that's the range

158
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
of range on Tuesday, that's the range
 

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,670
of range on Tuesday, that's the range
into Wednesday, that's the range into

160
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
into Wednesday, that's the range into
 

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,350
into Wednesday, that's the range into
Thursday, and we've had a failed

162
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
Thursday, and we've had a failed
 

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,629
Thursday, and we've had a failed
breakout. And that's the range. You can

164
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
breakout. And that's the range. You can
 

165
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,110
breakout. And that's the range. You can
see we're getting tighter, but we really

166
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
see we're getting tighter, but we really
 

167
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,270
see we're getting tighter, but we really
need to see reclaims up here and holds

168
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
need to see reclaims up here and holds
 

169
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,350
need to see reclaims up here and holds
above to be bullish. You can see look

170
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
above to be bullish. You can see look
 

171
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,029
above to be bullish. You can see look
above fail. Look above fail. Look above

172
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
above fail. Look above fail. Look above
 

173
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,710
above fail. Look above fail. Look above
fail. Look above fail. Look above fail.

174
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:26,720
fail. Look above fail. Look above fail.
 

175
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,469
fail. Look above fail. Look above fail.
Look below fail. Look below fail. Look

176
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
Look below fail. Look below fail. Look
 

177
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,390
Look below fail. Look below fail. Look
below fail. All right. You're kind of

178
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
below fail. All right. You're kind of
 

179
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,950
below fail. All right. You're kind of
just doing a dance. Um I'd say

180
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
just doing a dance. Um I'd say
 

181
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,550
just doing a dance. Um I'd say
effectively from sort of 675

182
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
effectively from sort of 675
 

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,589
effectively from sort of 675
and no acceptance under 500. So that's

184
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
and no acceptance under 500. So that's
 

185
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,150
and no acceptance under 500. So that's
your dance. That dance might be tighter

186
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
your dance. That dance might be tighter
 

187
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,029
your dance. That dance might be tighter
today. It might be down to 589. So you

188
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
today. It might be down to 589. So you
 

189
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,510
today. It might be down to 589. So you
might be in a 100 to 90 point range

190
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
might be in a 100 to 90 point range
 

191
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,990
might be in a 100 to 90 point range
until the market proves otherwise. I

192
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
until the market proves otherwise. I
 

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,350
until the market proves otherwise. I
want to move up into here because I want

194
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
want to move up into here because I want
 

195
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,870
want to move up into here because I want
to talk about this cumulative delta

196
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:52,880
to talk about this cumulative delta
 

197
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,029
to talk about this cumulative delta
because it actually gave some clues

198
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
because it actually gave some clues
 

199
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,950
because it actually gave some clues
yesterday and I was a bit sloppy in

200
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
yesterday and I was a bit sloppy in
 

201
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,110
yesterday and I was a bit sloppy in
looking for it. Um, but if we see

202
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
looking for it. Um, but if we see
 

203
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,830
looking for it. Um, but if we see
drag this up, right, Delta did nothing

204
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
drag this up, right, Delta did nothing
 

205
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,990
drag this up, right, Delta did nothing
yesterday other than drift higher. All

206
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
yesterday other than drift higher. All
 

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,150
yesterday other than drift higher. All
right, all we did was make higher highs

208
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
right, all we did was make higher highs
 

209
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,469
right, all we did was make higher highs
and higher lows, which means on the

210
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
and higher lows, which means on the
 

211
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,309
and higher lows, which means on the
tape, all right, there was no aggressive

212
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
tape, all right, there was no aggressive
 

213
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,629
tape, all right, there was no aggressive
selling. It's just aggressive buying.

214
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
selling. It's just aggressive buying.
 

215
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,070
selling. It's just aggressive buying.
Maybe the odd bit of passive selling,

216
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
Maybe the odd bit of passive selling,
 

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,589
Maybe the odd bit of passive selling,
but actually no aggression. So when

218
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
but actually no aggression. So when
 

219
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,550
but actually no aggression. So when
we're making these moves here of lower

220
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
we're making these moves here of lower
 

221
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,710
we're making these moves here of lower
lows, we're making higher highs on

222
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
lows, we're making higher highs on
 

223
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,629
lows, we're making higher highs on
delta. We make another lower low here,

224
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
delta. We make another lower low here,
 

225
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,469
delta. We make another lower low here,
we're making higher highs on delta. That

226
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
we're making higher highs on delta. That
 

227
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,070
we're making higher highs on delta. That
means that there's no selling in here,

228
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
means that there's no selling in here,
 

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,070
means that there's no selling in here,
folks. There's no aggressive selling in

230
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
folks. There's no aggressive selling in
 

231
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,749
folks. There's no aggressive selling in
here. And it's worth noting because

232
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
here. And it's worth noting because
 

233
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,350
here. And it's worth noting because
until we see aggressive selling and

234
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
until we see aggressive selling and
 

235
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,190
until we see aggressive selling and
probably until we break down that 500

236
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
probably until we break down that 500
 

237
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,430
probably until we break down that 500
level, I don't think this market's going

238
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
level, I don't think this market's going
 

239
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,750
level, I don't think this market's going
to do anything other than rotate, unless

240
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
to do anything other than rotate, unless
 

241
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,230
to do anything other than rotate, unless
we obviously close above this block here

242
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
we obviously close above this block here
 

243
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,829
we obviously close above this block here
and start driving higher, which is

244
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
and start driving higher, which is
 

245
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,750
and start driving higher, which is
possible. So, even this morning in that

246
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
possible. So, even this morning in that
 

247
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,070
possible. So, even this morning in that
flush, I mean, they're doing these same

248
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
flush, I mean, they're doing these same
 

249
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,829
flush, I mean, they're doing these same
gains every day at the moment. It's a

250
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
gains every day at the moment. It's a
 

251
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,310
gains every day at the moment. It's a
pre-market flush, which is being

252
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
pre-market flush, which is being
 

253
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,990
pre-market flush, which is being
absorbed. And you can see Delta's come

254
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
absorbed. And you can see Delta's come
 

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,509
absorbed. And you can see Delta's come
back in and we're all the way back up.

256
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
back in and we're all the way back up.
 

257
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,310
back in and we're all the way back up.
Now, whether today is different, you

258
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
Now, whether today is different, you
 

259
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,310
Now, whether today is different, you
know, whether they've done this trap

260
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
know, whether they've done this trap
 

261
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,910
know, whether they've done this trap
four days in a row and on the fifth day,

262
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
four days in a row and on the fifth day,
 

263
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,310
four days in a row and on the fifth day,
they let it go, I don't know. But, uh,

264
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
they let it go, I don't know. But, uh,
 

265
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,509
they let it go, I don't know. But, uh,
that's what we're seeing at the moment.

266
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
that's what we're seeing at the moment.
 

267
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,630
that's what we're seeing at the moment.
So, we're going to respect what we're

268
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
So, we're going to respect what we're
 

269
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,990
So, we're going to respect what we're
seeing because there's not much else we

270
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
seeing because there's not much else we
 

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,550
seeing because there's not much else we
can do. We're opening up in no man's

272
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
can do. We're opening up in no man's
 

273
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,910
can do. We're opening up in no man's
land right now. Now, if we think about

274
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
land right now. Now, if we think about
 

275
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,630
land right now. Now, if we think about
what we did yesterday, here's the death

276
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
what we did yesterday, here's the death
 

277
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,949
what we did yesterday, here's the death
chop that we talked about all day. We

278
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
chop that we talked about all day. We
 

279
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,630
chop that we talked about all day. We
are holding previous days value area

280
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
are holding previous days value area
 

281
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,990
are holding previous days value area
low. We haven't even got there. We've

282
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
low. We haven't even got there. We've
 

283
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,509
low. We haven't even got there. We've
tested previous days point of control.

284
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
tested previous days point of control.
 

285
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,190
tested previous days point of control.
We've reclaimed previous days value area

286
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
We've reclaimed previous days value area
 

287
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,350
We've reclaimed previous days value area
high. We drifted higher, came back, held

288
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
high. We drifted higher, came back, held
 

289
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,190
high. We drifted higher, came back, held
it, and went now into no man's land.

290
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
it, and went now into no man's land.
 

291
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,750
it, and went now into no man's land.
Fantastic. I mean, absolutely

292
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
Fantastic. I mean, absolutely
 

293
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,550
Fantastic. I mean, absolutely
nothing we can do. Just bouncing

294
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
nothing we can do. Just bouncing
 

295
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,470
nothing we can do. Just bouncing
off previous day's value, which is very

296
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
off previous day's value, which is very
 

297
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,070
off previous day's value, which is very
tight. If we think about the value

298
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
tight. If we think about the value
 

299
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,710
tight. If we think about the value
yesterday, the low was 560. The high was

300
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
yesterday, the low was 560. The high was
 

301
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,310
yesterday, the low was 560. The high was
620. I mean, there's no range there,

302
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
620. I mean, there's no range there,
 

303
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,310
620. I mean, there's no range there,
folks. There's literally nothing there

304
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
folks. There's literally nothing there
 

305
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,470
folks. There's literally nothing there
to do. That's about as big as a normal

306
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
to do. That's about as big as a normal
 

307
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,790
to do. That's about as big as a normal
stop right now. So, just be aware of

308
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
stop right now. So, just be aware of
 

309
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,430
stop right now. So, just be aware of
that. All right, moving into lower time

310
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
that. All right, moving into lower time
 

311
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,550
that. All right, moving into lower time
frame. You can see even more clear here.

312
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
frame. You can see even more clear here.
 

313
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,590
frame. You can see even more clear here.
So, this is yesterday's mess. The same

314
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
So, this is yesterday's mess. The same
 

315
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,350
So, this is yesterday's mess. The same
kind of area as all week. All we're

316
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
kind of area as all week. All we're
 

317
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,509
kind of area as all week. All we're
doing coming back and back testing it

318
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
doing coming back and back testing it
 

319
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,230
doing coming back and back testing it
and holding it. So, I would say shorts

320
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
and holding it. So, I would say shorts
 

321
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,030
and holding it. So, I would say shorts
will need to defend 69700. It's as

322
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
will need to defend 69700. It's as
 

323
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,870
will need to defend 69700. It's as
simple as that. All right. If shorts

324
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
simple as that. All right. If shorts
 

325
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,949
simple as that. All right. If shorts
don't defend that for a retest of this,

326
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
don't defend that for a retest of this,
 

327
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,389
don't defend that for a retest of this,
right? And the retest of this, bulls

328
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
right? And the retest of this, bulls
 

329
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,230
right? And the retest of this, bulls
will want to defend this to go back up.

330
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
will want to defend this to go back up.
 

331
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,829
will want to defend this to go back up.
If shorts don't defend this and we get

332
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
If shorts don't defend this and we get
 

333
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,509
If shorts don't defend this and we get
back start chewing back through all of

334
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
back start chewing back through all of
 

335
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,750
back start chewing back through all of
this, right? If shorts don't defend this

336
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
this, right? If shorts don't defend this
 

337
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,190
this, right? If shorts don't defend this
level and we get back through and we do

338
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
level and we get back through and we do
 

339
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,509
level and we get back through and we do
this, then we're probably bullish for a

340
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
this, then we're probably bullish for a
 

341
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,470
this, then we're probably bullish for a
breakout over 65 757 to uh 830s. All

342
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
breakout over 65 757 to uh 830s. All
 

343
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,030
breakout over 65 757 to uh 830s. All
right. So, just be aware of that. It's

344
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
right. So, just be aware of that. It's
 

345
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,030
right. So, just be aware of that. It's
uh it's not a very pretty tape right now

346
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
uh it's not a very pretty tape right now
 

347
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,190
uh it's not a very pretty tape right now
is probably the best way to put it.

348
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
is probably the best way to put it.
 

349
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,389
is probably the best way to put it.
Marquez said it is worth watching uh ES

350
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
Marquez said it is worth watching uh ES
 

351
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,310
Marquez said it is worth watching uh ES
and the spiders. ES coming right back to

352
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
and the spiders. ES coming right back to
 

353
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,829
and the spiders. ES coming right back to
that same point. All right, it's the

354
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
that same point. All right, it's the
 

355
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,750
that same point. All right, it's the
same dance.

356
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
same dance.
 

357
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,150
same dance.
We swept this low. We've held this

358
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
We swept this low. We've held this
 

359
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,910
We swept this low. We've held this
pivot. All right, and we're coming back

360
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
pivot. All right, and we're coming back
 

361
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,670
pivot. All right, and we're coming back
to this same level. I'm not really going

362
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
to this same level. I'm not really going
 

363
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,269
to this same level. I'm not really going
to even try a short here. I'm going to

364
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
to even try a short here. I'm going to
 

365
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,069
to even try a short here. I'm going to
be honest. This market's showing me that

366
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
be honest. This market's showing me that
 

367
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,389
be honest. This market's showing me that
all it wants to do is run traps. And

368
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
all it wants to do is run traps. And
 

369
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,630
all it wants to do is run traps. And
until we're out of a trappy market on a

370
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
until we're out of a trappy market on a
 

371
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,310
until we're out of a trappy market on a
on a Friday, it's the last thing I want

372
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
on a Friday, it's the last thing I want
 

373
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,949
on a Friday, it's the last thing I want
to do is get caught on a trap. Uh, as I

374
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
to do is get caught on a trap. Uh, as I
 

375
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,150
to do is get caught on a trap. Uh, as I
reminded you at the beginning of the

376
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
reminded you at the beginning of the
 

377
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,030
reminded you at the beginning of the
show, uh, where's my spiders?

378
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
show, uh, where's my spiders?
 

379
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,350
show, uh, where's my spiders?
85, which we're at now. All right, mark

380
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
85, which we're at now. All right, mark
 

381
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,030
85, which we're at now. All right, mark
out 85. Mark out 82, Mark 80. Those are

382
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
out 85. Mark out 82, Mark 80. Those are
 

383
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,870
out 85. Mark out 82, Mark 80. Those are
your big gamma levels. All right, those

384
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
your big gamma levels. All right, those
 

385
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,470
your big gamma levels. All right, those
are the big options levels. I wouldn't

386
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
are the big options levels. I wouldn't
 

387
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,949
are the big options levels. I wouldn't
normally care, but apparently this

388
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
normally care, but apparently this
 

389
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,190
normally care, but apparently this
market only cares about options right

390
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
market only cares about options right
 

391
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,949
market only cares about options right
now. So, you can see we can't get a

392
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
now. So, you can see we can't get a
 

393
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,509
now. So, you can see we can't get a
close under 82. All right, 82 keeps

394
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
close under 82. All right, 82 keeps
 

395
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,829
close under 82. All right, 82 keeps
absorbing. All right, so that is your

396
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
absorbing. All right, so that is your
 

397
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,509
absorbing. All right, so that is your
put wall underneath there. There was

398
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
put wall underneath there. There was
 

399
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,790
put wall underneath there. There was
another one at 80 where I've got it

400
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
another one at 80 where I've got it
 

401
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,470
another one at 80 where I've got it
marked out in blue. So, we can move this

402
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
marked out in blue. So, we can move this
 

403
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,630
marked out in blue. So, we can move this
up. Right. This 82s

404
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640

 

405
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,870

basically here. Yeah. Let's get rid of

406
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
basically here. Yeah. Let's get rid of
 

407
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,910
basically here. Yeah. Let's get rid of
these. And your call wall right now is

408
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
these. And your call wall right now is
 

409
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,710
these. And your call wall right now is
85. So, if they get above 85, potential

410
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
85. So, if they get above 85, potential
 

411
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,150
85. So, if they get above 85, potential
squeeze, but every time we've come up

412
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
squeeze, but every time we've come up
 

413
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,750
squeeze, but every time we've come up
towards 85, failed. Failed. Failed. And

414
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
towards 85, failed. Failed. Failed. And
 

415
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,430
towards 85, failed. Failed. Failed. And
we're there again. All right. So, that

416
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
we're there again. All right. So, that
 

417
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,350
we're there again. All right. So, that
is your call wall is sat at 85 right

418
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
is your call wall is sat at 85 right
 

419
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,110
is your call wall is sat at 85 right
now. Right. So, I'd be using these as

420
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
now. Right. So, I'd be using these as
 

421
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,910
now. Right. So, I'd be using these as
over under levels for rotations

422
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
over under levels for rotations
 

423
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,590
over under levels for rotations
and the spy will probably help you. The

424
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
and the spy will probably help you. The
 

425
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,949
and the spy will probably help you. The
reason I'm saying the spy is because

426
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
reason I'm saying the spy is because
 

427
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,110
reason I'm saying the spy is because
it's the most traded instrument for

428
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
it's the most traded instrument for
 

429
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,750
it's the most traded instrument for
options is the spy. All right, let's

430
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
options is the spy. All right, let's
 

431
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,990
options is the spy. All right, let's
have a look at the mag.

432
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000

 

433
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,750

Apple slight gap down, but I mean really

434
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
Apple slight gap down, but I mean really
 

435
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,910
Apple slight gap down, but I mean really
this is about as no trade zone as you

436
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
this is about as no trade zone as you
 

437
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,430
this is about as no trade zone as you
get. Drift down yesterday, there's your

438
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
get. Drift down yesterday, there's your
 

439
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,030
get. Drift down yesterday, there's your
pocket and we're opening up basically

440
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
pocket and we're opening up basically
 

441
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,910
pocket and we're opening up basically
flatten it. So, not a great start there,

442
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
flatten it. So, not a great start there,
 

443
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,910
flatten it. So, not a great start there,
folks. I'm afraid

444
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
folks. I'm afraid
 

445
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,590
folks. I'm afraid
Amazon big flush yesterday. Ground back

446
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
Amazon big flush yesterday. Ground back
 

447
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,750
Amazon big flush yesterday. Ground back
up. It's trying to hold a pivot here.

448
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
up. It's trying to hold a pivot here.
 

449
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,670
up. It's trying to hold a pivot here.
This is your box, right? These lows if

450
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
This is your box, right? These lows if
 

451
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,790
This is your box, right? These lows if
it gets through that up here. So, Amazon

452
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
it gets through that up here. So, Amazon
 

453
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,030
it gets through that up here. So, Amazon
again probably just rotation until it

454
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
again probably just rotation until it
 

455
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,430
again probably just rotation until it
proves otherwise right now and opening

456
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
proves otherwise right now and opening
 

457
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,310
proves otherwise right now and opening
up. Slight gap up, but not much. Goo

458
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
up. Slight gap up, but not much. Goo
 

459
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,150
up. Slight gap up, but not much. Goo
trying to find a bounce. So, there's the

460
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
trying to find a bounce. So, there's the
 

461
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,430
trying to find a bounce. So, there's the
flush on Thursday. Grind, grind, grind,

462
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
flush on Thursday. Grind, grind, grind,
 

463
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,030
flush on Thursday. Grind, grind, grind,
grind, grind. God, that looks like the

464
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
grind, grind. God, that looks like the
 

465
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,629
grind, grind. God, that looks like the
market, doesn't it? And uh we're coming

466
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
market, doesn't it? And uh we're coming
 

467
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,629
market, doesn't it? And uh we're coming
right back up to this pivot right where

468
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
right back up to this pivot right where
 

469
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,389
right back up to this pivot right where
we failed from. So, it all depends. Does

470
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
we failed from. So, it all depends. Does
 

471
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,949
we failed from. So, it all depends. Does
Google sell 320 or not? So, you could

472
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
Google sell 320 or not? So, you could
 

473
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,590
Google sell 320 or not? So, you could
set a price alert there. 3 320s um

474
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
set a price alert there. 3 320s um
 

475
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,389
set a price alert there. 3 320s um
32060s. Does it sell it or not? That's

476
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
32060s. Does it sell it or not? That's
 

477
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,470
32060s. Does it sell it or not? That's
that would be my question this morning.

478
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
that would be my question this morning.
 

479
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,949
that would be my question this morning.
Meta came out with tried to come out

480
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
Meta came out with tried to come out
 

481
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,030
Meta came out with tried to come out
with some more positive news this

482
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
with some more positive news this
 

483
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,710
with some more positive news this
morning after this yesterday. All this

484
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
morning after this yesterday. All this
 

485
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,069
morning after this yesterday. All this
was yesterday is them saying, "Hey,

486
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
was yesterday is them saying, "Hey,
 

487
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,350
was yesterday is them saying, "Hey,
we're going to stop working on our

488
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
we're going to stop working on our
 

489
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,269
we're going to stop working on our
stupid metaverse. We've wasted money on

490
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
stupid metaverse. We've wasted money on
 

491
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,470
stupid metaverse. We've wasted money on
it." Go figure. Uh the market liked that

492
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
it." Go figure. Uh the market liked that
 

493
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,509
it." Go figure. Uh the market liked that
because they were like, "Thank God

494
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
because they were like, "Thank God
 

495
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,190
because they were like, "Thank God
they're going to stop spending." But uh

496
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
they're going to stop spending." But uh
 

497
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,710
they're going to stop spending." But uh
it didn't like it that much because we

498
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
it didn't like it that much because we
 

499
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,190
it didn't like it that much because we
haven't done much with it. So again,

500
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
haven't done much with it. So again,
 

501
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,310
haven't done much with it. So again,
Meta not really moving.

502
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
Meta not really moving.
 

503
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,829
Meta not really moving.
Microsoft, there's your gap up on

504
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
Microsoft, there's your gap up on
 

505
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,470
Microsoft, there's your gap up on
Microsoft. So that's probably one of the

506
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
Microsoft. So that's probably one of the
 

507
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,750
Microsoft. So that's probably one of the
better looking charts that I've seen

508
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
better looking charts that I've seen
 

509
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,670
better looking charts that I've seen
this morning. But again, we're still

510
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
this morning. But again, we're still
 

511
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,829
this morning. But again, we're still
pinned in. All right. Pinned in from

512
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
pinned in. All right. Pinned in from
 

513
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,430
pinned in. All right. Pinned in from
Wednesday's range. Thursday traded

514
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
Wednesday's range. Thursday traded
 

515
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,470
Wednesday's range. Thursday traded
inside Wednesday. Friday still opening

516
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
inside Wednesday. Friday still opening
 

517
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,710
inside Wednesday. Friday still opening
up inside Wednesday. All right. We're

518
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
up inside Wednesday. All right. We're
 

519
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,870
up inside Wednesday. All right. We're
still pinned in.

520
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880

 

521
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,150

Nothing here.

522
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
Nothing here.
 

523
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,350
Nothing here.
Nvidia. All right. Pre-market gap up.

524
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
Nvidia. All right. Pre-market gap up.
 

525
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,829
Nvidia. All right. Pre-market gap up.
We've already closed the gap. So, Nvidia

526
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
We've already closed the gap. So, Nvidia
 

527
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,310
We've already closed the gap. So, Nvidia
still

528
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
still
 

529
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,829
still
kind of pinned in.

530
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839

 

531
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,590

All right.

532
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
All right.
 

533
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,990
All right.
We have to see whether it can hold the

534
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
We have to see whether it can hold the
 

535
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,590
We have to see whether it can hold the
top side of the range, but still pinned

536
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
top side of the range, but still pinned
 

537
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,110
top side of the range, but still pinned
in a bigger range here. This is the

538
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
in a bigger range here. This is the
 

539
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,790
in a bigger range here. This is the
weekly range. Was that Tuesday's high?

540
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
weekly range. Was that Tuesday's high?
 

541
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,150
weekly range. Was that Tuesday's high?
Yeah, still pending. And Tesla.

542
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
Yeah, still pending. And Tesla.
 

543
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,829
Yeah, still pending. And Tesla.
Okay, a bit of weakness here to start

544
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
Okay, a bit of weakness here to start
 

545
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,670
Okay, a bit of weakness here to start
the day on Tesla, but overall it's been

546
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
the day on Tesla, but overall it's been
 

547
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,430
the day on Tesla, but overall it's been
in a big old squeeze, hasn't it? So, if

548
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
in a big old squeeze, hasn't it? So, if
 

549
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,750
in a big old squeeze, hasn't it? So, if
we look at Tesla, it's done a fantastic

550
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
we look at Tesla, it's done a fantastic
 

551
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,949
we look at Tesla, it's done a fantastic
job this week. It's probably one of the

552
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
job this week. It's probably one of the
 

553
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,269
job this week. It's probably one of the
better stocks this week from Monday,

554
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
better stocks this week from Monday,
 

555
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,870
better stocks this week from Monday,
Tuesday low. If we think about weekly

556
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
Tuesday low. If we think about weekly
 

557
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,350
Tuesday low. If we think about weekly
model, Monday, Tuesday, and all we've

558
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
model, Monday, Tuesday, and all we've
 

559
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,430
model, Monday, Tuesday, and all we've
done is break out. Really nice. Question

560
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
done is break out. Really nice. Question
 

561
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,870
done is break out. Really nice. Question
is for Tesla now. Does it backs stop

562
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880

 

563
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,870

into here?

564
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
into here?
 

565
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,030
into here?
All right. Is it going to retest that or

566
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
All right. Is it going to retest that or
 

567
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,910
All right. Is it going to retest that or
is this too much too soon? And we if we

568
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
is this too much too soon? And we if we
 

569
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,269
is this too much too soon? And we if we
start losing 46s and 45s, there's

570
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
start losing 46s and 45s, there's
 

571
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,790
start losing 46s and 45s, there's
potential for a move back down into

572
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
potential for a move back down into
 

573
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,310
potential for a move back down into
here. So, if this was nothing more than

574
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
here. So, if this was nothing more than
 

575
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,150
here. So, if this was nothing more than
a big gamma squeeze, there's potential

576
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
a big gamma squeeze, there's potential
 

577
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,550
a big gamma squeeze, there's potential
for that to move back down into the 30s.

578
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
for that to move back down into the 30s.
 

579
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,230
for that to move back down into the 30s.
Uh just want to have a quick look at

580
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
Uh just want to have a quick look at
 

581
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,310
Uh just want to have a quick look at
Oracle because that did find a bid the

582
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
Oracle because that did find a bid the
 

583
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,030
Oracle because that did find a bid the
last few days.

584
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
last few days.
 

585
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,030
last few days.
Yeah, we have seen I would say this week

586
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
Yeah, we have seen I would say this week
 

587
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,269
Yeah, we have seen I would say this week
we have some seen some rotation into

588
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
we have some seen some rotation into
 

589
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,629
we have some seen some rotation into
some uh other names again. So some of

590
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
some uh other names again. So some of
 

591
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,150
some uh other names again. So some of
the more squeezy type names remember

592
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
the more squeezy type names remember
 

593
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,710
the more squeezy type names remember
Oracle has been absolutely slammed. Um

594
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
Oracle has been absolutely slammed. Um
 

595
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,470
Oracle has been absolutely slammed. Um
they found a bid and they're starting to

596
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
they found a bid and they're starting to
 

597
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,310
they found a bid and they're starting to
drift up. How we act here becomes key.

598
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
drift up. How we act here becomes key.
 

599
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,629
drift up. How we act here becomes key.
So I'll be keeping one eye on that. The

600
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
So I'll be keeping one eye on that. The
 

601
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,870
So I'll be keeping one eye on that. The
names yesterday which started to go were

602
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
names yesterday which started to go were
 

603
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,870
names yesterday which started to go were
all those uh sort of chip names. So your

604
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
all those uh sort of chip names. So your
 

605
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,949
all those uh sort of chip names. So your
IN

606
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
IN
 

607
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,750
IN
uh you can see started to find a bid big

608
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:45,760
uh you can see started to find a bid big
 

609
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,230
uh you can see started to find a bid big
squeeze. IQ did the same. Look at that

610
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
squeeze. IQ did the same. Look at that
 

611
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,069
squeeze. IQ did the same. Look at that
ginormous squeeze yesterday, right?

612
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
ginormous squeeze yesterday, right?
 

613
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,430
ginormous squeeze yesterday, right?
Gamma squeeze yesterday. Uh MVTS was the

614
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
Gamma squeeze yesterday. Uh MVTS was the
 

615
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,030
Gamma squeeze yesterday. Uh MVTS was the
same. So we have seen rotations into

616
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
same. So we have seen rotations into
 

617
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,470
same. So we have seen rotations into
some of these shorts. Probably getting a

618
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
some of these shorts. Probably getting a
 

619
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,470
some of these shorts. Probably getting a
bit caught in some of these. RGTI was

620
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
bit caught in some of these. RGTI was
 

621

Let's see if there's a pullback to get
involved with. Uh now that we're

starting to break out,
 

767
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,350
starting to break out,
let's say if they're going to hold this

768
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
let's say if they're going to hold this
 

769
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,549
let's say if they're going to hold this
as potentially blue now. Is there a

770
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
as potentially blue now. Is there a
 

771
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,310

pullback

772
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
pullback
 

773
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,990
pullback
that holds or do they just wash this

774
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
that holds or do they just wash this
 

775
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,750
that holds or do they just wash this

whole thing out after taking out
 

777
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,590

778
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
overnight high? This is the danger right
 

779
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,230
overnight high? This is the danger right
now. It moves so quick so violently

780
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
now. It moves so quick so violently
 

781
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,510
now. It moves so quick so violently
without any structure.

782
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
without any structure.
 

783
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,270
without any structure.
Got long from the bottom with one micro.

784
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
Got long from the bottom with one micro.
 

785
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,430
Got long from the bottom with one micro.
Nice one tone. Yeah, I mean it was the

786
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
Nice one tone. Yeah, I mean it was the
 

787
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,750
Nice one tone. Yeah, I mean it was the
same pre-market trap. The long was here

788
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
same pre-market trap. The long was here
 

789
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,549
same pre-market trap. The long was here
as soon as as soon as we reclaimed value

790
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
as soon as as soon as we reclaimed value
 

791
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,950
as soon as as soon as we reclaimed value
in PDC. That was your long. But I can't

792
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
in PDC. That was your long. But I can't
 

793
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,870
in PDC. That was your long. But I can't
join up here. So I need to see now if

794
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
join up here. So I need to see now if
 

795
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,390
join up here. So I need to see now if
they pull back and hold. The problem is

796
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
they pull back and hold. The problem is
 

797
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,669
they pull back and hold. The problem is
they've just taken out a lowhanging

798
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
they've just taken out a lowhanging
 

799
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,430
they've just taken out a lowhanging
fruit. So on the opening drive, they've

800
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
fruit. So on the opening drive, they've
 

801
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,750
fruit. So on the opening drive, they've
taken out a lowhanging fruit. So I'll be

802
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
taken out a lowhanging fruit. So I'll be
 

803
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,190
taken out a lowhanging fruit. So I'll be
waiting to see now. Can we get rid of

804
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200
waiting to see now. Can we get rid of
 

805
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,789
waiting to see now. Can we get rid of
that? There we go. Can we pull back and

806
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
that? There we go. Can we pull back and
 

807
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,950
that? There we go. Can we pull back and
hold price above sort of that Asia high

808
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
hold price above sort of that Asia high
 

809
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,750
hold price above sort of that Asia high
or even into this blue box

810
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
or even into this blue box
 

811
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,669
or even into this blue box
and see what they do with it once we get

812
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
and see what they do with it once we get
 

813
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,430
and see what they do with it once we get
there.

814
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440

 

815
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,230

Currently holding right now. We're not

816
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
Currently holding right now. We're not
 

817
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,070
Currently holding right now. We're not
even 5 minutes into the day. 2 minutes

818
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
even 5 minutes into the day. 2 minutes
 

819
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,510
even 5 minutes into the day. 2 minutes
in. So, I want to give this a bit of

820
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
in. So, I want to give this a bit of
 

821
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,789
in. So, I want to give this a bit of
time to shake out. This is an exuberant

822
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
time to shake out. This is an exuberant
 

823
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,029
time to shake out. This is an exuberant
market that's doing nothing but driving

824
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
market that's doing nothing but driving
 

825
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,710
market that's doing nothing but driving
higher right now.

826
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720

 

827
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,750

Still think this wants to move higher.

828
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760

 

829
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,750

Come on, Ninja. Can I move my charts?

830
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
Come on, Ninja. Can I move my charts?
 

831
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,549
Come on, Ninja. Can I move my charts?
Can we move some of these lines around?

832
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
Can we move some of these lines around?
 

833
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,350
Can we move some of these lines around?
No.

834
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360

 

835
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,669

struggling to get through here at 70s.

836
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
struggling to get through here at 70s.
 

837
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,870
struggling to get through here at 70s.
It should just squeeze through at this

838
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
It should just squeeze through at this
 

839
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,549
It should just squeeze through at this
point. It's done all the hard work to be

840
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
point. It's done all the hard work to be
 

841
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,310
point. It's done all the hard work to be
quite honest. We should just go for a

842
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
quite honest. We should just go for a
 

843
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,950
quite honest. We should just go for a
scream, but it's struggling at the

844
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
scream, but it's struggling at the
 

845
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,830
scream, but it's struggling at the
moment.

846
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
moment.
 

847
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,510
moment.
It's held that pull back into GlobeEx.

848
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
It's held that pull back into GlobeEx.
 

849
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,950
It's held that pull back into GlobeEx.
It should just go for a scream up here

850
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
It should just go for a scream up here
 

851
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,549
It should just go for a scream up here
unless it wants to really rebalance

852
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
unless it wants to really rebalance
 

853
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,230
unless it wants to really rebalance
again. I'm not in anything, but I'm just

854
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
again. I'm not in anything, but I'm just
 

855
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,470
again. I'm not in anything, but I'm just
saying what I'm seeing right now.

856
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480

 

857
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,230

was about to enter previous day value

858
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
was about to enter previous day value
 

859
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,870
was about to enter previous day value
high and missed it. Now I've heard all

860
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
high and missed it. Now I've heard all
 

861
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,190
high and missed it. Now I've heard all
the ICT traders on social about the

862
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
the ICT traders on social about the
 

863
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,870
the ICT traders on social about the
power of three sweep high. Yeah,

864
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
power of three sweep high. Yeah,
 

865
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,310
power of three sweep high. Yeah,
I mean all we did is the same thing

866
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
I mean all we did is the same thing
 

867
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,390
I mean all we did is the same thing
we've done all week, right? We we came

868
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
we've done all week, right? We we came
 

869
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,830
we've done all week, right? We we came
under value, we closed the gap, held pre

870
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
under value, we closed the gap, held pre
 

871
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,230
under value, we closed the gap, held pre
previous day point of control. It's just

872
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
previous day point of control. It's just
 

873
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,750
previous day point of control. It's just
the same levels as yesterday where we

874
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
the same levels as yesterday where we
 

875
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,990
the same levels as yesterday where we
found a bid, right? Just found a bid and

876
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
found a bid, right? Just found a bid and
 

877
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,470
found a bid, right? Just found a bid and
uh off to the races we go. And the key

878
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
uh off to the races we go. And the key
 

879
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,430
uh off to the races we go. And the key
thing for me is spies over that 85.

880
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
thing for me is spies over that 85.
 

881
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,190
thing for me is spies over that 85.
Um, I will be waiting here for a

882
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
Um, I will be waiting here for a
 

883
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,669
Um, I will be waiting here for a
pullback to see what we do. If we don't

884
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
pullback to see what we do. If we don't
 

885
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,430
pullback to see what we do. If we don't
hold it, then, you know, maybe we flush

886
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
hold it, then, you know, maybe we flush
 

887
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,990
hold it, then, you know, maybe we flush
back into the range. But my uh opinion

888
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
back into the range. But my uh opinion
 

889
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,149
back into the range. But my uh opinion
right now is we're showing that there's

890
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
right now is we're showing that there's
 

891
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,909
right now is we're showing that there's
no strong selling. The market just wants

892
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
no strong selling. The market just wants
 

893
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,510
no strong selling. The market just wants
to squeeze higher. It's successfully

894
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
to squeeze higher. It's successfully
 

895
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,110
to squeeze higher. It's successfully
done it this morning. I don't want to

896
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
done it this morning. I don't want to
 

897
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,190
done it this morning. I don't want to
buy the high. It might be a day where I

898
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
buy the high. It might be a day where I
 

899
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,789
buy the high. It might be a day where I
just missed the trade. And that's also

900
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
just missed the trade. And that's also
 

901
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,630
just missed the trade. And that's also
okay on a Friday if it doesn't want to

902
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
okay on a Friday if it doesn't want to
 

903
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,110
okay on a Friday if it doesn't want to
play bull. If it wants to be a bugger,

904
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
play bull. If it wants to be a bugger,
 

905
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,350
play bull. If it wants to be a bugger,
it can be a bugger.

906
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
it can be a bugger.
 

907
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,590
it can be a bugger.
I don't care. Be a bugger all you want,

908
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
I don't care. Be a bugger all you want,
 

909
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,590
I don't care. Be a bugger all you want,
market. I'm definitely not going to be

910
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
market. I'm definitely not going to be
 

911
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,750
market. I'm definitely not going to be
trapped. I had a go at the short

912
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
trapped. I had a go at the short
 

913
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,990
trapped. I had a go at the short
yesterday and cut it uh break even in

914
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
yesterday and cut it uh break even in
 

915
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,470
yesterday and cut it uh break even in
the afternoon and once I reviewed that

916
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
the afternoon and once I reviewed that
 

917
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,710
the afternoon and once I reviewed that
trade uh later in the day and saw the

918
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
trade uh later in the day and saw the
 

919
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,870
trade uh later in the day and saw the
delta, I just thought, why why did you

920
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
delta, I just thought, why why did you
 

921
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,430
delta, I just thought, why why did you
even bother? Why did you even bother,

922
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
even bother? Why did you even bother,
 

923
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:26,630
even bother? Why did you even bother,
Alex?

924
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640

up with them direct for you and make
sure you get paid out, buddy.

936

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,990
sure you get paid out, buddy.
It's one of the advantages in uh having

938
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
It's one of the advantages in uh having
 

939
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,590
It's one of the advantages in uh having
a mentor which has a good relationship

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
a mentor which has a good relationship
 

941

a mentor which has a good relationship
with them. So, definitely send me all

942
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
with them. So, definitely send me all
 

943
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,750
with them. So, definitely send me all
the details. I will uh get that sorted

944
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
the details. I will uh get that sorted
 

945
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,710
the details. I will uh get that sorted
for you or I'll at least at the very

946
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
for you or I'll at least at the very
 

947
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,510
for you or I'll at least at the very

least get them to get in touch with you.
 

949
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,430
least get them to get in touch with you.
at the very least.

950
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440

 

951
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,909

Okay, starting to see this come back to

952
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
Okay, starting to see this come back to
 

953
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,830
Okay, starting to see this come back to
repric. So, we have some imbalances

954
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
repric. So, we have some imbalances
 

955
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,549
repric. So, we have some imbalances
here. One here at 50, one at 40, one at

956
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
here. One here at 50, one at 40, one at
 

957
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,549
here. One here at 50, one at 40, one at
72,

958
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
72,
 

959
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,470
72,
and then one all the way down at 700.

960
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
and then one all the way down at 700.
 

961
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,789
and then one all the way down at 700.
So, let's see.

962
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
So, let's see.
 

963
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,710
So, let's see.
Definitely left a little bit of volume

964
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
Definitely left a little bit of volume
 

965
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,990
Definitely left a little bit of volume
trapped up here. I'm going to put this

966
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
trapped up here. I'm going to put this
 

967
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,149
trapped up here. I'm going to put this
on here.

968
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
on here.
 

969
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,590
on here.
Okay. I want to see if we can drift down

970
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
Okay. I want to see if we can drift down
 

971
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,430
Okay. I want to see if we can drift down
into this blue box and if we find a bid

972
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
into this blue box and if we find a bid
 

973
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,350
into this blue box and if we find a bid
there. Apple, by the way, is selling and

974
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
there. Apple, by the way, is selling and
 

975
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,149
there. Apple, by the way, is selling and
Nvidia is gone green to red. Just worth

976
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
Nvidia is gone green to red. Just worth
 

977
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,710
Nvidia is gone green to red. Just worth
noting, we have just taken out all the

978
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
noting, we have just taken out all the
 

979
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,710
noting, we have just taken out all the
lowhanging fruit. The only thing left to

980
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
lowhanging fruit. The only thing left to
 

981
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,270
lowhanging fruit. The only thing left to
aim for now are these stops up here. We

982
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,280
aim for now are these stops up here. We
 

983
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,190
aim for now are these stops up here. We
have just taken out a ton of lowhanging

984
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
have just taken out a ton of lowhanging
 

985
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,549
have just taken out a ton of lowhanging
fruit, which is what I don't want to be

986
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
fruit, which is what I don't want to be
 

987
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,230
fruit, which is what I don't want to be
long at the high of day. What I'm going

988
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,240
long at the high of day. What I'm going
 

989
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,909
long at the high of day. What I'm going
to need to see is some form of bear

990
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
to need to see is some form of bear
 

991
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,789
to need to see is some form of bear
trap. Something like this, right? For me

992
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
trap. Something like this, right? For me
 

993
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,990
trap. Something like this, right? For me
to risk off to get involved in

994
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
to risk off to get involved in
 

995
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,430
to risk off to get involved in
because I don't want to just long here

996
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
because I don't want to just long here
 

997
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,350
because I don't want to just long here
and get caught in one nasty flush

998
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
and get caught in one nasty flush
 

999
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,870
and get caught in one nasty flush
because remember this was straight up.

1000
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:50,880
because remember this was straight up.
 

1001
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,909
because remember this was straight up.
We have no volume in here, no structure.

1002
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
We have no volume in here, no structure.
 

1003
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,590
We have no volume in here, no structure.
So, I need to see some form of trap if

1004
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
So, I need to see some form of trap if
 

1005
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:04,149
So, I need to see some form of trap if
I'm going to join in.

1006
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,159

 

1007
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,789

Not in a hurry. Not in a rush. It's been

1008
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
Not in a hurry. Not in a rush. It's been
 

1009
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,270
Not in a hurry. Not in a rush. It's been
a decent week on what I would say is a

1010
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,280
a decent week on what I would say is a
 

1011
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,350
a decent week on what I would say is a
fairly tricky rotational week. I'm not

1012
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
fairly tricky rotational week. I'm not
 

1013
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,390
fairly tricky rotational week. I'm not
in a hurry

1014
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
in a hurry
 

1015
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,190
in a hurry
to give back my money to this market on

1016
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
to give back my money to this market on
 

1017
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,230
to give back my money to this market on
a Friday. It's already reclaimed. There

1018
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240
a Friday. It's already reclaimed. There
 

1019
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,310
a Friday. It's already reclaimed. There
we are stuck inside that volume again

1020
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
we are stuck inside that volume again
 

1021
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,470
we are stuck inside that volume again
though. This level here starting to

1022
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
though. This level here starting to
 

1023
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,990
though. This level here starting to
develop.

1024
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
develop.
 

1025
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,269
develop.
Right. So we're building out

1026
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279

 

1027
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,110

volume here right now. Can you get

1028
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
volume here right now. Can you get
 

1029
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,830
volume here right now. Can you get
deleted? Yeah. I don't think that's a

1030
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
deleted? Yeah. I don't think that's a
 

1031
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,029
deleted? Yeah. I don't think that's a
strong high. So I think there's a good

1032
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
strong high. So I think there's a good
 

1033
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,710
strong high. So I think there's a good
chance we will break out and make a new

1034
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
chance we will break out and make a new
 

1035
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,590
chance we will break out and make a new
high here. We'll just have to see.

1036
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
high here. We'll just have to see.
 

1037
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,590
high here. We'll just have to see.
There we go.

1038
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:51,600

 

1039
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,029

failed to break out or did they just

1040
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
failed to break out or did they just
 

1041
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,230
failed to break out or did they just
take the high? Oh, they did just take

1042
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
take the high? Oh, they did just take
 

1043
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,190
take the high? Oh, they did just take
the high there in actual fact.

1044
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200

 

1045
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,750

Still liquidity up at 90. I'd be careful

1046
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
Still liquidity up at 90. I'd be careful
 

1047
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,470
Still liquidity up at 90. I'd be careful
because we're trading inside this like

1048
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
because we're trading inside this like
 

1049
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,789
because we're trading inside this like
developing profile. They did just take

1050
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
developing profile. They did just take
 

1051
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,710
developing profile. They did just take
that high there without too much of a

1052
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
that high there without too much of a
 

1053
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,630
that high there without too much of a
shove up. They should be shoving this up

1054
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
shove up. They should be shoving this up
 

1055
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,990
shove up. They should be shoving this up
right now. They've got the ability to do

1056
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
right now. They've got the ability to do
 

1057
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,510
right now. They've got the ability to do
it. If there's a passive seller here

1058
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
it. If there's a passive seller here
 

1059
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,870
it. If there's a passive seller here
that could get caught in a bit of a

1060
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
that could get caught in a bit of a
 

1061
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,590
that could get caught in a bit of a
wash.

1062
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
wash.
 

1063
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,269
wash.
So, they got stuck there again. They've

1064
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
So, they got stuck there again. They've
 

1065
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,190
So, they got stuck there again. They've
had two attempts.

1066
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200

 

1067
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:33,430

Delta still pretty good.

1068
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440

 

1069
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,909

Where do they keep getting stuck? 75 is

1070
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:35,919
Where do they keep getting stuck? 75 is
 

1071
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:50,390
Where do they keep getting stuck? 75 is
an interesting level.

1072
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400

 

1073
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,230

No breakout there on the spiders. Sorry,

1074
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
No breakout there on the spiders. Sorry,
 

1075
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,510
No breakout there on the spiders. Sorry,
I'm just watching across the board here.

1076
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
I'm just watching across the board here.
 

1077
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,269
I'm just watching across the board here.
If you see me rolling my head around,

1078
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
If you see me rolling my head around,
 

1079
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,549
If you see me rolling my head around,
I'm just looking to try and see what's

1080
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
I'm just looking to try and see what's
 

1081
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,149
I'm just looking to try and see what's
going on.

1082
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159

 

1083
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,909

Apple's trying to find a bid. Nvidia's

1084
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
Apple's trying to find a bid. Nvidia's
 

1085
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,350
Apple's trying to find a bid. Nvidia's
trying to find a bid. Feels very

1086
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
trying to find a bid. Feels very
 

1087
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,950
trying to find a bid. Feels very
dangerous up here right now.

1088
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960

 

1089
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,230

feel like they want to squeeze, but

1090
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
feel like they want to squeeze, but
 

1091
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,830
feel like they want to squeeze, but
there's a passive seller up here at 80

1092
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
there's a passive seller up here at 80
 

1093
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,149
there's a passive seller up here at 80
and 90. So, they keep getting stuck.

1094
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
and 90. So, they keep getting stuck.
 

1095
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:26,710
and 90. So, they keep getting stuck.
There you go. Stuck there again.

1096
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720

 

1097
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,630

Do they leave this volume trapped and

1098
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
Do they leave this volume trapped and
 

1099
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,149
Do they leave this volume trapped and
come all the way back down? I mean, they

1100
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
come all the way back down? I mean, they
 

1101
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:37,110
come all the way back down? I mean, they
could. They absolutely could.

1102
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,120

 

1103
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,630

holding the edge of that range. What's

1104
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
holding the edge of that range. What's
 

1105
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,710
holding the edge of that range. What's
that range there? 42s is the edge of

1106
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
that range there? 42s is the edge of
 

1107
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,070
that range there? 42s is the edge of
value for the day. If they lose value

1108
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
value for the day. If they lose value
 

1109
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,990
value for the day. If they lose value
for the day, this could get very nasty

1110
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,000
for the day, this could get very nasty
 

1111
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,510
for the day, this could get very nasty
very quickly, I'd say. So, just be

1112
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
very quickly, I'd say. So, just be
 

1113
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:55,190
very quickly, I'd say. So, just be
careful.

1114
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,200

 

1115
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,789

That previous day higher testing

1116
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
That previous day higher testing
 

1117
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,269
That previous day higher testing
previous day high here.

1118
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
previous day high here.
 

1119
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:07,350
previous day high here.
Be careful. Be careful.

1120
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,360

 

1121
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,950

They're losing it. They're starting to

1122
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
They're losing it. They're starting to
 

1123
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,549
They're losing it. They're starting to
lose a bid here. They need to come in

1124
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
lose a bid here. They need to come in
 

1125
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,750
lose a bid here. They need to come in
now, otherwise they're going to get

1126
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
now, otherwise they're going to get
 

1127
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,950
now, otherwise they're going to get
caught. All these bulls at the top.

1128
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
caught. All these bulls at the top.
 

1129
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,789
caught. All these bulls at the top.
So, they're retesting value and they're

1130
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
So, they're retesting value and they're
 

1131
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,470
So, they're retesting value and they're
losing that bid up there. They might be

1132
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
losing that bid up there. They might be
 

1133
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,630
losing that bid up there. They might be
in trouble here, these bulls.

1134
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,640

 

1135
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,149

We're about to find out, I think.

1136
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
We're about to find out, I think.
 

1137
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,909
We're about to find out, I think.
Nvidia selling, by the way, folks. So,

1138
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:27,919
Nvidia selling, by the way, folks. So,
 

1139
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,310
Nvidia selling, by the way, folks. So,
that's dragging the market. And those uh

1140
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
that's dragging the market. And those uh
 

1141
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,590
that's dragging the market. And those uh
high gamma names are also selling the

1142
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
high gamma names are also selling the
 

1143
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,110
high gamma names are also selling the
ones we talked about pre-market. They

1144
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
ones we talked about pre-market. They
 

1145
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:44,390
ones we talked about pre-market. They
are also selling here.

1146
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:44,400

 

1147
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,990

There you go. All the way back down to V

1148
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,000
There you go. All the way back down to V
 

1149
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:58,870
There you go. All the way back down to V
up here.

1150
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880

 

1151
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,950

So, leaving that volume trapped back

1152
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
So, leaving that volume trapped back
 

1153
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,950
So, leaving that volume trapped back
down to VWOP. Do they catch a bid here?

1154
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
down to VWOP. Do they catch a bid here?
 

1155
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,909
down to VWOP. Do they catch a bid here?
If not, the same thing uh will keep

1156
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
If not, the same thing uh will keep
 

1157
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,510
If not, the same thing uh will keep
applying. Rinse, repeat,

1158
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:09,520
applying. Rinse, repeat,
 

1159
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,029
applying. Rinse, repeat,
and we can go right back into the range.

1160
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
and we can go right back into the range.
 

1161
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,470
and we can go right back into the range.
It'll be a fail breakout right back into

1162
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
It'll be a fail breakout right back into
 

1163
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,830
It'll be a fail breakout right back into
the range. And there'd be well,

1164
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
the range. And there'd be well,
 

1165
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,350
the range. And there'd be well,
absolutely nothing we can do with it if

1166
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360
absolutely nothing we can do with it if
 

1167
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:30,310
absolutely nothing we can do with it if
we do that to be quite honest.

1168
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320

 

1169
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,590

God, what a terrible, boring market. Not

1170
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:33,600
God, what a terrible, boring market. Not
 

1171
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,350
God, what a terrible, boring market. Not
really offering a re-short, not offering

1172
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,360
really offering a re-short, not offering
 

1173
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,510
really offering a re-short, not offering
a long, not offering anything.

1174
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520

 

1175
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,029

Yeah, Nvidia might drag the market down,

1176
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,039
Yeah, Nvidia might drag the market down,
 

1177
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,470
Yeah, Nvidia might drag the market down,
but we're not seeing a roll with the

1178
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
but we're not seeing a roll with the
 

1179
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,350
but we're not seeing a roll with the
rest of the market. So, it's just one of

1180
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
rest of the market. So, it's just one of
 

1181
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,990
rest of the market. So, it's just one of
those where it's like a

1182
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
those where it's like a
 

1183
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,510
those where it's like a
what what are you going to do with this?

1184
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
what what are you going to do with this?
 

1185
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,190
what what are you going to do with this?
There's no retest here. We've left. We

1186
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
There's no retest here. We've left. We
 

1187
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,590
There's no retest here. We've left. We
we poked. We did do a fail breakout. We

1188
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
we poked. We did do a fail breakout. We
 

1189
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,950
we poked. We did do a fail breakout. We
poked and we're coming back down to what

1190
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
poked and we're coming back down to what
 

1191
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,430
poked and we're coming back down to what
can still be bid off. It's just really

1192
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
can still be bid off. It's just really
 

1193
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,710
can still be bid off. It's just really
ugly, folks. It's really really ugly.

1194
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
ugly, folks. It's really really ugly.
 

1195
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,230
ugly, folks. It's really really ugly.
And like maybe they sell this whole

1196
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,240
And like maybe they sell this whole
 

1197
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,630
And like maybe they sell this whole
thing off, but you're not going to catch

1198
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
thing off, but you're not going to catch
 

1199
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,990
thing off, but you're not going to catch
me trying to force a way in.

1200
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000

 

1201
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,990

Tape has gone heavy, but there's been no

1202
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
Tape has gone heavy, but there's been no
 

1203
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,549
Tape has gone heavy, but there's been no
retrace to sell into.

1204
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:16,559
retrace to sell into.
 

1205
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,389
retrace to sell into.
Delta's very heavy. There's just no

1206
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:18,399
Delta's very heavy. There's just no
 

1207
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,070
Delta's very heavy. There's just no
retrace though. There's nothing to sell

1208
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
retrace though. There's nothing to sell
 

1209
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,909
retrace though. There's nothing to sell
into.

1210
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:21,919
into.
 

1211
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,510
into.
It's a lack of structure and that's what

1212
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,520
It's a lack of structure and that's what
 

1213
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,190
It's a lack of structure and that's what
we're seeing in this market. One side to

1214
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
we're seeing in this market. One side to
 

1215
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:40,230
we're seeing in this market. One side to
the other side with no structure

1216
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,240

 

1217
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,230

back to that New York open. If we flush

1218
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
back to that New York open. If we flush
 

1219
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,669
back to that New York open. If we flush
New York open, maybe there's a short,

1220
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:43,679
New York open, maybe there's a short,
 

1221
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,510
New York open, maybe there's a short,
but it's very risky to get short under

1222
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
but it's very risky to get short under
 

1223
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,070
but it's very risky to get short under
here at that point because you you'd

1224
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
here at that point because you you'd
 

1225
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,750
here at that point because you you'd
have to risk all the way back up to

1226
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
have to risk all the way back up to
 

1227
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,710
have to risk all the way back up to
750s. We've not retested this level up

1228
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
750s. We've not retested this level up
 

1229
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,269
750s. We've not retested this level up
here. We've not done this drive up here.

1230
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
here. We've not done this drive up here.
 

1231
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,110
here. We've not done this drive up here.
And this can still hold this blue box.

1232
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,120
And this can still hold this blue box.
 

1233
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,149
And this can still hold this blue box.
We It's not like we've done this to

1234
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,159
We It's not like we've done this to
 

1235
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,750
We It's not like we've done this to
sell. All right. All we've done is chop

1236
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
sell. All right. All we've done is chop
 

1237
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,310
sell. All right. All we've done is chop
chop chop. Oh, we flush down to repric.

1238
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,320
chop chop. Oh, we flush down to repric.
 

1239
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,070
chop chop. Oh, we flush down to repric.
How we act up here is what's going to be

1240
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
How we act up here is what's going to be
 

1241
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,669
How we act up here is what's going to be
important. And we're not really doing

1242
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
important. And we're not really doing
 

1243
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,269
important. And we're not really doing
much to get up there right now. So,

1244
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
much to get up there right now. So,
 

1245
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,070
much to get up there right now. So,
let's see.

1246
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,080
let's see.
 

1247
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,510
let's see.
And if they reclaim it, like I said,

1248
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
And if they reclaim it, like I said,
 

1249
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,870
And if they reclaim it, like I said,
that would be the sort of bear trap,

1250
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880
that would be the sort of bear trap,
 

1251
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,470
that would be the sort of bear trap,
which

1252
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
which
 

1253
00:30:16,480 --> 00:31:01,990
which
could potentially be interesting.

1254
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000

 

1255
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,389

stuck at VWAP now. Not retesting that

1256
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
stuck at VWAP now. Not retesting that
 

1257
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:12,630
stuck at VWAP now. Not retesting that
high yet.

1258
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,640

 

1259
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,190

Stuck at the up again.

1260
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
Stuck at the up again.
 

1261
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,549
Stuck at the up again.
Starting to see some follow through

1262
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:16,559
Starting to see some follow through
 

1263
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:27,190
Starting to see some follow through
here.

1264
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200

 

1265
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,029

It just feels like no man's land to me,

1266
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
It just feels like no man's land to me,
 

1267
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,669
It just feels like no man's land to me,
folks. I'm going to be honest with you.

1268
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
folks. I'm going to be honest with you.
 

1269
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,590
folks. I'm going to be honest with you.
It feels like the last few days,

1270
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,600
It feels like the last few days,
 

1271
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,350
It feels like the last few days,
we haven't retested this volume. We're

1272
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
we haven't retested this volume. We're
 

1273
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,110
we haven't retested this volume. We're
stuck at the edge of this blue box. They

1274
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
stuck at the edge of this blue box. They
 

1275
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,430
stuck at the edge of this blue box. They
can hold this if they want. I'm

1276
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
can hold this if they want. I'm
 

1277
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,870
can hold this if they want. I'm
interested if we see some follow through

1278
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
interested if we see some follow through
 

1279
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,870
interested if we see some follow through
on the tape, but uh you know, we've had

1280
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
on the tape, but uh you know, we've had
 

1281
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,470
on the tape, but uh you know, we've had
the chance to set a lower high there and

1282
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
the chance to set a lower high there and
 

1283
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,470
the chance to set a lower high there and
reject 19s. It just depends whether they

1284
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
reject 19s. It just depends whether they
 

1285
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,470
reject 19s. It just depends whether they
actually want to do that or not. I lack

1286
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,480
actually want to do that or not. I lack
 

1287
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,909
actually want to do that or not. I lack
any conviction that they're actually

1288
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
any conviction that they're actually
 

1289
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,269
any conviction that they're actually
going to do that right now.

1290
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279

 

1291
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,590

VIX is trying to find a bid, but it's

1292
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
VIX is trying to find a bid, but it's
 

1293
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,669
VIX is trying to find a bid, but it's
not through that 1519 level. So,

1294
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
not through that 1519 level. So,
 

1295
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,750
not through that 1519 level. So,
I don't have any conviction here for a

1296
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:05,760
I don't have any conviction here for a
 

1297
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,430
I don't have any conviction here for a
move lower at this point. And we're

1298
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
move lower at this point. And we're
 

1299
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,950
move lower at this point. And we're
still above that New York open. We've

1300
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
still above that New York open. We've
 

1301
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,110
still above that New York open. We've
just repriced the squeeze and if they

1302
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
just repriced the squeeze and if they
 

1303
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,549
just repriced the squeeze and if they
want to go all the way back up, they

1304
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
want to go all the way back up, they
 

1305
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,990
want to go all the way back up, they
will go all the way back up. That's what

1306
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,000
will go all the way back up. That's what
 

1307
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,430
will go all the way back up. That's what
they've done the last few days. Here you

1308
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,440
they've done the last few days. Here you
 

1309
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,710
they've done the last few days. Here you
go. So, they're starting to go all the

1310
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:16,720
go. So, they're starting to go all the
 

1311
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,149
go. So, they're starting to go all the
way back. There's literally nothing to

1312
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:18,159
way back. There's literally nothing to
 

1313
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,470
way back. There's literally nothing to
do with this market. This is screaming,

1314
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
do with this market. This is screaming,
 

1315
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,389
do with this market. This is screaming,
"Leave it the [\h__\h] alone." Honestly,

1316
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:22,399
"Leave it the [\h__\h] alone." Honestly,
 

1317
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,750
"Leave it the [\h__\h] alone." Honestly,
that's what this market's screaming

1318
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:23,760
that's what this market's screaming
 

1319
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,710
that's what this market's screaming
right now. It's telling you

1320
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
right now. It's telling you
 

1321
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,230
right now. It's telling you
it's unfortunate, but that's what this

1322
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,240
it's unfortunate, but that's what this
 

1323
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:39,029
it's unfortunate, but that's what this
market's screaming. It's just a trap.

1324
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,039

 

1325
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,389

Yeah, I feel the same coupe. I'm

1326
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:40,399
Yeah, I feel the same coupe. I'm
 

1327
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,590
Yeah, I feel the same coupe. I'm
watching this just like what's the

1328
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
watching this just like what's the
 

1329
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,430
watching this just like what's the
point?

1330
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,440
point?
 

1331
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,269
point?
You want to understand what this is?

1332
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
You want to understand what this is?
 

1333
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,269
You want to understand what this is?
Flush, rebid, huge squeeze, reprice. Now

1334
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:49,279
Flush, rebid, huge squeeze, reprice. Now
 

1335
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,789
Flush, rebid, huge squeeze, reprice. Now
you're in no man's land. What you going

1336
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
you're in no man's land. What you going
 

1337
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,190
you're in no man's land. What you going
to do with this? We're still holding

1338
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
to do with this? We're still holding
 

1339
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,430
to do with this? We're still holding
blue box. We haven't retested this.

1340
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,440
blue box. We haven't retested this.
 

1341
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,029
blue box. We haven't retested this.
There's no short. And if we come all the

1342
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:57,039
There's no short. And if we come all the
 

1343
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,630
There's no short. And if we come all the
way up there, you've got to say that's a

1344
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:58,640
way up there, you've got to say that's a
 

1345
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,070
way up there, you've got to say that's a
resqueeze with a higher low, haven't

1346
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
resqueeze with a higher low, haven't
 

1347
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,990
resqueeze with a higher low, haven't
you?

1348
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,000
you?
 

1349
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,029
you?
Like

1350
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:05,039

 

1351
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,590

What the [\h__\h] are you going to do, man?

1352
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
What the [\h__\h] are you going to do, man?
 

1353
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:23,190
What the [\h__\h] are you going to do, man?
What are you going to do with it?

1354
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200

 

1355
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,990

This is their game right now. All the

1356
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
This is their game right now. All the
 

1357
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,310
This is their game right now. All the
way back up you go.

1358
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320
way back up you go.
 

1359
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,909
way back up you go.
So, testing this volume at the high.

1360
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:29,919
So, testing this volume at the high.
 

1361
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,350
So, testing this volume at the high.
Now, if you don't react there, then

1362
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,360
Now, if you don't react there, then
 

1363
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,549
Now, if you don't react there, then
you're going to slice right through it.

1364
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
you're going to slice right through it.
 

1365
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,710
you're going to slice right through it.
And I'm not convinced high days in. So

1366
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,720
And I'm not convinced high days in. So
 

1367
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,389
And I'm not convinced high days in. So
this is why I just at the moment it's

1368
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
this is why I just at the moment it's
 

1369
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:43,750
this is why I just at the moment it's
just a loan.

1370
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:43,760

 

1371
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,430

And again, I just think this is options

1372
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:45,440
And again, I just think this is options
 

1373
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,029
And again, I just think this is options
dealers. I don't think this is anything

1374
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:47,039
dealers. I don't think this is anything
 

1375
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,029
dealers. I don't think this is anything
else. And that that worries me when

1376
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039
else. And that that worries me when
 

1377
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,549
else. And that that worries me when
you've got a market where it's just

1378
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
you've got a market where it's just
 

1379
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,310
you've got a market where it's just
being dictated by options. If you look

1380
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,320
being dictated by options. If you look
 

1381
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,710
being dictated by options. If you look
at that last flush down on SPY, did we

1382
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
at that last flush down on SPY, did we
 

1383
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,950
at that last flush down on SPY, did we
ever get back into 85? No, we held above

1384
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:56,960
ever get back into 85? No, we held above
 

1385
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,590
ever get back into 85? No, we held above
85. So they've just moved gamma up from

1386
00:33:59,590 --> 00:33:59,600
85. So they've just moved gamma up from
 

1387
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,110
85. So they've just moved gamma up from
80 to 82 to 85. And that's the play. So

1388
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
80 to 82 to 85. And that's the play. So
 

1389
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,669
80 to 82 to 85. And that's the play. So
now really it's about do you lose this?

1390
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:05,679
now really it's about do you lose this?
 

1391
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:13,109
now really it's about do you lose this?
Can I get this on?

1392
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,119

 

1393
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,990

It's about this, right? That's all that

1394
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
It's about this, right? That's all that
 

1395
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,669
It's about this, right? That's all that
matters. How do we act into that?

1396
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
matters. How do we act into that?
 

1397
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,750
matters. How do we act into that?
That's your game. You want to know the

1398
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:21,760
That's your game. You want to know the
 

1399
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,829
That's your game. You want to know the
game being played? That's the game. And

1400
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:23,839
game being played? That's the game. And
 

1401
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,750
game being played? That's the game. And
I don't think necessarily the high is in

1402
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
I don't think necessarily the high is in
 

1403
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,589
I don't think necessarily the high is in
right now. I just think this is uh

1404
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:29,599
right now. I just think this is uh
 

1405
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,430
right now. I just think this is uh
it's just going to keep rotating, folks.

1406
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440
it's just going to keep rotating, folks.
 

1407
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,470
it's just going to keep rotating, folks.
That's what this market wants to do.

1408
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:38,480

 

1409
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,589

I don't care that the options uh volume

1410
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:41,599
I don't care that the options uh volume
 

1411
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,109
I don't care that the options uh volume
today is small. What I care about is

1412
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
today is small. What I care about is
 

1413
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,710
today is small. What I care about is
that they've moved gamma up and we're

1414
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
that they've moved gamma up and we're
 

1415
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,750
that they've moved gamma up and we're
above it. That's all that matters. Uh

1416
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:47,760
above it. That's all that matters. Uh
 

1417
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,589
above it. That's all that matters. Uh
the volume all week has been small and

1418
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
the volume all week has been small and
 

1419
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,629
the volume all week has been small and
they've just moved it up, right? So

1420
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
they've just moved it up, right? So
 

1421
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,869
they've just moved it up, right? So
I the volume's tiny this week. We went

1422
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
I the volume's tiny this week. We went
 

1423
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,470
I the volume's tiny this week. We went
over that right at the beginning. If you

1424
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,480
over that right at the beginning. If you
 

1425
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,069
over that right at the beginning. If you
look at the volume this week, no,

1426
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
look at the volume this week, no,
 

1427
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,670
look at the volume this week, no,
there's no players. Like, it's like

1428
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
there's no players. Like, it's like
 

1429
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,470
there's no players. Like, it's like
there's no one here, but we went over

1430
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,480
there's no one here, but we went over
 

1431
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,150
there's no one here, but we went over
it.

1432
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,160
it.
 

1433
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,470
it.
It's declining volume on an uprising

1434
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
It's declining volume on an uprising
 

1435
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,870
It's declining volume on an uprising
move. This is bad. It's a bad bad look.

00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
It's what we talked about right at the
 

1439
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:20,470

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:20,480

 

1441
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,790

There's nothing

1442
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:22,800
There's nothing
 

1443
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,829
There's nothing

1445
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,790

1446
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
can't make the market move properly.
 

1447
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,470

We've talked about it all week. If we're

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,390

I'm feeling the same. I'm getting ready

1454
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm feeling the same. I'm getting ready
 

1455
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,829

1465
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,430

How'd New York open? Squeeze all the way
 

1539
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,790
How'd New York open? Squeeze all the way
back up. Probably break out now after

00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800
back up. Probably break out now after
 

1541
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,349
back up. Probably break out now after
doing some absolute stupidity.

1542
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:49,359

 

1543
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,510

I just got no interest now. Like I know

1544
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,520
I just got no interest now. Like I know
 

1545
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,430
I just got no interest now. Like I know
we should now come up here, but I've

1546
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:53,440
we should now come up here, but I've
 

1547
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,190
we should now come up here, but I've
just lost interest in the market. It's

1548
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
just lost interest in the market. It's
 

1549
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,270
just lost interest in the market. It's
put me off so much the last few days by

1550
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,280
put me off so much the last few days by
 

1551
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,589
put me off so much the last few days by
doing these.

1552
00:39:59,589 --> 00:39:59,599
doing these.
 

1553
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,190
doing these.
It's like what what what we going to do

1554
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200

00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,160
But all they wanted was 685 spy. That's
 

1565
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,069
But all they wanted was 685 spy. That's
all this was about. This whole thing was

1570
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:23,599

 

1571
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:59,349

It's so dumb.

1572
00:40:59,349 --> 00:40:59,359

 

1573
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,950

I can't stop coughing. There you go. So,

1574
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:00,960
I can't stop coughing. There you go. So,
 

1575
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,950
I can't stop coughing. There you go. So,
squeeze, resqueeze up. Now, this is your

1576
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
squeeze, resqueeze up. Now, this is your
 

1577
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,950
squeeze, resqueeze up. Now, this is your
target if you're in this. I just know

1578
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:04,960
target if you're in this. I just know
 

1579
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,550
target if you're in this. I just know
I'm not trading today. I'm just so done

1580
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
I'm not trading today. I'm just so done
 

1581
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,589
I'm not trading today. I'm just so done
with this.

1582
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:09,599
with this.
 

1583
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:39,190
with this.
So done with it.

1584
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,200

 

1585
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,309

00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760

 

1589
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,109

It's annoying because I'd love to

1590
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,119
It's annoying because I'd love to
 

1591
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,630
It's annoying because I'd love to
actually participate in some of this,

1592
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:54,640
actually participate in some of this,
 

1593
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,910
actually participate in some of this,
but I just don't like how they're moving

1594
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
but I just don't like how they're moving
 

1595
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,910
but I just don't like how they're moving
it, man.

1596
00:41:59,910 --> 00:41:59,920
it, man.
 

1597
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,950
it, man.
Just feels way too dangerous for me to

1598
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:02,960
Just feels way too dangerous for me to
 

1599
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,670
Just feels way too dangerous for me to
put risk on. So, into your 800s, your

1600
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
put risk on. So, into your 800s, your

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,430
put risk on. So, into your 800s, your

49 bucks away from paying from passing
TPT. My first prop and I'm trying not to

1613
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,710

s if you're in this trade, if you took

1614
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:28,720
s if you're in this trade, if you took
 

1615
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,870
s if you're in this trade, if you took
this dip here or you found a way to get

1616
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:30,880
this dip here or you found a way to get
 

1617
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,390
this dip here or you found a way to get
in here, I don't think they've really

1618
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
in here, I don't think they've really
 

1619
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,870
in here, I don't think they've really
had any structure, but uh if you're in

1620
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:34,880
had any structure, but uh if you're in
 

1621
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,550
had any structure, but uh if you're in
this, just make sure you know you don't

1622
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:36,560
this, just make sure you know you don't
 

1623
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,270
this, just make sure you know you don't
want price to come back below this shelf

1624
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,280
want price to come back below this shelf
 

1625
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,109
want price to come back below this shelf
that we just developed here. All right,

1626
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
that we just developed here. All right,
 

1627
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,790
that we just developed here. All right,
it needs to hold that. Price needs to

1628
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:42,800
it needs to hold that. Price needs to
 

1629
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:57,030
it needs to hold that. Price needs to
hold that.

1630
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,040

 

1631
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,630

that that would be my advice anyway.

1632
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:58,640
that that would be my advice anyway.
 

1633
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:39,750
that that would be my advice anyway.
You'd need to see price hold that

1634
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:39,760

 

1635
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,030

So let's come back to it. So this is

1636
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,040
So let's come back to it. So this is
 

1637
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,470
So let's come back to it. So this is
your level. It needs to hold this. Now

1638
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:42,480
your level. It needs to hold this. Now
 

1639
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,750
your level. It needs to hold this. Now
failing to hold this level would mean

1640
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:43,760
failing to hold this level would mean
 

1641
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,510
failing to hold this level would mean
another failed breakout. So this dip

1642
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:45,520
another failed breakout. So this dip
 

1643
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,950
another failed breakout. So this dip
here needs to hold for you guys.

1644
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
here needs to hold for you guys.
 

1645

1781
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,910

you are into supply now. So it's really

00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:25,920
you are into supply now. So it's really

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,750
depends if they can take out all this

liquidity. The edge of the old previous
 

1787
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,430
liquidity. The edge of the old previous
week value would be up at 900. That

00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:31,440
week value would be up at 900. That
 

1789
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,030
week value would be up at 900. That
would be the ultimate target if it can

00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,040
would be the ultimate target if it can
 

1791
00:50:33,040 --> 00:51:13,750
would be the ultimate target if it can
get there.

1792

1793
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,510

stuck at this supply. So, first test of

1794
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,520
stuck at this supply. So, first test of
 

1795
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,349
stuck at this supply. So, first test of
supply getting stuck. Like I said, your

00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:17,359
supply getting stuck. Like I said, your
 

1797
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,670
supply getting stuck. Like I said, your
location to be a buyer right now is

1798
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:19,680
location to be a buyer right now is
 

1799
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,309
location to be a buyer right now is

00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:22,319
[\h__\h] awful. They've done it on
 

1801
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,470
[\h__\h] awful. They've done it on
purpose. Your best location was

00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
purpose. Your best location was
 

1803
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,710
purpose. Your best location was
pre-market. They've given us nothing.

pre-market. They've given us nothing.

pre-market. They've given us nothing.
Maybe maybe a turnaround here, but very

1806
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
Maybe maybe a turnaround here, but very
 

1807
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,790
Maybe maybe a turnaround here, but very
risky off that VWOP, but that's that's

1808
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:30,800
risky off that VWOP, but that's that's
 

1809
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,870
risky off that VWOP, but that's that's
the turnaround. I wouldn't want to

1810
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:32,880
the turnaround. I wouldn't want to
 

1811
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,309
the turnaround. I wouldn't want to
really be a buyer up here, but if you're

1812
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319
really be a buyer up here, but if you're
 

1813
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,549
really be a buyer up here, but if you're
a continuation trader, this is your

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,510
trade. This is your first tap into
supply. If you can get through this

liquidity here and here, but as you get
 

1821
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,790
liquidity here and here, but as you get
into this, this gets thick. This is our

first time coming into it. This is the

00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:44,880
first time coming into it. This is the
 

1825
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,950
first time coming into it. This is the
the weekly supply all the way back from

the weekly supply all the way back from
 

1827
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,030

1829
00:51:49,040 --> 00:52:11,910
Monday the 3rd of November, so about six
weeks ago now.

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,470

Oh, my ninja's now frozen.

1832

1833
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:23,990

Come on.

1834
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,000

 

1835
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,510

Few days in a row. I might have to take

1836
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:25,520
Few days in a row. I might have to take
 

1837
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:56,069
Few days in a row. I might have to take
off some of the stuff on here.

1838
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079

 

1839
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,430

You've got a feeling it's going to drop.

1840
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,440
You've got a feeling it's going to drop.
 

1841
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,990
You've got a feeling it's going to drop.
Well, I mean, it's nothing more than a

Well, I mean, it's nothing more than a
 

1843
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,589
Well, I mean, it's nothing more than a
feeling. I would say you need to ignore

1844
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:01,599
feeling. I would say you need to ignore
 

1845
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,670
feeling. I would say you need to ignore
feelings and do what the charts are

1846
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:03,680
feelings and do what the charts are
 

1847

it keeps going, 900s will be its target.

1856
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
it keeps going, 900s will be its target.

I'm interested in this. I don't want to
 

1865
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,470
I'm interested in this. I don't want to

right now.

1870
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:02,559
right now.
 

1871
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,750
right now.
It's one of those where

1872
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
It's one of those where
 

1873
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,589
It's one of those where
if I don't see what I want to see, it's

1874
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:07,599
if I don't see what I want to see, it's
 

1875
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,510
if I don't see what I want to see, it's
uh

1876
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
uh
 

1877
00:55:09,520 --> 00:56:17,430
uh
it's not of interest to me.

1878
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:17,440

 

1879
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,910

there's nothing to do. Any big lots

1880
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
there's nothing to do. Any big lots
 

1881
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,030
there's nothing to do. Any big lots
above? Uh, not really.

1882
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,040
above? Uh, not really.
 

1883
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:34,309
above? Uh, not really.
Not really.

1884
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:34,319

 

1885
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,910

It still looks like it wants to squeeze

1886
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920
It still looks like it wants to squeeze
 

1887
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,230
It still looks like it wants to squeeze
more, but uh you know, it's got that

1888
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:38,240
more, but uh you know, it's got that
 

1889
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,270
more, but uh you know, it's got that
little We've taken it once here. I mean,

1890
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
little We've taken it once here. I mean,
 

1891
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,190
little We've taken it once here. I mean,
maybe we trade through it again. 900 is

1892
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
maybe we trade through it again. 900 is
 

1893
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,710
maybe we trade through it again. 900 is
probably the target at the moment, but

1894
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:44,720
probably the target at the moment, but
 

1895
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,150
probably the target at the moment, but
it's just like,

1896
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,160

 

1897
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,789

how are you going to buy this up here?

1898
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:50,799
how are you going to buy this up here?
 

1899
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,390
how are you going to buy this up here?
What's upset? I think what the reason

1900
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
What's upset? I think what the reason
 

1901
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,270
What's upset? I think what the reason
I'm is why do they have to keep doing

1902
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:55,280
I'm is why do they have to keep doing
 

1903
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,829
I'm is why do they have to keep doing
this premarket? Why do this move

1904
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:57,839
this premarket? Why do this move
 

1905
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,150
this premarket? Why do this move
premarket? They're such [\h__\h] doing

1906
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:00,160
premarket? They're such [\h__\h] doing
 

1907
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,710
premarket? They're such [\h__\h] doing
that pre-market. Like they won't let us

1908
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:02,720
that pre-market. Like they won't let us
 

1909
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,950
that pre-market. Like they won't let us
have it. And they have to do squeeze up

1910
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,960
have it. And they have to do squeeze up
 

1911
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,549
have it. And they have to do squeeze up
and dump down. I'm like, I'm not playing

1912
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:06,559
and dump down. I'm like, I'm not playing
 

1913
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,150
and dump down. I'm like, I'm not playing
that squeeze up and I'm not playing that

1914
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160
that squeeze up and I'm not playing that
 

1915
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,829
that squeeze up and I'm not playing that
dump down. And then once we get to the

1916
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:09,839
dump down. And then once we get to the
 

1917
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,750
dump down. And then once we get to the
level of liquidity,

1918
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
level of liquidity,
 

1919
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,349
level of liquidity,
they don't give us an option here. They

1920
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:13,359
they don't give us an option here. They
 

1921
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:14,710
they don't give us an option here. They
have to break out and retest. You're

1922
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:14,720
have to break out and retest. You're
 

1923
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,510
have to break out and retest. You're
forcing me to buy the high of weak to

1924
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
forcing me to buy the high of weak to
 

1925
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,990
forcing me to buy the high of weak to
trade higher.

1926
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
trade higher.
 

1927
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,390
trade higher.
Like I just won't do it. I'd rather not

1928
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:22,400
Like I just won't do it. I'd rather not
 

1929
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:33,270
Like I just won't do it. I'd rather not
trade than do that.

1930
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280

 

1931
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,349

Continuation to squeeze here. That's all

1932
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:35,359
Continuation to squeeze here. That's all
 

1933
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:49,510
Continuation to squeeze here. That's all
we're doing.

1934
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:49,520

 

1935
00:57:49,520 --> 00:58:00,069

Delta looks good. Really good.

1936
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:00,079

 

1937
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,589

I'll grab a coffee here. Be right back.

1938
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:01,599
I'll grab a coffee here. Be right back.
 

1939
00:58:01,599 --> 01:00:04,069
I'll grab a coffee here. Be right back.
Cuz this ain't moving for me.

1940
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079

 

1941
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,230

All right. Are they there yet? Still,

1942
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:06,240
All right. Are they there yet? Still,
 

1943
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,630
All right. Are they there yet? Still,
they're trying to squeeze up to 900.

1944
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:12,640

 

1945
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,589

Delta still strong.

1946
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:15,599
Delta still strong.
 

1947
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,349
Delta still strong.

for whatever reason their intentions are
 

1985
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,430
for whatever reason their intentions are
just to take this higher on low volume

1986
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:05,440
just to take this higher on low volume
 

1987
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,390
just to take this higher on low volume
and there's no strong selling now if we

1988
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:08,400
and there's no strong selling now if we
 

1989
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,430
and there's no strong selling now if we
if structure changes and we start seeing

1990
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,440
if structure changes and we start seeing
 

1991
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,150
if structure changes and we start seeing
this market you know rolling over or

1992
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
this market you know rolling over or
 

1993
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,589
this market you know rolling over or

Yeah, but of course, but like all all

1998
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:21,119
Yeah, but of course, but like all all
 

1999
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,270
Yeah, but of course, but like all all
levels are are those they're they're

2000
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
levels are are those they're they're
 

2001
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,870
levels are are those they're they're
levels, right? They're just levels.

2002
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:24,880
levels, right? They're just levels.
 

2003
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,230
levels, right? They're just levels.
They're nothing more than levels. What

2004
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,240
They're nothing more than levels. What
 

2005
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,390
They're nothing more than levels. What
matters is how we react into a level. If

2006
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,400
matters is how we react into a level. If
 

2007
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,390
matters is how we react into a level. If
you got short at 900 cuz you like that

2008
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:30,400
you got short at 900 cuz you like that
 

2009
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,789
you got short at 900 cuz you like that
level and this market continues

2010
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:32,799
level and this market continues
 

2011
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,829
level and this market continues
screaming and then goes for 25,000 and

2012
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:35,839
screaming and then goes for 25,000 and
 

2013
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,270
screaming and then goes for 25,000 and
all the way up into this block, you're

2014
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,280
all the way up into this block, you're
 

2015
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,870
all the way up into this block, you're
going to get butt hurt, aren't you? So,

2016
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:38,880
going to get butt hurt, aren't you? So,
 

2017
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,270
going to get butt hurt, aren't you? So,
it it's it's more about, you know, if we

2018
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:41,280
it it's it's more about, you know, if we
 

2019
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,829
it it's it's more about, you know, if we
do something like this, okay, I'd

2020
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:43,839
do something like this, okay, I'd
 

2021
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,670
do something like this, okay, I'd
consider it, but what's the trend on the

2022
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
consider it, but what's the trend on the
 

2023
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,069
consider it, but what's the trend on the
day? trends up again after what? Two,

2024
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:48,079
day? trends up again after what? Two,
 

2025
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,069
day? trends up again after what? Two,
you got to think about this. Two traps.

2026
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:50,079
you got to think about this. Two traps.
 

2027
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,990
you got to think about this. Two traps.
There's your first trap. There's your

2028
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
There's your first trap. There's your
 

2029
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,230
There's your first trap. There's your
second trap. They want to move higher.

2030
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,240
second trap. They want to move higher.
 

2031
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,069
second trap. They want to move higher.
And so, so anything that holds this is

2032
01:01:56,069 --> 01:01:56,079
And so, so anything that holds this is
 

2033
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,589
And so, so anything that holds this is
going to continue to move higher. All

2034
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:57,599
going to continue to move higher. All
 

2035
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,589
going to continue to move higher. All
they want to do is move higher for

2036
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
they want to do is move higher for
 

2037
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,230
they want to do is move higher for
whatever reasons. I've talked about it

2038
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:02,240
whatever reasons. I've talked about it
 

2039
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,549
whatever reasons. I've talked about it
extensively on socials. All they want to

2040
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:04,559
extensively on socials. All they want to
 

2041
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,069
extensively on socials. All they want to
do is move higher.

2042
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079

 

2043
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,589

We're just printing higher highs, higher

2044
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:11,599
We're just printing higher highs, higher
 

2045
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,589
We're just printing higher highs, higher
lows, higher highs, higher lows. and and

2046
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:13,599
lows, higher highs, higher lows. and and
 

2047
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,069
lows, higher highs, higher lows. and and
anything that's not that is a trap for

2048
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
anything that's not that is a trap for
 

2049
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:44,710
anything that's not that is a trap for
them to absorb

2050
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:44,720

 

2051
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,349

No, I don't trade gold.

2052
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:49,359

 

2053
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:50,789

Let's see if there's a pullback here,

2054
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:50,799
Let's see if there's a pullback here,
 

2055
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,390
Let's see if there's a pullback here,
whether they hold this old wick here or

2056
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:52,400
whether they hold this old wick here or
 

2057
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,829
whether they hold this old wick here or
come all the way down here. But you can

2058
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:53,839
come all the way down here. But you can
 

2059
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,430
come all the way down here. But you can
see this is developing as like

2060
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:57,440
see this is developing as like
 

2061
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,150
see this is developing as like
we're thick here on the profile,

2062
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:00,160
we're thick here on the profile,
 

2063
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,549
we're thick here on the profile,
but we have quite a few nuggets here.

2064
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559
but we have quite a few nuggets here.
 

2065
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,870
but we have quite a few nuggets here.
This is never nice when they do this

2066
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
This is never nice when they do this
 

2067
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,230
This is never nice when they do this
because you never know which one they're

2068
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,240
because you never know which one they're
 

2069
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,230
because you never know which one they're
going to hold. So, it's kind of like

2070
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,240
going to hold. So, it's kind of like
 

2071
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,829
going to hold. So, it's kind of like
them to develop a bit more volume at

2072
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
them to develop a bit more volume at
 

2073
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,470
them to develop a bit more volume at
this point.

2074
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480
this point.
 

2075
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,789
this point.
I don't think they're done with it yet.

2076
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:14,799
I don't think they're done with it yet.
 

2077
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,230
I don't think they're done with it yet.
Don't think they're done with it yet.

2078
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:18,240
Don't think they're done with it yet.
 

2079
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,470
Don't think they're done with it yet.
I think any pullback probably gets

2080
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
I think any pullback probably gets
 

2081
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,309
I think any pullback probably gets
absorbed. If it's a nasty pullback,

2082
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:22,319
absorbed. If it's a nasty pullback,
 

2083
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,829
absorbed. If it's a nasty pullback,
probably even more of a trap to be

2084
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
probably even more of a trap to be
 

2085
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,549
probably even more of a trap to be
absorbed. That would be my guess on what

2086
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:26,559
absorbed. That would be my guess on what
 

2087
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,309
absorbed. That would be my guess on what
their intentions are right now. But

2088
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:30,319
their intentions are right now. But
 

2089
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:33,029
their intentions are right now. But
I said I don't I don't like buying a

2090
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:33,039
I said I don't I don't like buying a
 

2091
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,670
I said I don't I don't like buying a
high of weak to trade higher

2092
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:37,680

 

2093
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,430

the the trade don't please don't move

2094
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:39,440
the the trade don't please don't move
 

2095
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,549
the the trade don't please don't move
that the trade this morning was

2096
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
that the trade this morning was
 

2097
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,630
that the trade this morning was
pre-market that was the entry for me I

2098
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:42,640
pre-market that was the entry for me I
 

2099
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,150
pre-market that was the entry for me I
would say this morning some of you took

2100
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
would say this morning some of you took
 

2101
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,910
would say this morning some of you took
this I did talk about this entry but I'm

2102
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:45,920
this I did talk about this entry but I'm
 

2103
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,670
this I did talk about this entry but I'm
not like I don't want to take that entry

2104
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:49,680
not like I don't want to take that entry
 

2105
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,430
not like I don't want to take that entry
but you know unfortunately they built

2106
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:51,440
but you know unfortunately they built
 

2107
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,789
but you know unfortunately they built
this above it would have been really

2108
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:52,799
this above it would have been really
 

2109
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,549
this above it would have been really
nice if they were kind and built it here

2110
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:54,559
nice if they were kind and built it here
 

2111
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:55,910
nice if they were kind and built it here
so we could have at least had a bit

2112
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:55,920
so we could have at least had a bit
 

2113
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,910
so we could have at least had a bit
cheaper but this entry here was decent

2114
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:57,920
cheaper but this entry here was decent
 

2115
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,670
cheaper but this entry here was decent
and this is your trend up now. So maybe

2116
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
and this is your trend up now. So maybe
 

2117
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,549
and this is your trend up now. So maybe
a pull back into here,

2118
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:02,559
a pull back into here,
 

2119
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,710
a pull back into here,
but certainly it's too too high in the

2120
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:04,720
but certainly it's too too high in the
 

2121
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,029
but certainly it's too too high in the
day for me to uh think about doing much

2122
01:04:07,029 --> 01:04:07,039
day for me to uh think about doing much
 

2123
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:42,950
day for me to uh think about doing much
with

2124
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960

 

2125
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,630

So, I'd say you'd be looking if you're

2126
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,640
So, I'd say you'd be looking if you're
 

2127
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,630
So, I'd say you'd be looking if you're
still in this long.

2128
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:46,640
still in this long.
 

2129
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,029
still in this long.
Let's get rid of this. Clean this up.

2130
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:49,039
Let's get rid of this. Clean this up.
 

2131
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,950
Let's get rid of this. Clean this up.
Hello. There we go. If you're still in

2132
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:50,960
Hello. There we go. If you're still in
 

2133
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,069
Hello. There we go. If you're still in
this long, you're looking for up here

2134
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
this long, you're looking for up here
 

2135
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,390
this long, you're looking for up here
into 900. That's your next target,

2136
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:54,400
into 900. That's your next target,
 

2137
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,309
into 900. That's your next target,
right? 900's your next target. And then

2138
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:56,319
right? 900's your next target. And then
 

2139
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,309
right? 900's your next target. And then
if you get through that, uh, we have got

2140
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
if you get through that, uh, we have got
 

2141
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,750
if you get through that, uh, we have got
another block all the way up here above

2142
01:04:59,750 --> 01:04:59,760
another block all the way up here above
 

2143
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,789
another block all the way up here above
25,000. So I'd say 25,000 uh, sorry,

2144
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:02,799
25,000. So I'd say 25,000 uh, sorry,
 

2145
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:15,910
25,000. So I'd say 25,000 uh, sorry,
26,000 whole number and then 26,80.

2146
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:15,920

 

2147
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,349

First time we've seen a bit of selling

2148
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
First time we've seen a bit of selling
 

2149
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:21,510
First time we've seen a bit of selling
up here.

2150
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:21,520

 

2151
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,829

Still don't think it's done. Still think

2152
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:23,839
Still don't think it's done. Still think
 

2153
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:28,870
Still don't think it's done. Still think
any pullback probably gets absorbed.

2154
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:28,880

 

2155
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,950

VIX has just found a bid. It's first bid

2156
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
VIX has just found a bid. It's first bid
 

2157
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,630
VIX has just found a bid. It's first bid
on the day, but

2158
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:36,640

 

2159
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,190

I don't know.

2160
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,200

 

2161
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,710

Nice, John. Yeah. So, you were in

2162
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:42,720
Nice, John. Yeah. So, you were in
 

2163
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,470
Nice, John. Yeah. So, you were in
pre-market 648. Uh,

2164
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:46,480
pre-market 648. Uh,
 

2165
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,069
pre-market 648. Uh,
yeah, you were in premarket. Really not.

2166
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:48,079
yeah, you were in premarket. Really not.
 

2167
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:49,510
yeah, you were in premarket. Really not.
I mean, that was the trade like we

2168
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:49,520
I mean, that was the trade like we
 

2169
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,270
I mean, that was the trade like we
talked about. That was the trade for you

2170
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
talked about. That was the trade for you
 

2171
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,230
talked about. That was the trade for you
guys. This buy, here's your signal

2172
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:54,240
guys. This buy, here's your signal
 

2173
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,549
guys. This buy, here's your signal
screaming buy. All right, there's the

2174
01:05:56,549 --> 01:05:56,559
screaming buy. All right, there's the
 

2175
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,990
screaming buy. All right, there's the
previous day PC gap fill previous day

2176
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
previous day PC gap fill previous day
 

2177
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,150
previous day PC gap fill previous day
value high. As soon as we reclaim that,

2178
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
value high. As soon as we reclaim that,
 

2179
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,829
value high. As soon as we reclaim that,
that's your buy and then we're off to

2180
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:03,839
that's your buy and then we're off to
 

2181
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,150
that's your buy and then we're off to
the races. That's the smart money buyers

2182
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,160
the races. That's the smart money buyers
 

2183
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,789
the races. That's the smart money buyers
down there. Absolutely.

2184
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:08,799
down there. Absolutely.
 

2185
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,309
down there. Absolutely.
Oh,

2186
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
Oh,
 

2187
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:17,430
Oh,
get rid of that. We're going to need it.

2188
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,440

 

2189
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,950

Thanks, John. Appreciate it, my friend.

2190
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:20,960
Thanks, John. Appreciate it, my friend.
 

2191
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,309
Thanks, John. Appreciate it, my friend.
All right, so current value on the day

2192
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:22,319
All right, so current value on the day
 

2193
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,710
All right, so current value on the day
is 8:14. So, I'd say bulls will want to

2194
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:24,720
is 8:14. So, I'd say bulls will want to
 

2195
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:30,710
is 8:14. So, I'd say bulls will want to
sort of protect that 814ish.

2196
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:30,720

 

2197
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,390

They won't want it trading back into

2198
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:32,400
They won't want it trading back into
 

2199
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,750
They won't want it trading back into
value for the day. They want to start

2200
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:33,760
value for the day. They want to start
 

2201
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,069
value for the day. They want to start
moving value up if they're going to

2202
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:36,079
moving value up if they're going to
 

2203
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,630
moving value up if they're going to
complete a rotation. So, that's what

2204
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,640
complete a rotation. So, that's what
 

2205
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,990
complete a rotation. So, that's what
they're going to want. Nvidia couldn't

2206
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,000
they're going to want. Nvidia couldn't
 

2207
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,430
they're going to want. Nvidia couldn't
go red to green. It tried and failed.

2208
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:43,440
go red to green. It tried and failed.
 

2209
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,309
go red to green. It tried and failed.
Rest of the market's all green. VIX is

2210
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:46,319
Rest of the market's all green. VIX is
 

2211
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,150
Rest of the market's all green. VIX is
starting to push. Uh, I'd be slightly

2212
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:48,160
starting to push. Uh, I'd be slightly
 

2213
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,270
starting to push. Uh, I'd be slightly
concerned with what they're going to do

2214
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:49,280
concerned with what they're going to do
 

2215
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,950
concerned with what they're going to do
with the options. If VIX starts breaking

2216
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
with the options. If VIX starts breaking
 

2217
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,029
with the options. If VIX starts breaking
out through the New York open, I'd be

2218
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
out through the New York open, I'd be
 

2219
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,950
out through the New York open, I'd be
slightly concerned because we're going

2220
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:54,960
slightly concerned because we're going
 

2221
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,870
slightly concerned because we're going
to start having huge divergences if it

2222
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:56,880
to start having huge divergences if it
 

2223
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,390
to start having huge divergences if it
does that. Let me just check that this

2224
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
does that. Let me just check that this
 

2225
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,630
does that. Let me just check that this
is on the right thing. - 5.

2226
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:02,640
is on the right thing. - 5.
 

2227
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,230
is on the right thing. - 5.
Yeah, I'd be concerned because if SPY is

2228
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:06,240
Yeah, I'd be concerned because if SPY is
 

2229
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,750
Yeah, I'd be concerned because if SPY is
not pulling back and VIX is starting to

2230
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:07,760
not pulling back and VIX is starting to
 

2231
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,670
not pulling back and VIX is starting to
like trade back upside, it's a bit

2232
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:09,680
like trade back upside, it's a bit
 

2233
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,309
like trade back upside, it's a bit
weird. And again, I would just maintain

2234
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:12,319
weird. And again, I would just maintain
 

2235
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,470
weird. And again, I would just maintain
I think this whole market is just option

2236
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:14,480
I think this whole market is just option
 

2237
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,630
I think this whole market is just option
dealers at the moment and it's going to

2238
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
dealers at the moment and it's going to
 

2239
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,950
dealers at the moment and it's going to
make it very hard to pull the trigger

2240
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
make it very hard to pull the trigger
 

2241
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,789
make it very hard to pull the trigger
doing anything when we're just being run

2242
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:20,799
doing anything when we're just being run
 

2243
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,349
doing anything when we're just being run
by zero DTE.

2244
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
by zero DTE.
 

2245
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,910
by zero DTE.
That's the market we've got and we can't

2246
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
That's the market we've got and we can't
 

2247
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,390
That's the market we've got and we can't
change it. So, we're leaving volume

2248
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
change it. So, we're leaving volume
 

2249
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,990
change it. So, we're leaving volume
trapped at this high. Again, the

2250
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000
trapped at this high. Again, the
 

2251
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,950
trapped at this high. Again, the
question is, do we hold value? This

2252
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
question is, do we hold value? This
 

2253
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,349
question is, do we hold value? This
level here is becoming important.

2254
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:37,359
level here is becoming important.
 

2255
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,430
level here is becoming important.
Current value on the session for me on

2256
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:39,440
Current value on the session for me on
 

2257
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,870
Current value on the session for me on
Ninja Trader is 8:14. So yeah, around

2258
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:42,880
Ninja Trader is 8:14. So yeah, around
 

2259
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,109
Ninja Trader is 8:14. So yeah, around
here bulls will want to hold around here

2260
01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:45,119
here bulls will want to hold around here
 

2261
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,470
here bulls will want to hold around here
basically. If they can't,

2262
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
basically. If they can't,
 

2263
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,710
basically. If they can't,
maybe you get a deeper wash. I'd say

2264
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:50,720
maybe you get a deeper wash. I'd say
 

2265
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,309
maybe you get a deeper wash. I'd say
bulls will be looking to do something

2266
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:52,319
bulls will be looking to do something
 

2267
01:07:52,319 --> 01:08:18,229
bulls will be looking to do something
like this at the moment.

2268
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239

 

2269
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,229

So, how we act at this volume above now

2270
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:20,239
So, how we act at this volume above now
 

2271
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:23,110
So, how we act at this volume above now
is about to become key, folks. So, this

2272
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,120
is about to become key, folks. So, this
 

2273
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,309
is about to become key, folks. So, this
uh 50s, how we acting to 50s is key. If

2274
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:26,319
uh 50s, how we acting to 50s is key. If
 

2275
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,149
uh 50s, how we acting to 50s is key. If
they reject 50s, you might get the start

2276
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:28,159
they reject 50s, you might get the start
 

2277
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:30,070
they reject 50s, you might get the start
of a rollover. If they reclaim it, then

2278
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:30,080
of a rollover. If they reclaim it, then
 

2279
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,590
of a rollover. If they reclaim it, then
I would say this was a trap that we

2280
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:31,600
I would say this was a trap that we
 

2281
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,870
I would say this was a trap that we
talked about and we're probably going to

2282
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
talked about and we're probably going to
 

2283
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,070
talked about and we're probably going to
go higher, which is what you're starting

2284
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:34,080
go higher, which is what you're starting
 

2285
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,510
go higher, which is what you're starting
to see. So, they're starting to reclaim

2286
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:35,520
to see. So, they're starting to reclaim
 

2287
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,990
to see. So, they're starting to reclaim
it.

2288
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:38,000

 

2289
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,590

So if you're going to get this and then

2290
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:39,600
So if you're going to get this and then
 

2291
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,470
So if you're going to get this and then
I think you get 900s, right? So that's

2292
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
I think you get 900s, right? So that's
 

2293
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,229
I think you get 900s, right? So that's
why I said it's a very bullish day right

2294
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:44,239
why I said it's a very bullish day right
 

2295
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:48,709
why I said it's a very bullish day right
now. It's a squeeze out.

2296
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:48,719

 

2297
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,789

So through the 50s or into the 50s, if

2298
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
So through the 50s or into the 50s, if
 

2299
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,269
So through the 50s or into the 50s, if
they get through 60s,

2300
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:53,279
they get through 60s,
 

2301
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,870
they get through 60s,
they should come and trade up. If they

2302
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
they should come and trade up. If they
 

2303
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,470
they should come and trade up. If they
get through 60, 60s is where all the

2304
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:56,480
get through 60, 60s is where all the
 

2305
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,550
get through 60, 60s is where all the
sellers came in.

2306
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:58,560
sellers came in.
 

2307
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,709
sellers came in.
Yeah, 60 all the way up to 65 is where

2308
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:00,719
Yeah, 60 all the way up to 65 is where
 

2309
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,189
Yeah, 60 all the way up to 65 is where
the sellers came in. So bulls need to

2310
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:03,199
the sellers came in. So bulls need to
 

2311
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:06,390
the sellers came in. So bulls need to
hold 50s and reclaim 60s. And if they

2312
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:06,400
hold 50s and reclaim 60s. And if they
 

2313
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,149
hold 50s and reclaim 60s. And if they
get through 60s, there's a drive up. If

2314
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:08,159
get through 60s, there's a drive up. If
 

2315
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:09,749
get through 60s, there's a drive up. If
they reject this volume here, I mean, I

2316
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:09,759
they reject this volume here, I mean, I
 

2317
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,189
they reject this volume here, I mean, I
guess you could reject the top of the

2318
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:11,199
guess you could reject the top of the
 

2319
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,870
guess you could reject the top of the
range, which would be slightly odd.

2320
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:14,880
range, which would be slightly odd.
 

2321
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,749
range, which would be slightly odd.
If we reject this, then maybe a rotation

2322
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
If we reject this, then maybe a rotation
 

2323
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,669
If we reject this, then maybe a rotation
back down into search for some of the

2324
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
back down into search for some of the
 

2325
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,550
back down into search for some of the
structure. If they get through this,

2326
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560
structure. If they get through this,
 

2327
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:39,189
structure. If they get through this,
then obviously more upside.

2328
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:39,199

 

2329
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,510

That's a good point, Willer. Uh, let me

2330
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
That's a good point, Willer. Uh, let me
 

2331
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,789
That's a good point, Willer. Uh, let me
have a look where we're at.

2332
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:44,799
have a look where we're at.
 

2333
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,950
have a look where we're at.
Yeah.

2334
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:46,960
Yeah.
 

2335
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,870
Yeah.
So, 6869

2336
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:48,880
So, 6869
 

2337
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,870
So, 6869
spy key through that alltime high.

2338
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
spy key through that alltime high.
 

2339
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,349
spy key through that alltime high.
You're not far away. You're not far

2340
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:53,359
You're not far away. You're not far
 

2341
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,510
You're not far away. You're not far
away. You're really not far away, are

2342
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:55,520
away. You're really not far away, are
 

2343
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:03,430
away. You're really not far away, are
you? Crazy.

2344
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:03,440

 

2345
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,390

Just seems like uh

2346
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:06,400
Just seems like uh
 

2347
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,070
Just seems like uh
market makers want their Christmas

2348
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,080
market makers want their Christmas
 

2349
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,550
market makers want their Christmas
bonuses. These hedge funds like we need

2350
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,560
bonuses. These hedge funds like we need
 

2351
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,310
bonuses. These hedge funds like we need
our Christmas bonuses. They've gobbled

2352
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:12,320
our Christmas bonuses. They've gobbled
 

2353
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:19,030
our Christmas bonuses. They've gobbled
everything up.

2354
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:19,040

 

2355
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:26,709

Yeah, no worries, Adam.

2356
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:26,719

 

2357
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,149

failing to get through this volume at

2358
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
failing to get through this volume at
 

2359
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,590
failing to get through this volume at
the moment for bulls. So, it's starting

2360
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:29,600
the moment for bulls. So, it's starting
 

2361
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,270
the moment for bulls. So, it's starting
to get a bit care. I'd be a bit careful

2362
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
to get a bit care. I'd be a bit careful
 

2363
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,870
to get a bit care. I'd be a bit careful
up here. If you were long from down

2364
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:32,880
up here. If you were long from down
 

2365
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,310
up here. If you were long from down
here, make sure you've taken some

2366
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
here, make sure you've taken some
 

2367
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,070
here, make sure you've taken some
profit. You should be trying to get up

2368
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,080
profit. You should be trying to get up
 

2369
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,750
profit. You should be trying to get up
here into the 900s, but you'd want to

2370
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:37,760
here into the 900s, but you'd want to
 

2371
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,310
here into the 900s, but you'd want to
see a push and a push soon. A push soon.

2372
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
see a push and a push soon. A push soon.
 

2373
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,310
see a push and a push soon. A push soon.
A push soon.

2374
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,320
A push soon.
 

2375
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,229
A push soon.
A push soon. If they don't get a push

2376
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:46,239
A push soon. If they don't get a push
 

2377
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:47,590
A push soon. If they don't get a push
soon, they're going to get trapped up

2378
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
soon, they're going to get trapped up
 

2379
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,709
soon, they're going to get trapped up
here. You definitely don't want to be a

2380
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:48,719
here. You definitely don't want to be a
 

2381
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,390
here. You definitely don't want to be a
new money buyer up here. That's for

2382
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,400
new money buyer up here. That's for
 

2383
01:10:50,400 --> 01:11:13,430
new money buyer up here. That's for
sure.

2384
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:13,440

 

2385
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,790

not seeing that acceleration up here.

2386
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:16,800
not seeing that acceleration up here.
 

2387
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,390
not seeing that acceleration up here.
We've just had a higher high on delta

2388
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:18,400
We've just had a higher high on delta
 

2389
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,149
We've just had a higher high on delta
without seeing a higher high on the

2390
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:20,159
without seeing a higher high on the
 

2391
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,750
without seeing a higher high on the
market. So, I'm slightly concerned that

2392
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
market. So, I'm slightly concerned that
 

2393
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,270
market. So, I'm slightly concerned that
there's a passive seller now starting to

2394
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:23,280
there's a passive seller now starting to
 

2395
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,550
there's a passive seller now starting to
absorb here for you guys who are long.

2396
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:26,560
absorb here for you guys who are long.
 

2397
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,990
absorb here for you guys who are long.
You want to see this market break out

2398
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
You want to see this market break out
 

2399
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,430
You want to see this market break out
and it's got to do it soon. If it

2400
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:29,440
and it's got to do it soon. If it
 

2401
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,550
and it's got to do it soon. If it
doesn't do it, you're going to get a

2402
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:30,560
doesn't do it, you're going to get a
 

2403
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,990
doesn't do it, you're going to get a
deeper roll over because you're starting

2404
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,000
deeper roll over because you're starting
 

2405
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,510
deeper roll over because you're starting
to build quite a lot of volume up here

2406
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:33,520
to build quite a lot of volume up here
 

2407
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,990
to build quite a lot of volume up here
in this gray box. So, if you don't see a

2408
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
in this gray box. So, if you don't see a
 

2409
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,110
in this gray box. So, if you don't see a
breakout soon, I'd be very concerned

2410
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,120
breakout soon, I'd be very concerned
 

2411
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,310
breakout soon, I'd be very concerned
because it means there's a passive

2412
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:40,320
because it means there's a passive
 

2413
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:51,910
because it means there's a passive
seller is now protecting 60s.

2414
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:51,920

 

2415
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,750

Once you bust through 60s, you'll get a

2416
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:53,760
Once you bust through 60s, you'll get a
 

2417
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,030
Once you bust through 60s, you'll get a
pop. But if you can't do that,

2418
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,040
pop. But if you can't do that,
 

2419
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,870
pop. But if you can't do that,
you've got delta divergence with price

2420
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:58,880
you've got delta divergence with price
 

2421
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,430
you've got delta divergence with price
and that's problematic.

2422
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
and that's problematic.
 

2423
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,270
and that's problematic.
And we can see he came they came flying

2424
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:03,280
And we can see he came they came flying
 

2425
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,430
And we can see he came they came flying
in at 60 and you you have not been able

2426
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,440
in at 60 and you you have not been able
 

2427
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,870
in at 60 and you you have not been able
to get back into there yet.

2428
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:10,880

 

2429
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,390

You're having another attempt here and

2430
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
You're having another attempt here and
 

2431
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,550
You're having another attempt here and
you're getting stuck. I'd be slightly

2432
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:14,560
you're getting stuck. I'd be slightly
 

2433
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,310
you're getting stuck. I'd be slightly
concerned here for you guys who are

2434
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,320
concerned here for you guys who are
 

2435
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:40,870
concerned here for you guys who are
long. You're starting to get stuck.

2436
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880

 

2437
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,350

VIX still

2438
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,360
VIX still
 

2439
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,350
VIX still
starting to move back upside trying to

2440
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
starting to move back upside trying to
 

2441
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,189
starting to move back upside trying to
get back to its New York open. Be

2442
01:12:47,189 --> 01:12:47,199
get back to its New York open. Be
 

2443
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,750
get back to its New York open. Be
careful folks. This is uh got a few

2444
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:49,760
careful folks. This is uh got a few
 

2445
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,669
careful folks. This is uh got a few
danger signs going here. You made a

2446
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:51,679
danger signs going here. You made a
 

2447
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,430
danger signs going here. You made a
higher high on delta, not a higher high

2448
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,440
higher high on delta, not a higher high
 

2449
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,550
higher high on delta, not a higher high
on price. You're stuck at 60 through 60.

2450
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:56,560
on price. You're stuck at 60 through 60.
 

2451
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,550
on price. You're stuck at 60 through 60.
I absolutely think you can pump. But at

2452
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
I absolutely think you can pump. But at
 

2453
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,229
I absolutely think you can pump. But at
the moment,

2454
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:00,239
the moment,
 

2455
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,270
the moment,
you've got a passive seller here. 60 70

2456
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:03,280
you've got a passive seller here. 60 70
 

2457
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,189
you've got a passive seller here. 60 70
75. They keep selling and you haven't

2458
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199
75. They keep selling and you haven't
 

2459
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,510
75. They keep selling and you haven't
even got through the 60 to test those 70

2460
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
even got through the 60 to test those 70
 

2461
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,790
even got through the 60 to test those 70
and 75s yet. Structure is bullish, but

2462
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:10,800
and 75s yet. Structure is bullish, but
 

2463
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,229
and 75s yet. Structure is bullish, but
wouldn't be surprised if they need to

2464
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,239
wouldn't be surprised if they need to
 

2465
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,830
wouldn't be surprised if they need to
swipe it down before they do anything

2466
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:13,840
swipe it down before they do anything
 

2467
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:19,270
swipe it down before they do anything
else. So, just be careful.

2468
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280

 

2469
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,110

Manage your positions accordingly. I'm

01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,120
Manage your positions accordingly. I'm
 

2471

Manage your positions accordingly. I'm
still flat on the day doing absolute

01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,040
still flat on the day doing absolute

still flat on the day doing absolute
bugger all. PC now moved up here. Oh, I

bugger all. PC now moved up here. Oh, I
 

2475
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,030
bugger all. PC now moved up here. Oh, I
don't like seeing that. You've traded

2476
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
don't like seeing that. You've traded
 

2477
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,110
don't like seeing that. You've traded
here so for so long now. This is being

2478
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,120
here so for so long now. This is being
 

2479
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,790
here so for so long now. This is being
considered fair value. You want to be

2480
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:32,800
considered fair value. You want to be
 

2481
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,590
considered fair value. You want to be
careful here.

2482
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:37,600

 

2483
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,790

Now fair value up here. We're not seeing

Now fair value up here. We're not seeing

01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,310
Now fair value up here. We're not seeing
price move higher. You're seeing delta

2486
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:42,320
price move higher. You're seeing delta
 

2487
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,990
price move higher. You're seeing delta
divergence start to play out. I'd be

2488
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,000
divergence start to play out. I'd be
 

2489
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,950
divergence start to play out. I'd be
very very very careful at this point.

2490
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:46,960
very very very careful at this point.
 

2491
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,709
very very very careful at this point.
They've had numerous attempts to move it

2492
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:48,719
They've had numerous attempts to move it
 

2493
01:13:48,719 --> 01:14:04,149
They've had numerous attempts to move it
higher and they're not able to.

2494
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159

 

2495
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,950

Where did that big cluster come in? 30s

2496
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:06,960
Where did that big cluster come in? 30s
 

2497
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,750
Where did that big cluster come in? 30s
and 800s. Okay.

2498
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:11,760

 

2499
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,030

You're starting to lose it. Delta

2500
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
You're starting to lose it. Delta
 

2501
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,470
You're starting to lose it. Delta
divergence playing out. You didn't

2502
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:14,480
divergence playing out. You didn't
 

2503
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,990
divergence playing out. You didn't
reclaim that grade box. You're rejecting

2504
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:16,000
reclaim that grade box. You're rejecting
 

2505
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,910
reclaim that grade box. You're rejecting
the grade box. We're going to can

2506
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:17,920
the grade box. We're going to can
 

2507
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,350
the grade box. We're going to can
possibly trade all the way down here. We

2508
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:19,360
possibly trade all the way down here. We
 

2509
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,950
possibly trade all the way down here. We
lack structure really. There are a lot

2510
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:20,960
lack structure really. There are a lot
 

2511
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,709
lack structure really. There are a lot
of nodes here, but uh if they want to

2512
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:22,719
of nodes here, but uh if they want to
 

2513
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,149
of nodes here, but uh if they want to
drift all the way down, they will

2514
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:24,159
drift all the way down, they will
 

2515
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,430
drift all the way down, they will
absolutely do that. If they're

2516
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:25,440
absolutely do that. If they're
 

2517
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,110
absolutely do that. If they're
exhausted,

2518
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:27,120
exhausted,
 

2519
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:33,430
exhausted,
they will do that.

2520
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440

 

2521
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,189

VIX back to that New York open.

2522
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:35,199
VIX back to that New York open.
 

2523
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,030
VIX back to that New York open.
Honestly, mate, this is not a good look

2524
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,040
Honestly, mate, this is not a good look
 

2525
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,750
Honestly, mate, this is not a good look
what you're seeing in the market.

2526
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
what you're seeing in the market.
 

2527
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,830
what you're seeing in the market.
You're not seeing spy at New York Open.

2528
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,840
You're not seeing spy at New York Open.
 

2529
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,830
You're not seeing spy at New York Open.
This is uh you got major divergence

2530
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:43,840
This is uh you got major divergence
 

2531
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,470
This is uh you got major divergence
starting to play out. Again, it's just

2532
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,480
starting to play out. Again, it's just
 

2533
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,470
starting to play out. Again, it's just
options dealers. That's all this is.

2534
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:50,480
options dealers. That's all this is.
 

2535
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:55,189
options dealers. That's all this is.
This is why I don't like these markets.

2536
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:55,199

 

2537
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,590

It's really shifted this market from the

2538
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
It's really shifted this market from the
 

2539
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,709
It's really shifted this market from the
last week of November. I'd say the feel

2540
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:00,719
last week of November. I'd say the feel
 

2541
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,030
last week of November. I'd say the feel
of this market has really shifted in how

2542
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:03,040
of this market has really shifted in how
 

2543
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,790
of this market has really shifted in how
we're moving. It's becoming less and

2544
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
we're moving. It's becoming less and
 

2545
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,189
we're moving. It's becoming less and
less technical and more and more about

2546
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
less technical and more and more about
 

2547
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,910
less technical and more and more about
just gamma levels. Uh we're not taking

2548
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:09,920
just gamma levels. Uh we're not taking
 

2549
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,630
just gamma levels. Uh we're not taking
liquidity. We're just doing, you know,

2550
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:12,640
liquidity. We're just doing, you know,
 

2551
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,630
liquidity. We're just doing, you know,
one move straight one way, then stop,

2552
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:14,640
one move straight one way, then stop,
 

2553
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,990
one move straight one way, then stop,
and then one move straight the other

2554
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:16,000
and then one move straight the other
 

2555
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,669
and then one move straight the other
way. It feels uh Yeah, it feels bizarre.

2556
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
way. It feels uh Yeah, it feels bizarre.
 

2557
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,070
way. It feels uh Yeah, it feels bizarre.
Doesn't feel

2558
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
Doesn't feel
 

2559
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,790
Doesn't feel
uh normal is not the right word, but it

2560
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800
uh normal is not the right word, but it
 

2561
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,070
uh normal is not the right word, but it
doesn't feel like the market we've had

2562
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,080
doesn't feel like the market we've had
 

2563
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,510
doesn't feel like the market we've had
all year. Feels like there's been a

2564
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:27,520
all year. Feels like there's been a
 

2565
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,470
all year. Feels like there's been a
major major shift.

2566
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:32,480

 

2567
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,229

I'd still say that gray box above you is

2568
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:34,239
I'd still say that gray box above you is
 

2569
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,510
I'd still say that gray box above you is
key. You've now got point of control,

2570
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
key. You've now got point of control,
 

2571
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,950
key. You've now got point of control,
the red line there. So, that's fair

2572
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:36,960
the red line there. So, that's fair
 

2573
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,310
the red line there. So, that's fair
value on the day. If you can't get back

2574
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:38,320
value on the day. If you can't get back
 

2575
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,830
value on the day. If you can't get back
above that, there's going to be no more

2576
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:39,840
above that, there's going to be no more
 

2577
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:48,550
above that, there's going to be no more
effort to move higher.

2578
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:48,560

 

2579
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,510

So, where's value on the day? 14s. So,

2580
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:51,520
So, where's value on the day? 14s. So,
 

2581
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,229
So, where's value on the day? 14s. So,
like I said, 14s will be the level bulls

2582
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:54,239
like I said, 14s will be the level bulls
 

2583
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,430
like I said, 14s will be the level bulls
won't want to see it below. If we go

2584
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:55,440
won't want to see it below. If we go
 

2585
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,350
won't want to see it below. If we go
back below that, you're back inside and

2586
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,360
back below that, you're back inside and
 

2587
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,669
back below that, you're back inside and
we can trade all the way down to 73.

2588
01:15:59,669 --> 01:15:59,679
we can trade all the way down to 73.
 

2589
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,350
we can trade all the way down to 73.
Might sound ridiculous, but that's what

2590
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:01,360
Might sound ridiculous, but that's what
 

2591
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:14,709
Might sound ridiculous, but that's what
the market's showing.

2592
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:14,719

 

2593
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:27,669

Here

2594
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679

 

2595
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,270

we go. They're going to test these 14s

2596
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280
we go. They're going to test these 14s
 

2597
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:38,950
we go. They're going to test these 14s
today.

2598
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960

 

2599
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:45,590

It's just rejected New York open.

2600
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:45,600

 

2601
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,709

You need uh Nvidia to go red to green.

2602
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
You need uh Nvidia to go red to green.
 

2603
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,390
You need uh Nvidia to go red to green.
That will really help you guys who are

2604
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:50,400
That will really help you guys who are
 

2605
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,310
That will really help you guys who are
long

2606
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,320
long
 

2607
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,630
long
and you're not seeing that yet. Still a

2608
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:54,640
and you're not seeing that yet. Still a
 

2609
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,910
and you're not seeing that yet. Still a
third of a percent down. Relative

2610
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:55,920
third of a percent down. Relative
 

2611
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,430
third of a percent down. Relative
weakness in Nvidia. It's not going to

2612
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:57,440
weakness in Nvidia. It's not going to
 

2613
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,350
weakness in Nvidia. It's not going to
help. Biggest stock in the world. It's

2614
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,360
help. Biggest stock in the world. It's
 

2615
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,870
help. Biggest stock in the world. It's
not been able to go red to green.

2616
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:00,880
not been able to go red to green.
 

2617
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,229
not been able to go red to green.
Doesn't mean it can't. It's just at the

2618
01:17:02,229 --> 01:17:02,239
Doesn't mean it can't. It's just at the
 

2619
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:03,910
Doesn't mean it can't. It's just at the
moment it hasn't been able to. It's had

2620
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
moment it hasn't been able to. It's had
 

2621
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,630
moment it hasn't been able to. It's had
a had a couple attempts at PDC and not

2622
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
a had a couple attempts at PDC and not
 

2623
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,790
a had a couple attempts at PDC and not
managed to do it.

2624
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:10,800

 

2625
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,390

Starting to see lower lows and lower

2626
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
Starting to see lower lows and lower
 

2627
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,229
Starting to see lower lows and lower
highs here. Unless you reclaim this gray

2628
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:14,239
highs here. Unless you reclaim this gray
 

2629
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:16,709
highs here. Unless you reclaim this gray
box, be very, very careful. Hopefully,

2630
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:16,719
box, be very, very careful. Hopefully,
 

2631
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,709
box, be very, very careful. Hopefully,
they can do it for you. But just be

2632
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:18,719
they can do it for you. But just be
 

2633
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:29,110
they can do it for you. But just be
smart.

2634
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:29,120

 

2635
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,709

I want this to get through the gray box

2636
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
I want this to get through the gray box
 

2637
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,470
I want this to get through the gray box
and PC for you guys because then you can

2638
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,480
and PC for you guys because then you can
 

2639
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,149
and PC for you guys because then you can
get a squeeze out, which would be really

2640
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:34,159
get a squeeze out, which would be really
 

2641
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:57,350
get a squeeze out, which would be really
nice. Didn't quite get to 14s.

2642
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:57,360

 

2643
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,270

still looks like it wants to be bullish,

2644
01:17:59,270 --> 01:17:59,280
still looks like it wants to be bullish,
 

2645
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,790
still looks like it wants to be bullish,
but it's this level up here which is

2646
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
but it's this level up here which is
 

2647
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,950
but it's this level up here which is
key. And see where we've trapped. We've

2648
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:02,960
key. And see where we've trapped. We've
 

2649
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,229
key. And see where we've trapped. We've
never been able to get back through

2650
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:04,239
never been able to get back through
 

2651
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,229
never been able to get back through
this. That's your level. That's your

2652
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:06,239
this. That's your level. That's your
 

2653
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:29,270
this. That's your level. That's your
over under right now.

2654
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,280

 

2655
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,270

Retesting it again. Be very careful if

2656
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:31,280
Retesting it again. Be very careful if
 

2657
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,830
Retesting it again. Be very careful if
they fail here.

2658
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:33,840
they fail here.
 

2659
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,590
they fail here.
This is them poking up to see if there's

2660
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:35,600
This is them poking up to see if there's
 

2661
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,270
This is them poking up to see if there's
any more juice. You've made another

2662
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:37,280
any more juice. You've made another
 

2663
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,390
any more juice. You've made another
higher high on uh delta without making a

2664
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:40,400
higher high on uh delta without making a
 

2665
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,149
higher high on uh delta without making a
higher high on price. It's another delta

2666
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:42,159
higher high on price. It's another delta
 

2667
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:44,470
higher high on price. It's another delta
divergence here. Yet again, it means

2668
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:44,480
divergence here. Yet again, it means
 

2669
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,990
divergence here. Yet again, it means
there's a passive seller up here because

2670
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,000
there's a passive seller up here because
 

2671
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,070
there's a passive seller up here because
it means that you're aggressively buying

2672
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:48,080
it means that you're aggressively buying
 

2673
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,030
it means that you're aggressively buying
without the ability to move higher. So,

2674
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
without the ability to move higher. So,
 

2675
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,550
without the ability to move higher. So,
we know that there's passive selling

2676
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
we know that there's passive selling
 

2677
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,030
we know that there's passive selling
here because Delta's coming in strong by

2678
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,040
here because Delta's coming in strong by
 

2679
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,870
here because Delta's coming in strong by
side and it's not getting follow

2680
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
side and it's not getting follow
 

2681
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:03,510
side and it's not getting follow
through.

2682
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,520

 

2683
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,510

It's a retesting point of control on the

2684
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:05,520
It's a retesting point of control on the
 

2685
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,390
It's a retesting point of control on the
day. This is your level, folks. This

2686
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
day. This is your level, folks. This
 

2687
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,110
day. This is your level, folks. This
level you're banging into

2688
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:11,120
level you're banging into
 

2689
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,910
level you're banging into
50s and 60s. You need to reclaim that if

2690
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:13,920
50s and 60s. You need to reclaim that if
 

2691
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,990
50s and 60s. You need to reclaim that if
you're still long and that will open up

2692
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:16,000
you're still long and that will open up
 

2693
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,990
you're still long and that will open up
a squeeze to 900s. So, here's the

2694
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
a squeeze to 900s. So, here's the
 

2695
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,189
a squeeze to 900s. So, here's the
attempt to get through it. Here's the

2696
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
attempt to get through it. Here's the
 

2697
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,709
attempt to get through it. Here's the
attempt of 60s. Like we've talked about,

2698
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:22,719
attempt of 60s. Like we've talked about,
 

2699
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:23,910
attempt of 60s. Like we've talked about,
if you get through this, you should make

2700
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:23,920
if you get through this, you should make
 

2701
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,390
if you get through this, you should make
a new high of day. Get through this, you

2702
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
a new high of day. Get through this, you
 

2703
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:35,669
a new high of day. Get through this, you
should make a new high of day.

2704

still looks good. Now
 

2717
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:01,910

this is the level. This 60 is the level.

Still no close above 60. You keep
getting stuck at 60.

2747
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,510
poked outside of it. I think you will
break outside of IB. It's just whether

2748
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,520
break outside of IB. It's just whether
 

2749
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,590
break outside of IB. It's just whether
they need to do a trap first. You're now

they need to do a trap first. You're now

they need to do a trap first. You're now
trading back at point of control. But

trading back at point of control. But

01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,669
trading back at point of control. But
this top of this gray box is the level,

this top of this gray box is the level,

this top of this gray box is the level,
right? Get through this. I think you get

right? Get through this. I think you get
 

2757
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,830
right? Get through this. I think you get
a swipe up here. If you can get through

2758
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,840
a swipe up here. If you can get through
 

2759
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,189
a swipe up here. If you can get through
this box here, all right, they've got

this box here, all right, they've got

this box here, all right, they've got
stops here. If you get through this, you

stops here. If you get through this, you
 

2763
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:02,709
stops here. If you get through this, you
should see a swipe there. What you don't

2764
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:02,719
should see a swipe there. What you don't
 

2765
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,070
should see a swipe there. What you don't
want to see is a move back under and

2766
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,080
want to see is a move back under and
 

2767
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,430
want to see is a move back under and
then you're opening up all this because

2768
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:05,440
then you're opening up all this because
 

2769
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,590
then you're opening up all this because
you've got a double bottom down here. My

2770
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:07,600
you've got a double bottom down here. My
 

2771
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,630
you've got a double bottom down here. My
bias would now be potential move up into

2772
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:10,640
bias would now be potential move up into
 

2773
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,830
bias would now be potential move up into
here. But they've got to get through

here. But they've got to get through
 

2775
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,990
here. But they've got to get through
this box. If they keep failing 60, it's

2776
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,000
this box. If they keep failing 60, it's
 

2777
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,669
this box. If they keep failing 60, it's
going to be a major problem for the

2778
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:15,679
going to be a major problem for the
 

2779
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:33,750
going to be a major problem for the

You've got divergence here as well with
 

2785
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,350
You've got divergence here as well with
ES and SPY. I think with ES, let me just

2786
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,360
ES and SPY. I think with ES, let me just
 

2787
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,149
ES and SPY. I think with ES, let me just
double check. Yes. So, just be aware of

2788
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:42,159
double check. Yes. So, just be aware of
 

2789
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,590
double check. Yes. So, just be aware of
that as well. You have some divergence

that as well. You have some divergence
 

2791
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,910
that as well. You have some divergence
here. ES and Spy made a new high day. NQ

did not. Nvidia is going to have another
go at going red to green here, folks.

2796
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:51,920
go at going red to green here, folks.
 

2797
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,229
go at going red to green here, folks.
So, this is key. Can Nvidia go red to

2798
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
So, this is key. Can Nvidia go red to
 

2799
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,629
So, this is key. Can Nvidia go red to
green? If the answer is yes,

2800
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639
green? If the answer is yes,
 

2801
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,870
green? If the answer is yes,
then uh video goes green on the day. You

2802
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
then uh video goes green on the day. You
 

2803
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,790
then uh video goes green on the day. You
might see a bit of influx on buying.

2804
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:00,800
might see a bit of influx on buying.
 

2805
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,590
might see a bit of influx on buying.
Very very close now. 0.07% down. It just

2806
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
Very very close now. 0.07% down. It just
 

2807
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,510
Very very close now. 0.07% down. It just
needs like a one one decent push and it

2808
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
needs like a one one decent push and it
 

2809
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,950
needs like a one one decent push and it
will do it. And then you might get your

2810
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
will do it. And then you might get your
 

2811
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,229
will do it. And then you might get your
swipe if you're lucky.

2812
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:12,239

0.05. It's It's trying. It's really
 

2815
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,070
0.05. It's It's trying. It's really
trying here on Nvidia.

2816
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:20,080

2821
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,070
Nvidia. They are they are trying. If
they do it, then you should swipe 60 and

2822
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:26,080
they do it, then you should swipe 60 and
 

2823
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,149
they do it, then you should swipe 60 and
get up to uh top of that red box. This

get up to uh top of that red box. This
 

2825
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:38,550
get up to uh top of that red box. This
red box is the next liquidity for

back beneath the shelf now, which is a

Another higher high on Delta on the 5m
 

2875
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,350
Another higher high on Delta on the 5m
minute. This is looking really

01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
minute. This is looking really
 

2877
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,229
minute. This is looking really
dangerous, guys.

2878
01:24:10,229 --> 01:24:10,239
dangerous, guys.
 

2879
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,070
dangerous, guys.
I think you're going to be open to a big

2880
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:12,080
I think you're going to be open to a big
 

2881
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,229
I think you're going to be open to a big
big wash here. If Nvidia can't go and go

2882
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
big wash here. If Nvidia can't go and go
 

2883
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,990
big wash here. If Nvidia can't go and go
soon, you're open to a very big wash

2884
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
soon, you're open to a very big wash
 

2885
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,830
soon, you're open to a very big wash
out.

2886
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:23,840

 

2887
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,229

You got VIX at lower day, SPY is not

2888
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:26,239
You got VIX at lower day, SPY is not
 

2889
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,750
You got VIX at lower day, SPY is not
breaking out through high of day. You

2890
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:27,760
breaking out through high of day. You
 

2891
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,750
breaking out through high of day. You
can't get over 60 and Nvidia can't get

2892
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:29,760
can't get over 60 and Nvidia can't get
 

2893
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,910
can't get over 60 and Nvidia can't get
through its PDC. Those are the levels.

2894
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:31,920
through its PDC. Those are the levels.
 

2895
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,750
through its PDC. Those are the levels.
As soon as that changes, the market

2896
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,760
As soon as that changes, the market
 

2897
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,430
As soon as that changes, the market
changes sentiment. But that is what's

2898
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:35,440
changes sentiment. But that is what's
 

2899
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,070
changes sentiment. But that is what's
happening at the at the moment. And I

2900
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080
happening at the at the moment. And I
 

2901
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,830
happening at the at the moment. And I
don't like that you've just lost this up

2902
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:39,840
don't like that you've just lost this up
 

2903
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,550
don't like that you've just lost this up
here. You've lost 50. You had the chance

2904
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:42,560
here. You've lost 50. You had the chance
 

2905
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,229
here. You've lost 50. You had the chance
here. You've had one. You've had three

2906
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:44,239
here. You've had one. You've had three
 

2907
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:46,390
here. You've had one. You've had three
goes at it. Obviously, you've had once,

2908
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
goes at it. Obviously, you've had once,
 

2909
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,950
goes at it. Obviously, you've had once,
twice, three times to do this move here

2910
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960
twice, three times to do this move here
 

2911
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,590
twice, three times to do this move here
and it's starting to fail. I wouldn't

2912
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
and it's starting to fail. I wouldn't
 

2913
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,189
and it's starting to fail. I wouldn't
say it's a short yet because you've not

2914
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:53,199
say it's a short yet because you've not
 

2915
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,510
say it's a short yet because you've not
left it, but it's worth noting that you

2916
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:55,520
left it, but it's worth noting that you
 

2917
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,629
left it, but it's worth noting that you
are unable to do this move. That's what

2918
01:24:58,629 --> 01:24:58,639
are unable to do this move. That's what
 

2919
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,110
are unable to do this move. That's what
the market's telling you. Video now

2923
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,510

VIX found a bid at lower day. This is

2924
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:07,520
VIX found a bid at lower day. This is
 

2925
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,189
VIX found a bid at lower day. This is
like so many warning signs in this

2926
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:11,199
like so many warning signs in this
 

2927
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,189
like so many warning signs in this
market right now. You know what's going

market right now. You know what's going
 

2929
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,629
market right now. You know what's going
to happen? It's probably going to do the

2930
01:25:14,629 --> 01:25:14,639
to happen? It's probably going to do the
 

2931
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:28,629
to happen? It's probably going to do the
complete opposite of what it should.

2932
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:28,639

 

2933
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,629

Yeah, you've had divergence with CBD.

2934
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:30,639
Yeah, you've had divergence with CBD.
 

2935
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,550
Yeah, you've had divergence with CBD.
Yeah. If you look at CVD, you made a

2936

Yeah. If you look at CVD, you made a
 

2937
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,030
Yeah. If you look at CVD, you made a
higher high on price on uh on CBD and

2938
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
higher high on price on uh on CBD and
 

2939
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,350
higher high on price on uh on CBD and
not higher high

2940
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
not higher high
 

2941
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,590

on price.
Same with ES. ES made a higher high. ENQ

2944
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:42,320
Same with ES. ES made a higher high. ENQ
 

2945
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,629
Same with ES. ES made a higher high. ENQ
did not. So you got warning signs going

2946
01:25:44,629 --> 01:25:44,639
did not. So you got warning signs going
 

2947
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:45,910
did not. So you got warning signs going
off. You're leaving that shelf now.

01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:50,790
off. You're leaving that shelf now.
Look, you never got back over 60.

2950
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:50,800

 

2951
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,950

So 14s will be the level. And they Well,

2952
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:52,960
So 14s will be the level. And they Well,
 

2953
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,870
So 14s will be the level. And they Well,
actually, they won't now. They've

2954
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:54,880
actually, they won't now. They've
 

2955
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,550
actually, they won't now. They've
shifted it. So I would say it can come

2956
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:56,560
shifted it. So I would say it can come
 

2957
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,950
shifted it. So I would say it can come
all the way down to 786 now and below.

2958
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:00,960
all the way down to 786 now and below.
 

2959
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:08,629
all the way down to 786 now and below.
And that is very, very possible.

2960
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639

 

2961
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,310

And the way we built volume out is not

2962
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:10,320
And the way we built volume out is not
 

2963
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,110
And the way we built volume out is not
very nice.

2964
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:13,120
very nice.
 

2965
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,110
very nice.
Yeah, I'd say yeah, can we can come down

2966
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,120
Yeah, I'd say yeah, can we can come down
 

2967
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,070
Yeah, I'd say yeah, can we can come down
to 770s. If it loses this, we can come

2968
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:18,080
to 770s. If it loses this, we can come
 

2969
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,750
to 770s. If it loses this, we can come
right down because of how we built

2970
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:19,760
right down because of how we built
 

2971
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,149
right down because of how we built
volume.

2972
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:22,159
volume.
 

2973
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,390
volume.
Bit of a vacuum in here. So maybe you

2974
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,400
Bit of a vacuum in here. So maybe you
 

2975
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,629
Bit of a vacuum in here. So maybe you
could argue

2976
01:26:26,629 --> 01:26:26,639
could argue
 

2977
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:34,950
could argue
a little bit higher 780s.

2978
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960

 

2979
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,629

Yeah, it's very It looks very dangerous

2980
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639
Yeah, it's very It looks very dangerous
 

2981
01:26:36,639 --> 01:27:03,830
Yeah, it's very It looks very dangerous
to me. Very very dangerous.

2982
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:03,840

 

2983
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,590

not even getting back into 50s now. Not

2987

Here's your box. You're starting to get

2990
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,080
Here's your box. You're starting to get
 

2991
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,070
Here's your box. You're starting to get
boxed in here. All right. Think about

2992
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:14,080
boxed in here. All right. Think about
 

2993
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,910
boxed in here. All right. Think about
how many buyers are trying and trying

2994
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:15,920
how many buyers are trying and trying
 

2995
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,750
how many buyers are trying and trying
and trying. They need this and they need

2996
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:17,760
and trying. They need this and they need
 

2997
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,310
and trying. They need this and they need
it soon. If you snap this, that is very

2998
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:20,320
it soon. If you snap this, that is very
 

2999
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,470
it soon. If you snap this, that is very
very open.

3000
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,480
very open.
 

3001

very open.
I wouldn't be short yet either, by the

I wouldn't be short yet either, by the
 

3003
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,550
I wouldn't be short yet either, by the
way. For me, you're you're probably, as

3004
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:26,560
way. For me, you're you're probably, as
 

3005
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,149
way. For me, you're you're probably, as
long as you're managing your long from

01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:28,159
long as you're managing your long from
 

3007
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,830
long as you're managing your long from
wherever you took it here, you're okay.

you see it crack, it needs to reclaim it

3012
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280
you see it crack, it needs to reclaim it
 

3013
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,510
you see it crack, it needs to reclaim it
instantly for a trap. Otherwise, that

instantly for a trap. Otherwise, that

instantly for a trap. Otherwise, that
rotation's going to happen because

rotation's going to happen because
 

3017
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,629
rotation's going to happen because
you've just shifted point of control up

you've just shifted point of control up
 

3019

you've just shifted point of control up
here. And everyone's buying this up here

looking for that. And if they don't get

01:27:42,149 --> 01:27:42,159
looking for that. And if they don't get
 

3023
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,870
looking for that. And if they don't get
it, they're going to be in trouble.

Nvidia is moving further and further

Nvidia is moving further and further
away from PDC now. It's failed that

It's not a good look for the market

It's not a good look for the market

It's not a good look for the market

Very careful. If you lose this, you're

Very careful. If you lose this, you're
 

3059

Very careful. If you lose this, you're
very thin. You can swipe all the way

Be very careful. Those of you who were

01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:43,280
Be very careful. Those of you who were
 

3067
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,070
Be very careful. Those of you who were
long, hopefully you've locked in. I'd be

long, hopefully you've locked in. I'd be
 

3069

long, hopefully you've locked in. I'd be
very, very careful about this. Just

01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,000
very, very careful about this. Just
 

3071
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:54,070
very, very careful about this. Just
absolutely dumping right now.

No, there's no one absorbing the book

No, there's no one absorbing the book

No, there's no one absorbing the book

they haven't moved higher. It's the

they haven't moved higher. It's the
 

3081
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:10,229
they haven't moved higher. It's the
other way around at the moment.

I think you're about to see potentially

I think you're about to see potentially

01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:28,790
I think you're about to see potentially
a swipe and dump here

3089
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,390

right into this new edge. They're just

3090
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
right into this new edge. They're just
 

3091
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:36,390
right into this new edge. They're just
building out more volume in it.

3092
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:36,400

 

3093
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,110

Last chance saloon, I'd say these balls.

3094
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:39,120
Last chance saloon, I'd say these balls.

just got that look where if it doesn't
 

3099

just got that look where if it doesn't
hold, it's going to go to VWAP

3100
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:50,159
hold, it's going to go to VWAP
 

3101
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:51,910

instantly.

01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:58,629

I think you're about to lose bid here.

3104

01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,600
Nvidia now half a percent down. That's
 

3107
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,830
Nvidia now half a percent down. That's
your problem. Your number one stock in

3108
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
your problem. Your number one stock in
 

3109
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,510
your problem. Your number one stock in
the world can't get back through. It's

3110
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:05,520
the world can't get back through. It's
 

3111
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,510
the world can't get back through. It's
not just a PDC. It's a massive level for

3112
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:07,520
not just a PDC. It's a massive level for
 

3113
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:11,350
not just a PDC. It's a massive level for
it. They can't get back through it.

3114
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:11,360
it. They can't get back through it.
 

3115
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,430
it. They can't get back through it.
They need that sentiment to change and

3116
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,440
They need that sentiment to change and
 

3117
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,750
They need that sentiment to change and
you're not seeing it. It's relative

3118
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:15,760
you're not seeing it. It's relative
 

3119
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,430
you're not seeing it. It's relative
weakness. This is your last chance to

3120
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:17,440
weakness. This is your last chance to
 

3121
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,510
weakness. This is your last chance to
lose this yellow line for the Bulls.

3122
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:21,520
lose this yellow line for the Bulls.
 

3123
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,870
lose this yellow line for the Bulls.
I'm going to get a refill of my coffee

3124
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:22,880
I'm going to get a refill of my coffee
 

3125
01:30:22,880 --> 01:31:09,110
I'm going to get a refill of my coffee
here.

3126
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:09,120

 

3127
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:17,750

taking a blast.

3128
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760

 

3129
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,669

All right, you've lost yellow line.

3130
01:31:19,669 --> 01:31:19,679
All right, you've lost yellow line.
 

3131
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:21,830
All right, you've lost yellow line.
You're in a problem here, Bulls. If they

3132
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:21,840
You're in a problem here, Bulls. If they
 

3133
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,510
You're in a problem here, Bulls. If they
can't reclaim that yellow line, that's

3134
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:23,520
can't reclaim that yellow line, that's
 

3135
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,950
can't reclaim that yellow line, that's
the shelf that they built out a new

3136
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:24,960
the shelf that they built out a new
 

3137
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,590
the shelf that they built out a new
shelf. So that's sort of 820. They need

3138
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:27,600
shelf. So that's sort of 820. They need
 

3139
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,270
shelf. So that's sort of 820. They need
to reclaim it otherwise it's game over.

3140
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:31,280
to reclaim it otherwise it's game over.
 

3141
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,510
to reclaim it otherwise it's game over.
This is uh these basically lows here.

3142
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:33,520
This is uh these basically lows here.
 

3143
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,310
This is uh these basically lows here.
You're starting to see

3144
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:36,320
You're starting to see
 

3145
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,510
You're starting to see
rejection here. Delta here was higher.

3146
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:39,520
rejection here. Delta here was higher.
 

3147
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,350
rejection here. Delta here was higher.
So you've got passive seller up here

3148
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:41,360
So you've got passive seller up here
 

3149
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,830
So you've got passive seller up here
selling into it. And this is now your

3150
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:43,840
selling into it. And this is now your
 

3151
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,830
selling into it. And this is now your
level. You've broken down under it. If

3152
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:45,840
level. You've broken down under it. If
 

3153
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,430
level. You've broken down under it. If
they keep getting stuck here, this is

3154
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:47,440
they keep getting stuck here, this is
 

3155
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,750
they keep getting stuck here, this is
going to happen. It doesn't look very

3156
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:49,760
going to happen. It doesn't look very
 

3157
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,470
going to happen. It doesn't look very
good. It does not look good for you

3158
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:52,480
good. It does not look good for you
 

3159
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:56,470
good. It does not look good for you
bulls. Now tone has shifted in the last

3160
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:56,480
bulls. Now tone has shifted in the last
 

3161
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,870
bulls. Now tone has shifted in the last
few minutes. So if you can't reclaim,

3162
01:31:58,870 --> 01:31:58,880
few minutes. So if you can't reclaim,
 

3163
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,229
few minutes. So if you can't reclaim,
you probably should already be out

3164
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:00,239
you probably should already be out
 

3165
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,750
you probably should already be out
unless you're managing a position from

3166
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
unless you're managing a position from
 

3167
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,350
unless you're managing a position from
down here or something. But and even

3168
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:03,360
down here or something. But and even
 

3169
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,550
down here or something. But and even
then you should have taken a lot of

3170
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:04,560
then you should have taken a lot of
 

3171
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,830
then you should have taken a lot of
profit. But you are very susceptible to

3172
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:07,840
profit. But you are very susceptible to
 

3173
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,910
profit. But you are very susceptible to
a wash back that back to VW up.

3174
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:11,920
a wash back that back to VW up.
 

3175
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,669
a wash back that back to VW up.
And it can happen fast because we're

3176
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
And it can happen fast because we're
 

3177
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,310
And it can happen fast because we're
thin. We are very thin here. Look at

3178
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
thin. We are very thin here. Look at
 

3179
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:28,709
thin. We are very thin here. Look at
this. This can happen in one swipe.

3180
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:28,719

 

3181
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,950

There you go. So, here comes the swipe.

3182
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:30,960
There you go. So, here comes the swipe.
 

3183
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,510
There you go. So, here comes the swipe.
Good night, market. Back down to B and

Good night, market. Back down to B and

now. See if they trap here and then
 

3187
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:40,149
now. See if they trap here and then
reabsorb.

3188
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:40,159

 

3189
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:44,149

Can we go lower? I mean,

3190
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
Can we go lower? I mean,
 

3191

Can we go lower? I mean,
I'm going to just say something, guys.

3192
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:46,159
I'm going to just say something, guys.

do you not listen to yourselves and
think, "What a weird question.

3198
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:52,480
think, "What a weird question.
 

3199
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:57,110
think, "What a weird question.
Can we go lower? Can we go higher?"

3200
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
Can we go lower? Can we go higher?"
 

3201
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,790
Can we go lower? Can we go higher?"

3205
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:03,030

whatever it wants. It's a weird thing to

3206
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:03,040
whatever it wants. It's a weird thing to
 

3207
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,669

3217
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:23,110

weird when people say that.

3218
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:23,120

 

3219
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,430

Can we go lower?

3220
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:25,440
Can we go lower?
 

3221
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,350
Can we go lower?
Yeah. Can we go higher? Yeah. Can we go

Yeah. Can we go higher? Yeah. Can we go
nowhere? Yeah.

3224
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:32,080
nowhere? Yeah.
 

3225
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,470
nowhere? Yeah.
Of course.

3226
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
Of course.
 

3227
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:41,430
Of course.
Of course.

3228
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:41,440

 

3229
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,350

Okay. So, we just did that wash back

3230
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:43,360
Okay. So, we just did that wash back
 

3231
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,870
Okay. So, we just did that wash back
into it. Well, towards this gray box.

3232
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:44,880
into it. Well, towards this gray box.
 

3233
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,310
into it. Well, towards this gray box.
Didn't quite make it yet. So, these are

3234
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:46,320
Didn't quite make it yet. So, these are
 

3235
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,709
Didn't quite make it yet. So, these are
your levels now. Trade between these.

3236
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:48,719
your levels now. Trade between these.
 

3237
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:51,110
your levels now. Trade between these.
Reclaim this. Bullish. Fail. This rot

3238
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,120
Reclaim this. Bullish. Fail. This rot
 

3239
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,910
Reclaim this. Bullish. Fail. This rot
rotation to this next box.

3240
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:53,920
rotation to this next box.
 

3241
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,430
rotation to this next box.
It's so weird, man. Like, it's so weird.

3242
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:57,440
It's so weird, man. Like, it's so weird.
 

3243
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,350
It's so weird, man. Like, it's so weird.
I'm going to just adjust this red box

3244
01:33:59,350 --> 01:33:59,360
I'm going to just adjust this red box
 

3245
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,790
I'm going to just adjust this red box
because it's looking a bit [\h__\h] now. So,

3246
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:02,800
because it's looking a bit [\h__\h] now. So,
 

3247
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:19,669
because it's looking a bit [\h__\h] now. So,
let's just change this

3248
01:34:19,669 --> 01:34:19,679

 

3249
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:33,430

No.

3250
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:33,440

 

3251
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,590

What do you want me to say on ES? Can

3252
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:35,600
What do you want me to say on ES? Can
 

3253
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,110
What do you want me to say on ES? Can
you guys not identify these? I think

3254
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,120
you guys not identify these? I think
 

3255
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:42,550
you guys not identify these? I think
they're fairly obvious.

3256
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,560

 

3257
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,750

There you go. There are your levels.

3258
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:45,760
There you go. There are your levels.
 

3259
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,510
There you go. There are your levels.
There's your gap which is standing out

3260
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:47,520
There's your gap which is standing out
 

3261
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,189
There's your gap which is standing out

happening. and just go, "Yeah, [\h__\h] it.

01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,709
need. Yeah, I'm bidding against every
flush. Right. And at some point, you're

3308
01:36:08,709 --> 01:36:08,719
flush. Right. And at some point, you're
 

3309
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:09,590
flush. Right. And at some point, you're
going to do that. It's going to go,

3310
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:09,600
going to do that. It's going to go,

going to do that. It's going to go,
"Fuck you." And take you out. And that's

01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
"Fuck you." And take you out. And that's
 

3313
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,950
"Fuck you." And take you out. And that's
the that's the problem. You can pretty

3314
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
the that's the problem. You can pretty
 

3315
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,709
the that's the problem. You can pretty
much throw technicals out the window on

3316
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:16,719
much throw technicals out the window on
 

3317
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:41,669
much throw technicals out the window on
the flushes at the moment.

01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:44,159
I think that's wise Troy. I think that I
 

3321
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,149
I think that's wise Troy. I think that I
think what you've just said is wise.

think what you've just said is wise.
Like you took the short from the

3324
01:36:48,229 --> 01:36:48,239
Like you took the short from the
 

3325
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,390
Like you took the short from the
breakdown of volume to VWAP. Didn't even

3326
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,400
breakdown of volume to VWAP. Didn't even
 

3327
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,629
breakdown of volume to VWAP. Didn't even
we didn't even make VWAP, you know,

which is stupid in itself. And you've
 

3331
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,669
which is stupid in itself. And you've
covered. I think that's the right thing

3332
01:36:57,669 --> 01:36:57,679
covered. I think that's the right thing
 

3333
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,510
covered. I think that's the right thing
to do. Yeah. Can we go high from here?

like I just said to my wife next door,
I'm going to stay flat in my swing

I'm going to stay flat in my swing
 

3391
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,510
I'm going to stay flat in my swing

actively trade until we get to January
 

3395

because my feeling is if they're
 

3397
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:27,750
because my feeling is if they're
actually going to be as dumb as to do

3398
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:27,760
actually going to be as dumb as to do
 

3399
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,229
actually going to be as dumb as to do
this, retail's going to come flying in

01:38:36,149 --> 01:38:36,159
you why I'm saying that. Because it
 

3407
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,550
you why I'm saying that. Because it
happens every [\h__\h] time they're

01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:38,560
happens every [\h__\h] time they're
 

3409
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,310
happens every [\h__\h] time they're
stupid enough to do this move to get

01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:40,320
stupid enough to do this move to get

01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,790
stupid enough to do this move to get
their Christmas bonuses. If they do the

3412
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:42,800
their Christmas bonuses. If they do the
 

3413
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,310
their Christmas bonuses. If they do the
move

3414
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:44,320
move
 

3415
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,830
move
in December, we get the move back from

3416
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:47,840
in December, we get the move back from
 

3417
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:53,510
in December, we get the move back from
January to March. If they do the move

3418
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:53,520

 

3419
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,030

in December, we get the move back

3420
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,040
in December, we get the move back
 

3421
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,590
in December, we get the move back
January to March. If they do the move,

3422
01:38:59,590 --> 01:38:59,600
January to March. If they do the move,
 

3423
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:06,870
January to March. If they do the move,
where's December?

3424
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:06,880

 

3425
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,390

There we go. They do the move in

3426
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:10,400
There we go. They do the move in
 

3427
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,629
There we go. They do the move in
December. We get the move back. January

3428
01:39:12,629 --> 01:39:12,639
December. We get the move back. January
 

3429
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,709
December. We get the move back. January
and March. It's the same thing every

3430
01:39:14,709 --> 01:39:14,719
and March. It's the same thing every
 

3431
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,709
and March. It's the same thing every
year that they do it. If they do it at

3432
01:39:16,709 --> 01:39:16,719
year that they do it. If they do it at
 

3433
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:19,189
year that they do it. If they do it at
Christmas, here you go.

3434
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:19,199
Christmas, here you go.
 

3435
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:22,310
Christmas, here you go.
December, January, March. All right. So,

3436
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:22,320
December, January, March. All right. So,
 

3437
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,430
December, January, March. All right. So,
I'm very aware of this. This is if they

3438
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:25,440
I'm very aware of this. This is if they
 

3439
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,990
I'm very aware of this. This is if they
do a Santa Claus rally in December, they

3440
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:28,000
do a Santa Claus rally in December, they
 

3441
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,669
do a Santa Claus rally in December, they
always always give it back. All right.

3442
01:39:31,669 --> 01:39:31,679
always always give it back. All right.
 

3443
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,910
always always give it back. All right.
If we don't, then I'm more open to

3444
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
If we don't, then I'm more open to
 

3445
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,910
If we don't, then I'm more open to
January and March having a better push

3446
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:37,920
January and March having a better push
 

3447
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,910
January and March having a better push
push back up for a continuation. But if

3448
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:39,920
push back up for a continuation. But if
 

3449
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,590
push back up for a continuation. But if
they're going to be stupid and this is

3450
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:41,600
they're going to be stupid and this is
 

3451
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,990
they're going to be stupid and this is
all about, hey, where is my Christmas

3452
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,000
all about, hey, where is my Christmas
 

3453
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,270
all about, hey, where is my Christmas
bonus? I need to get paid. I'm [\h__\h] it.

3454
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:47,280
bonus? I need to get paid. I'm [\h__\h] it.
 

3455
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,030
bonus? I need to get paid. I'm [\h__\h] it.
They can get paid by themselves. I'm not

3456
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,040
They can get paid by themselves. I'm not
 

3457
01:39:49,040 --> 01:40:02,709
They can get paid by themselves. I'm not
going to bugger around with them.

3458
01:40:02,709 --> 01:40:02,719

 

3459
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:15,270

Oh my gosh, look at this.

3460
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,280

 

3461
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,910

Yes, is stronger. Yeah. Well, why why

3462
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:17,920
Yes, is stronger. Yeah. Well, why why
 

3463
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:22,229
Yes, is stronger. Yeah. Well, why why

3464
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
isn't that breadth, isn't it?
 

3465
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:43,510
isn't that breadth, isn't it?
Brethren in the market.

3466
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:43,520

 

3467
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:47,189

market's too thin for me to have uh

3468
01:40:47,189 --> 01:40:47,199
market's too thin for me to have uh
 

3469

Where's the structure?

Where's the structure?
 

3479
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:03,830
Where's the structure?
Like, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck.

I said if if we if we lose this, it's

3482
01:41:06,229 --> 01:41:06,239
I said if if we if we lose this, it's
 

3483
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:07,750
I said if if we if we lose this, it's
going to flush. Boom. All the way back

3484
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:07,760
going to flush. Boom. All the way back
 

3485
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,750

01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:11,199
What how are you going to bid off this?
 

3489
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,270
What how are you going to bid off this?
Who's got the bollocks to bid off this?

3490
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:13,280
Who's got the bollocks to bid off this?
 

3491
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,950
Who's got the bollocks to bid off this?
Probably only hedge funds. All right. At

3492
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:14,960
Probably only hedge funds. All right. At
 

3493
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,790
Probably only hedge funds. All right. At
some point that stops working. This is

01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:16,800
some point that stops working. This is
 

3495
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,790
some point that stops working. This is
the problem with the market. We're on a

01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,990
these guys do whatever the hell it is
that they want to do.

01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,000
that they want to do.
 

3505
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,830
that they want to do.
It's just uh weird.

3506
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:33,840
It's just uh weird.
 

3507
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:37,030
It's just uh weird.
a weird market right now. It's it's

3508
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:37,040
a weird market right now. It's it's
 

3509
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,709
a weird market right now. It's it's
beyond

3510
01:41:38,709 --> 01:41:38,719
beyond
 

3511
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:42,390
beyond
what I would call normal.

3512
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400
what I would call normal.
 

3513
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,229
what I would call normal.
There's a lack of volume. There's a lack

3514
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:44,239
There's a lack of volume. There's a lack
 

3515
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:46,629
There's a lack of volume. There's a lack
of structure. It is all about the trap

3516
01:41:46,629 --> 01:41:46,639
of structure. It is all about the trap
 

3517
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:58,950
of structure. It is all about the trap
and not about anything else.

3518
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:58,960

 

3519
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,870

Yeah, I know. Adam. Well,

3520
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:02,880
Yeah, I know. Adam. Well,
 

3521
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,550
Yeah, I know. Adam. Well,
I just look at that and go like, what

3522
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:04,560
I just look at that and go like, what
 

3523
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,149
I just look at that and go like, what
what do you want me to do with it?

3524
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:06,159
what do you want me to do with it?
 

3525
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,390
what do you want me to do with it?
There's just too many there's too many

3526
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:08,400
There's just too many there's too many
 

3527
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,470
There's just too many there's too many
fighting things right now, right? Like

3528
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:10,480
fighting things right now, right? Like
 

3529
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,430
fighting things right now, right? Like
the hourly's broken out. So, you know,

3530
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:13,440
the hourly's broken out. So, you know,
 

3531
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,750
the hourly's broken out. So, you know,
if we pull back and hold a base here,

3532
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:15,760
if we pull back and hold a base here,
 

3533
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,189
if we pull back and hold a base here,
technically it's still bullish, isn't

3534
01:42:17,189 --> 01:42:17,199
technically it's still bullish, isn't
 

3535
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,990
technically it's still bullish, isn't
it? Right. It's a breakout and retest,

3536
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:20,000
it? Right. It's a breakout and retest,
 

3537
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,470
it? Right. It's a breakout and retest,
but like I'm not bidding on that after

3538
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:22,480
but like I'm not bidding on that after
 

3539
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,470
but like I'm not bidding on that after
seeing that up there. And this is what I

3540
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:24,480
seeing that up there. And this is what I
 

3541
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,350
seeing that up there. And this is what I
mean. We're just not seeing alignment.

3542
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:27,360
mean. We're just not seeing alignment.
 

3543
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,510
mean. We're just not seeing alignment.
There's no alignment in this market.

3544
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:29,520
There's no alignment in this market.
 

3545
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,310
There's no alignment in this market.
Look at this. Every breakout sold, sold,

3546
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:32,320
Look at this. Every breakout sold, sold,
 

3547
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,270
Look at this. Every breakout sold, sold,
sold, sold, sold. But bears then come

3548
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
sold, sold, sold. But bears then come
 

3549
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,189
sold, sold, sold. But bears then come
in. Do we see a breakdown under a key

3550
01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:37,199
in. Do we see a breakdown under a key
 

3551
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,430
in. Do we see a breakdown under a key
level? No. We've never seen it. Every

3552
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:39,440
level? No. We've never seen it. Every
 

3553
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,870
level? No. We've never seen it. Every
opportunity they've had, we've never

3554
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:40,880
opportunity they've had, we've never
 

3555
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,270
opportunity they've had, we've never
seen it. Maybe next week they do that.

3556
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:43,280
seen it. Maybe next week they do that.
 

3557
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,030
seen it. Maybe next week they do that.
But I doubt it because at the moment,

3558
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:45,040
But I doubt it because at the moment,
 

3559
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,510
But I doubt it because at the moment,
all this market's saying to me is every

3560
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:47,520
all this market's saying to me is every
 

3561
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,229
all this market's saying to me is every
pullback is a bear trap to go higher.

3562
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:50,239
pullback is a bear trap to go higher.
 

3563
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:51,830
pullback is a bear trap to go higher.
This is probably the same. It's probably

3564
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:51,840
This is probably the same. It's probably
 

3565
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,070
This is probably the same. It's probably
the same thing. They don't have

3566
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,080
the same thing. They don't have
 

3567
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,109
the same thing. They don't have
intentions on taking this lower um as in

3568
01:42:57,109 --> 01:42:57,119
intentions on taking this lower um as in
 

3569
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:58,550
intentions on taking this lower um as in
like higher time frame lower at the

3570
01:42:58,550 --> 01:42:58,560
like higher time frame lower at the
 

3571
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,390
like higher time frame lower at the
moment. But you can see they left this

3572
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:00,400
moment. But you can see they left this
 

3573
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:01,910
moment. But you can see they left this
volume. You couldn't get through 60. I

3574
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:01,920
volume. You couldn't get through 60. I
 

3575
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,310
volume. You couldn't get through 60. I
kept telling you divergence up there. If

3576
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:04,320
kept telling you divergence up there. If
 

3577
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,830
kept telling you divergence up there. If
you crack this, there's a move back down

3578
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:05,840
you crack this, there's a move back down
 

3579
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,270
you crack this, there's a move back down
into this block here. You're losing this

3580
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:07,280
into this block here. You're losing this
 

3581
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,390
into this block here. You're losing this
block here. We're going to move all the

3582
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:08,400
block here. We're going to move all the
 

3583
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,990
block here. We're going to move all the
way down into this RBS, which is a

3584
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:10,000
way down into this RBS, which is a
 

3585
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,229
way down into this RBS, which is a
higher time frame RBS zone. Now, if you

3586
01:43:12,229 --> 01:43:12,239
higher time frame RBS zone. Now, if you
 

3587
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:14,149
higher time frame RBS zone. Now, if you
lose that and we go under New York open,

3588
01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:14,159
lose that and we go under New York open,
 

3589
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:16,070
lose that and we go under New York open,
we're going to go guess where back into

3590
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:16,080
we're going to go guess where back into
 

3591
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,830
we're going to go guess where back into
previous days value. All this is telling

3592
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:17,840
previous days value. All this is telling
 

3593
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,229
previous days value. All this is telling
me is we're rejecting outside of value

3594
01:43:20,229 --> 01:43:20,239
me is we're rejecting outside of value
 

3595
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:32,950
me is we're rejecting outside of value
again.

3596
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:32,960

 

3597
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:41,030

Are you joking? Lines, mate.

3598
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:41,040

 

3599
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,550

students. It would make you like push
 

3665
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,790

All right. Is that consistency enough?
 

3671
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,149

going. Do we get the point? I think

3678
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:45,920
going. Do we get the point? I think
 

3679
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:53,109
going. Do we get the point? I think
there's consistency there.

3680

01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:19,440
the time because I like it's not going
 

3691
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,229
the time because I like it's not going
to help your trading, but I get it. You

a a break even. I'd rather talk about
 

3711
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,430
a a break even. I'd rather talk about
those trades in managing risk than, you

3712
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:45,440
those trades in managing risk than, you
 

3713

those trades in managing risk than, you
know, winning days.

3728
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:17,920
up in the UK. Okay, you're starting to
 

3729
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,070
up in the UK. Okay, you're starting to
see a bid on this RBS. Remember, this is

3730
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,080
see a bid on this RBS. Remember, this is
 

3731
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,470
see a bid on this RBS. Remember, this is
what we just talked about.

3732
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:22,480
what we just talked about.
 

3733
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,669
what we just talked about.
This can be like a hold of the hourly.

3734
01:47:25,669 --> 01:47:25,679
This can be like a hold of the hourly.
 

3735
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:27,189
This can be like a hold of the hourly.
This is the problem right now, folks.

3736
01:47:27,189 --> 01:47:27,199
This is the problem right now, folks.
 

3737
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:29,590
This is the problem right now, folks.
So, everyone's come flying in short

3738
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:29,600
So, everyone's come flying in short
 

3739
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,390
So, everyone's come flying in short
because you've seen this here, but this

3740
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:32,400
because you've seen this here, but this
 

3741
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,070
because you've seen this here, but this
can still hold. And this is what we've

3742
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:34,080
can still hold. And this is what we've
 

3743
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,510
can still hold. And this is what we've
done time and time again. This is why

3744
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
done time and time again. This is why
 

3745
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,310
done time and time again. This is why
I'm like on a Friday, do I really want

3746
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:38,320
I'm like on a Friday, do I really want
 

3747
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,910
I'm like on a Friday, do I really want
to play these levels, right? This is

3748
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:39,920
to play these levels, right? This is
 

3749
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,189
to play these levels, right? This is
technically resistance now because

3750
01:47:41,189 --> 01:47:41,199
technically resistance now because
 

3751
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:44,149
technically resistance now because
you're under it. Okay, right here. This

3752
01:47:44,149 --> 01:47:44,159
you're under it. Okay, right here. This
 

3753
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,830
you're under it. Okay, right here. This
is the problem. Your alignment is an

3754
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:45,840
is the problem. Your alignment is an
 

3755
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,990
is the problem. Your alignment is an
issue. Right? If they trade back through

3756
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:48,000
issue. Right? If they trade back through
 

3757
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,470
issue. Right? If they trade back through
this, remember how thin we are here?

3758
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:50,480
this, remember how thin we are here?
 

3759
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,310
this, remember how thin we are here?
Thin we are here. If we trade back

3760
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:52,320
Thin we are here. If we trade back
 

3761
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,590
Thin we are here. If we trade back
through this, guess where we're going to

3762
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:53,600
through this, guess where we're going to
 

3763
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,629
through this, guess where we're going to
go? Right back to this line again. And

3764
01:47:56,629 --> 01:47:56,639
go? Right back to this line again. And
 

3765
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:59,030
go? Right back to this line again. And
then it's going to be like, hey bears,

3766
01:47:59,030 --> 01:47:59,040
then it's going to be like, hey bears,
 

3767
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,310
then it's going to be like, hey bears,
do you remember what we talked about?

3768
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:00,320
do you remember what we talked about?
 

3769
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,750
do you remember what we talked about?
The bulls that are winning are the ones

3770
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:01,760
The bulls that are winning are the ones
 

3771
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,510
The bulls that are winning are the ones
with massive bollocks right now who are

3772
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:03,520
with massive bollocks right now who are
 

3773
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,189
with massive bollocks right now who are
willing to bid on this. That's not me.

3774
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:05,199
willing to bid on this. That's not me.
 

3775
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,430
willing to bid on this. That's not me.
My balls aren't big enough to do that

3776
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:07,440
My balls aren't big enough to do that
 

3777
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,149
My balls aren't big enough to do that
against momentum. But if we come back up

3778
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:10,159
against momentum. But if we come back up
 

3779
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:11,910
against momentum. But if we come back up
here, you got to ask, are the bears

3780
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:11,920
here, you got to ask, are the bears
 

3781
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,990
here, you got to ask, are the bears
going to defend this level? Cuz if the

3782
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:14,000
going to defend this level? Cuz if the
 

3783
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,750
going to defend this level? Cuz if the
answer is no, we're going to make a new

3784
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:15,760
answer is no, we're going to make a new
 

3785
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,830
answer is no, we're going to make a new
high. So bears have two levels here to

3786
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:17,840
high. So bears have two levels here to
 

3787
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,310
high. So bears have two levels here to
defend. This red block here

3788
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:20,320
defend. This red block here
 

3789
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,709
defend. This red block here
and put this in for you so you can see

3790
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:22,719
and put this in for you so you can see
 

3791
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:24,950
and put this in for you so you can see
it. And this block here, right? That's

3792
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:24,960
it. And this block here, right? That's
 

3793
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,430
it. And this block here, right? That's
where they need to defend. But this is a

3794
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,440
where they need to defend. But this is a
 

3795
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,430
where they need to defend. But this is a
higher time frame RBS. And that's the

3796
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:29,440
higher time frame RBS. And that's the
 

3797
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,629
higher time frame RBS. And that's the
problem that you've got in the market.

3798
01:48:30,629 --> 01:48:30,639
problem that you've got in the market.
 

3799
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:32,629
problem that you've got in the market.
Now, if we trade under this, I will tell

3800
01:48:32,629 --> 01:48:32,639
Now, if we trade under this, I will tell
 

3801
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:35,990
Now, if we trade under this, I will tell
you now, if we trade under this, we

01:48:35,990 --> 01:48:36,000
you now, if we trade under this, we
 

3803
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,990
you now, if we trade under this, we
build liquidity here and we fail, we're

3804
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:38,000
build liquidity here and we fail, we're
 

3805
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,430
build liquidity here and we fail, we're
going to come back for previous days

3806
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:39,440
going to come back for previous days
 

3807
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,270
going to come back for previous days
value. These must be cover points. If we

3808
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:41,280
value. These must be cover points. If we
 

3809
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,109
value. These must be cover points. If we
trade under value, maybe we come back

3810
01:48:43,109 --> 01:48:43,119
trade under value, maybe we come back
 

3811
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:44,470
trade under value, maybe we come back
here. Do I still think we have

3812
01:48:44,470 --> 01:48:44,480
here. Do I still think we have
 

3813
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,149
here. Do I still think we have
unfinished business lower? Yeah, I think

3814
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:46,159
unfinished business lower? Yeah, I think
 

3815
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:48,470
unfinished business lower? Yeah, I think
we've got unfinished business at Where's

3816
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:48,480
we've got unfinished business at Where's
 

3817
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,669
we've got unfinished business at Where's
that low?

3818
01:48:51,669 --> 01:48:51,679
that low?
 

3819
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:53,590
that low?
Where's that awful low that we've left

3820
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:53,600
Where's that awful low that we've left
 

3821
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,590
Where's that awful low that we've left
three times now? Where are you?

3822
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:57,600
three times now? Where are you?
 

3823
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,750
three times now? Where are you?
It's here, isn't it? Is it this one?

3824
01:48:59,750 --> 01:48:59,760
It's here, isn't it? Is it this one?
 

3825
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:03,270
It's here, isn't it? Is it this one?
200s. What do we No, it's here. Sorry.

3826
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:03,280
200s. What do we No, it's here. Sorry.
 

3827
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:06,310
200s. What do we No, it's here. Sorry.
420s. I don't think we do that today.

3828
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:06,320
420s. I don't think we do that today.
 

3829
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,430
420s. I don't think we do that today.
But my sentiment will shift if we start

3830
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:09,440
But my sentiment will shift if we start
 

3831
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,990
But my sentiment will shift if we start
taking that out and staying heavy. Then

3832
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:12,000
taking that out and staying heavy. Then
 

3833
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,910
taking that out and staying heavy. Then
I think we get a rotation into the old

3834
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:13,920
I think we get a rotation into the old
 

3835
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,669
I think we get a rotation into the old
week's range. I don't think you see that

3836
01:49:15,669 --> 01:49:15,679
week's range. I don't think you see that
 

3837
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:18,149
week's range. I don't think you see that
today. We're on a Friday. But for the

3838
01:49:18,149 --> 01:49:18,159
today. We're on a Friday. But for the
 

3839
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:20,229
today. We're on a Friday. But for the
future weeks ahead, that's going to be

3840
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:20,239
future weeks ahead, that's going to be
 

3841
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:22,310
future weeks ahead, that's going to be
the sentiment shift to bearish. But

3842
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:22,320
the sentiment shift to bearish. But
 

3843
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:36,229
the sentiment shift to bearish. But
we'll talk about that in the newsletter.

3844
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:36,239

3951
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,109
back inside the opening 15 minutes. And
this is now going to flip. If we're here

this is now going to flip. If we're here
much longer, we're going to flip this uh

3954
01:52:06,790 --> 01:52:06,800
much longer, we're going to flip this uh
 

3955

much longer, we're going to flip this uh
point of control down here.

is is anchored volume profile. I think

4006
01:54:41,430 --> 01:54:41,440
is is anchored volume profile. I think
 

4007
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,030
is is anchored volume profile. I think
as long as you've got a pro account and

4008
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:43,040
as long as you've got a pro account and

4015
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,790
or paying for it, I think if you pay for
it, it's like eight bucks a month on

01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:13,350
of a gap fill above.
Where is that line?

4028
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:13,360
Where is that line?
 

4029
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:16,790
Where is that line?
1590 to 16. 1590. Big big level on VIX.

4030
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:16,800
1590 to 16. 1590. Big big level on VIX.
 

4031
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,070
1590 to 16. 1590. Big big level on VIX.
All right. So, that's kind of the base

4032
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:20,080
All right. So, that's kind of the base
 

4033
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:23,270
All right. So, that's kind of the base
that we based out on. Vixed and we lost

4034
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:23,280
that we based out on. Vixed and we lost
 

4035
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:26,470
that we based out on. Vixed and we lost
uh overnight. We've peaked back above

4036
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:26,480
uh overnight. We've peaked back above
 

4037
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,750
uh overnight. We've peaked back above
it. We've come back under it. We're

4038
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:27,760
it. We've come back under it. We're
 

4039
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:36,870
it. We've come back under it. We're
trading back into it again.

4040
01:55:36,870 --> 01:55:36,880

 

4041
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,990

[\h__\h] is going on here with my hours?

4042
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:40,000
[\h__\h] is going on here with my hours?
 

4043
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,950
[\h__\h] is going on here with my hours?
What? What? What?

4044
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:44,960

 

4045
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:52,229

There we go.

4046
01:55:52,229 --> 01:55:52,239

 

4047
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:54,390

Where's the spiders?

4048
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:54,400
Where's the spiders?
 

4049
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,950
Where's the spiders?
May very well come and check that uh 685

4050
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:56,960
May very well come and check that uh 685
 

4051
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,350
May very well come and check that uh 685
again on spy.

4052
01:55:59,350 --> 01:55:59,360
again on spy.
 

4053
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,030
again on spy.
May very well come and check that again

4054
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,040
May very well come and check that again
 

4055
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:16,310
May very well come and check that again
at gamma level.

4056
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:16,320

 

4057
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,470

Yours is showing profit after the trade

4058
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
Yours is showing profit after the trade
 

4059
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,390
Yours is showing profit after the trade
on the account.

4060
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:20,400
on the account.
 

4061
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,870
on the account.
Henrik, do you mean when you're logged?

4062
01:56:22,870 --> 01:56:22,880
Henrik, do you mean when you're logged?
 

4063
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:27,669
Henrik, do you mean when you're logged?
Do you mean on the back end of uh

4064
01:56:27,669 --> 01:56:27,679
Do you mean on the back end of uh
 

4065
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:29,270
Do you mean on the back end of uh
of the website? Is that what you're

4066
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:29,280
of the website? Is that what you're
 

4067
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:32,070
of the website? Is that what you're
talking about? Would I take a long here?

4068
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:32,080
talking about? Would I take a long here?
 

4069
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,669
talking about? Would I take a long here?
No.

4070
01:56:33,669 --> 01:56:33,679
No.
 

4071
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:35,270
No.
No. This this is what I'm saying is the

4072
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:35,280
No. This this is what I'm saying is the
 

4073
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,510
No. This this is what I'm saying is the
problem with the market. Momentum

4074
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:37,520
problem with the market. Momentum
 

4075
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,189
problem with the market. Momentum
shifted, right? We're in strong sell

4076
01:56:39,189 --> 01:56:39,199
shifted, right? We're in strong sell
 

4077
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:40,790
shifted, right? We're in strong sell
momentum. Is it a possible good

4078
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:40,800
momentum. Is it a possible good
 

4079
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,750
momentum. Is it a possible good
location? Location's possibly good. It's

4080
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:43,760
location? Location's possibly good. It's
 

4081
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:46,870
location? Location's possibly good. It's
possibly good, but your momentum isn't.

4082
01:56:46,870 --> 01:56:46,880
possibly good, but your momentum isn't.
 

4083
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,709
possibly good, but your momentum isn't.
And this is how the market's operating.

4084
01:56:48,709 --> 01:56:48,719
And this is how the market's operating.
 

4085
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:49,990
And this is how the market's operating.
This is what they've been doing. So

4086
01:56:49,990 --> 01:56:50,000
This is what they've been doing. So
 

4087
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,750
This is what they've been doing. So
really, until you see this, I wouldn't

4088
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:53,760
really, until you see this, I wouldn't
 

4089
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,109
really, until you see this, I wouldn't
think about getting long. And even then,

4090
01:56:55,109 --> 01:56:55,119
think about getting long. And even then,
 

4091
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:56,709
think about getting long. And even then,
it's going to be really tricky with how

4092
01:56:56,709 --> 01:56:56,719
it's going to be really tricky with how
 

4093
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:58,229
it's going to be really tricky with how
they built this out. There's a reason

4094
01:56:58,229 --> 01:56:58,239
they built this out. There's a reason
 

4095
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,669
they built this out. There's a reason
they're building it out like this. It's

4096
01:56:59,669 --> 01:56:59,679
they're building it out like this. It's
 

4097
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:02,310
they're building it out like this. It's
to make it really hard. Like, you know,

4098
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:02,320
to make it really hard. Like, you know,
 

4099
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,990
to make it really hard. Like, you know,
is the location better? Yeah, it's an

4100
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:04,000
is the location better? Yeah, it's an
 

4101
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,709
is the location better? Yeah, it's an
RBS zone, but are you making have you

4102
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:06,719
RBS zone, but are you making have you
 

4103
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,270
RBS zone, but are you making have you
shifted in any way at all? Has sentiment

4104
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:09,280
shifted in any way at all? Has sentiment
 

4105
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:15,189
shifted in any way at all? Has sentiment
changed? No.

4106
01:57:15,189 --> 01:57:15,199

 

4107
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:17,430

This can still dive deeper if it wants

4108
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:17,440
This can still dive deeper if it wants
 

4109
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,830
This can still dive deeper if it wants
until you get a shift.

4110
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:19,840
until you get a shift.
 

4111
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:26,229
until you get a shift.
Delta is sort of flattened out.

4112
01:57:26,229 --> 01:57:26,239

 

4113
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:28,229

There's still someone trying to bid down

4114
01:57:28,229 --> 01:57:28,239
There's still someone trying to bid down
 

4115
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:31,350
There's still someone trying to bid down
at 700. So with size as well. So let's

4116
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:31,360
at 700. So with size as well. So let's
 

4117
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:41,830
at 700. So with size as well. So let's
see.

4118
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:41,840

 

4119
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,109

There was one today, but I didn't see

4120
01:57:43,109 --> 01:57:43,119
There was one today, but I didn't see
 

4121
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:44,790
There was one today, but I didn't see
anything affected by it. Oh, that's the

4122
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:44,800
anything affected by it. Oh, that's the
 

4123
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,390
anything affected by it. Oh, that's the
cloud player thing. Yeah, I didn't I

4124
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:46,400
cloud player thing. Yeah, I didn't I
 

4125
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,510
cloud player thing. Yeah, I didn't I
didn't even know there was one. I just

4126
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520
didn't even know there was one. I just
 

4127
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,790
didn't even know there was one. I just
see the news come out on it.

4128
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:50,800
see the news come out on it.
 

4129
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,149
see the news come out on it.
Volume is trash. Yeah, volume's been

4130
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:52,159
Volume is trash. Yeah, volume's been
 

4131
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:54,950
Volume is trash. Yeah, volume's been
trash for two weeks.

4132
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:54,960
trash for two weeks.
 

4133
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,790
trash for two weeks.
It's been trash for two weeks. I I

4134
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:56,800
It's been trash for two weeks. I I
 

4135
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:01,589
It's been trash for two weeks. I I
agree.

4136
01:58:01,589 --> 01:58:01,599

 

4137
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:08,390

Crazy

4138
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:08,400

 

4139
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:12,229

jump on gold. Is it we seeing rotation

4140
01:58:12,229 --> 01:58:12,239
jump on gold. Is it we seeing rotation
 

4141
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:15,030
jump on gold. Is it we seeing rotation
out the market again?

4142
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:15,040
out the market again?
 

4143
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:22,390
out the market again?
Yep. BTC probably seeing the same. Yep.

4144
01:58:22,390 --> 01:58:22,400

 

4145
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,830

Honestly, I just keep saying it's just

4146
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:23,840
Honestly, I just keep saying it's just
 

4147
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,510
Honestly, I just keep saying it's just
it's a dealer's market at the moment.

4148
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:25,520
it's a dealer's market at the moment.
 

4149
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,109
it's a dealer's market at the moment.
They're just going edge to edge, edge to

4150
01:58:27,109 --> 01:58:27,119
They're just going edge to edge, edge to
 

4151
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:28,629
They're just going edge to edge, edge to
edge, edge to edge, edge to edge. These

4152
01:58:28,629 --> 01:58:28,639
edge, edge to edge, edge to edge. These
 

4153
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:31,990
edge, edge to edge, edge to edge. These
are not markets I enjoy trading in.

4154
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:32,000
are not markets I enjoy trading in.
 

4155
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,990
are not markets I enjoy trading in.
Oh, like honestly I'll happily wait till

4156
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,000
Oh, like honestly I'll happily wait till
 

4157
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,589
Oh, like honestly I'll happily wait till
January. It's absolutely fine. I'm

4158
01:58:35,589 --> 01:58:35,599
January. It's absolutely fine. I'm
 

4159
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:37,109
January. It's absolutely fine. I'm
pretty exhausted from the year as it is.

4160
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:37,119
pretty exhausted from the year as it is.
 

4161
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:39,350
pretty exhausted from the year as it is.
It's been a decent year. Have I

4162
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:39,360
It's been a decent year. Have I
 

4163
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,030
It's been a decent year. Have I
underperformed? Definitely. I'd say

4164
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:41,040
underperformed? Definitely. I'd say
 

4165
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:42,709
underperformed? Definitely. I'd say
where I've underperformed the most is my

4166
01:58:42,709 --> 01:58:42,719
where I've underperformed the most is my
 

4167
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:45,189
where I've underperformed the most is my
swing accounts. Waiting to get long with

4168
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:45,199
swing accounts. Waiting to get long with
 

4169
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:48,229
swing accounts. Waiting to get long with
good size forever this year in the swing

4170
01:58:48,229 --> 01:58:48,239
good size forever this year in the swing
 

4171
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:49,910
good size forever this year in the swing
accounts and it's just not come into a

4172
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:49,920
accounts and it's just not come into a
 

4173
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,990
accounts and it's just not come into a
level where I felt comfortable bidding

4174
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:52,000
level where I felt comfortable bidding
 

4175
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,589
level where I felt comfortable bidding
on the market. And I think a lot of

4176
01:58:53,589 --> 01:58:53,599
on the market. And I think a lot of
 

4177
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:55,589
on the market. And I think a lot of
people feel the same way. And I would

4178
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:55,599
people feel the same way. And I would
 

4179
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:56,950
people feel the same way. And I would
say that's a big reason why we're

4180
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:56,960
say that's a big reason why we're
 

4181
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:58,709
say that's a big reason why we're
squeezing up end of year because I think

4182
01:58:58,709 --> 01:58:58,719
squeezing up end of year because I think
 

4183
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:00,870
squeezing up end of year because I think
hedge funds haven't made their bonuses.

4184
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:00,880
hedge funds haven't made their bonuses.
 

4185
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,189
hedge funds haven't made their bonuses.
They're probably way way short of where

4186
01:59:03,189 --> 01:59:03,199
They're probably way way short of where
 

4187
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:04,629
They're probably way way short of where
they need to be because they didn't get

4188
01:59:04,629 --> 01:59:04,639
they need to be because they didn't get
 

4189
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:06,550
they need to be because they didn't get
into the market at the right time. Same

4190
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:06,560
into the market at the right time. Same
 

4191
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:09,030
into the market at the right time. Same
as me. Everyone waited for that pullback

4192
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:09,040
as me. Everyone waited for that pullback
 

4193
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,870
as me. Everyone waited for that pullback
post April which never came. And

4194
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:10,880
post April which never came. And
 

4195
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,430
post April which never came. And
consequently, they're sat sitting on

4196
01:59:13,430 --> 01:59:13,440
consequently, they're sat sitting on
 

4197
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,030
consequently, they're sat sitting on
cash. And that's not good if they want

4198
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:15,040
cash. And that's not good if they want
 

4199
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:17,030
cash. And that's not good if they want
to get bonuses. So wouldn't surprise me

4200
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
to get bonuses. So wouldn't surprise me
 

4201
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,950
to get bonuses. So wouldn't surprise me
if this whole thing the last two weeks

4202
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:18,960
if this whole thing the last two weeks
 

4203
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,109
if this whole thing the last two weeks
or three weeks now has been about

4204
01:59:21,109 --> 01:59:21,119
or three weeks now has been about
 

4205
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:23,830
or three weeks now has been about
manipulating price so they can size in

4206

manipulating price so they can size in
 

4207
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:33,830
manipulating price so they can size in

I'm thinking about buying your course,

I'm thinking about buying your course,
but uh I don't know if you're fleecing

but uh I don't know if you're fleecing

It doesn't matter even if it does get to
 

4267
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,669
It doesn't matter even if it does get to
me. I'm not trading. I'm not trading

4268
02:01:17,669 --> 02:01:17,679
me. I'm not trading. I'm not trading

But like like good luck. Like who you

4274
02:01:25,109 --> 02:01:25,119
going to go and learn from? Who are you
 

4275
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:27,669
going to go and learn from? Who are you
going to go and learn from? I love that

going to go and learn from? I love that
 

4277
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:29,189
going to go and learn from? I love that

you're going to go and watch some other
 

4279
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:31,589
you're going to go and watch some other
guy who's sat there actually fleecing

4280
02:01:31,589 --> 02:01:31,599
guy who's sat there actually fleecing
 

4281
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:34,709
guy who's sat there actually fleecing
you all day long.

4282
02:01:34,709 --> 02:01:34,719

4283

I literally never talk about my course.

4284
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:41,040

 

4285
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,790

Yeah, I have. I've earned the right to

4286
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:42,800
Yeah, I have. I've earned the right to
 

4287
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,350
Yeah, I have. I've earned the right to
sell what I want like anyone has in

4288
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:45,360
sell what I want like anyone has in
 

4289
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:47,430
sell what I want like anyone has in
life. But the funny thing is I'm not

4290
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:47,440
life. But the funny thing is I'm not
 

4291
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:49,990
life. But the funny thing is I'm not
here actually selling anything. I'm sat

4292
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
here actually selling anything. I'm sat
 

4293
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:56,550
here actually selling anything. I'm sat
here talking about price action.

4294
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:56,560

 

4295
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:59,109

What's the [\h__\h] point, mate? This

4296
02:01:59,109 --> 02:01:59,119
What's the [\h__\h] point, mate? This
 

4297
02:01:59,119 --> 02:02:01,669
What's the [\h__\h] point, mate? This
world's [\h__\h] It's got people like

4298
02:02:01,669 --> 02:02:01,679
world's [\h__\h] It's got people like
 

4299
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:13,589
world's [\h__\h] It's got people like
that in it.

4300
02:02:13,589 --> 02:02:13,599

 

4301
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:15,109

Doesn't even cost you anything to be

4302
02:02:15,109 --> 02:02:15,119
Doesn't even cost you anything to be
 

4303
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:18,310
Doesn't even cost you anything to be
here. You can be here and not do the

4304
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:18,320
here. You can be here and not do the
 

4305
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,950
here. You can be here and not do the
course and not use any of my codes. I

4306
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:20,960
course and not use any of my codes. I
 

4307
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,629
course and not use any of my codes. I
don't care. That's also fine. But what

4308
02:02:22,629 --> 02:02:22,639
don't care. That's also fine. But what
 

4309
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:23,910
don't care. That's also fine. But what
you're not going to do is sit there and

4310
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:23,920
you're not going to do is sit there and
 

4311
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:28,070
you're not going to do is sit there and
[\h__\h] try and abuse me. Like, suck a

4312
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:28,080
[\h__\h] try and abuse me. Like, suck a
 

4313
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:35,669
[\h__\h] try and abuse me. Like, suck a
nut.

4314
02:02:35,669 --> 02:02:35,679

 

4315
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:36,950

All right, coming all the way down to

4316
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:36,960
All right, coming all the way down to
 

4317
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:38,950
All right, coming all the way down to
this New York open now. All right, and

4318
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:38,960
this New York open now. All right, and
 

4319
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,870
this New York open now. All right, and
if we lose this, so technically we're

4320
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:40,880
if we lose this, so technically we're
 

4321
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,790
if we lose this, so technically we're
inside an initial balance day. If they

4322
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:42,800
inside an initial balance day. If they
 

4323
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,709
inside an initial balance day. If they
want to complete a rotation today, they

4324
02:02:44,709 --> 02:02:44,719
want to complete a rotation today, they
 

4325
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:48,470
want to complete a rotation today, they
can do this. If we lose IB, like I said,

4326
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,480
can do this. If we lose IB, like I said,
 

4327
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,070
can do this. If we lose IB, like I said,
I wouldn't be long here. Someone asked,

4328
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:50,080
I wouldn't be long here. Someone asked,
 

4329
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:51,270
I wouldn't be long here. Someone asked,
would I be long here? I said the

4330
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:51,280
would I be long here? I said the
 

4331
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:54,310
would I be long here? I said the
momentum is heavy. If they lose IB,

4332
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:54,320
momentum is heavy. If they lose IB,
 

4333
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:55,430
momentum is heavy. If they lose IB,
where are they going to come? Well,

4334
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:55,440
where are they going to come? Well,
 

4335
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:56,790
where are they going to come? Well,
here's your previous day value. All

4336
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:56,800
here's your previous day value. All
 

4337
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,470
here's your previous day value. All
right, so this is yesterday's tight

4338
02:02:58,470 --> 02:02:58,480
right, so this is yesterday's tight
 

4339
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:01,270
right, so this is yesterday's tight
balance range. This is what we held in

4340
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:01,280
balance range. This is what we held in
 

4341
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,070
balance range. This is what we held in
the pre-market. We held yesterday's

4342
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,080
the pre-market. We held yesterday's
 

4343
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:07,109
the pre-market. We held yesterday's
value. Now, we got stuck up here. We

4344
02:03:07,109 --> 02:03:07,119
value. Now, we got stuck up here. We
 

4345
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:09,030
value. Now, we got stuck up here. We
couldn't get over those 60s. Obviously,

4346
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:09,040
couldn't get over those 60s. Obviously,
 

4347
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,550
couldn't get over those 60s. Obviously,
I was selling you the course up here

4348
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:10,560
I was selling you the course up here
 

4349
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,470
I was selling you the course up here
instead of telling you, you know, that

4350
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:12,480
instead of telling you, you know, that
 

4351
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:14,310
instead of telling you, you know, that
you had delta divergence and that

4352
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:14,320
you had delta divergence and that
 

4353
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,990
you had delta divergence and that
there's a passive seller and that if you

4354
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:16,000
there's a passive seller and that if you
 

4355
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,510
there's a passive seller and that if you
can't move through 60s, it's going to be

4356
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:17,520
can't move through 60s, it's going to be
 

4357
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:18,950
can't move through 60s, it's going to be
a problem. But no, I didn't tell you

4358
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:18,960
a problem. But no, I didn't tell you
 

4359
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,470
a problem. But no, I didn't tell you
that. I was selling you a course. Okay?

4360
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:20,480
that. I was selling you a course. Okay?
 

4361
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:22,070
that. I was selling you a course. Okay?
And then you failed here and you washed

4362
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:22,080
And then you failed here and you washed
 

4363
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,990
And then you failed here and you washed
to where? Right. Right. To VW up where

4364
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:24,000
to where? Right. Right. To VW up where
 

4365
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,589
to where? Right. Right. To VW up where
we said we'd fail to. And if you don't

4366
02:03:25,589 --> 02:03:25,599
we said we'd fail to. And if you don't
 

4367
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:27,430
we said we'd fail to. And if you don't
catch a bid here, we keep selling. One

4368
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:27,440
catch a bid here, we keep selling. One
 

4369
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,189
catch a bid here, we keep selling. One
of you asked about getting long and for

4370
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:29,199
of you asked about getting long and for
 

4371
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,830
of you asked about getting long and for
free I told you no because momentum is

4372
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:31,840
free I told you no because momentum is
 

4373
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,430
free I told you no because momentum is
still heavy. Now we're coming down to

4374
02:03:33,430 --> 02:03:33,440
still heavy. Now we're coming down to
 

4375
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,589
still heavy. Now we're coming down to
New York open. If we lose that we will

4376
02:03:35,589 --> 02:03:35,599
New York open. If we lose that we will
 

4377
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:38,070
New York open. If we lose that we will
come and gut check yesterday's value

4378
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:38,080
come and gut check yesterday's value
 

4379
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:40,070
come and gut check yesterday's value
where we found a bid this morning. Now

4380
02:03:40,070 --> 02:03:40,080
where we found a bid this morning. Now
 

4381
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:42,470
where we found a bid this morning. Now
if we lose yesterday's value it's a

4382
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:42,480
if we lose yesterday's value it's a
 

4383
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:43,910
if we lose yesterday's value it's a
whole different ballgame. I wouldn't

4384
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:43,920
whole different ballgame. I wouldn't
 

4385
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,830
whole different ballgame. I wouldn't
expect this market to go in free-for-all

4386
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:45,840
expect this market to go in free-for-all
 

4387
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:49,430
expect this market to go in free-for-all
but we can say that you never know what

4388
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:49,440
but we can say that you never know what
 

4389
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,109
but we can say that you never know what
happens in this market. Someone said can

02:03:51,109 --> 02:03:51,119
happens in this market. Someone said can
 

4391
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:53,350
happens in this market. Someone said can

02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:53,360
we go lower? Can we go higher? I laugh
 

4393
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:55,109

[\h__\h] hell, mate.
 

4415
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:24,070
[\h__\h] hell, mate.
Why do I bother?

4416
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:24,080

 

4417
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:26,070

I'll make sure when I come here Monday,

4418
02:04:26,070 --> 02:04:26,080
I'll make sure when I come here Monday,
 

4419
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:28,870
I'll make sure when I come here Monday,
all I do is sell you stuff and I won't

4420
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:28,880
all I do is sell you stuff and I won't
 

4421
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:30,950
all I do is sell you stuff and I won't
teach anymore. And you can just sit

4422
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:30,960
teach anymore. And you can just sit
 

4423
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,430
teach anymore. And you can just sit
there and watch a couple squiggly lines

4424
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:33,440
there and watch a couple squiggly lines
 

4425
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,030
there and watch a couple squiggly lines
on a chart. Maybe I take the opening

4426
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:35,040
on a chart. Maybe I take the opening
 

4427
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,350
on a chart. Maybe I take the opening
range breakout on a guest for 30 seconds

4428
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:37,360
range breakout on a guest for 30 seconds
 

4429
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:38,870
range breakout on a guest for 30 seconds
and you can watch that. And then maybe

4430
02:04:38,870 --> 02:04:38,880
and you can watch that. And then maybe
 

4431
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,550
and you can watch that. And then maybe
we just talk about a couple squiggly

4432
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:40,560
we just talk about a couple squiggly
 

4433
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,950
we just talk about a couple squiggly
lines on a chart all day and we ignore

4434
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:42,960
lines on a chart all day and we ignore
 

4435
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,030
lines on a chart all day and we ignore
all price and uh maybe I just try and

4436
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:45,040
all price and uh maybe I just try and
 

4437
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:46,950
all price and uh maybe I just try and
sell you my course all day long and sell

4438
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:46,960
sell you my course all day long and sell
 

4439
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,470
sell you my course all day long and sell
you codes all day long and then I'll be

4440
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:48,480
you codes all day long and then I'll be
 

4441
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:55,589
you codes all day long and then I'll be
like everyone else.

4442
02:04:55,589 --> 02:04:55,599

 

4443
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:58,310

What a world we live in where this is

4444
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:58,320
What a world we live in where this is
 

4445
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:30,310
What a world we live in where this is
how it is.

4446
02:05:30,310 --> 02:05:30,320

Vic starting to test that 15196
 

4449

Vic starting to test that 15196
level again. I [\h__\h] made you pay for

We talked about this

4460
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:47,280
We talked about this
 

4461
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,950
We talked about this
All right, we talked about this level

4462
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:48,960
All right, we talked about this level
 

4463
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,350
All right, we talked about this level
here. This shelf

4464
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:51,360
here. This shelf
 

4465
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:57,669
here. This shelf
right here.

4466
02:05:57,669 --> 02:05:57,679

 

4467
02:05:57,679 --> 02:05:59,910

This is the shelf that it lost. This is

4468
02:05:59,910 --> 02:05:59,920
This is the shelf that it lost. This is
 

4469
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:03,830
This is the shelf that it lost. This is
what's key. Now, VIX reclaims this and

4470
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:03,840
what's key. Now, VIX reclaims this and
 

4471
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,790
what's key. Now, VIX reclaims this and
does one of these, this will push the

4472
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:06,800
does one of these, this will push the
 

4473
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:10,149
does one of these, this will push the
market lower, right? As in the S&P will

4474
02:06:10,149 --> 02:06:10,159
market lower, right? As in the S&P will
 

4475
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:14,070
market lower, right? As in the S&P will
start rotating lower.

4476
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:14,080

4487
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:34,069

This level here is key. This is their

This level here is key. This is their
 

4489
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:36,149
This level here is key. This is their
gamma level. Positive gamma above it. If

4490
02:06:36,149 --> 02:06:36,159
gamma level. Positive gamma above it. If
 

4491
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:37,750
gamma level. Positive gamma above it. If
they lose this, where's the rotation?

4492
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:37,760
they lose this, where's the rotation?
 

4493
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:39,589
they lose this, where's the rotation?
It's to 82. That's the next level. All

4494
02:06:39,589 --> 02:06:39,599
It's to 82. That's the next level. All
 

4495
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:41,350
It's to 82. That's the next level. All
right. So, the rotation, if they lose

4496
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:41,360
right. So, the rotation, if they lose
 

4497
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,750
right. So, the rotation, if they lose
it, is at 82. So if they look below and

4498
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:43,760
it, is at 82. So if they look below and
 

4499
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:45,510
it, is at 82. So if they look below and
fail, then we come right back up and

4500
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:45,520
fail, then we come right back up and
 

4501
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:46,950
fail, then we come right back up and
they will want to complete it probably

4502
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:46,960
they will want to complete it probably
 

4503
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,390
they will want to complete it probably
all the way to 90. Doesn't have to be

4504
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:48,400
all the way to 90. Doesn't have to be
 

4505
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:49,669
all the way to 90. Doesn't have to be
today, but that's what they're trading

4506
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
today, but that's what they're trading
 

4507
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:57,669
today, but that's what they're trading
between two.

4508
02:06:57,669 --> 02:06:57,679

 

4509
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:00,709

Again,

4510
02:07:00,709 --> 02:07:00,719

 

4511
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:04,550

price alerts on spy 85 8280. We talked

4512
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:04,560
price alerts on spy 85 8280. We talked
 

4513
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:14,790
price alerts on spy 85 8280. We talked
about it. Lower expectations of price.

4514
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:14,800

 

4515
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:25,910

I know, Jose, but

4516
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:25,920

 

4517
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:27,510

you wouldn't you wouldn't you just

4518
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:27,520
you wouldn't you wouldn't you just
 

4519
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,270
you wouldn't you wouldn't you just
wouldn't believe the amount of [\h__\h]

4520
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,280
wouldn't believe the amount of [\h__\h]
 

4521
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,030
wouldn't believe the amount of [\h__\h]
that I get on a daily basis. Like, I've

4522
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:31,040
that I get on a daily basis. Like, I've
 

4523
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:32,550
that I get on a daily basis. Like, I've
got someone commenting right now on my

4524
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:32,560
got someone commenting right now on my
 

4525
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,069
got someone commenting right now on my
volume profile saying, "You don't

4526
02:07:34,069 --> 02:07:34,079
volume profile saying, "You don't
 

4527
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,669
volume profile saying, "You don't
mention your settings on the number of

4528
02:07:35,669 --> 02:07:35,679
mention your settings on the number of
 

4529
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:37,669
mention your settings on the number of
row sizes." where I know for a [\h__\h]

4530
02:07:37,669 --> 02:07:37,679
row sizes." where I know for a [\h__\h]
 

4531
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:40,950
row sizes." where I know for a [\h__\h]
fact I say in the video it's a thousand.

4532
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:40,960
fact I say in the video it's a thousand.
 

4533
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,310
fact I say in the video it's a thousand.
And this is what annoys me. It's just

4534
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:42,320
And this is what annoys me. It's just
 

4535
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,390
And this is what annoys me. It's just
like people they haven't got the

4536
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:44,400
like people they haven't got the
 

4537
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,629
like people they haven't got the
patience to go and watch the education

4538
02:07:46,629 --> 02:07:46,639
patience to go and watch the education
 

4539
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:48,470
patience to go and watch the education
and then they question you where I know

4540
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:48,480
and then they question you where I know
 

4541
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:51,189
and then they question you where I know
the answer's in there.

4542
02:07:51,189 --> 02:07:51,199
the answer's in there.
 

4543
02:07:51,199 --> 02:08:02,229
the answer's in there.
It just drives me mad.

4544
02:08:02,229 --> 02:08:02,239

 

4545
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:04,069

Okay. So, at the moment, they're trying

4546
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:04,079
Okay. So, at the moment, they're trying
 

4547
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:05,750
Okay. So, at the moment, they're trying
to protect New York open. That blue

4548
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:05,760
to protect New York open. That blue
 

4549
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:07,510
to protect New York open. That blue
line, the bottom blue line on your chart

4550
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:07,520
line, the bottom blue line on your chart
 

4551
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:11,109
line, the bottom blue line on your chart
is the New York Open.

4552
02:08:11,109 --> 02:08:11,119
is the New York Open.
 

4553
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:12,470
is the New York Open.
That's the bottom blue line on your

4554
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:12,480
That's the bottom blue line on your
 

4555
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:21,669
That's the bottom blue line on your
chart.

4556
02:08:21,669 --> 02:08:21,679

 

4557
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:23,830

Yeah, gold selling off. BTC's been

4558
02:08:23,830 --> 02:08:23,840
Yeah, gold selling off. BTC's been
 

4559
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,109
Yeah, gold selling off. BTC's been
selling off. There was a big flush in

4560
02:08:25,109 --> 02:08:25,119
selling off. There was a big flush in
 

4561
02:08:25,119 --> 02:08:26,550
selling off. There was a big flush in
the market. Someone called it called

4562
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:26,560
the market. Someone called it called
 

4563
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,910
the market. Someone called it called
about it earlier. But again,

4564
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:29,920
about it earlier. But again,
 

4565
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,550
about it earlier. But again,
for me personally on a Friday with how

4566
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:32,560
for me personally on a Friday with how
 

4567
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:35,189
for me personally on a Friday with how
this market's operated the last 5 to 10

4568
02:08:35,189 --> 02:08:35,199
this market's operated the last 5 to 10
 

4569
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:39,270
this market's operated the last 5 to 10
days, um I'm not too bothered. I'm not

4570
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:39,280
days, um I'm not too bothered. I'm not
 

4571
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:40,950
days, um I'm not too bothered. I'm not
too bothered about doing anything. From

4572
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:40,960
too bothered about doing anything. From
 

4573
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,709
too bothered about doing anything. From
what I've seen this morning, I would

4574
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:42,719
what I've seen this morning, I would
 

4575
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:44,950
what I've seen this morning, I would
have liked if this market had been very

4576
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:44,960
have liked if this market had been very
 

4577
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,189
have liked if this market had been very
kind to us and it had waited and done

4578
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:47,199
kind to us and it had waited and done
 

4579
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:49,830
kind to us and it had waited and done
this off the opening drive, I would have

4580
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:49,840
this off the opening drive, I would have
 

4581
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:51,589
this off the opening drive, I would have
thought about a bid off previous day's

4582
02:08:51,589 --> 02:08:51,599
thought about a bid off previous day's
 

4583
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:53,189
thought about a bid off previous day's
value because I knew we built lots

4584
02:08:53,189 --> 02:08:53,199
value because I knew we built lots
 

4585
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:55,109
value because I knew we built lots
there. But we didn't. We we opened up

4586
02:08:55,109 --> 02:08:55,119
there. But we didn't. We we opened up
 

4587
02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:56,870
there. But we didn't. We we opened up
went straight squeeze gave the whole

4588
02:08:56,870 --> 02:08:56,880
went straight squeeze gave the whole
 

4589
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,709
went straight squeeze gave the whole
thing back and then went straight upside

4590
02:08:58,709 --> 02:08:58,719
thing back and then went straight upside
 

4591
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:00,870
thing back and then went straight upside
and the next buying opportunity was up

4592
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:00,880
and the next buying opportunity was up
 

4593
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:03,030
and the next buying opportunity was up
here and that is buying the high of week

4594
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:03,040
here and that is buying the high of week
 

4595
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:04,629
here and that is buying the high of week
and I'm not buying a high of week on a

4596
02:09:04,629 --> 02:09:04,639
and I'm not buying a high of week on a
 

4597
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:12,310
and I'm not buying a high of week on a
Friday. I will not do it.

4598
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:12,320

 

4599
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:14,310

So there we go. It's a no trade day and

4600
02:09:14,310 --> 02:09:14,320
So there we go. It's a no trade day and
 

4601
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:17,030
So there we go. It's a no trade day and
that's all right.

4602
02:09:17,030 --> 02:09:17,040
that's all right.
 

4603
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,589
that's all right.

very good back in the day. It used to be
 

4677

very good back in the day. It used to be
the one to go to that and Trade Zero for

Trading 212 for my big swings.
 

4687

Trading 212 for my big swings.
Um because being from the UK, they are

4688
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:05,840
Um because being from the UK, they are
 

4689
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:08,310
Um because being from the UK, they are
very tax efficient for me. But it all

4690
02:11:08,310 --> 02:11:08,320
very tax efficient for me. But it all
 

4691
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,870
very tax efficient for me. But it all
depends

4692
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:10,880
depends
 

4693
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,950
depends
all depends what you're looking at like

4694
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:12,960
all depends what you're looking at like
 

4695
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:14,870
all depends what you're looking at like

4697
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:16,629
in terms of what what products and what
kind of trades you're going to take. If

4698
02:11:16,629 --> 02:11:16,639
kind of trades you're going to take. If
 

4699
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:18,709
kind of trades you're going to take. If
you're looking to like sw like to take

4700
02:11:18,709 --> 02:11:18,719
you're looking to like sw like to take
 

4701
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:21,669
you're looking to like sw like to take
swing trades on commons, then what I

4702
02:11:21,669 --> 02:11:21,679
swing trades on commons, then what I
 

4703
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:22,950
swing trades on commons, then what I
would say is you just want something

4704
02:11:22,950 --> 02:11:22,960
would say is you just want something
 

4705
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:24,629
would say is you just want something
where you're not paying a lot for a

4706
02:11:24,629 --> 02:11:24,639
where you're not paying a lot for a
 

4707
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:27,350
where you're not paying a lot for a
round trip. Um, that's probably the best

4708
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:27,360
round trip. Um, that's probably the best
 

4709
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,950
round trip. Um, that's probably the best
thing. So, probably I would say Think or

4710
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:28,960
thing. So, probably I would say Think or
 

4711
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,030
thing. So, probably I would say Think or
Swim probably is still good for that.

4712
02:11:31,030 --> 02:11:31,040
Swim probably is still good for that.
 

4713
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:33,990
Swim probably is still good for that.
Um, I know Think or Swim also have good

4714
02:11:33,990 --> 02:11:34,000
Um, I know Think or Swim also have good
 

4715
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,910
Um, I know Think or Swim also have good
option chains. Well, at least they used

4716
02:11:35,910 --> 02:11:35,920
option chains. Well, at least they used
 

4717
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:37,910
option chains. Well, at least they used
to. I haven't looked at it for a long

4718
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:37,920
to. I haven't looked at it for a long
 

4719
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:40,149
to. I haven't looked at it for a long
time. Charting used to be really good

4720
02:11:40,149 --> 02:11:40,159
time. Charting used to be really good
 

4721
02:11:40,159 --> 02:11:41,669
time. Charting used to be really good
there and then everyone moved to Trading

4722
02:11:41,669 --> 02:11:41,679
there and then everyone moved to Trading
 

4723
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:44,310
there and then everyone moved to Trading
View.

4724
02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:44,320
View.
 

4725
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:48,629
View.
It used to be the go-to for charts.

4726
02:11:48,629 --> 02:11:48,639

 

4727
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:49,990

It used to annoy me because I couldn't

4728
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,000
It used to annoy me because I couldn't
 

4729
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,550
It used to annoy me because I couldn't
get it when I was uh from the UK. I

4730
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:52,560
get it when I was uh from the UK. I
 

4731
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,310
get it when I was uh from the UK. I
couldn't get it. Canadian based, isn't

4732
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,320
couldn't get it. Canadian based, isn't
 

4733
02:11:54,320 --> 02:12:01,750
couldn't get it. Canadian based, isn't
it? TDM Trade.

4734
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:01,760

 

4735
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,310

Love that, Jeff. I love that, Jeff.

4736
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:04,320
Love that, Jeff. I love that, Jeff.
 

4737

Love that, Jeff. I love that, Jeff.

4738
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:08,159
Congrats, mate. Nice work.
 

4739
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:10,470
Congrats, mate. Nice work.

4740
02:12:10,470 --> 02:12:10,480
Nice work.
 

4741
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:15,510
Nice work.
All right. So, so far you're protecting.

4742
02:12:15,510 --> 02:12:15,520
All right. So, so far you're protecting.
 

4743
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:17,910
All right. So, so far you're protecting.
Where's this low? All right. You've got

4744
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:17,920
Where's this low? All right. You've got
 

4745
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:19,750
Where's this low? All right. You've got
delta divergence here. So, we have

4746
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:19,760
delta divergence here. So, we have
 

4747
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:21,669
delta divergence here. So, we have
positive delta from here to here. All

4748
02:12:21,669 --> 02:12:21,679
positive delta from here to here. All
 

4749
02:12:21,679 --> 02:12:23,830
positive delta from here to here. All
right. So, Delta made a higher high

4750
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:23,840
right. So, Delta made a higher high
 

4751
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,589
right. So, Delta made a higher high
here. So, we've got aggressive buying

4752
02:12:25,589 --> 02:12:25,599
here. So, we've got aggressive buying
 

4753
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:27,589
here. So, we've got aggressive buying
starting to take place here. All right.

4754
02:12:27,589 --> 02:12:27,599
starting to take place here. All right.
 

4755
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:29,030
starting to take place here. All right.
We have aggressive buying starting to

4756
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:29,040
We have aggressive buying starting to
 

4757
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:32,550
We have aggressive buying starting to
take place here. No doubt about it.

4758
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:32,560
take place here. No doubt about it.
 

4759
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:35,270
take place here. No doubt about it.
Right? Because we made a higher high on

4760
02:12:35,270 --> 02:12:35,280
Right? Because we made a higher high on
 

4761
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,750
Right? Because we made a higher high on
cumulative delta. If I have a look at

4762
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:37,760
cumulative delta. If I have a look at
 

4763
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,430
cumulative delta. If I have a look at
the footprint,

4764
02:12:39,430 --> 02:12:39,440
the footprint,
 

4765
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:41,990
the footprint,
where did that strong selling coming in?

4766
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:42,000
where did that strong selling coming in?
 

4767
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,830
where did that strong selling coming in?
Yeah, they got absorbed. So, we saw

4768
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:43,840
Yeah, they got absorbed. So, we saw
 

4769
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:48,550
Yeah, they got absorbed. So, we saw
strong selling at 706s, 696,

4770
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:48,560
strong selling at 706s, 696,
 

4771
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:51,189
strong selling at 706s, 696,
and definitely 692 and under. And that

4772
02:12:51,189 --> 02:12:51,199
and definitely 692 and under. And that
 

4773
02:12:51,199 --> 02:12:53,430
and definitely 692 and under. And that
all got absorbed and we're starting to

4774
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:53,440
all got absorbed and we're starting to
 

4775
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:55,109
all got absorbed and we're starting to
trade upside. So, we had a bid come back

4776
02:12:55,109 --> 02:12:55,119
trade upside. So, we had a bid come back
 

4777
02:12:55,119 --> 02:12:57,270
trade upside. So, we had a bid come back
in over 700. So, let's just see. But,

4778
02:12:57,270 --> 02:12:57,280
in over 700. So, let's just see. But,
 

4779
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:58,310
in over 700. So, let's just see. But,
you've got point of control. Like I

4780
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:58,320
you've got point of control. Like I
 

4781
02:12:58,320 --> 02:12:59,669
you've got point of control. Like I
said, point of control will flip from

4782
02:12:59,669 --> 02:12:59,679
said, point of control will flip from
 

4783
02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:01,109
said, point of control will flip from
here to here because we spent a long

4784
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
here to here because we spent a long
 

4785
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:02,950
here to here because we spent a long
time. It's what you're starting to see

4786
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:02,960
time. It's what you're starting to see
 

4787
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,390
time. It's what you're starting to see
this here. It's going to get messy in

4788
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:04,400
this here. It's going to get messy in
 

4789
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,990
this here. It's going to get messy in
between this. This is this is the

4790
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:06,000
between this. This is this is the
 

4791
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,390
between this. This is this is the
battleground now. Right in here right

4792
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:08,400
battleground now. Right in here right
 

4793
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:09,990
battleground now. Right in here right
now. If bulls reclaim that, there's

4794
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:10,000
now. If bulls reclaim that, there's
 

4795
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,350
now. If bulls reclaim that, there's
potential for a squeeze high. There's no

4796
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:11,360
potential for a squeeze high. There's no
 

4797
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:13,669
potential for a squeeze high. There's no
doubt about it. But that's what they've

4798
02:13:13,669 --> 02:13:13,679
doubt about it. But that's what they've
 

4799
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:15,510
doubt about it. But that's what they've
done the last few days. Maybe they don't

4800
02:13:15,510 --> 02:13:15,520
done the last few days. Maybe they don't
 

4801
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:20,229
done the last few days. Maybe they don't
do it on a Friday.

4802
02:13:20,229 --> 02:13:20,239

 

4803
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:22,229

Took the rejection from VIX. Nice. Yeah,

4804
02:13:22,229 --> 02:13:22,239
Took the rejection from VIX. Nice. Yeah,
 

4805
02:13:22,239 --> 02:13:23,990
Took the rejection from VIX. Nice. Yeah,
it just failed 16s, didn't it? We just

4806
02:13:23,990 --> 02:13:24,000
it just failed 16s, didn't it? We just
 

4807
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:31,750
it just failed 16s, didn't it? We just
talked about it. That trade up to 16s.

4808
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:31,760

 

4809
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,750

Yeah, I don't I don't blame. That's how

4810
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:33,760
Yeah, I don't I don't blame. That's how
 

4811
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:35,189
Yeah, I don't I don't blame. That's how
I feel. That's why I'm not trading it.

4812
02:13:35,189 --> 02:13:35,199
I feel. That's why I'm not trading it.
 

4813
02:13:35,199 --> 02:13:38,629
I feel. That's why I'm not trading it.
I've got zero trust in this market.

4814
02:13:38,629 --> 02:13:38,639
I've got zero trust in this market.
 

4815
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:41,189
I've got zero trust in this market.
Zero trust in this market. What I know

4816
02:13:41,189 --> 02:13:41,199
Zero trust in this market. What I know
 

4817
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:44,310
Zero trust in this market. What I know
is like just based on the daily. Where's

4818
02:13:44,310 --> 02:13:44,320
is like just based on the daily. Where's
 

4819
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:47,510
is like just based on the daily. Where's
your screen? Based on the daily,

02:13:47,510 --> 02:13:47,520
your screen? Based on the daily,
 

4821
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:49,350
your screen? Based on the daily,
right? If we're if we're doing this

4822
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:49,360
right? If we're if we're doing this
 

4823
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:51,669
right? If we're if we're doing this
drift up off this and everyone's like

4824
02:13:51,669 --> 02:13:51,679
drift up off this and everyone's like
 

4825
02:13:51,679 --> 02:13:55,669
drift up off this and everyone's like
low volume doesn't matter. Um, it does.

4826
02:13:55,669 --> 02:13:55,679
low volume doesn't matter. Um, it does.
 

4827
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:57,910
low volume doesn't matter. Um, it does.
Yeah, it does. Because if there is a

4828
02:13:57,910 --> 02:13:57,920
Yeah, it does. Because if there is a
 

4829
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:00,149
Yeah, it does. Because if there is a
reason for them to sell here, if they

4830
02:14:00,149 --> 02:14:00,159
reason for them to sell here, if they
 

4831
02:14:00,159 --> 02:14:01,990
reason for them to sell here, if they
find a reason to sell here and they sell

4832
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:02,000
find a reason to sell here and they sell
 

4833
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,790
find a reason to sell here and they sell
with high volume, right? High volume,

4834
02:14:04,790 --> 02:14:04,800
with high volume, right? High volume,
 

4835
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,990
with high volume, right? High volume,
guess what's going to happen? Night

4836
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,000
guess what's going to happen? Night
 

4837
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,550
guess what's going to happen? Night
night. Because this there's not a lot in

4838
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:08,560
night. Because this there's not a lot in
 

4839
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:10,149
night. Because this there's not a lot in
here, folks. Any structure we're looking

4840
02:14:10,149 --> 02:14:10,159
here, folks. Any structure we're looking
 

4841
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:12,790
here, folks. Any structure we're looking
at in here, we can see it's low volume.

4842
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:12,800
at in here, we can see it's low volume.
 

4843
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:15,510
at in here, we can see it's low volume.
If they sell a high volume day, um we

4844
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:15,520
If they sell a high volume day, um we
 

4845
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:17,350
If they sell a high volume day, um we
are going to give back most of this

4846
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:17,360
are going to give back most of this
 

4847
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:20,229
are going to give back most of this
move, right? Low volume, low volume, low

4848
02:14:20,229 --> 02:14:20,239
move, right? Low volume, low volume, low
 

4849
02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:21,910
move, right? Low volume, low volume, low
volume, low volume, low volume. If they

4850
02:14:21,910 --> 02:14:21,920
volume, low volume, low volume. If they
 

4851
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:23,990
volume, low volume, low volume. If they
come in with a catalyst and a reason to

4852
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:24,000
come in with a catalyst and a reason to
 

4853
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,310
come in with a catalyst and a reason to
sell, big if. But if they do, we'll be

4854
02:14:26,310 --> 02:14:26,320
sell, big if. But if they do, we'll be
 

4855
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:29,910
sell, big if. But if they do, we'll be
back down here in one day. In one day.

4856
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:29,920
back down here in one day. In one day.
 

4857
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:32,069
back down here in one day. In one day.
Because where are we? We're at 700. Do

4858
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:32,079
Because where are we? We're at 700. Do
 

4859
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:33,430
Because where are we? We're at 700. Do
you think it's that hard to get back to

4860
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,440
you think it's that hard to get back to
 

4861
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:35,830
you think it's that hard to get back to
sort of 200 500 point move? It's not

4862
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:35,840
sort of 200 500 point move? It's not
 

4863
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:38,229
sort of 200 500 point move? It's not
that hard, folks. It's It's not that

4864
02:14:38,229 --> 02:14:38,239
that hard, folks. It's It's not that
 

4865
02:14:38,239 --> 02:14:39,990
that hard, folks. It's It's not that
hard at all for them to do that. That is

4866
02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:40,000
hard at all for them to do that. That is
 

4867
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:52,629
hard at all for them to do that. That is
my concern with the market here.

4868
02:14:52,629 --> 02:14:52,639

 

4869
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:54,149

So I'd say now looking at this market,

4870
02:14:54,149 --> 02:14:54,159
So I'd say now looking at this market,
 

4871
02:14:54,159 --> 02:14:57,109
So I'd say now looking at this market,
bulls need to fend 715s just based on

4872
02:14:57,109 --> 02:14:57,119
bulls need to fend 715s just based on
 

4873
02:14:57,119 --> 02:15:00,470
bulls need to fend 715s just based on
what I'm seeing in the tape. 715s.

4874
02:15:00,470 --> 02:15:00,480
what I'm seeing in the tape. 715s.
 

4875
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,310
what I'm seeing in the tape. 715s.
All right, they came flying in at 715s.

4876
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:02,320
All right, they came flying in at 715s.
 

4877
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,870
All right, they came flying in at 715s.
You have an imbalance from 7 720s to

4878
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:04,880
You have an imbalance from 7 720s to
 

4879
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:07,910
You have an imbalance from 7 720s to
715s. If bulls hold that, you can see a

4880
02:15:07,910 --> 02:15:07,920
715s. If bulls hold that, you can see a
 

4881
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:11,109
715s. If bulls hold that, you can see a
rotation, right? This

4882
02:15:11,109 --> 02:15:11,119
rotation, right? This
 

4883
02:15:11,119 --> 02:15:12,709
rotation, right? This
kind of little nugget here, that's where

4884
02:15:12,709 --> 02:15:12,719
kind of little nugget here, that's where
 

4885
02:15:12,719 --> 02:15:14,470
kind of little nugget here, that's where
bulls need to defend. Failing to hold

4886
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:14,480
bulls need to defend. Failing to hold
 

4887
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:17,189
bulls need to defend. Failing to hold
this will just allow a swipe all the way

4888
02:15:17,189 --> 02:15:17,199
this will just allow a swipe all the way
 

4889
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:20,390
this will just allow a swipe all the way
back down again. No position for me. I'm

4890
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:20,400
back down again. No position for me. I'm
 

4891
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,750
back down again. No position for me. I'm
definitely not putting a position on

4892
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:21,760
definitely not putting a position on
 

4893
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,470
definitely not putting a position on
today. Too rolled up. Too many people

4894
02:15:24,470 --> 02:15:24,480
today. Too rolled up. Too many people
 

4895
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:30,790
today. Too rolled up. Too many people
pissing me off today.

4896
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:30,800

 

4897
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,310

It's the same thing that I'm seeing with

4898
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:32,320
It's the same thing that I'm seeing with
 

4899
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:34,709
It's the same thing that I'm seeing with
like people trying to say like RIPS is

4900
02:15:34,709 --> 02:15:34,719
like people trying to say like RIPS is
 

4901
02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:36,790
like people trying to say like RIPS is
trading paper. It's like the guy's

4902
02:15:36,790 --> 02:15:36,800
trading paper. It's like the guy's
 

4903
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:39,750
trading paper. It's like the guy's
trading [\h__\h] 50 lots on NQ and gold.

4904
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:39,760
trading [\h__\h] 50 lots on NQ and gold.
 

4905
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:43,669
trading [\h__\h] 50 lots on NQ and gold.
Do you know how much size that is?

4906
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
Do you know how much size that is?
 

4907
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,350
Do you know how much size that is?
Do you know how much size that is? And

02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:50,229
trading. It's laughable. And he gets
animated and annoyed like I do when

4920
02:16:04,229 --> 02:16:04,239

 

4921
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:07,350

RIPs is a legit trader. He's trading

All right. They didn't defend 15s here.
 

4943
02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:38,870
All right. They didn't defend 15s here.
The only place left now is where those

5013
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:20,950

All right, more downside here. And if

5014
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:20,960
All right, more downside here. And if
 

5015
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:23,509
All right, more downside here. And if
you lose initial balance here, your

5016
02:18:23,509 --> 02:18:23,519
you lose initial balance here, your

5020
02:18:27,429 --> 02:18:27,439
value area high is very, very possible
 

5021
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:29,190
value area high is very, very possible
all the way down into here, folks. All

5022

all the way down into here, folks. All
 

5023
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,469
all the way down into here, folks. All
right. And we might come and test that

5024
02:18:32,469 --> 02:18:32,479
right. And we might come and test that
 

5025
02:18:32,479 --> 02:18:34,230
right. And we might come and test that
VIX back through the 16s. Just be

5026
02:18:34,230 --> 02:18:34,240
VIX back through the 16s. Just be
 

5027
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:36,549
VIX back through the 16s. Just be
careful now. All right. Like I said, if

5028
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:36,559
careful now. All right. Like I said, if
 

5029
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:39,030
careful now. All right. Like I said, if
VIX holds above 16, starts spiking, it's

5030
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:39,040
VIX holds above 16, starts spiking, it's
 

5031
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:40,549
VIX holds above 16, starts spiking, it's
going to be a problem for the market and

5032
02:18:40,549 --> 02:18:40,559
going to be a problem for the market and
 

5033
02:18:40,559 --> 02:18:42,950
going to be a problem for the market and
it's starting to go. All right. So, if

5034
02:18:42,950 --> 02:18:42,960
it's starting to go. All right. So, if
 

5035
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:44,389
it's starting to go. All right. So, if
you were short in this, like I said, for

5036
02:18:44,389 --> 02:18:44,399
you were short in this, like I said, for
 

5037
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:46,070
you were short in this, like I said, for
me, I would there's no long in this.

5038
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:46,080
me, I would there's no long in this.
 

5039
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:47,990
me, I would there's no long in this.

If you trade under 685, then um 682 is

5102
02:24:14,790 --> 02:24:14,800
If you trade under 685, then um 682 is
 

5103
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:16,790
If you trade under 685, then um 682 is
possible.

5104
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:16,800
possible.
 

5105
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,030
possible.
That was the the level from the last few

5106
02:24:19,030 --> 02:24:19,040
That was the the level from the last few
 

5107
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:21,270
That was the the level from the last few
days. All right. So 685 is that sort of

5108
02:24:21,270 --> 02:24:21,280
days. All right. So 685 is that sort of
 

5109
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,389
days. All right. So 685 is that sort of
dealers level that they're trying to

5110
02:24:22,389 --> 02:24:22,399
dealers level that they're trying to
 

5111
02:24:22,399 --> 02:24:55,510
dealers level that they're trying to
hold.

5112
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:55,520

 

5113
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:57,110

again. You know, obviously you have to

5114
02:24:57,110 --> 02:24:57,120
again. You know, obviously you have to
 

5115
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:59,429
again. You know, obviously you have to
pay the course to find out the level of

5116
02:24:59,429 --> 02:24:59,439
pay the course to find out the level of
 

5117
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:01,990
pay the course to find out the level of
685 for me. Made that clear. I can't not

5118
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,000
685 for me. Made that clear. I can't not
 

5119
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,670
685 for me. Made that clear. I can't not
I'm going to tell you without you paying

5120
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:03,680
I'm going to tell you without you paying
 

5121
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:06,710
I'm going to tell you without you paying
me money. [\h__\h] me. That's still in my

5122
02:25:06,710 --> 02:25:06,720
me money. [\h__\h] me. That's still in my
 

5123
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:26,710
me money. [\h__\h] me. That's still in my
head. It's just [\h__\h] madness.

5124
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:26,720

 

5125
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:28,870

Uh, I was going to do a giveaway today,

5126
02:25:28,870 --> 02:25:28,880
Uh, I was going to do a giveaway today,
 

5127
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:31,349
Uh, I was going to do a giveaway today,

5137
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:49,349

I think that's fair.

5138
02:25:49,349 --> 02:25:49,359

 

5139
02:25:49,359 --> 02:25:51,670

You know, you you can only get the Apex

5140
02:25:51,670 --> 02:25:51,680
You know, you you can only get the Apex
 

5141
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:53,190
You know, you you can only get the Apex
giveaway if you're giving me all your

02:25:53,190 --> 02:25:53,200
giveaway if you're giving me all your
 

5143
02:25:53,200 --> 02:26:02,070
giveaway if you're giving me all your
money first.

5144
02:26:02,070 --> 02:26:02,080

 

5145
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:07,670

Oh,

5146
02:26:07,670 --> 02:26:07,680

 

5147
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:10,389

[\h__\h] me. I don't know how celebs deal

5148
02:26:10,389 --> 02:26:10,399
[\h__\h] me. I don't know how celebs deal
 

5149
02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:12,710
[\h__\h] me. I don't know how celebs deal
with anything.

5150
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
with anything.
 

5151
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:20,630
with anything.
All

5152
02:26:20,630 --> 02:26:20,640

 

5153
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,630

right, you're starting to see it try and

5154
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:22,640
right, you're starting to see it try and
 

5155
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:25,990
right, you're starting to see it try and
reclaim current range for value on the

5156
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:26,000
reclaim current range for value on the
 

5157
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,429
reclaim current range for value on the
day. You're starting to see a little bit

5158
02:26:27,429 --> 02:26:27,439
day. You're starting to see a little bit
 

5159
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:29,190
day. You're starting to see a little bit
of reaction from spy. It's a little bit

5160
02:26:29,190 --> 02:26:29,200
of reaction from spy. It's a little bit
 

5161
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:30,790
of reaction from spy. It's a little bit
early, I would say, but it's trying.

5162
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:30,800
early, I would say, but it's trying.
 

5163
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:33,830
early, I would say, but it's trying.
It's trying to find a reaction there. Oh

5164
02:26:33,830 --> 02:26:33,840
It's trying to find a reaction there. Oh
 

5165
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:44,070
It's trying to find a reaction there. Oh
god.

5166
02:26:44,070 --> 02:26:44,080

 

5167
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:45,830

There's a sell side imbalance. They want

5168
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:45,840
There's a sell side imbalance. They want
 

5169
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:47,670
There's a sell side imbalance. They want
to trade all the way out to 720s at the

5170
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:47,680
to trade all the way out to 720s at the
 

5171
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:50,309
to trade all the way out to 720s at the
moment. They can they can come up there.

5172
02:26:50,309 --> 02:26:50,319
moment. They can they can come up there.
 

5173
02:26:50,319 --> 02:26:59,830
moment. They can they can come up there.
That's where uh they last came in.

5174
02:26:59,830 --> 02:26:59,840

 

5175
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:12,630

Or was that New York open 80s?

5176
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:12,640

 

5177
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:14,230

and they need to get a close under 80s

5178
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:14,240
and they need to get a close under 80s
 

5179
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:16,389
and they need to get a close under 80s
and under IB. If you if you do get a

5180
02:27:16,389 --> 02:27:16,399
and under IB. If you if you do get a
 

5181
02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:17,990
and under IB. If you if you do get a
close under those, then I think there's

5182
02:27:17,990 --> 02:27:18,000
close under those, then I think there's
 

5183
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,510
close under those, then I think there's
a chance to move lower here back to

5184
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:19,520
a chance to move lower here back to
 

5185
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:21,750
a chance to move lower here back to
value. But at the moment, it really

5186
02:27:21,750 --> 02:27:21,760
value. But at the moment, it really
 

5187
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:23,270
value. But at the moment, it really
depends how they operate. Here's the

5188
02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:23,280
depends how they operate. Here's the
 

5189
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,510
depends how they operate. Here's the
move back down to IB. And I think if you

5190
02:27:25,510 --> 02:27:25,520
move back down to IB. And I think if you
 

5191
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:27,349
move back down to IB. And I think if you
start to see sellside pressure come in

5192
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:27,359
start to see sellside pressure come in
 

5193
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:29,110
start to see sellside pressure come in
underneath this, I think you get quite a

5194
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:29,120
underneath this, I think you get quite a
 

5195
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:32,469
underneath this, I think you get quite a
nasty wash to be quite honest with you.

5196
02:27:32,469 --> 02:27:32,479
nasty wash to be quite honest with you.
 

5197
02:27:32,479 --> 02:27:35,750
nasty wash to be quite honest with you.
big if, but that that's what the if is.

5198
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:35,760
big if, but that that's what the if is.
 

5199
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:37,429
big if, but that that's what the if is.
That is what the if is. If they can

5200
02:27:37,429 --> 02:27:37,439
That is what the if is. If they can
 

5201
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:39,670
That is what the if is. If they can
close under IB, I think you can

5202
02:27:39,670 --> 02:27:39,680
close under IB, I think you can
 

5203
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:41,429
close under IB, I think you can
potentially get a wash back down to

5204
02:27:41,429 --> 02:27:41,439
potentially get a wash back down to
 

5205
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:44,070
potentially get a wash back down to
here.

5206
02:27:44,070 --> 02:27:44,080
here.
 

5207
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:45,670
here.
This is a sensitive area. You wouldn't

5208
02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:45,680
This is a sensitive area. You wouldn't
 

5209
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:47,190
This is a sensitive area. You wouldn't
want to be a new money short, but like

5210
02:27:47,190 --> 02:27:47,200
want to be a new money short, but like
 

5211
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:49,110
want to be a new money short, but like
if they start rejecting this and they

5212
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:49,120
if they start rejecting this and they
 

5213
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,190
if they start rejecting this and they
rotate, then if some of you are already

5214
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,200
rotate, then if some of you are already
 

5215
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,150
rotate, then if some of you are already
short,

5216
02:27:54,150 --> 02:27:54,160
short,
 

5217
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:56,710
short,
no, I'll uh we'll do a like a just a

5218
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:56,720
no, I'll uh we'll do a like a just a
 

5219
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:00,150
no, I'll uh we'll do a like a just a
draw in 30 minutes. I'll just give you a

5220
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:00,160
draw in 30 minutes. I'll just give you a
 

5221
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:01,670
draw in 30 minutes. I'll just give you a
word that you write into chat and then

5222
02:28:01,670 --> 02:28:01,680
word that you write into chat and then
 

5223
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:03,349
word that you write into chat and then
we'll do a draw for it. It just be

5224
02:28:03,349 --> 02:28:03,359
we'll do a draw for it. It just be
 

5225
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:09,429
we'll do a draw for it. It just be
selected by random.

5226
02:28:09,429 --> 02:28:09,439

 

5227
02:28:09,439 --> 02:28:12,150

It's trying to get to 685. Yeah. Uh spy.

5228
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:12,160
It's trying to get to 685. Yeah. Uh spy.
 

5229
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:13,830
It's trying to get to 685. Yeah. Uh spy.
Well, it's it's there or thereabouts.

5230
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:13,840
Well, it's it's there or thereabouts.
 

5231
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:16,790
Well, it's it's there or thereabouts.
You know, they might protect it. If you

5232
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:16,800
You know, they might protect it. If you
 

5233
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:18,710
You know, they might protect it. If you
were short, you'd be covering into this.

5234
02:28:18,710 --> 02:28:18,720
were short, you'd be covering into this.
 

5235
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:20,710
were short, you'd be covering into this.
And if they're going to hold it, they're

5236
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:20,720
And if they're going to hold it, they're
 

5237
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:22,150
And if they're going to hold it, they're
going to start accumulating in and

5238
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:22,160
going to start accumulating in and
 

5239
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:24,230
going to start accumulating in and
around here. If SPY fails that, it's got

5240
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:24,240
around here. If SPY fails that, it's got
 

5241
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:27,190
around here. If SPY fails that, it's got
a gap filled to 68440. And then uh

5242
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:27,200
a gap filled to 68440. And then uh
 

5243
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:29,750
a gap filled to 68440. And then uh
previous day high 683

5244
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:29,760
previous day high 683
 

5245
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:31,910
previous day high 683
um or 68360s.

5246
02:28:31,910 --> 02:28:31,920
um or 68360s.
 

5247
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:34,870
um or 68360s.
And if we wash 682 that's the gamma

5248
02:28:34,870 --> 02:28:34,880
And if we wash 682 that's the gamma
 

5249
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:56,550
And if we wash 682 that's the gamma
level. If they wash it

5250
02:28:56,550 --> 02:28:56,560

 

5251
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:05,110

wants to retest PDH

5252
02:29:05,110 --> 02:29:05,120

 

5253
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:08,309

on this. What is going on with my timing

5254
02:29:08,309 --> 02:29:08,319
on this. What is going on with my timing
 

5255
02:29:08,319 --> 02:29:11,670
on this. What is going on with my timing
on here? Yeah. Uh 1618 is the level to

5256
02:29:11,670 --> 02:29:11,680
on here? Yeah. Uh 1618 is the level to
 

5257
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:14,550
on here? Yeah. Uh 1618 is the level to
watch on VIX. 1618. Break through that

5258
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:14,560
watch on VIX. 1618. Break through that
 

5259
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:16,950
watch on VIX. 1618. Break through that
uh you suddenly get room up to the

5260
02:29:16,950 --> 02:29:16,960
uh you suddenly get room up to the
 

5261
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:19,270
uh you suddenly get room up to the
1656s.

5262
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:19,280
1656s.
 

5263
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:20,870
1656s.
That's the level on Vick. So if if it

5264
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:20,880
That's the level on Vick. So if if it
 

5265
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:24,150
That's the level on Vick. So if if it
keeps bidding above 16 market like we

5266
02:29:24,150 --> 02:29:24,160
keeps bidding above 16 market like we
 

5267
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:25,590
keeps bidding above 16 market like we
might need a pull back on VIX back

5268
02:29:25,590 --> 02:29:25,600
might need a pull back on VIX back
 

5269
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,429
might need a pull back on VIX back
towards the 16 but if it keeps bid

5270
02:29:27,429 --> 02:29:27,439
towards the 16 but if it keeps bid
 

5271
02:29:27,439 --> 02:29:29,429
towards the 16 but if it keeps bid
bidding above it and breaks through 1618

5272
02:29:29,429 --> 02:29:29,439
bidding above it and breaks through 1618
 

5273
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:31,190
bidding above it and breaks through 1618
then the market's going to get heavy.

5274
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:31,200
then the market's going to get heavy.
 

5275
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:32,630
then the market's going to get heavy.
But you know we are at a sensitive

5276
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:32,640
But you know we are at a sensitive
 

5277
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:34,150
But you know we are at a sensitive
level. Look we're at value for the day.

5278
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:34,160
level. Look we're at value for the day.
 

5279
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:35,590
level. Look we're at value for the day.
We're at initial balance. We've swept

5280
02:29:35,590 --> 02:29:35,600
We're at initial balance. We've swept
 

5281
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:37,270
We're at initial balance. We've swept
the low already. This might want to turn

5282
02:29:37,270 --> 02:29:37,280
the low already. This might want to turn
 

5283
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:40,790
the low already. This might want to turn
inside and test this little pocket here.

5284
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:40,800
inside and test this little pocket here.
 

5285
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:42,790
inside and test this little pocket here.
Right. We said like 1720. We've got a

5286
02:29:42,790 --> 02:29:42,800
Right. We said like 1720. We've got a
 

5287
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,230
Right. We said like 1720. We've got a
sellside imbalance. If it wants to come

5288
02:29:44,230 --> 02:29:44,240
sellside imbalance. If it wants to come
 

5289
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:46,070
sellside imbalance. If it wants to come
up here it can. How it acts there then

5290
02:29:46,070 --> 02:29:46,080
up here it can. How it acts there then
 

5291
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:47,910
up here it can. How it acts there then
becomes key. Remember, it's always about

5292
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:47,920
becomes key. Remember, it's always about
 

5293
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:51,349
becomes key. Remember, it's always about
how it acts when it gets to a level.

5294
02:29:51,349 --> 02:29:51,359
how it acts when it gets to a level.
 

5295
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:53,349
how it acts when it gets to a level.
Definitely wouldn't be long right now.

5296
02:29:53,349 --> 02:29:53,359
Definitely wouldn't be long right now.
 

5297
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:55,590
Definitely wouldn't be long right now.
Market's still been heavy. It's not

5298
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:55,600
Market's still been heavy. It's not
 

5299
02:29:55,600 --> 02:30:07,910
Market's still been heavy. It's not
shown that it wants to move upside yet.

5300
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:07,920

 

5301
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:09,429

Only thing I would say is there's been

5302
02:30:09,429 --> 02:30:09,439
Only thing I would say is there's been
 

5303
02:30:09,439 --> 02:30:11,510
Only thing I would say is there's been
aggressive buying. All the time we've

5304
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:11,520
aggressive buying. All the time we've
 

5305
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:12,790
aggressive buying. All the time we've
been down here, there's been aggressive

5306
02:30:12,790 --> 02:30:12,800
been down here, there's been aggressive
 

5307
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:14,469
been down here, there's been aggressive
buying

5308
02:30:14,469 --> 02:30:14,479
buying
 

5309
02:30:14,479 --> 02:30:16,230
buying
because you're not seeing lower lows on

5310
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:16,240
because you're not seeing lower lows on
 

5311
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:17,910
because you're not seeing lower lows on
the CBD.

5312
02:30:17,910 --> 02:30:17,920
the CBD.
 

5313
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:19,429
the CBD.
Seeing the opposite. You are seeing

5314
02:30:19,429 --> 02:30:19,439
Seeing the opposite. You are seeing
 

5315
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:20,630
Seeing the opposite. You are seeing
aggressive buying here. There is

5316
02:30:20,630 --> 02:30:20,640
aggressive buying here. There is
 

5317
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:22,230
aggressive buying here. There is
divergence down here, but we just have

5318
02:30:22,230 --> 02:30:22,240
divergence down here, but we just have
 

5319
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:24,150
divergence down here, but we just have
to see what happens. It mean for me it

5320
02:30:24,150 --> 02:30:24,160
to see what happens. It mean for me it
 

5321
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:25,910
to see what happens. It mean for me it
means that there's a hidden seller

5322
02:30:25,910 --> 02:30:25,920
means that there's a hidden seller
 

5323
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:27,429
means that there's a hidden seller
walking it down trying to move it lower

5324
02:30:27,429 --> 02:30:27,439
walking it down trying to move it lower
 

5325
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:30,469
walking it down trying to move it lower
for now. That's what it means for me.

5326
02:30:30,469 --> 02:30:30,479
for now. That's what it means for me.
 

5327
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:41,030
for now. That's what it means for me.
But we'll see.

5328
02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:41,040

 

5329
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:42,389

Is that in balance? I said, "Oh, we're

5330
02:30:42,389 --> 02:30:42,399
Is that in balance? I said, "Oh, we're
 

5331
02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:45,030
Is that in balance? I said, "Oh, we're
at 1720."

5332
02:30:45,030 --> 02:30:45,040
at 1720."
 

5333
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:49,190
at 1720."
17 17 720 1720 720. Here we go. Here's

5334
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:49,200
17 17 720 1720 720. Here we go. Here's
 

5335
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:53,030
17 17 720 1720 720. Here we go. Here's
the lift up to 7 and 720 is the top of

5336
02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:53,040
the lift up to 7 and 720 is the top of
 

5337
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:55,190
the lift up to 7 and 720 is the top of
that imbalance. So, how they up there

5338
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:55,200
that imbalance. So, how they up there
 

5339
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:56,710
that imbalance. So, how they up there
becomes key. SPY already back through

5340
02:30:56,710 --> 02:30:56,720
becomes key. SPY already back through
 

5341
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:59,349
becomes key. SPY already back through
its New York open

5342
02:30:59,349 --> 02:30:59,359
its New York open
 

5343
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:01,190
its New York open
and VIX coming back down to that 16s

5344
02:31:01,190 --> 02:31:01,200
and VIX coming back down to that 16s
 

5345
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:03,110
and VIX coming back down to that 16s
that we just talked about. So, I have to

5346
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:03,120
that we just talked about. So, I have to
 

5347
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,510
that we just talked about. So, I have to
see if VIX can form a higher low here or

5348
02:31:05,510 --> 02:31:05,520
see if VIX can form a higher low here or
 

5349
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:07,910
see if VIX can form a higher low here or
not. I still think there's potentially a

5350
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:07,920
not. I still think there's potentially a
 

5351
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:09,429
not. I still think there's potentially a
hidden seller here trying to walk price

5352
02:31:09,429 --> 02:31:09,439
hidden seller here trying to walk price
 

5353
02:31:09,439 --> 02:31:12,710
hidden seller here trying to walk price
down. But, uh, we will see.

5354
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:12,720
down. But, uh, we will see.
 

5355
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:14,710
down. But, uh, we will see.
We will see. If market starts breaking

5356
02:31:14,710 --> 02:31:14,720
We will see. If market starts breaking
 

5357
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:17,110
We will see. If market starts breaking
out, it'll get trapped. I still think

5358
02:31:17,110 --> 02:31:17,120
out, it'll get trapped. I still think
 

5359
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:19,110
out, it'll get trapped. I still think
price wants to probably move lower. It's

5360
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:19,120
price wants to probably move lower. It's
 

5361
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:20,630
price wants to probably move lower. It's
just whether it needs a shove up first.

5362
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:20,640
just whether it needs a shove up first.
 

5363
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,870
just whether it needs a shove up first.
We've been in a sell

5364
02:31:22,870 --> 02:31:22,880
We've been in a sell
 

5365
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:25,030
We've been in a sell
ever since we put in that rotation

5366
02:31:25,030 --> 02:31:25,040
ever since we put in that rotation
 

5367
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:27,670
ever since we put in that rotation
formation up here, right? Ever since we

5368
02:31:27,670 --> 02:31:27,680
formation up here, right? Ever since we
 

5369
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,830
formation up here, right? Ever since we
had the delta divergence here, we had

5370
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:29,840
had the delta divergence here, we had
 

5371
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:32,070
had the delta divergence here, we had
this here and delta was doing this,

5372
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:32,080
this here and delta was doing this,
 

5373
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,349
this here and delta was doing this,
which means we had a passive seller

5374
02:31:33,349 --> 02:31:33,359
which means we had a passive seller
 

5375
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:34,630
which means we had a passive seller
because you had aggressive buying,

5376
02:31:34,630 --> 02:31:34,640
because you had aggressive buying,
 

5377
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:37,270
because you had aggressive buying,
failed to move higher, that six uh 860

5378
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:37,280
failed to move higher, that six uh 860
 

5379
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:39,030
failed to move higher, that six uh 860
was the level. Soon as you lost this

5380
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:39,040
was the level. Soon as you lost this
 

5381
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:41,190
was the level. Soon as you lost this
shelf, we talked about if you fail to

5382
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:41,200
shelf, we talked about if you fail to
 

5383
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:42,710
shelf, we talked about if you fail to
hold that, you're going to wash. There's

5384
02:31:42,710 --> 02:31:42,720
hold that, you're going to wash. There's
 

5385
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:44,469
hold that, you're going to wash. There's
the wash. And since then, it's just been

5386
02:31:44,469 --> 02:31:44,479
the wash. And since then, it's just been
 

5387
02:31:44,479 --> 02:31:46,950
the wash. And since then, it's just been
a walk down, right? If shorts get

5388
02:31:46,950 --> 02:31:46,960
a walk down, right? If shorts get
 

5389
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:48,870
a walk down, right? If shorts get
trapped here, yeah, sure, we might see

5390
02:31:48,870 --> 02:31:48,880
trapped here, yeah, sure, we might see
 

5391
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:50,469
trapped here, yeah, sure, we might see
some relief, but I wouldn't really be

5392
02:31:50,469 --> 02:31:50,479
some relief, but I wouldn't really be
 

5393
02:31:50,479 --> 02:31:54,389
some relief, but I wouldn't really be
long until you get well above this. Now,

5394
02:31:54,389 --> 02:31:54,399
long until you get well above this. Now,
 

5395
02:31:54,399 --> 02:31:56,150
long until you get well above this. Now,
market's in a rotation. We've been in a

5396
02:31:56,150 --> 02:31:56,160
market's in a rotation. We've been in a
 

5397
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,590
market's in a rotation. We've been in a
rotation the whole time. Is this a

5398
02:31:57,590 --> 02:31:57,600
rotation the whole time. Is this a
 

5399
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:59,510
rotation the whole time. Is this a
higher time frame RBS? Yeah, but we're

5400
02:31:59,510 --> 02:31:59,520
higher time frame RBS? Yeah, but we're
 

5401
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,830
higher time frame RBS? Yeah, but we're
trading the lower side of it. Uh

5402
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:01,840
trading the lower side of it. Uh
 

5403
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:03,670
trading the lower side of it. Uh
momentum's been heavy. So, you know,

5404
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:03,680
momentum's been heavy. So, you know,
 

5405
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,110
momentum's been heavy. So, you know,
maybe they come up to here and then

5406
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:05,120
maybe they come up to here and then
 

5407
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,910
maybe they come up to here and then
wash. Maybe they just fail already. I'll

5408
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:07,920
wash. Maybe they just fail already. I'll
 

5409
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,270
wash. Maybe they just fail already. I'll
watch the tape and try and call it for

5410
02:32:09,270 --> 02:32:09,280
watch the tape and try and call it for
 

5411
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:11,590
watch the tape and try and call it for
you. But, uh it's been fairly thin

5412
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:11,600
you. But, uh it's been fairly thin
 

5413
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:16,550
you. But, uh it's been fairly thin
volume wise.

5414
02:32:16,550 --> 02:32:16,560

 

5415
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:18,389

Fix finding a bid at 16 like we just

5416
02:32:18,389 --> 02:32:18,399
Fix finding a bid at 16 like we just
 

5417
02:32:18,399 --> 02:32:20,950
Fix finding a bid at 16 like we just
talked about. Again, give me all your

5418
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:20,960
talked about. Again, give me all your
 

5419
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:23,190
talked about. Again, give me all your
money because I gave you a level. Make

5420
02:32:23,190 --> 02:32:23,200
money because I gave you a level. Make
 

5421
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:26,150
money because I gave you a level. Make
sure you give me all your money.

5422
02:32:26,150 --> 02:32:26,160
sure you give me all your money.
 

5423
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:27,590
sure you give me all your money.
That's never going to get boring for me

5424
02:32:27,590 --> 02:32:27,600
That's never going to get boring for me
 

5425
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:36,469
That's never going to get boring for me
saying that. Now,

5426
02:32:36,469 --> 02:32:36,479

 

5427
02:32:36,479 --> 02:32:39,349

I'd say uh 720 is the level that bears

5428
02:32:39,349 --> 02:32:39,359
I'd say uh 720 is the level that bears
 

5429
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:43,110
I'd say uh 720 is the level that bears
will need to to defend. 720. If they

5430
02:32:43,110 --> 02:32:43,120
will need to to defend. 720. If they
 

5431
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:44,309
will need to to defend. 720. If they
don't defend that, they're opening

5432
02:32:44,309 --> 02:32:44,319
don't defend that, they're opening
 

5433
02:32:44,319 --> 02:32:47,270
don't defend that, they're opening
themselves up. 720s, I would say, is the

5434
02:32:47,270 --> 02:32:47,280
themselves up. 720s, I would say, is the
 

5435
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:51,270
themselves up. 720s, I would say, is the
level

5436
02:32:51,270 --> 02:32:51,280

 

5437
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:57,590

in this pocket.

5438
02:32:57,590 --> 02:32:57,600

 

5439
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:00,950

If we drift, well,

5440
02:33:00,950 --> 02:33:00,960
If we drift, well,
 

5441
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:04,230
If we drift, well,
IB2 maybe, but I wouldn't be playing

5442
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:04,240
IB2 maybe, but I wouldn't be playing
 

5443
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:10,790
IB2 maybe, but I wouldn't be playing
that right now.

5444
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:10,800

 

5445
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:12,790

Big starting to lose 16s here. It can

5446
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:12,800
Big starting to lose 16s here. It can
 

5447
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:17,190
Big starting to lose 16s here. It can
still hold a bid on that level which was

5448
02:33:17,190 --> 02:33:17,200
still hold a bid on that level which was
 

5449
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:41,750
still hold a bid on that level which was
sort of 90ish.

5450
02:33:41,750 --> 02:33:41,760

 

5451
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,590

defended the edge of this. Like I said,

5452
02:33:43,590 --> 02:33:43,600
defended the edge of this. Like I said,
 

5453
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:45,510
defended the edge of this. Like I said,
1720 is where they have to defend. They

5454
02:33:45,510 --> 02:33:45,520
1720 is where they have to defend. They
 

5455
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:47,030
1720 is where they have to defend. They
didn't even allow it into that little

5456
02:33:47,030 --> 02:33:47,040
didn't even allow it into that little
 

5457
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:48,630
didn't even allow it into that little
gap. They defended the edge of this

5458
02:33:48,630 --> 02:33:48,640
gap. They defended the edge of this
 

5459
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:50,790
gap. They defended the edge of this
right here.

5460
02:33:50,790 --> 02:33:50,800
right here.
 

5461
02:33:50,800 --> 02:34:07,830
right here.
It's a good defend from Bears.

5462
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:07,840

 

5463
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:20,150

Oh, stop being an [\h__\h] Honestly,

5464
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:20,160

 

5465
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:21,990

so so far you're not seeing any follow

5466
02:34:21,990 --> 02:34:22,000
so so far you're not seeing any follow
 

5467
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,750
so so far you're not seeing any follow
through underneath 85 on the spy. All

5468
02:34:25,750 --> 02:34:25,760
through underneath 85 on the spy. All
 

5469
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:28,150
through underneath 85 on the spy. All
right.

5470
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:28,160
right.
 

5471
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:29,590
right.
If you see follow through under there,

5472
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:29,600
If you see follow through under there,
 

5473
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:31,429
If you see follow through under there,
there is a flush moment probably to fill

5474
02:34:31,429 --> 02:34:31,439
there is a flush moment probably to fill
 

5475
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:34,150
there is a flush moment probably to fill
the gap. We haven't filled the gap in

5476
02:34:34,150 --> 02:34:34,160
the gap. We haven't filled the gap in
 

5477
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:36,389
the gap. We haven't filled the gap in
the New York session yet to PDC. And if

5478
02:34:36,389 --> 02:34:36,399
the New York session yet to PDC. And if
 

5479
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:37,590
the New York session yet to PDC. And if
they get under there, then I'd be

5480
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:37,600
they get under there, then I'd be
 

5481
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,389
they get under there, then I'd be
watching 82s. But we are Bears are still

5482
02:34:40,389 --> 02:34:40,399
watching 82s. But we are Bears are still
 

5483
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:41,910
watching 82s. But we are Bears are still
in control. Like I said, look, here's

5484
02:34:41,910 --> 02:34:41,920
in control. Like I said, look, here's
 

5485
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:43,990
in control. Like I said, look, here's
the defend. Look how simple volume makes

5486
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:44,000
the defend. Look how simple volume makes
 

5487
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,510
the defend. Look how simple volume makes
this for you. There's the defend. They

5488
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:45,520
this for you. There's the defend. They
 

5489
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:46,790
this for you. There's the defend. They
could have let it come all the way up

5490
02:34:46,790 --> 02:34:46,800
could have let it come all the way up
 

5491
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,150
could have let it come all the way up
here. That's what I was saying. As long

5492
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:48,160
here. That's what I was saying. As long
 

5493
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:50,309
here. That's what I was saying. As long
as they defend 820s, there's potential

5494
02:34:50,309 --> 02:34:50,319
as they defend 820s, there's potential
 

5495
02:34:50,319 --> 02:34:52,710
as they defend 820s, there's potential
for this rotation. And but you're going

5496
02:34:52,710 --> 02:34:52,720
for this rotation. And but you're going
 

5497
02:34:52,720 --> 02:35:14,070
for this rotation. And but you're going
to have to watch the spiders.

5498
02:35:14,070 --> 02:35:14,080

 

5499
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:23,590

That is that

5500
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:23,600

 

5501
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:25,990

previous day New York open.

5502
02:35:25,990 --> 02:35:26,000
previous day New York open.
 

5503
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,670
previous day New York open.
Sorry, I'm just having to check a level

5504
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:27,680
Sorry, I'm just having to check a level
 

5505
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:37,750
Sorry, I'm just having to check a level
there.

5506
02:35:37,750 --> 02:35:37,760

 

5507
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:39,510

Why is it easier? It's not that it's

5508
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:39,520
Why is it easier? It's not that it's
 

5509
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:42,309
Why is it easier? It's not that it's
easier. It's that when it comes to

5510
02:35:42,309 --> 02:35:42,319
easier. It's that when it comes to
 

5511
02:35:42,319 --> 02:35:44,309
easier. It's that when it comes to
options, the biggest traded market is

5512
02:35:44,309 --> 02:35:44,319
options, the biggest traded market is
 

5513
02:35:44,319 --> 02:35:45,990
options, the biggest traded market is
the spy.

5514
02:35:45,990 --> 02:35:46,000
the spy.
 

5515
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,469
the spy.
So, I'm just using that as a guide. I I

5516
02:35:48,469 --> 02:35:48,479
So, I'm just using that as a guide. I I
 

5517
02:35:48,479 --> 02:35:50,309
So, I'm just using that as a guide. I I
hate doing it, Aani, if I'm honest.

5518
02:35:50,309 --> 02:35:50,319
hate doing it, Aani, if I'm honest.
 

5519
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:51,910
hate doing it, Aani, if I'm honest.
Like, it's very rare that you'll hear me

5520
02:35:51,910 --> 02:35:51,920
Like, it's very rare that you'll hear me
 

5521
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:55,110
Like, it's very rare that you'll hear me
talk about that. But because I know it's

5522
02:35:55,110 --> 02:35:55,120
talk about that. But because I know it's
 

5523
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:57,110
talk about that. But because I know it's
that that's in control of the market, I

5524
02:35:57,110 --> 02:35:57,120
that that's in control of the market, I
 

5525
02:35:57,120 --> 02:35:58,870
that that's in control of the market, I
have to pay attention to it. That's all

5526
02:35:58,870 --> 02:35:58,880
have to pay attention to it. That's all
 

5527
02:35:58,880 --> 02:36:01,830
have to pay attention to it. That's all
it is. Normally, I wouldn't give

5528
02:36:01,830 --> 02:36:01,840
it is. Normally, I wouldn't give
 

5529
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:05,990
it is. Normally, I wouldn't give
a rat's ass about it, but just because I

5530
02:36:05,990 --> 02:36:06,000
a rat's ass about it, but just because I
 

5531
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,070
a rat's ass about it, but just because I
know that that is what's having such a

5532
02:36:08,070 --> 02:36:08,080
know that that is what's having such a
 

5533
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:10,309
know that that is what's having such a
big impact in the market at the moment,

5534
02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:10,319
big impact in the market at the moment,
 

5535
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:12,870
big impact in the market at the moment,
I'm giving it a little bit of respect.

5536
02:36:12,870 --> 02:36:12,880
I'm giving it a little bit of respect.
 

5537
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:14,150
I'm giving it a little bit of respect.
Let's say, let me just close this door.

5538
02:36:14,150 --> 02:36:14,160
Let's say, let me just close this door.
 

5539
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:24,710
Let's say, let me just close this door.
Wife just got home.

5540
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:24,720

 

5541
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:27,670

You'll give me $5 if I pass this combine

5542
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:27,680
You'll give me $5 if I pass this combine
 

5543
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:29,590
You'll give me $5 if I pass this combine
next trade. What? You're in a combine.

5544
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:29,600
next trade. What? You're in a combine.
 

5545
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:45,990
next trade. What? You're in a combine.
How much do you need to make?

5546
02:36:45,990 --> 02:36:46,000

 

5547
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:50,630

Can't get below this initial balance.

5548
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:50,640

 

5549
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:53,110

This is the level, right? Bears need to

5550
02:36:53,110 --> 02:36:53,120
This is the level, right? Bears need to
 

5551
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:55,110
This is the level, right? Bears need to
get underneath this or that wash. If

5552
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:55,120
get underneath this or that wash. If
 

5553
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,469
get underneath this or that wash. If
they can't do that, they must defend

5554
02:36:56,469 --> 02:36:56,479
they can't do that, they must defend
 

5555
02:36:56,479 --> 02:36:59,190
they can't do that, they must defend
this. If bulls reclaim this, squeeze out

5556
02:36:59,190 --> 02:36:59,200
this. If bulls reclaim this, squeeze out
 

5557
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:03,750
this. If bulls reclaim this, squeeze out
as possible.

5558
02:37:03,750 --> 02:37:03,760

 

5559
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:06,150

500. Oh, mate. Don't Don't force it.

5560
02:37:06,150 --> 02:37:06,160
500. Oh, mate. Don't Don't force it.
 

5561
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:08,550
500. Oh, mate. Don't Don't force it.
Don't force it. It's nothing. One good

5562
02:37:08,550 --> 02:37:08,560
Don't force it. It's nothing. One good
 

5563
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:10,950
Don't force it. It's nothing. One good
trade will get you there. Let let the

5564
02:37:10,950 --> 02:37:10,960
trade will get you there. Let let the
 

5565
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:12,389
trade will get you there. Let let the
market funny around for a bit and trap

5566
02:37:12,389 --> 02:37:12,399
market funny around for a bit and trap
 

5567
02:37:12,399 --> 02:37:13,910
market funny around for a bit and trap
some participants and then you can uh

5568
02:37:13,910 --> 02:37:13,920
some participants and then you can uh
 

5569
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:20,309
some participants and then you can uh
get involved.

5570
02:37:20,309 --> 02:37:20,319

 

5571
02:37:20,319 --> 02:37:22,150

Alex, that's dead on. SPX is a huge

5572
02:37:22,150 --> 02:37:22,160
Alex, that's dead on. SPX is a huge
 

5573
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:23,670
Alex, that's dead on. SPX is a huge
market that pushes other markets around.

5574
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:23,680
market that pushes other markets around.
 

5575
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:33,110
market that pushes other markets around.
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

5576
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:33,120

 

5577
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:35,910

So defending that level again bears for

5578
02:37:35,910 --> 02:37:35,920
So defending that level again bears for
 

5579
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:38,230
So defending that level again bears for
now.

5580
02:37:38,230 --> 02:37:38,240
now.
 

5581
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:39,670
now.
I just want to see if they lift and let

5582
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:39,680
I just want to see if they lift and let
 

5583
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:41,349
I just want to see if they lift and let
it through to 20s, but at the moment

5584
02:37:41,349 --> 02:37:41,359
it through to 20s, but at the moment
 

5585
02:37:41,359 --> 02:37:42,790
it through to 20s, but at the moment
they're not letting that through again

5586
02:37:42,790 --> 02:37:42,800
they're not letting that through again
 

5587
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,870
they're not letting that through again
at all.

5588
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:44,880
at all.
 

5589
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:51,429
at all.
What's this alert going off?

5590
02:37:51,429 --> 02:37:51,439

 

5591
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:53,830

Coinbase just telling me that crypto is

5592
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:53,840
Coinbase just telling me that crypto is
 

5593
02:37:53,840 --> 02:38:02,469
Coinbase just telling me that crypto is
getting destroyed. Yeah. No [\h__\h]

5594
02:38:02,469 --> 02:38:02,479

 

5595
02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:05,429

So, still bears defending that level,

5596
02:38:05,429 --> 02:38:05,439
So, still bears defending that level,
 

5597
02:38:05,439 --> 02:38:07,270
So, still bears defending that level,
but still no follow through for them

5598
02:38:07,270 --> 02:38:07,280
but still no follow through for them
 

5599
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:09,110
but still no follow through for them
yet.

5600
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:09,120
yet.
 

5601
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:11,910
yet.
We have seen like an increase in buying

5602
02:38:11,910 --> 02:38:11,920
We have seen like an increase in buying
 

5603
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:13,670
We have seen like an increase in buying
delta start to step in on the tape

5604
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:13,680
delta start to step in on the tape
 

5605
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:15,670
delta start to step in on the tape
recently. But this this candle here is

5606
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:15,680
recently. But this this candle here is
 

5607
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:17,030
recently. But this this candle here is
going to be important this next five

5608
02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:17,040
going to be important this next five
 

5609
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:26,070
going to be important this next five
minutes, I think.

5610
02:38:26,070 --> 02:38:26,080

 

5611
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:28,230

Bull's defending 92 right now. That's

5612
02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:28,240
Bull's defending 92 right now. That's
 

5613
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:31,670
Bull's defending 92 right now. That's
their level is 92.

5614
02:38:31,670 --> 02:38:31,680
their level is 92.
 

5615
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:34,630
their level is 92.
92 to 85.

5616
02:38:34,630 --> 02:38:34,640
92 to 85.
 

5617
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:36,870
92 to 85.
There are definitely shorts caught at

5618
02:38:36,870 --> 02:38:36,880
There are definitely shorts caught at
 

5619
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:39,270
There are definitely shorts caught at
that low at 57.

5620
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:39,280
that low at 57.
 

5621
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:41,910
that low at 57.
The strong selling into 57. So they are

5622
02:38:41,910 --> 02:38:41,920
The strong selling into 57. So they are
 

5623
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:44,469
The strong selling into 57. So they are
caught under under 57 right now. for the

5624
02:38:44,469 --> 02:38:44,479
caught under under 57 right now. for the
 

5625
02:38:44,479 --> 02:38:55,910
caught under under 57 right now. for the
bears.

5626
02:38:55,910 --> 02:38:55,920

 

5627
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:57,429

Are they going to fill this guy up to

5628
02:38:57,429 --> 02:38:57,439
Are they going to fill this guy up to
 

5629
02:38:57,439 --> 02:39:02,469
Are they going to fill this guy up to
720?

5630
02:39:02,469 --> 02:39:02,479

 

5631
02:39:02,479 --> 02:39:03,670

Looks like they're going to try and get

5632
02:39:03,670 --> 02:39:03,680
Looks like they're going to try and get
 

5633
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:06,550
Looks like they're going to try and get
into that little gap

5634
02:39:06,550 --> 02:39:06,560
into that little gap
 

5635
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:08,230
into that little gap
we talked about. And I'd say this is the

5636
02:39:08,230 --> 02:39:08,240
we talked about. And I'd say this is the
 

5637
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:09,990
we talked about. And I'd say this is the
area here to make for it to make a

5638
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:10,000
area here to make for it to make a
 

5639
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:11,750
area here to make for it to make a
decision. They're going to have to

5640
02:39:11,750 --> 02:39:11,760
decision. They're going to have to
 

5641
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:13,429
decision. They're going to have to
defend here or hereabouts. They let it

5642
02:39:13,429 --> 02:39:13,439
defend here or hereabouts. They let it
 

5643
02:39:13,439 --> 02:39:14,309
defend here or hereabouts. They let it
through. Then we're going to go straight

5644
02:39:14,309 --> 02:39:14,319
through. Then we're going to go straight
 

5645
02:39:14,319 --> 02:39:22,870
through. Then we're going to go straight
to VWOP

5646
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:22,880

 

5647
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:27,429

at that key level now 1590s.

5648
02:39:27,429 --> 02:39:27,439

 

5649
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:29,750

So I said this is your level 20s. If

5650
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:29,760
So I said this is your level 20s. If
 

5651
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:30,950
So I said this is your level 20s. If
they let it through here, there's a

5652
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:30,960
they let it through here, there's a
 

5653
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:32,710
they let it through here, there's a
squeeze potential to come straight up to

5654
02:39:32,710 --> 02:39:32,720
squeeze potential to come straight up to
 

5655
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:35,190
squeeze potential to come straight up to
point of control, VWAPs, all these kind

5656
02:39:35,190 --> 02:39:35,200
point of control, VWAPs, all these kind
 

5657
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:37,190
point of control, VWAPs, all these kind
of areas.

5658
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:37,200
of areas.
 

5659
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:38,710
of areas.
Bears will want to defend these 20s

5660
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:38,720
Bears will want to defend these 20s
 

5661
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:40,630
Bears will want to defend these 20s
here. And if they can't do that, they're

5662
02:39:40,630 --> 02:39:40,640
here. And if they can't do that, they're
 

5663
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:46,230
here. And if they can't do that, they're
going to be in trouble.

5664
02:39:46,230 --> 02:39:46,240

 

5665
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:47,670

And we're just going to be in an IB

5666
02:39:47,670 --> 02:39:47,680
And we're just going to be in an IB
 

5667
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:49,349
And we're just going to be in an IB
rotation, aren't we? We've failed IB

5668
02:39:49,349 --> 02:39:49,359
rotation, aren't we? We've failed IB
 

5669
02:39:49,359 --> 02:39:51,270
rotation, aren't we? We've failed IB
high, failed IB low so far. That's all

5670
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:51,280
high, failed IB low so far. That's all
 

5671
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:56,150
high, failed IB low so far. That's all
we've done. Failed both sides.

5672
02:39:56,150 --> 02:39:56,160

 

5673
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,990

Pretty lame.

5674
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,000
Pretty lame.
 

5675
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,670
Pretty lame.
What does that remind me of? Oh, every

5676
02:39:59,670 --> 02:39:59,680
What does that remind me of? Oh, every
 

5677
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:02,550
What does that remind me of? Oh, every
day this week.

5678
02:40:02,550 --> 02:40:02,560
day this week.
 

5679
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,790
day this week.
Every day this week.

5680
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:04,800
Every day this week.
 

5681
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:06,309
Every day this week.
Set the high and low early of the day

5682
02:40:06,309 --> 02:40:06,319
Set the high and low early of the day
 

5683
02:40:06,319 --> 02:40:09,750
Set the high and low early of the day
and then just grind it all back.

5684
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:09,760
and then just grind it all back.
 

5685
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:12,790
and then just grind it all back.
Right.

5686
02:40:12,790 --> 02:40:12,800

 

5687
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:14,469

Almost at that 20 test. Have we done it

5688
02:40:14,469 --> 02:40:14,479
Almost at that 20 test. Have we done it
 

5689
02:40:14,479 --> 02:40:17,030
Almost at that 20 test. Have we done it
yet? There or thereabouts.

5690
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:17,040
yet? There or thereabouts.
 

5691
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:18,710
yet? There or thereabouts.
Right. And this is the level. They're

5692
02:40:18,710 --> 02:40:18,720
Right. And this is the level. They're
 

5693
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:19,910
Right. And this is the level. They're
going to have to defend this bears.

5694
02:40:19,910 --> 02:40:19,920
going to have to defend this bears.
 

5695
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:21,190
going to have to defend this bears.
Otherwise, we're going to start chomping

5696
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:21,200
Otherwise, we're going to start chomping
 

5697
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:27,590
Otherwise, we're going to start chomping
through up to 40s.

5698
02:40:27,590 --> 02:40:27,600

 

5699
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:29,990

Now or never for you bears. If you don't

5700
02:40:29,990 --> 02:40:30,000
Now or never for you bears. If you don't
 

5701
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,750
Now or never for you bears. If you don't
see this uh trade lower now, you're

5702
02:40:31,750 --> 02:40:31,760
see this uh trade lower now, you're
 

5703
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:38,950
see this uh trade lower now, you're
going to be caught in a squeeze. I think

5704
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:38,960

 

5705
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:40,870

so there's the trade through the 20s. So

5706
02:40:40,870 --> 02:40:40,880
so there's the trade through the 20s. So
 

5707
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:42,950
so there's the trade through the 20s. So
bear's not doing a very good job. So now

5708
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:42,960
bear's not doing a very good job. So now
 

5709
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:44,710
bear's not doing a very good job. So now
bulls will want to take it up to VWAP

5710
02:40:44,710 --> 02:40:44,720
bulls will want to take it up to VWAP
 

5711
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:48,070
bulls will want to take it up to VWAP
and then up to 55 if they can.

5712
02:40:48,070 --> 02:40:48,080
and then up to 55 if they can.
 

5713
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:52,230
and then up to 55 if they can.
Bank keeps pinging off here.

5714
02:40:52,230 --> 02:40:52,240

 

5715
02:40:52,240 --> 02:41:02,469

Big strong buying delta coming in here.

5716
02:41:02,469 --> 02:41:02,479

 

5717
02:41:02,479 --> 02:41:05,990

Oh, it's the same market again.

5718
02:41:05,990 --> 02:41:06,000
Oh, it's the same market again.
 

5719

No follow through. Just going to stay
 

5721
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,550
No follow through. Just going to stay
inside balance all day. It's just a

5722
02:41:10,550 --> 02:41:10,560
inside balance all day. It's just a
 

5723
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:23,590
inside balance all day. It's just a
balance range market.

5724
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:23,600

 

5725
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:25,349

I see some news hitting the wire here.

5738
02:41:50,230 --> 02:41:50,240
the window now that he's talking.
 

5739
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:51,510
the window now that he's talking.
Who knows what he's going to say?

5740
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:51,520
Who knows what he's going to say?
 

5741
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:53,030
Who knows what he's going to say?
Probably cancel all tariffs and you're

5742
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,040
Probably cancel all tariffs and you're
 

5743
02:41:53,040 --> 02:42:04,230
Probably cancel all tariffs and you're
back to highs in no time.

5744
02:42:04,230 --> 02:42:04,240

 

5745
02:42:04,240 --> 02:42:05,750

So there's your VWAP. So they didn't

5746
02:42:05,750 --> 02:42:05,760
So there's your VWAP. So they didn't
 

5747
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:07,270
So there's your VWAP. So they didn't
defend 20s like we talked about. Then

5748
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:07,280
defend 20s like we talked about. Then
 

5749
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:08,309
defend 20s like we talked about. Then
you're going to get to VW up. There's

5750
02:42:08,309 --> 02:42:08,319
you're going to get to VW up. There's
 

5751
02:42:08,319 --> 02:42:10,469
you're going to get to VW up. There's
your VWAP.

5752
02:42:10,469 --> 02:42:10,479
your VWAP.
 

5753
02:42:10,479 --> 02:42:12,950
your VWAP.
Last chance saloon. Uh and if bears

5754
02:42:12,950 --> 02:42:12,960
Last chance saloon. Uh and if bears
 

5755
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:14,710
Last chance saloon. Uh and if bears
can't defend this, then probably up to

5756
02:42:14,710 --> 02:42:14,720
can't defend this, then probably up to
 

5757
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:17,030
can't defend this, then probably up to
these this next block here. And if they

5758
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:17,040
these this next block here. And if they
 

5759
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,550
these this next block here. And if they
get through that and the rotation's all

5760
02:42:18,550 --> 02:42:18,560
get through that and the rotation's all
 

5761
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:20,389
get through that and the rotation's all
the way up to these 820s. All right. So

5762
02:42:20,389 --> 02:42:20,399
the way up to these 820s. All right. So
 

5763
02:42:20,399 --> 02:42:28,790
the way up to these 820s. All right. So
that's what you're looking at right now.

5764
02:42:28,790 --> 02:42:28,800

 

5765
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:32,230

And did Spy get under 85? No. What did
 

5767
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:35,830
And did Spy get under 85? No. What did
we trade down to on spy? 85.

5768
02:42:35,830 --> 02:42:35,840
we trade down to on spy? 85.
 

5769
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:38,790
we trade down to on spy? 85.
Literally traded down to 85. The gamma

5770
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:38,800
Literally traded down to 85. The gamma
 

5771
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:40,469
Literally traded down to 85. The gamma
level.

5772
02:42:40,469 --> 02:42:40,479
level.
 

5773
02:42:40,479 --> 02:42:42,950
level.
You know what I'm going to say? Should I

5774
02:42:42,950 --> 02:42:42,960
You know what I'm going to say? Should I
 

5775

You know what I'm going to say? Should I
send my accounts? Should I put my

02:43:21,349 --> 02:43:21,359

 

5793
02:43:21,359 --> 02:43:25,270

Guess who's in control of the market?

5794
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:25,280
Guess who's in control of the market?
 

5795
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:30,309
Guess who's in control of the market?
It's the options dealers.

5796
02:43:30,309 --> 02:43:30,319

 

5797
02:43:30,319 --> 02:43:31,670

[\h__\h] couldn't have made it any

5798
02:43:31,670 --> 02:43:31,680
[\h__\h] couldn't have made it any
 

5799
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:33,670
[\h__\h] couldn't have made it any
clearer.

5800
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:33,680
clearer.
 

5801
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,429
clearer.
This is why I'm not trading because the

5802
02:43:35,429 --> 02:43:35,439
This is why I'm not trading because the
 

5803
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:37,670
This is why I'm not trading because the
option dealers are controlling the whole

5804
02:43:37,670 --> 02:43:37,680
option dealers are controlling the whole
 

5805
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:41,110
option dealers are controlling the whole
market right now. Mad. I can't remember

5806
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,120
market right now. Mad. I can't remember
 

5807
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:44,309
market right now. Mad. I can't remember
a time where it was like this where it

5808
02:43:44,309 --> 02:43:44,319
a time where it was like this where it
 

5809
02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:46,389
a time where it was like this where it
was this. It was about just these levels

5810
02:43:46,389 --> 02:43:46,399
was this. It was about just these levels
 

5811
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:48,550
was this. It was about just these levels
and these levels only. I cannot remember

5812
02:43:48,550 --> 02:43:48,560
and these levels only. I cannot remember
 

5813
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:50,309
and these levels only. I cannot remember
that time. But that's what we've had

5814
02:43:50,309 --> 02:43:50,319
that time. But that's what we've had
 

5815
02:43:50,319 --> 02:43:55,269
that time. But that's what we've had
this week. 680 682 685 is just all we've

5816
02:43:55,269 --> 02:43:55,279
this week. 680 682 685 is just all we've
 

5817
02:43:55,279 --> 02:43:57,269
this week. 680 682 685 is just all we've
had.

5818
02:43:57,269 --> 02:43:57,279
had.
 

5819
02:43:57,279 --> 02:43:59,510
had.
Like I said, every single flush down, it

5820
02:43:59,510 --> 02:43:59,520
Like I said, every single flush down, it
 

5821
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:03,910
Like I said, every single flush down, it
just gets gobbled up at the moment.

5822
02:44:03,910 --> 02:44:03,920

 

5823
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:06,710

So, rotation IB to VWAP, bears have lost

5824
02:44:06,710 --> 02:44:06,720
So, rotation IB to VWAP, bears have lost
 

5825
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:08,230
So, rotation IB to VWAP, bears have lost
all control right now. And if we get

5826
02:44:08,230 --> 02:44:08,240
all control right now. And if we get
 

5827
02:44:08,240 --> 02:44:10,070
all control right now. And if we get
above this red box, there is a giant

5828
02:44:10,070 --> 02:44:10,080
above this red box, there is a giant
 

5829
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:13,030
above this red box, there is a giant
squeeze possible. And you have Trump

5830
02:44:13,030 --> 02:44:13,040
squeeze possible. And you have Trump
 

5831
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:14,630
squeeze possible. And you have Trump
talking and you're into lunch. So, just

5832
02:44:14,630 --> 02:44:14,640
talking and you're into lunch. So, just
 

5833
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:21,590
talking and you're into lunch. So, just
be aware.

5834
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:21,600

 

5835
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:24,870

If he's saying anything of interest,

5836
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:24,880
If he's saying anything of interest,
 

5837
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:26,950
If he's saying anything of interest,
we have meetings set up. After the

5838
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:26,960
we have meetings set up. After the
 

5839
02:44:26,960 --> 02:44:28,469
we have meetings set up. After the
event, we will discuss trade. So there

5840
02:44:28,469 --> 02:44:28,479
event, we will discuss trade. So there
 

5841
02:44:28,479 --> 02:44:29,990
event, we will discuss trade. So there
you go. Trump saying he's going to

5842
02:44:29,990 --> 02:44:30,000
you go. Trump saying he's going to
 

5843
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,590
you go. Trump saying he's going to
discuss trade with Canada and Mexico.

5844
02:44:31,590 --> 02:44:31,600
discuss trade with Canada and Mexico.
 

5845
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:33,269
discuss trade with Canada and Mexico.
That will include tariffs. So there you

5846
02:44:33,269 --> 02:44:33,279
That will include tariffs. So there you
 

5847
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:45,110
That will include tariffs. So there you
go.

5848
02:44:45,110 --> 02:44:45,120

 

5849
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:46,309

Getting there, John. Yeah, getting

5850
02:44:46,309 --> 02:44:46,319
Getting there, John. Yeah, getting
 

5851
02:44:46,319 --> 02:44:47,990
Getting there, John. Yeah, getting
there. I made good impact on it

5852
02:44:47,990 --> 02:44:48,000
there. I made good impact on it
 

5853
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,469
there. I made good impact on it
yesterday. So what I got done on the

5854
02:44:50,469 --> 02:44:50,479
yesterday. So what I got done on the
 

5855
02:44:50,479 --> 02:44:54,230
yesterday. So what I got done on the
course so far?

5856
02:44:54,230 --> 02:44:54,240

 

5857
02:44:54,240 --> 02:44:56,950

So far I've recorded

5858
02:44:56,950 --> 02:44:56,960
So far I've recorded
 

5859
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:59,269
So far I've recorded
auction theory, volume profile, profile

5860
02:44:59,269 --> 02:44:59,279
auction theory, volume profile, profile
 

5861
02:44:59,279 --> 02:45:02,950
auction theory, volume profile, profile
shapings, developing profiles, bookm

5862
02:45:02,950 --> 02:45:02,960
shapings, developing profiles, bookm
 

5863
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:05,269
shapings, developing profiles, bookm
and delta divergences. Uh the next thing

5864
02:45:05,269 --> 02:45:05,279
and delta divergences. Uh the next thing
 

5865
02:45:05,279 --> 02:45:07,349
and delta divergences. Uh the next thing
for me to do is footprint and then to

5866
02:45:07,349 --> 02:45:07,359
for me to do is footprint and then to
 

5867
02:45:07,359 --> 02:45:09,030
for me to do is footprint and then to
put all the setups together for you. So

5868
02:45:09,030 --> 02:45:09,040
put all the setups together for you. So
 

5869
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:15,510
put all the setups together for you. So
there's probably two big modules left.

5870
02:45:15,510 --> 02:45:15,520

 

5871
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:17,190

Can I explain what I mean by when the

5872
02:45:17,190 --> 02:45:17,200
Can I explain what I mean by when the
 

5873
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:18,790
Can I explain what I mean by when the
option traders are in control? Yeah,

5874
02:45:18,790 --> 02:45:18,800
option traders are in control? Yeah,
 

5875
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:20,710
option traders are in control? Yeah,
absolutely. All right. So, if you watch

5876
02:45:20,710 --> 02:45:20,720
absolutely. All right. So, if you watch
 

5877
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:27,190
absolutely. All right. So, if you watch
the options chain,

5878
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:27,200

 

5879
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:30,630

5895
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:51,910
under there. Before that, it was this

5896
02:45:51,910 --> 02:45:51,920
here. It was 82. It was actually the top

put from 82 to 80. Earlier in the week,

5906
02:46:03,429 --> 02:46:03,439
put from 82 to 80. Earlier in the week,

put from 82 to 80. Earlier in the week,
it was 680.

it was 680.
 

5909
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:07,349
it was 680.

did not want price to come under this
 

5913
02:46:08,880 --> 02:46:10,710
did not want price to come under this
because if price comes under this,

5914
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:10,720
because if price comes under this,
 

5915
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:12,550
because if price comes under this,

5931
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:32,150

skeptical on a Friday to think about
doing anything. But

folks. It's like it's why I've lost
 

5949
02:46:58,160 --> 02:47:00,870

interest in the market at the moment. Um

5950
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:00,880
interest in the market at the moment. Um

5956
02:47:06,150 --> 02:47:06,160
options, but I'm having to like at least
 

5957
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:07,510
options, but I'm having to like at least
give it some attention after each

5958
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:07,520
give it some attention after each
 

5959
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:14,230
give it some attention after each
session to see where they're trading.

5960
02:47:14,230 --> 02:47:14,240

 

5961
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:16,950

When might when everything be ready for
 

5969
02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:26,870
When might when everything be ready for
the course? hopefully this side of the

5970
02:47:26,870 --> 02:47:26,880
the course? hopefully this side of the
 

5971
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:32,469
the course? hopefully this side of the
year, but I lost two weeks to co so

5972
02:47:32,469 --> 02:47:32,479

 

5973

5990
02:48:06,870 --> 02:48:06,880

 

5991
02:48:06,880 --> 02:48:09,429

anything which is offering you

5996
02:48:14,790 --> 02:48:14,800
anything which is offering you
 

5997
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:17,030
anything which is offering you
um the key gamma levels, the biggest

5998
02:48:17,030 --> 02:48:17,040
um the key gamma levels, the biggest
 

5999
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:20,309
um the key gamma levels, the biggest
gamma levels traded. So you could use

6000
02:48:20,309 --> 02:48:20,319
gamma levels traded. So you could use
 

6001
02:48:20,319 --> 02:48:23,030
gamma levels traded. So you could use
men for Q, you could use Cheddar Flow,

6002
02:48:23,030 --> 02:48:23,040
men for Q, you could use Cheddar Flow,
 

6003
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:25,670
men for Q, you could use Cheddar Flow,
you could use Tide with Unusual uh

6004
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:25,680
you could use Tide with Unusual uh
 

6005
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:29,429
you could use Tide with Unusual uh
whales, you could use uh is there one

6006
02:48:29,429 --> 02:48:29,439
whales, you could use uh is there one
 

6007
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:30,790
whales, you could use uh is there one
called Wave or something like there's

called Wave or something like there's
 

6009
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:33,110
called Wave or something like there's
there's loads. You could probably even

6010
02:48:33,110 --> 02:48:33,120
there's loads. You could probably even
 

6011
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:35,830
there's loads. You could probably even
use it on on Trading View. Trading View

6012
02:48:35,830 --> 02:48:35,840
use it on on Trading View. Trading View
 

6013
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:37,830
use it on on Trading View. Trading View
has a way of checking out the levels as

6014
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:37,840
has a way of checking out the levels as
 

6015
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:40,550
has a way of checking out the levels as
well, doesn't it? Or

See where it is.
Never look at it on Trading View. Who

02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:23,680
Never look at it on Trading View. Who
 

6031
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:24,950
Never look at it on Trading View. Who
can tell me where it is on Trading View?

6032
02:49:24,950 --> 02:49:24,960

6033
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:33,510
can tell me where it is on Trading View?
I thought it was at the bottom here.

6034

6035
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,110

Some of you use it. I know some of you

6036
02:49:35,110 --> 02:49:35,120
Some of you use it. I know some of you
 

6037
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:36,710
Some of you use it. I know some of you
do.

6038
02:49:36,710 --> 02:49:36,720
do.
 

6039
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:39,830
do.
Do I trade ICT concepts? Not really. I

6040
02:49:39,830 --> 02:49:39,840
Do I trade ICT concepts? Not really. I
 

6041
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:42,150
Do I trade ICT concepts? Not really. I
mean, I pay like I I guess you could say

6042
02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:42,160
mean, I pay like I I guess you could say
 

6043
02:49:42,160 --> 02:49:45,510
mean, I pay like I I guess you could say
I pay attention to

6044
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:45,520
I pay attention to
 

6045
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:47,429
I pay attention to
what you would call S&T and I would call

6046
02:49:47,429 --> 02:49:47,439
what you would call S&T and I would call
 

6047
02:49:47,439 --> 02:49:49,510
what you would call S&T and I would call
divergence. And I guess you could say I

6048
02:49:49,510 --> 02:49:49,520
divergence. And I guess you could say I
 

6049
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:51,990
divergence. And I guess you could say I
pay attention to what you would call

6050
02:49:51,990 --> 02:49:52,000
pay attention to what you would call
 

6051
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,510
pay attention to what you would call
fair value gap and I would call an

6052
02:49:53,510 --> 02:49:53,520
fair value gap and I would call an
 

6053
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:57,190
fair value gap and I would call an
imbalance. But you know, I would

6054
02:49:57,190 --> 02:49:57,200
imbalance. But you know, I would
 

6055
02:49:57,200 --> 02:49:58,950
imbalance. But you know, I would
be paying more attention to that

6056
02:49:58,950 --> 02:49:58,960
be paying more attention to that
 

6057
02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:04,630
be paying more attention to that
imbalance um

6058
02:50:04,630 --> 02:50:04,640

 

6059
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:07,110

by using actual footprint,

6060
02:50:07,110 --> 02:50:07,120
by using actual footprint,
 

6061
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:08,870
by using actual footprint,
right? Because you have a rough area.

6062
02:50:08,870 --> 02:50:08,880
right? Because you have a rough area.
 

6063
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:11,750
right? Because you have a rough area.
I'd be able to see an actual area.

6064
02:50:11,750 --> 02:50:11,760
I'd be able to see an actual area.
 

6065
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,269
I'd be able to see an actual area.
So,

6066
02:50:13,269 --> 02:50:13,279
So,
 

6067
02:50:13,279 --> 02:50:17,510
So,
yes and no. I guess I mean what you call

6068
02:50:17,510 --> 02:50:17,520
yes and no. I guess I mean what you call
 

6069
02:50:17,520 --> 02:50:22,150
yes and no. I guess I mean what you call
a breaker, I would just call an RBS,

6070
02:50:22,150 --> 02:50:22,160
a breaker, I would just call an RBS,
 

6071
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:26,790
a breaker, I would just call an RBS,
you know. I don't know what else to say.

6072
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:26,800
you know. I don't know what else to say.
 

6073
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:29,190
you know. I don't know what else to say.

I don't see it. Maybe I have to.

Are you on the app? I'm on the app. I

don't see it. Screeners calendar. Where

6082
02:50:55,510 --> 02:50:55,520
don't see it. Screeners calendar. Where
 

6083
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:57,269
don't see it. Screeners calendar. Where
is it? next to screen as calendar. Maybe

6084
02:50:57,269 --> 02:50:57,279
is it? next to screen as calendar. Maybe
 

6085
02:50:57,279 --> 02:50:59,910
is it? next to screen as calendar. Maybe
I have to make this bigger.

6086
02:50:59,910 --> 02:50:59,920
I have to make this bigger.
 

6087
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:01,269
I have to make this bigger.
Maybe I have to go to something which

6088
02:51:01,269 --> 02:51:01,279
Maybe I have to go to something which
 

6089
02:51:01,279 --> 02:51:25,269
Maybe I have to go to something which
has an options chain available.

6090
02:51:25,269 --> 02:51:25,279

 

6091
02:51:25,279 --> 02:51:26,870

Let's suppose I had to trade here. Would

6092
02:51:26,870 --> 02:51:26,880
Let's suppose I had to trade here. Would
 

6093
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:35,750
Let's suppose I had to trade here. Would
I buy or sell? Um,

6094
02:51:35,750 --> 02:51:35,760

 

6095
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:38,150

I wouldn't do anything here at VWAP. Do

6096
02:51:38,150 --> 02:51:38,160
I wouldn't do anything here at VWAP. Do
 

6097
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:40,550
I wouldn't do anything here at VWAP. Do
I have to do something here? Okay, let

6098
02:51:40,550 --> 02:51:40,560
I have to do something here? Okay, let
 

6099
02:51:40,560 --> 02:51:47,750
I have to do something here? Okay, let
me have a look.

6100
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:47,760

 

6101
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:50,790

Uh, I'd probably sell.

6102
02:51:50,790 --> 02:51:50,800
Uh, I'd probably sell.
 

6103
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:54,469
Uh, I'd probably sell.
I'd sell. I'll show you why I'd sell.

6104
02:51:54,469 --> 02:51:54,479
I'd sell. I'll show you why I'd sell.
 

6105
02:51:54,479 --> 02:51:55,830
I'd sell. I'll show you why I'd sell.
Because I think you got a passive seller

6106
02:51:55,830 --> 02:51:55,840
Because I think you got a passive seller
 

6107
02:51:55,840 --> 02:52:00,710
Because I think you got a passive seller
on the book. Um, so,

6108
02:52:00,710 --> 02:52:00,720

 

6109
02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:03,349

all right,

6110
02:52:03,349 --> 02:52:03,359
all right,
 

6111
02:52:03,359 --> 02:52:06,230
all right,
we've got aggressive buyers trying to

6112
02:52:06,230 --> 02:52:06,240
we've got aggressive buyers trying to
 

6113
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:08,870
we've got aggressive buyers trying to
break out. And if we pivot to here,

6114
02:52:08,870 --> 02:52:08,880
break out. And if we pivot to here,
 

6115
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,389
break out. And if we pivot to here,
price is not moving higher. I think

6116
02:52:10,389 --> 02:52:10,399
price is not moving higher. I think
 

6117
02:52:10,399 --> 02:52:11,590
price is not moving higher. I think
you've got a passive seller on the

6118
02:52:11,590 --> 02:52:11,600
you've got a passive seller on the
 

6119
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:14,230
you've got a passive seller on the
books. So, I'd sell. There you go. If I

6120
02:52:14,230 --> 02:52:14,240
books. So, I'd sell. There you go. If I
 

6121
02:52:14,240 --> 02:52:17,670
books. So, I'd sell. There you go. If I
had to do something, I would sell

6122
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:17,680
had to do something, I would sell
 

6123
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:18,790
had to do something, I would sell
because I think you've probably got a

6124
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:18,800
because I think you've probably got a
 

6125
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:20,550
because I think you've probably got a
passive seller on the book forcing price

6126
02:52:20,550 --> 02:52:20,560
passive seller on the book forcing price
 

6127
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:28,469
passive seller on the book forcing price
lower at this point.

6128
02:52:28,469 --> 02:52:28,479

 

6129
02:52:28,479 --> 02:52:30,469

Do I think it's a good position to sell

6130
02:52:30,469 --> 02:52:30,479
Do I think it's a good position to sell
 

6131
02:52:30,479 --> 02:52:33,670
Do I think it's a good position to sell
from? No, I don't because structurally

6132
02:52:33,670 --> 02:52:33,680
from? No, I don't because structurally
 

6133
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:38,550
from? No, I don't because structurally
we're starting to go back the other way.

6134
02:52:38,550 --> 02:52:38,560
we're starting to go back the other way.
 

6135
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:41,510
we're starting to go back the other way.
But we just failed VWAP.

6136
02:52:41,510 --> 02:52:41,520
But we just failed VWAP.
 

6137
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:43,910
But we just failed VWAP.
We failed this shelf. There's aggressive

6138
02:52:43,910 --> 02:52:43,920
We failed this shelf. There's aggressive
 

6139
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:46,550
We failed this shelf. There's aggressive
buying and we're failing to move higher.

6140
02:52:46,550 --> 02:52:46,560
buying and we're failing to move higher.
 

6141
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:48,790
buying and we're failing to move higher.
So, if I had to do something, I'd sell

6142
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:48,800
So, if I had to do something, I'd sell
 

6143
02:52:48,800 --> 02:52:50,389
So, if I had to do something, I'd sell
because I think there's a passive seller

6144
02:52:50,389 --> 02:52:50,399
because I think there's a passive seller
 

6145
02:52:50,399 --> 02:52:52,950
because I think there's a passive seller
here. And if that passive seller absorbs

6146
02:52:52,950 --> 02:52:52,960
here. And if that passive seller absorbs
 

6147
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:54,630
here. And if that passive seller absorbs
the whole tape, then everyone who's been

6148
02:52:54,630 --> 02:52:54,640
the whole tape, then everyone who's been
 

6149
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:55,990
the whole tape, then everyone who's been
aggressive buying is going to be forced

6150
02:52:55,990 --> 02:52:56,000
aggressive buying is going to be forced
 

6151
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,550
aggressive buying is going to be forced
to be a seller. And if we take out the

6152
02:52:58,550 --> 02:52:58,560
to be a seller. And if we take out the
 

6153
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:00,870
to be a seller. And if we take out the
low, where are those sellers trapped

6154
02:53:00,870 --> 02:53:00,880
low, where are those sellers trapped
 

6155
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:02,389
low, where are those sellers trapped
from? All right, there's sellers trapped

6156
02:53:02,389 --> 02:53:02,399
from? All right, there's sellers trapped
 

6157
02:53:02,399 --> 02:53:05,269
from? All right, there's sellers trapped
under 58. But if we start taking out

6158
02:53:05,269 --> 02:53:05,279
under 58. But if we start taking out
 

6159
02:53:05,279 --> 02:53:07,349
under 58. But if we start taking out
700s and think there's potential for a

6160
02:53:07,349 --> 02:53:07,359
700s and think there's potential for a
 

6161
02:53:07,359 --> 02:53:09,670
700s and think there's potential for a
move lower, but do I think it's an A+

6162
02:53:09,670 --> 02:53:09,680
move lower, but do I think it's an A+
 

6163
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:11,990
move lower, but do I think it's an A+
trade? No, definitely not. But like if

6164
02:53:11,990 --> 02:53:12,000
trade? No, definitely not. But like if
 

6165
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:13,670
trade? No, definitely not. But like if
you basically saying I have to flip a

6166
02:53:13,670 --> 02:53:13,680
you basically saying I have to flip a
 

6167
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:15,030
you basically saying I have to flip a
coin and make a decision. That's what I

6168
02:53:15,030 --> 02:53:15,040
coin and make a decision. That's what I
 

6169
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:20,630
coin and make a decision. That's what I
do.

6170
02:53:20,630 --> 02:53:20,640

 

6171
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:23,670

Exactly. Troy,

6172
02:53:23,670 --> 02:53:23,680
Exactly. Troy,
 

6173
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:25,830
Exactly. Troy,

02:53:25,830 --> 02:53:25,840
the waffle icon on the lower right TV.
 

6175
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:28,469

Waffle. Circle with dots.

6176
02:53:28,469 --> 02:53:28,479
Waffle. Circle with dots.
 

6177
02:53:28,479 --> 02:53:33,750
Waffle. Circle with dots.
Circle with dots. Circle. Oh yeah.

6178
02:53:33,750 --> 02:53:33,760

 

6179
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:35,190

But then it's not bringing it up when I

6180
02:53:35,190 --> 02:53:35,200
But then it's not bringing it up when I
 

6181
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:49,110
But then it's not bringing it up when I
click it.

6182
02:53:49,110 --> 02:53:49,120

 

6183
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:51,110

What I want is to see the actual

6184
02:53:51,110 --> 02:53:51,120
What I want is to see the actual
 

6185
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:54,389
What I want is to see the actual
exposure levels.

6186
02:53:54,389 --> 02:53:54,399
exposure levels.
 

6187
02:53:54,399 --> 02:53:56,710
exposure levels.
More on option. Won't open that up.

6188
02:53:56,710 --> 02:53:56,720
More on option. Won't open that up.
 

6189
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:58,550
More on option. Won't open that up.
Maybe I need to reset this. Maybe that's

6190
02:53:58,550 --> 02:53:58,560
Maybe I need to reset this. Maybe that's
 

6191
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:04,389
Maybe I need to reset this. Maybe that's
what it is.

6192
02:54:04,389 --> 02:54:04,399

 

6193
02:54:04,399 --> 02:54:08,070

Do I ever use MAC day or RSI? I don't.

6194
02:54:08,070 --> 02:54:08,080
Do I ever use MAC day or RSI? I don't.
 

6195
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:11,030
Do I ever use MAC day or RSI? I don't.
I don't use Matt deal RSI. It you can

6196
02:54:11,030 --> 02:54:11,040
I don't use Matt deal RSI. It you can
 

6197
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:12,790
I don't use Matt deal RSI. It you can
I'm not against using it, but like if

6198
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:12,800
I'm not against using it, but like if
 

6199
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:14,469
I'm not against using it, but like if
you were going to use it, I'd use it on

6200
02:54:14,469 --> 02:54:14,479
you were going to use it, I'd use it on
 

6201
02:54:14,479 --> 02:54:16,230
you were going to use it, I'd use it on
the higher time frames and I'd be

6202
02:54:16,230 --> 02:54:16,240
the higher time frames and I'd be
 

6203
02:54:16,240 --> 02:54:18,950
the higher time frames and I'd be
looking for divergences. So like if you

6204
02:54:18,950 --> 02:54:18,960
looking for divergences. So like if you
 

6205
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:21,750
looking for divergences. So like if you
were going to use like RSI on a higher

6206
02:54:21,750 --> 02:54:21,760
were going to use like RSI on a higher
 

6207
02:54:21,760 --> 02:54:24,230
were going to use like RSI on a higher
time frame and

6208
02:54:24,230 --> 02:54:24,240
time frame and
 

6209
02:54:24,240 --> 02:54:25,750
time frame and
you could you could see a divergence

6210
02:54:25,750 --> 02:54:25,760
you could you could see a divergence
 

6211
02:54:25,760 --> 02:54:27,750
you could you could see a divergence
there. It would be interesting. VIX is

6212
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:27,760
there. It would be interesting. VIX is
 

6213
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:29,910
there. It would be interesting. VIX is
dumping. Not for me. It's just found a

6214
02:54:29,910 --> 02:54:29,920
dumping. Not for me. It's just found a
 

6215
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:31,429
dumping. Not for me. It's just found a
bid. It's just found a bid off the New

6216
02:54:31,429 --> 02:54:31,439
bid. It's just found a bid off the New
 

6217
02:54:31,439 --> 02:54:34,790
bid. It's just found a bid off the New
York open. I I think you're behind. It's

6218
02:54:34,790 --> 02:54:34,800
York open. I I think you're behind. It's
 

6219
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:40,870
York open. I I think you're behind. It's
trading at 1590.

6220
02:54:40,870 --> 02:54:40,880

 

6221
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:45,030

I know, Phenom. I know. I know. But

6222
02:54:45,030 --> 02:54:45,040
I know, Phenom. I know. I know. But
 

6223
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:47,750
I know, Phenom. I know. I know. But
it's easy to say, but when you wake up

6224
02:54:47,750 --> 02:54:47,760
it's easy to say, but when you wake up
 

6225
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:49,990
it's easy to say, but when you wake up
to every day people saying stupid [\h__\h]

6226
02:54:49,990 --> 02:54:50,000
to every day people saying stupid [\h__\h]
 

6227
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:53,429
to every day people saying stupid [\h__\h]
on videos or on Twitter or on your live

6228
02:54:53,429 --> 02:54:53,439
on videos or on Twitter or on your live
 

6229
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:55,670
on videos or on Twitter or on your live
stream, it gets uh it gets pretty

6230
02:54:55,670 --> 02:54:55,680
stream, it gets uh it gets pretty
 

6231
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:57,349
stream, it gets uh it gets pretty
tiring.

6232
02:54:57,349 --> 02:54:57,359
tiring.
 

6233
02:54:57,359 --> 02:55:01,429
tiring.
It gets pretty tiring eventually.

6234
02:55:01,429 --> 02:55:01,439
It gets pretty tiring eventually.
 

6235
02:55:01,439 --> 02:55:03,910
It gets pretty tiring eventually.
If it if it continues, I'll tell you

6236
02:55:03,910 --> 02:55:03,920
If it if it continues, I'll tell you
 

6237
02:55:03,920 --> 02:55:05,269
If it if it continues, I'll tell you
what, if it continues and it starts to

6238
02:55:05,269 --> 02:55:05,279
what, if it continues and it starts to
 

6239
02:55:05,279 --> 02:55:07,349
what, if it continues and it starts to
affect my trading, all that happens is

6240
02:55:07,349 --> 02:55:07,359
affect my trading, all that happens is
 

6241
02:55:07,359 --> 02:55:10,150
affect my trading, all that happens is
that I'll just trade for the guys in the

6242
02:55:10,150 --> 02:55:10,160
that I'll just trade for the guys in the
 

6243
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:13,110
that I'll just trade for the guys in the
community and not anyone else.

6244
02:55:13,110 --> 02:55:13,120
community and not anyone else.
 

6245
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:14,870
community and not anyone else.
Right. So, that's short at the moment.

6246
02:55:14,870 --> 02:55:14,880
Right. So, that's short at the moment.
 

6247
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:25,110
Right. So, that's short at the moment.
Looks okayish.

6248
02:55:25,110 --> 02:55:25,120

 

6249
02:55:25,120 --> 02:55:29,429

Is reverse AMD a thing?

6250
02:55:29,429 --> 02:55:29,439
Is reverse AMD a thing?
 

6251
02:55:29,439 --> 02:55:34,070
Is reverse AMD a thing?
What? Uh, I don't know what you mean.

6252
02:55:34,070 --> 02:55:34,080

 

6253
02:55:34,080 --> 02:56:01,110

What do you mean reverse AMD?

6254
02:56:01,110 --> 02:56:01,120

 

6255
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:03,030

into lunch here, folks. Think I'm going

6256
02:56:03,030 --> 02:56:03,040
into lunch here, folks. Think I'm going
 

6257
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:04,790
into lunch here, folks. Think I'm going
to call it here. No trades for me today.

6258
02:56:04,790 --> 02:56:04,800
to call it here. No trades for me today.
 

6259
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:07,110
to call it here. No trades for me today.
No trade day. It's all right. Is what it

6260
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:07,120
No trade day. It's all right. Is what it
 

6261
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:15,429
No trade day. It's all right. Is what it
is.

6262
02:56:15,429 --> 02:56:15,439

 

6263
02:56:15,439 --> 02:56:17,349

No trades during the stream. We'll see.

6264
02:56:17,349 --> 02:56:17,359
No trades during the stream. We'll see.
 

6265
02:56:17,359 --> 02:56:18,870
No trades during the stream. We'll see.
I don't think I'm going to even touch it

6266
02:56:18,870 --> 02:56:18,880
I don't think I'm going to even touch it
 

6267
02:56:18,880 --> 02:56:20,309
I don't think I'm going to even touch it
later. Come back Monday, see where we

6268
02:56:20,309 --> 02:56:20,319
later. Come back Monday, see where we
 

6269
02:56:20,319 --> 02:56:21,830
later. Come back Monday, see where we
close today. Um, I think there's some

6270
02:56:21,830 --> 02:56:21,840
close today. Um, I think there's some
 

6271
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:23,030
close today. Um, I think there's some
weakness in the market at the moment,

6272
02:56:23,030 --> 02:56:23,040
weakness in the market at the moment,
 

6273
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:24,790
weakness in the market at the moment,
though. Like I said, I think there's

6274
02:56:24,790 --> 02:56:24,800
though. Like I said, I think there's
 

6275
02:56:24,800 --> 02:56:26,070
though. Like I said, I think there's
been aggressive buying here and you

6276
02:56:26,070 --> 02:56:26,080
been aggressive buying here and you
 

6277
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:27,750
been aggressive buying here and you
haven't moved higher. All right. So,

6278
02:56:27,750 --> 02:56:27,760
haven't moved higher. All right. So,
 

6279
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:29,110
haven't moved higher. All right. So,
there was a bit of a squeeze out like we

6280
02:56:29,110 --> 02:56:29,120
there was a bit of a squeeze out like we
 

6281
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:31,190
there was a bit of a squeeze out like we
talked about. If if the shorts lost lost

6282
02:56:31,190 --> 02:56:31,200
talked about. If if the shorts lost lost
 

6283
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:33,110
talked about. If if the shorts lost lost
the 720s,

6284
02:56:33,110 --> 02:56:33,120
the 720s,
 

6285
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:35,750
the 720s,
you'd see this squeeze out, but in this

6286
02:56:35,750 --> 02:56:35,760
you'd see this squeeze out, but in this
 

6287
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:37,349
you'd see this squeeze out, but in this
big buying here, there's a passive

6288
02:56:37,349 --> 02:56:37,359
big buying here, there's a passive
 

6289
02:56:37,359 --> 02:56:38,710
big buying here, there's a passive
seller. So, they tried to move higher

6290
02:56:38,710 --> 02:56:38,720
seller. So, they tried to move higher
 

6291
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:40,070
seller. So, they tried to move higher
and they failed. And they tried again

6292
02:56:40,070 --> 02:56:40,080
and they failed. And they tried again
 

6293
02:56:40,080 --> 02:56:41,590
and they failed. And they tried again
here and they failed. And they're trying

6294
02:56:41,590 --> 02:56:41,600
here and they failed. And they're trying
 

6295
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:44,070
here and they failed. And they're trying
again. Now, you're going to need to see

6296
02:56:44,070 --> 02:56:44,080
again. Now, you're going to need to see
 

6297
02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:45,750
again. Now, you're going to need to see
this market break out. And if they can't

6298
02:56:45,750 --> 02:56:45,760
this market break out. And if they can't
 

6299
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:47,030
this market break out. And if they can't
keep doing that, if you keep seeing

6300
02:56:47,030 --> 02:56:47,040
keep doing that, if you keep seeing
 

6301
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:48,309
keep doing that, if you keep seeing
aggressive buying, which is what I'm

6302
02:56:48,309 --> 02:56:48,319
aggressive buying, which is what I'm
 

6303
02:56:48,319 --> 02:56:49,830
aggressive buying, which is what I'm
seeing, and thus not move higher, it

6304
02:56:49,830 --> 02:56:49,840
seeing, and thus not move higher, it
 

6305
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:51,349
seeing, and thus not move higher, it
means there's a passive seller on this

6306
02:56:51,349 --> 02:56:51,359
means there's a passive seller on this
 

6307
02:56:51,359 --> 02:56:54,150
means there's a passive seller on this
book. And um if that passive seller is

6308
02:56:54,150 --> 02:56:54,160
book. And um if that passive seller is
 

6309
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:55,910
book. And um if that passive seller is
able to hold price down and all these

6310
02:56:55,910 --> 02:56:55,920
able to hold price down and all these
 

6311
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:57,990
able to hold price down and all these
buyers get trapped, right, and you get

6312
02:56:57,990 --> 02:56:58,000
buyers get trapped, right, and you get
 

6313
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:59,990
buyers get trapped, right, and you get
this move under here, I would not rule

6314
02:56:59,990 --> 02:57:00,000
this move under here, I would not rule
 

6315
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,950
this move under here, I would not rule
out this, right? I would not rule out

6316
02:57:02,950 --> 02:57:02,960
out this, right? I would not rule out
 

6317
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:04,630
out this, right? I would not rule out
this for the rest of the day. Now, if we

6318
02:57:04,630 --> 02:57:04,640
this for the rest of the day. Now, if we
 

6319
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:06,389
this for the rest of the day. Now, if we
get above here, yeah, absolutely squeeze

6320
02:57:06,389 --> 02:57:06,399
get above here, yeah, absolutely squeeze
 

6321
02:57:06,399 --> 02:57:08,630
get above here, yeah, absolutely squeeze
back out. This is just not a location

6322
02:57:08,630 --> 02:57:08,640
back out. This is just not a location
 

6323
02:57:08,640 --> 02:57:10,150
back out. This is just not a location
you really want to trade at around point

6324
02:57:10,150 --> 02:57:10,160
you really want to trade at around point
 

6325
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:11,670
you really want to trade at around point
of control, right? This is the most

6326
02:57:11,670 --> 02:57:11,680
of control, right? This is the most
 

6327
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:29,269
of control, right? This is the most
traded level of the day.

6328
02:57:29,269 --> 02:57:29,279

 

6329
02:57:29,279 --> 02:57:30,550

GG, you're looking for a liquidity

6330
02:57:30,550 --> 02:57:30,560
GG, you're looking for a liquidity
 

6331
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:32,230
GG, you're looking for a liquidity
break. Yeah, you you might get it.

6332
02:57:32,230 --> 02:57:32,240
break. Yeah, you you might get it.
 

6333
02:57:32,240 --> 02:57:34,230
break. Yeah, you you might get it.
Again, like just set guys, it's really

6334
02:57:34,230 --> 02:57:34,240
Again, like just set guys, it's really
 

6335
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:36,630
Again, like just set guys, it's really
easy. Set price at 685. If you get

6336
02:57:36,630 --> 02:57:36,640
easy. Set price at 685. If you get
 

6337
02:57:36,640 --> 02:57:39,190
easy. Set price at 685. If you get
continuation on SPY under 685, market

6338
02:57:39,190 --> 02:57:39,200
continuation on SPY under 685, market
 

6339
02:57:39,200 --> 02:57:41,429
continuation on SPY under 685, market
will start to bleed. Yeah. So, that can

6340
02:57:41,429 --> 02:57:41,439
will start to bleed. Yeah. So, that can
 

6341
02:57:41,439 --> 02:57:43,349
will start to bleed. Yeah. So, that can
be like not necessarily a trigger, but

6342
02:57:43,349 --> 02:57:43,359
be like not necessarily a trigger, but
 

6343
02:57:43,359 --> 02:57:45,190
be like not necessarily a trigger, but
it's like that will help with your

6344
02:57:45,190 --> 02:57:45,200
it's like that will help with your
 

6345
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:46,870
it's like that will help with your
sentiment. Like one of you asked me what

6346
02:57:46,870 --> 02:57:46,880
