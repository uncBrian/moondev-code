down this morning as the panic continues

18
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
down this morning as the panic continues
 

19
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,149
down this morning as the panic continues
taking out previous week lows. It's

20
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
taking out previous week lows. It's
 

21
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,750
taking out previous week lows. It's
understand it's important to understand

22
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
understand it's important to understand
 

23
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,030
understand it's important to understand
where we're at on the dailies. All

24
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
where we're at on the dailies. All
 

25
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,670
where we're at on the dailies. All
right, so let's just have a quick look

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
right, so let's just have a quick look
 

27
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,030
right, so let's just have a quick look
at this. Sorry, move this mic. All

28
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
at this. Sorry, move this mic. All
 

29
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,630
at this. Sorry, move this mic. All
right, we talked about yesterday this

30
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
right, we talked about yesterday this
 

31
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,030
right, we talked about yesterday this
yearly profile and how we've been

32
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
yearly profile and how we've been
 

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,789
yearly profile and how we've been
developing and the key being

34
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
developing and the key being
 

35
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,110
developing and the key being
I just lost that already.

36
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120

 

37
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,190

The key being this shelf here. All

38
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
The key being this shelf here. All
 

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,030
The key being this shelf here. All
right, this is where we've built a

40
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
right, this is where we've built a
 

41
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,990
right, this is where we've built a
decent amount of liquidity into uh well

42
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
decent amount of liquidity into uh well
 

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,030
decent amount of liquidity into uh well
down to 247s. Surprise, surprise. All

44
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
down to 247s. Surprise, surprise. All
 

45
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,870
down to 247s. Surprise, surprise. All
right, 247s. The rotation 7s to 25K back

46
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
right, 247s. The rotation 7s to 25K back
 

47
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,390
right, 247s. The rotation 7s to 25K back
and forth, back and forth. Right, we're

48
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
and forth, back and forth. Right, we're
 

49
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,550
and forth, back and forth. Right, we're
back to that level, right? We're back to

50
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
back to that level, right? We're back to
 

51
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,990
back to that level, right? We're back to
247s on this shelf. The key being here's

52
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
247s on this shelf. The key being here's
 

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,950
247s on this shelf. The key being here's
the lower Ballinger band. All right, now

54
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
the lower Ballinger band. All right, now
 

55
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,830
the lower Ballinger band. All right, now
we rarely trade beyond lower Ballinger

56
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
we rarely trade beyond lower Ballinger
 

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,830
we rarely trade beyond lower Ballinger
bands in one go. You can see when we do

58
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
bands in one go. You can see when we do
 

59
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,710
bands in one go. You can see when we do
rotations like this, 20-day, lower bowl,

60
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
rotations like this, 20-day, lower bowl,
 

61
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,670
rotations like this, 20-day, lower bowl,
20-day, lower bowl, rally. All right,

62
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
20-day, lower bowl, rally. All right,
 

63
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,670
20-day, lower bowl, rally. All right,
upper bowl, 20-day, lower bowl, 20-day,

64
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
upper bowl, 20-day, lower bowl, 20-day,
 

65
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,629
upper bowl, 20-day, lower bowl, 20-day,
lower bowl. It is possible to trade

66
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
lower bowl. It is possible to trade
 

67
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,310
lower bowl. It is possible to trade
outside of it. All right, if absolute

68
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
outside of it. All right, if absolute
 

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,390
outside of it. All right, if absolute
panic happens, we can have big black

70
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
panic happens, we can have big black
 

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,070
panic happens, we can have big black
swan event. I'm not saying we go down

72
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
swan event. I'm not saying we go down
 

73
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,110
swan event. I'm not saying we go down
that far, but you can see capitulation

74
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
that far, but you can see capitulation
 

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,430
that far, but you can see capitulation
underneath it. There are some levels

76
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
underneath it. There are some levels
 

77
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,270
underneath it. There are some levels
here which we can come and test. We've

78
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
here which we can come and test. We've
 

79
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,749
here which we can come and test. We've
got these equal lows here, 24,420,

80
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
got these equal lows here, 24,420,
 

81
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,270
got these equal lows here, 24,420,
right? lots of stops will be in and

82
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
right? lots of stops will be in and
 

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,710
right? lots of stops will be in and
around there. We have some old point of

84
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
around there. We have some old point of
 

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,710
around there. We have some old point of
controls and value areas in here. So,

86
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
controls and value areas in here. So,
 

87
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,950
controls and value areas in here. So,
I'm not saying we don't drift lower.

88
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm not saying we don't drift lower.
 

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,749
I'm not saying we don't drift lower.
What I'm saying is your location for a

90
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
What I'm saying is your location for a
 

91
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,790
What I'm saying is your location for a
new short down here is far from ideal.

92
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
new short down here is far from ideal.
 

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,710
new short down here is far from ideal.
Is it is far from ideal. Think about the

94
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
Is it is far from ideal. Think about the
 

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,550
Is it is far from ideal. Think about the
last few days we've been trying to short

96
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
last few days we've been trying to short
 

97
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,350
last few days we've been trying to short
up here. Right? This is a long way down.

98
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
up here. Right? This is a long way down.
 

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,950
up here. Right? This is a long way down.
You're almost 1,000 points lower than

100
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
You're almost 1,000 points lower than
 

101
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,189
You're almost 1,000 points lower than
where we were entering before. So, be

102
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
where we were entering before. So, be
 

103
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,070
where we were entering before. So, be
aware of that. If we get continuation

104
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
aware of that. If we get continuation
 

105
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,749
aware of that. If we get continuation
over the next few weeks, right, if we're

106
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
over the next few weeks, right, if we're
 

107
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,830
over the next few weeks, right, if we're
going to go into the capitulation, then

108
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
going to go into the capitulation, then
 

109
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,350
going to go into the capitulation, then
we are going to get this sharp turn on

110
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
we are going to get this sharp turn on
 

111
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,270
we are going to get this sharp turn on
the Ballinger. You can see if we zoom

112
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
the Ballinger. You can see if we zoom
 

113
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,070
the Ballinger. You can see if we zoom
in, it has already already started,

114
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
in, it has already already started,
 

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,990
in, it has already already started,
right? It has already started to turn.

116
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
right? It has already started to turn.
 

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,270
right? It has already started to turn.
You're going to get this and you're

118
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
You're going to get this and you're
 

119
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,270
You're going to get this and you're
going to get one of these to follow.

120
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
going to get one of these to follow.
 

121
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,950
going to get one of these to follow.
What will the target be? Well, if we go

122
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
What will the target be? Well, if we go
 

123
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,029
What will the target be? Well, if we go
really really heavy. All right, this

124
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
really really heavy. All right, this
 

125
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,310
really really heavy. All right, this
node, this has not been tested. This is

126
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,320
node, this has not been tested. This is
 

127
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,710
node, this has not been tested. This is
your 200. All right, very rare that we

128
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
your 200. All right, very rare that we
 

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,629
your 200. All right, very rare that we
don't test this in a low volume node

130
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
don't test this in a low volume node
 

131
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,469
don't test this in a low volume node
area. This will keep trending up. So,

132
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
area. This will keep trending up. So,
 

133
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,029
area. This will keep trending up. So,
I'm interested that whether it's into

134
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
I'm interested that whether it's into
 

135
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,270
I'm interested that whether it's into
the end of Q4 or beginning of next year,

136
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
the end of Q4 or beginning of next year,
 

137
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,189
the end of Q4 or beginning of next year,
if we do sell, those are areas I'm

138
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
if we do sell, those are areas I'm
 

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,350
if we do sell, those are areas I'm
watching. Right now, we're just looking

140
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
watching. Right now, we're just looking
 

141
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,270
watching. Right now, we're just looking
for inchday plays. This is not a great

142
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
for inchday plays. This is not a great
 

143
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,270
for inchday plays. This is not a great
location. A back test would be better.

144
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
location. A back test would be better.
 

145
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,510
location. A back test would be better.
If we get capitulation at the open, then

146
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
If we get capitulation at the open, then
 

147
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,510
If we get capitulation at the open, then
maybe we can follow the tape, but it's

148
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
maybe we can follow the tape, but it's
 

149
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,870
maybe we can follow the tape, but it's
uh far from ideal to be taking new short

150
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
uh far from ideal to be taking new short
 

151
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,870
uh far from ideal to be taking new short
positions down here. If we move to the

152
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
positions down here. If we move to the
 

153
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,590
positions down here. If we move to the
hourlys,

154
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600

 

155
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,350

you'll see what I'm talking about. All

156
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
you'll see what I'm talking about. All
 

157
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,350
you'll see what I'm talking about. All
right, this is previous week low. This

158
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
right, this is previous week low. This
 

159
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,830
right, this is previous week low. This
was the capitulation low last Friday.

160
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
was the capitulation low last Friday.
 

161
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,990
was the capitulation low last Friday.
Remember last Friday, we came down here

162
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
Remember last Friday, we came down here
 

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,909
Remember last Friday, we came down here
and then rallied off it into close and

164
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
and then rallied off it into close and
 

165
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,189
and then rallied off it into close and
then gapped up. We are now below this.

166
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
then gapped up. We are now below this.
 

167
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,790
then gapped up. We are now below this.
This becomes a big level, which is why

168
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
This becomes a big level, which is why
 

169
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,870
This becomes a big level, which is why
I've marked it out as red. And really,

170
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
I've marked it out as red. And really,
 

171
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,110
I've marked it out as red. And really,
I'd argue up into here into this old

172
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
I'd argue up into here into this old
 

173
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,629
I'd argue up into here into this old
value. So, in fact, let's

174
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
value. So, in fact, let's
 

175
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,670
value. So, in fact, let's
do one of these here. All right, this

176
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
do one of these here. All right, this
 

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,589
do one of these here. All right, this
matters. This bump from last Friday

178
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
matters. This bump from last Friday
 

179
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,749
matters. This bump from last Friday
matters. If we don't fail Friday's low,

180
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
matters. If we don't fail Friday's low,
 

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,029
matters. If we don't fail Friday's low,
we've already wicked underneath it.

182
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
we've already wicked underneath it.
 

183
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,029
we've already wicked underneath it.
We've taken that liquidity. How we act

184
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
We've taken that liquidity. How we act
 

185
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,350
We've taken that liquidity. How we act
into this bump here where we built out

186
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
into this bump here where we built out
 

187
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,749
into this bump here where we built out
liquidity will matter. All right,

188
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
liquidity will matter. All right,
 

189
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,990
liquidity will matter. All right,
because that was a big V-shaped

190
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
because that was a big V-shaped
 

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,150
because that was a big V-shaped
recovery. Can we sort of reject that old

192
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
recovery. Can we sort of reject that old
 

193
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,950
recovery. Can we sort of reject that old
point of control?

194
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
point of control?
 

195
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,749
point of control?
Can we reject that old point of control

196
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
Can we reject that old point of control
 

197
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,629
Can we reject that old point of control
from last Friday? If not, where is the

198
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
from last Friday? If not, where is the
 

199
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,230
from last Friday? If not, where is the
better location here? All right, but

200
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
better location here? All right, but
 

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,230
better location here? All right, but
think about what we had yesterday. Nice

202
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
think about what we had yesterday. Nice
 

203
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,309
think about what we had yesterday. Nice
B-shaped profile,

204
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
B-shaped profile,
 

205
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,870
B-shaped profile,
right? Beautiful B-shaped profile.

206
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
right? Beautiful B-shaped profile.
 

207
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,870
right? Beautiful B-shaped profile.
Really, we'd love to reject off the

208
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
Really, we'd love to reject off the
 

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,230
Really, we'd love to reject off the
lower end of that profile. That is the

210
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
lower end of that profile. That is the
 

211
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,550
lower end of that profile. That is the
most ideal play we will get today. All

212
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
most ideal play we will get today. All
 

213
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,870
most ideal play we will get today. All
right, would be a short squeeze up to

214
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:46,880
right, would be a short squeeze up to
 

215
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,830
right, would be a short squeeze up to
here and a rejection off that Bshape. If

216
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
here and a rejection off that Bshape. If
 

217
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,909
here and a rejection off that Bshape. If
we recover previous day value area low

218
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
we recover previous day value area low
 

219
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,150
we recover previous day value area low
and previous day uh previous week value

220
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
and previous day uh previous week value
 

221
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,469
and previous day uh previous week value
area low then it's potential that they

222
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
area low then it's potential that they
 

223
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,710
area low then it's potential that they
do one of these. We can't rule it out

224
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
do one of these. We can't rule it out
 

225
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,070
do one of these. We can't rule it out
guys. All right we can't rule it out.

226
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
guys. All right we can't rule it out.
 

227
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,230
guys. All right we can't rule it out.
It's a big move down.

228
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
It's a big move down.
 

229
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,550
It's a big move down.
Could even easily have a two leg back up

230
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
Could even easily have a two leg back up
 

231
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,990
Could even easily have a two leg back up
and that can happen over multiple

232
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
and that can happen over multiple
 

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,150
and that can happen over multiple
sessions. I would like to play

234
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
sessions. I would like to play
 

235
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,830
sessions. I would like to play
continuation short. I just don't want to

236
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
continuation short. I just don't want to
 

237
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,589
continuation short. I just don't want to
get short down here. All right. The only

238
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
get short down here. All right. The only
 

239
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,710
get short down here. All right. The only
way I'm going to play short down there

240
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
way I'm going to play short down there
 

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,469
way I'm going to play short down there
is if I see something on the tape that I

242
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
is if I see something on the tape that I
 

243
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,830
is if I see something on the tape that I
can join and it's very obvious and I

244
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
can join and it's very obvious and I
 

245
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,869
can join and it's very obvious and I
think yeah, I can I can have a decent RR

246
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
think yeah, I can I can have a decent RR
 

247
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,070
think yeah, I can I can have a decent RR
there. At the moment, I'm not seeing

248
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
there. At the moment, I'm not seeing
 

249
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,029
there. At the moment, I'm not seeing
that. So, either this is going to

250
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
that. So, either this is going to
 

251
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,990
that. So, either this is going to
happen, a rejection of previous uh

252
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
happen, a rejection of previous uh
 

253
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,869
happen, a rejection of previous uh
week's value down here,

254
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
week's value down here,
 

255
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,870
week's value down here,
right? A drift into there, or

256
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
right? A drift into there, or
 

257
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,509
right? A drift into there, or
the push up into previous days value

258
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
the push up into previous days value
 

259
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,430
the push up into previous days value
area low and a rejection of that. All

260
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
area low and a rejection of that. All
 

261
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,110
area low and a rejection of that. All
right, that would be more ideal. That

262
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
right, that would be more ideal. That
 

263
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,630
right, that would be more ideal. That
would be sort of your GlobeEx level and

264
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
would be sort of your GlobeEx level and
 

265
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,709
would be sort of your GlobeEx level and
stuff. Somewhere into here would be

266
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
stuff. Somewhere into here would be
 

267
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,790
stuff. Somewhere into here would be
absolutely ideal if it will offer it.

268
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
absolutely ideal if it will offer it.
 

269
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,910
absolutely ideal if it will offer it.
All right, I'm not going to play the

270
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
All right, I'm not going to play the
 

271
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,269
All right, I'm not going to play the
longs today. You might be like, you're

272
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
longs today. You might be like, you're
 

273
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,150
longs today. You might be like, you're
mad. I'm not playing counter trend longs

274
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
mad. I'm not playing counter trend longs
 

275
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,550
mad. I'm not playing counter trend longs
um off this heavy momentum because I

276
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
um off this heavy momentum because I
 

277
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,230
um off this heavy momentum because I
don't know that you don't just see that

278
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
don't know that you don't just see that
 

279
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,070
don't know that you don't just see that
and a complete capitulation. You just

280
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
and a complete capitulation. You just
 

281
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,509
and a complete capitulation. You just
don't know what these funds are going to

282
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
don't know what these funds are going to
 

283
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,470
don't know what these funds are going to
do. Targets to downside all the way down

284
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
do. Targets to downside all the way down
 

285
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,230
do. Targets to downside all the way down
here. Double bottom. We are coming into

286
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
here. Double bottom. We are coming into
 

287
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,630
here. Double bottom. We are coming into
this old value area low. You can see

288
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
this old value area low. You can see
 

289
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,190
this old value area low. You can see
this is the congested area. Go back to

290
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
this is the congested area. Go back to
 

291
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,550
this is the congested area. Go back to
like a month ago when we were talking

292
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
like a month ago when we were talking
 

293
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,910
like a month ago when we were talking
about the 20 25,000 to 700 rotation.

294
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
about the 20 25,000 to 700 rotation.
 

295
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,389
about the 20 25,000 to 700 rotation.
Here's your 700s. Here's your 700s.

296
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
Here's your 700s. Here's your 700s.
 

297
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,550
Here's your 700s. Here's your 700s.
Here's just under 700. 700 700 700

298
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
Here's just under 700. 700 700 700
 

299
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,670
Here's just under 700. 700 700 700
255,000. All right, this was a heavily

300
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
255,000. All right, this was a heavily
 

301
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,710
255,000. All right, this was a heavily
fought over level for 2 weeks. For two

302
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
fought over level for 2 weeks. For two
 

303
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,030
fought over level for 2 weeks. For two
weeks, we battled in here. All right, so

304
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
weeks, we battled in here. All right, so
 

305
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,949
weeks, we battled in here. All right, so
just be aware of that. If they want to

306
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
just be aware of that. If they want to
 

307
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,389
just be aware of that. If they want to
hold, you can see we've come right into

308
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
hold, you can see we've come right into
 

309
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,550
hold, you can see we've come right into
this value low right underneath this

310
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
this value low right underneath this
 

311
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,350
this value low right underneath this
trying to trade inside. These areas here

312
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
trying to trade inside. These areas here
 

313
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,750
trying to trade inside. These areas here
hold significance. Okay, I don't think

314
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
hold significance. Okay, I don't think
 

315
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,590
hold significance. Okay, I don't think
there's any which are untested. There's

316
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
there's any which are untested. There's
 

317
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,310
there's any which are untested. There's
no naked PC's down here. Everything's

318
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
no naked PC's down here. Everything's
 

319
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,910
no naked PC's down here. Everything's
been tested. So really if we're going to

320
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
been tested. So really if we're going to
 

321
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,829
been tested. So really if we're going to
liquidate I am looking for all the way

322
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
liquidate I am looking for all the way
 

323
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,550
liquidate I am looking for all the way
down here 24400 that would be more

324
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
down here 24400 that would be more
 

325
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,310
down here 24400 that would be more
more of a black swan more of something

326
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
more of a black swan more of something
 

327
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,990
more of a black swan more of something
where we go outside of the Ballinger.

328
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
where we go outside of the Ballinger.
 

329
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,389
where we go outside of the Ballinger.
It's very unusual but the tape has been

330
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
It's very unusual but the tape has been
 

331
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,550
It's very unusual but the tape has been
heavy. I'm not going to argue with that

332
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
heavy. I'm not going to argue with that
 

333
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,389
heavy. I'm not going to argue with that
and I'm not going to fight it. So let's

334
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
and I'm not going to fight it. So let's
 

335
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,150
and I'm not going to fight it. So let's
just see what we get. Looking at

336
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
just see what we get. Looking at
 

337
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,949
just see what we get. Looking at
overnight you can see right big B-shaped

338
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
overnight you can see right big B-shaped
 

339
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,790
overnight you can see right big B-shaped
profile like we talked about yesterday.

340
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
profile like we talked about yesterday.
 

341
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,110
profile like we talked about yesterday.
Beautiful.

342
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
Beautiful.
 

343
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,949
Beautiful.

London came in and said, "What has gone

348
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
London came in and said, "What has gone
 

349
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,910
London came in and said, "What has gone
on there yesterday? Let's sell this

350
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
on there yesterday? Let's sell this
 

351
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,509
on there yesterday? Let's sell this
versus previous day value." And we're in

352
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
versus previous day value." And we're in
 

353
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,269
versus previous day value." And we're in
a drift lower. All right. So, here are

354
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
a drift lower. All right. So, here are
 

355
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,310
a drift lower. All right. So, here are
your levels. They're marked out for you.

356
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
your levels. They're marked out for you.
 

357
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,470
your levels. They're marked out for you.
Let's move up

358
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
Let's move up
 

359
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,030
Let's move up
into 5m minute. We can check uh

360
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
into 5m minute. We can check uh
 

361
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,030
into 5m minute. We can check uh
Yes. So, basically, guys, we should also

362
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
Yes. So, basically, guys, we should also
 

363
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,949
Yes. So, basically, guys, we should also
mention, let's get out of this a second.

364
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
mention, let's get out of this a second.
 

365
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,870
mention, let's get out of this a second.
Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. If

366
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. If
 

367
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,110
Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. If
we do build liquidity here down here,

368
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120

 

369
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,190

all right, that is to go lower. Just so

370
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
all right, that is to go lower. Just so
 

371
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,630
all right, that is to go lower. Just so
that you understand why I'd like to see

372
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
that you understand why I'd like to see
 

373
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,110
that you understand why I'd like to see
a back test to move lower. All right,

374
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
a back test to move lower. All right,
 

375
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,590
a back test to move lower. All right,
very very simple

376
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
very very simple
 

377
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,790
very very simple
inverse cup and handle. Okay,

378
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
inverse cup and handle. Okay,
 

379
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,509
inverse cup and handle. Okay,
let's get to the ES. Looking exactly

380
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
let's get to the ES. Looking exactly
 

381
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,110
let's get to the ES. Looking exactly
same. Okay, bouncing off a key level

382
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
same. Okay, bouncing off a key level
 

383
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,910
same. Okay, bouncing off a key level
which I had marked. Okay, same kind of

384
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
which I had marked. Okay, same kind of
 

385
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,190
which I had marked. Okay, same kind of
thing. Friday low. So, it's got room. ES

386
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
thing. Friday low. So, it's got room. ES
 

387
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,870
thing. Friday low. So, it's got room. ES
has got room to take this liquidity at

388
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
has got room to take this liquidity at
 

389
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,949
has got room to take this liquidity at
655. All right, so that's what it' be

390
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
655. All right, so that's what it' be
 

391
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,550
655. All right, so that's what it' be
watching for. If you get a push and

392
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
watching for. If you get a push and
 

393
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,670
watching for. If you get a push and
fail, 655 is your target. Spiders,

394
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680

 

395
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,910

same thing. It's got room. Very, very

396
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
same thing. It's got room. Very, very
 

397
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,430
same thing. It's got room. Very, very
heavy. This is a block where we found a

398
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
heavy. This is a block where we found a
 

399
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,430
heavy. This is a block where we found a
bid on Friday. All right, very simple.

400
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
bid on Friday. All right, very simple.
 

401
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,430
bid on Friday. All right, very simple.
We bid off this on Friday. We're

402
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
We bid off this on Friday. We're
 

403
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,550
We bid off this on Friday. We're
bouncing off IB low from a week ago on

404
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
bouncing off IB low from a week ago on
 

405
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,069
bouncing off IB low from a week ago on
Friday. At the moment, you can see it's

406
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
Friday. At the moment, you can see it's
 

407
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,790
Friday. At the moment, you can see it's
got a reaction from the IB low. If they

408
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
got a reaction from the IB low. If they
 

409
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,310
got a reaction from the IB low. If they
fail, if they push and fail, they're

410
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
fail, if they push and fail, they're
 

411
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,829
fail, if they push and fail, they're
going to come back for these lows. We

412
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
going to come back for these lows. We
 

413
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,910
going to come back for these lows. We
can watch that. Watch that carefully

414
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
can watch that. Watch that carefully
 

415
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,509
can watch that. Watch that carefully
because what we do after that becomes

416
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
because what we do after that becomes
 

417
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,350
because what we do after that becomes
important. Do we have follow through or

418
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
important. Do we have follow through or
 

419
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,030
important. Do we have follow through or
is that liquidity grab and the end of

420
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
is that liquidity grab and the end of
 

421
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,269
is that liquidity grab and the end of
this and you know we need to go sideways

422
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
this and you know we need to go sideways
 

423
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,430
this and you know we need to go sideways
for a bit. Q's same story. We're

424
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
for a bit. Q's same story. We're
 

425
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,949
for a bit. Q's same story. We're
underneath that low like we talked

426
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
underneath that low like we talked
 

427
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,670
underneath that low like we talked
about. It has room if we're going to get

428
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
about. It has room if we're going to get
 

429
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,389
about. It has room if we're going to get
really heavy on the Q's. You know we got

430
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
really heavy on the Q's. You know we got
 

431
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,069
really heavy on the Q's. You know we got
tons of room down to 590s. 600 is a huge

432
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
tons of room down to 590s. 600 is a huge
 

433
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,150
tons of room down to 590s. 600 is a huge
uh options level as well. Just remember

434
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
uh options level as well. Just remember
 

435
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,870
uh options level as well. Just remember
that. a 600 big big big big big options

436
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
that. a 600 big big big big big options
 

437
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,670
that. a 600 big big big big big options
level and under that it has room. So if

438
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
level and under that it has room. So if
 

439
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,590
level and under that it has room. So if
they reject uh 600 this morning was a it

440
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
they reject uh 600 this morning was a it
 

441
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,790
they reject uh 600 this morning was a it
was a put wall. They're already

442
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
was a put wall. They're already
 

443
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,389
was a put wall. They're already
underneath it. Let's see how they act at

444
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
underneath it. Let's see how they act at
 

445
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,870
underneath it. Let's see how they act at
the open.

446
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
the open.
 

447
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,430
the open.
VIX is on a tear. All right. Just

448
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
VIX is on a tear. All right. Just
 

449
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,310
VIX is on a tear. All right. Just
absolutely flying right now. Coming back

450
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
absolutely flying right now. Coming back
 

451
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,150
absolutely flying right now. Coming back
to these Friday highs. If we base over

452
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
to these Friday highs. If we base over
 

453
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,750
to these Friday highs. If we base over
those Friday highs, you know, we'd be

454
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
those Friday highs, you know, we'd be
 

455
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,750
those Friday highs, you know, we'd be
looking for a trade into 25s and then

456
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
looking for a trade into 25s and then
 

457
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,710
looking for a trade into 25s and then
29s. If we have a sell day today, unless

458
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
29s. If we have a sell day today, unless
 

459
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,710
29s. If we have a sell day today, unless
it's, you know, complete panic and the

460
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
it's, you know, complete panic and the
 

461

hardest thing right now is where can we

hardest thing right now is where can we
 

781
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,870

previous week low right here, right now.
 

785
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,549
previous week low right here, right now.
All right. So, this green line is

786
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
All right. So, this green line is
 

787
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,909
All right. So, this green line is
previous week low. If you've seen

788
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
previous week low. If you've seen
 

789
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,350
previous week low. If you've seen
continuation under that, it's possible

790
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
continuation under that, it's possible
 

791
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,590
continuation under that, it's possible
that we bleed out. It is like I've

792
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
that we bleed out. It is like I've
 

793
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,070
that we bleed out. It is like I've
talked about numerous times. It is not a

794
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
talked about numerous times. It is not a
 

795
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,750
talked about numerous times. It is not a
good location. We're at the lower

796
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
good location. We're at the lower
 

797
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,390
good location. We're at the lower
Ballinger band. We've taken liquidity.

798
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
Ballinger band. We've taken liquidity.
 

799
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,669
Ballinger band. We've taken liquidity.
It is what it is. Unfortunately, it's

800
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
It is what it is. Unfortunately, it's
 

801
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,909
It is what it is. Unfortunately, it's
just going to really depend if this

802
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:23,919
just going to really depend if this
 

803
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,510
just going to really depend if this
market is going to be nice to us and

804
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
market is going to be nice to us and
 

805
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,350
market is going to be nice to us and
give us a pop. At the moment, I don't

806
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
give us a pop. At the moment, I don't
 

807
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,070
give us a pop. At the moment, I don't
think we're going to get that. No, Jack.

808
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
think we're going to get that. No, Jack.
 

809
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,430
think we're going to get that. No, Jack.
I'm absolutely not. I've talked about

810
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm absolutely not. I've talked about
 

811
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,470
I'm absolutely not. I've talked about
it. Why would I buy the lows

812
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
it. Why would I buy the lows
 

813
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,510
it. Why would I buy the lows
in a panic cell scenario? It's not like

814
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
in a panic cell scenario? It's not like
 

815
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,430
in a panic cell scenario? It's not like
we've looked below and reclaimed

816
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
we've looked below and reclaimed
 

817
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,350
we've looked below and reclaimed
anything. All right? But we are a heavy

818
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360

market right now. Not something I'm

821
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,430
market right now. Not something I'm
going to look to do. I'm going to look

822
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
going to look to do. I'm going to look
 

823
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,750
going to look to do. I'm going to look
to fade pops into key levels and play

824
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
to fade pops into key levels and play
 

825
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,590
to fade pops into key levels and play
the protrend.

826
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
the protrend.

here so far. I just want to give it a
 

839
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,070
here so far. I just want to give it a
chance to shake out. I really don't want

840
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
chance to shake out. I really don't want
 

841
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,270
chance to shake out. I really don't want
to join the short down here if possible.

842
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
to join the short down here if possible.
 

843

But it feels like we're just going to go

But it feels like we're just going to go
into a straight sell here this morning

846
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520

 

847
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,909

cuz it is panic stations. So it's not a

848
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
cuz it is panic stations. So it's not a
 

849
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,510
cuz it is panic stations. So it's not a
good location into that lower bowl, but

850
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
good location into that lower bowl, but
 

851
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,270
good location into that lower bowl, but
it is definitely panic stations. Market

852
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
it is definitely panic stations. Market
 

853
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,310
it is definitely panic stations. Market

good entry model.

878

879
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,990

901
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,470

If we start breaking heavy today, it

902
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
If we start breaking heavy today, it
 

903
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,470
If we start breaking heavy today, it
will not be controlled. It will be

904
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
will not be controlled. It will be
 

905
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,870

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,750

So, be watching to see how we operate

928
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
So, be watching to see how we operate
 

929
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,390
So, be watching to see how we operate
into that previous week low into VWAP

930
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
into that previous week low into VWAP
 

931
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,950
into that previous week low into VWAP
into New York open.

932
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
into New York open.
 

933
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,430
into New York open.
Do the sellers sell that or can we get a

934
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
Do the sellers sell that or can we get a
 

935
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,669
Do the sellers sell that or can we get a
bit of a squeeze back up to test some

936
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
bit of a squeeze back up to test some
 

937
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,029
bit of a squeeze back up to test some
areas above like Friday's

938
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
areas above like Friday's
 

939
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,669
areas above like Friday's
um value area? Yesterday's value area. I

940
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
um value area? Yesterday's value area. I
 

941
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,710
um value area? Yesterday's value area. I
don't think we're going to get any hope

942
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
don't think we're going to get any hope
 

943
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,230
don't think we're going to get any hope
in hell in getting up to yesterday's

944
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
in hell in getting up to yesterday's
 

945
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,669
in hell in getting up to yesterday's
value area right now. That's trading up

946
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
value area right now. That's trading up
 

947
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,630
value area right now. That's trading up
at 25,000.

948
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
at 25,000.
 

949
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,430
at 25,000.
I just don't see us going there. It's a

950
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
I just don't see us going there. It's a
 

951
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,430
I just don't see us going there. It's a
400 point drive higher. At the moment,

952
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
400 point drive higher. At the moment,
 

953
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,230
400 point drive higher. At the moment,
it's showing nothing. No reason to get

954
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
it's showing nothing. No reason to get
 

955
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,669
it's showing nothing. No reason to get
up there.

956
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679

 

957
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,430

Ideally, we can get a drive to sell

958
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
Ideally, we can get a drive to sell
 

959
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,549
Ideally, we can get a drive to sell
into.

960
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559

 

961
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,350

Here come the bulls. So, here's VWAP.

962
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
Here come the bulls. So, here's VWAP.
 

963
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,549
Here come the bulls. So, here's VWAP.
Through VWAP, we will go previous week

964
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
Through VWAP, we will go previous week
 

965
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,270
Through VWAP, we will go previous week
low and the New York open. Again, no

966
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,280
low and the New York open. Again, no
 

967
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,710
low and the New York open. Again, no
position here. I'm just letting it do

968
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
position here. I'm just letting it do
 

969
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:35,110
position here. I'm just letting it do
whatever it is it wants to do.

970
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120

 

971
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,789

There's VWAP.

972
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799

 

973
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,230

Very different to yesterday. We have to

974
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,240
Very different to yesterday. We have to
 

975
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,789
Very different to yesterday. We have to
be patient today. We have to wait for

976
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
be patient today. We have to wait for
 

977
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,549
be patient today. We have to wait for
location. Remember, we're at the lower

978
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:44,559
location. Remember, we're at the lower
 

979
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,510
location. Remember, we're at the lower
ballinger band outside of previous week.

980
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520

 

981
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,669

So, to move lower, we would need bulls

982
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
So, to move lower, we would need bulls
 

983
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,149
So, to move lower, we would need bulls
trapped in the market, right? We would

984
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
trapped in the market, right? We would
 

985
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,149
trapped in the market, right? We would
need either panic either like swing

986
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
need either panic either like swing
 

987
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,990
need either panic either like swing
bulls selling all their positions or

988
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
bulls selling all their positions or
 

989
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,990
bulls selling all their positions or
some bulls being trapped in the market.

990
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
some bulls being trapped in the market.
 

991
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,630
some bulls being trapped in the market.
That will happen if we can move higher,

992
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,640
That will happen if we can move higher,
 

993
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,470
That will happen if we can move higher,
encourage lots of bulls to start buying

994
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
encourage lots of bulls to start buying
 

995
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,950
encourage lots of bulls to start buying
the lows and then sell into them. And

996
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
the lows and then sell into them. And
 

997
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,549
the lows and then sell into them. And
that's what I'm going to be considering

998
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
that's what I'm going to be considering
 

999
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,630
that's what I'm going to be considering
considering. And I think if we sell

1000
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
considering. And I think if we sell
 

1001
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,390
considering. And I think if we sell
today or go sideways today, then I think

1002
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
today or go sideways today, then I think
 

1003
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,029
today or go sideways today, then I think
Monday will probably be your day where

1004
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
Monday will probably be your day where
 

1005
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,789
Monday will probably be your day where
you get some relief because the VIX is

1006
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
you get some relief because the VIX is
 

1007
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,549
you get some relief because the VIX is
very unlikely to keep screaming higher

1008
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
very unlikely to keep screaming higher
 

1009
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,350
very unlikely to keep screaming higher
for three sessions in a row. Monday or

1010
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
for three sessions in a row. Monday or
 

1011
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,710
for three sessions in a row. Monday or
Tuesday next week, there will probably

1012
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
Tuesday next week, there will probably
 

1013
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,789
Tuesday next week, there will probably
be probably probably be some relief.

1014
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
be probably probably be some relief.
 

1015
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,789
be probably probably be some relief.
Right, here's the squeeze. It's why we

1016
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
Right, here's the squeeze. It's why we
 

1017
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,430
Right, here's the squeeze. It's why we
don't short the lows through New York

1018
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
don't short the lows through New York
 

1019
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,510
don't short the lows through New York
open VW up here, Asia here, and uh

1021
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,190

previous day low. If we can get up here,

1022
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
previous day low. If we can get up here,
 

1023
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,870
previous day low. If we can get up here,
I'm very interested in the short. If we

1024
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm very interested in the short. If we
 

1025
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,590
I'm very interested in the short. If we
get up here, yes, absolutely. I'm

Watching this book. Is there any

1043
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,950

Up you go. Come on, market. Higher you

1044
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
Up you go. Come on, market. Higher you
 

1045
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,230
Up you go. Come on, market. Higher you
go the better. Higher you go the better.

Bit of H1 relief here would be good.

1048
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
Bit of H1 relief here would be good.
 

1049
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,590
Bit of H1 relief here would be good.
What would that swing look like? Fib to

1050
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
What would that swing look like? Fib to
 

1051
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:36,789
What would that swing look like? Fib to
fib on the H1.

1052
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799

 

1053
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,029

50% would be at 900. We're into the 30s

1054
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
50% would be at 900. We're into the 30s
 

1055
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,549
50% would be at 900. We're into the 30s
already. 30%. So,

1056
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:44,559
already. 30%. So,
 

1057
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,990
already. 30%. So,
let's see. Let's just let this squeeze

1058
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,000
let's see. Let's just let this squeeze
 

1059
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,750
let's see. Let's just let this squeeze
out. See what we can get.

1060
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760

 

1061
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,669

Big buyers got trapped there again on

1062
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
Big buyers got trapped there again on
 

1063
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,110
Big buyers got trapped there again on
this first push. I'd like to see it go

1064
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
this first push. I'd like to see it go
 

1065
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,789
this first push. I'd like to see it go
higher, but it's no doubt about it. Some

1066
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:56,799
higher, but it's no doubt about it. Some
 

1067
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,149
higher, but it's no doubt about it. Some
buyers just got trapped there on that

1068
00:25:58,149 --> 00:25:58,159
buyers just got trapped there on that
 

1069
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,230
buyers just got trapped there on that
first push. 100 million%. Some buyers

1070
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
first push. 100 million%. Some buyers
 

1071
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,549
first push. 100 million%. Some buyers
just got trapped on that first push

1072
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
just got trapped on that first push
 

1073
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,269
just got trapped on that first push
above 90.

1074
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:09,279

 

1075
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:24,470

Like this to go much higher first.

1076
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480

 

1077
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,149

These are big candles, folks. They might

1078
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
These are big candles, folks. They might
 

1079
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,510
These are big candles, folks. They might
look small, but they're big. Just be

1080
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
look small, but they're big. Just be
 

1081
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,470
look small, but they're big. Just be
careful.

1082
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
careful.
 

1083
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,269
careful.
These are no joke. And VOP's a long way

1084
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
These are no joke. And VOP's a long way
 

1085
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:42,070
These are no joke. And VOP's a long way
away.

1086
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080

 

1087
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,230

So testing those 800s, failing the 800s.

1088
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
So testing those 800s, failing the 800s.
 

1089
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,070
So testing those 800s, failing the 800s.
Buyers caught up there again so far. If

1090
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
Buyers caught up there again so far. If
 

1091
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,190
Buyers caught up there again so far. If
we get through that, then I think we're

1092
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,200
we get through that, then I think we're
 

1093
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,190
we get through that, then I think we're
going to go 860s to 900s.

1094
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
going to go 860s to 900s.
 

1095
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,390
going to go 860s to 900s.
Think that's possible.

1096
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
Think that's possible.
 

1097
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,269
Think that's possible.
Big old squeeze out here.

1098
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
Big old squeeze out here.
 

1099
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,310
Big old squeeze out here.
Looks moving very very quick. Very very

1100
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
Looks moving very very quick. Very very
 

1101
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:17,909
Looks moving very very quick. Very very
quick.

1102
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919

 

1103
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,590

but it's still coming in here for now.

1104
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
but it's still coming in here for now.
 

1105
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,430
but it's still coming in here for now.
Still has squeeze potential up to those

1106
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
Still has squeeze potential up to those
 

1107
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,190
Still has squeeze potential up to those
VWs. Lower time frame I'll go all the

1108
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
VWs. Lower time frame I'll go all the
 

1109
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,470
VWs. Lower time frame I'll go all the
way up here. It can get very very

1110
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
way up here. It can get very very
 

1111
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,470
way up here. It can get very very
violent on the return back up side.

1112
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:28,480
violent on the return back up side.
 

1113
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:36,149
violent on the return back up side.
Remember

1114
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159

 

1115
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,990

there's some selling here.

1116
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
there's some selling here.
 

1117
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,070
there's some selling here.
VIX coming right back downside.

1118
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,080
VIX coming right back downside.
 

1119
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,669
VIX coming right back downside.
Interesting if they find a bid here or

1120
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
Interesting if they find a bid here or
 

1121
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,789
Interesting if they find a bid here or
not. If they don't, we're going to go

1122
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
not. If they don't, we're going to go
 

1123
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,149
not. If they don't, we're going to go
right the way back to the lows because

1124
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
right the way back to the lows because
 

1125
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,510
right the way back to the lows because
this where the buyer stepped in. So,

1126
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,520
this where the buyer stepped in. So,
 

1127
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,669
this where the buyer stepped in. So,
it's interesting kind of areas around

1128
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
it's interesting kind of areas around
 

1129
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,110
it's interesting kind of areas around
here holding the 800s for now. Okay. If

1130
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
here holding the 800s for now. Okay. If
 

1131
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,710
here holding the 800s for now. Okay. If
they hold the 800s, they have the

1132
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:56,720
they hold the 800s, they have the
 

1133
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,789
they hold the 800s, they have the
potential to move up towards the 860s

1134
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
potential to move up towards the 860s
 

1135
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,870
potential to move up towards the 860s
and then 900s. If they fail the n the

1136
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
and then 900s. If they fail the n the
 

1137
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,430
and then 900s. If they fail the n the
800s, we can go and test that New York

1138
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,440
800s, we can go and test that New York
 

1139
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:11,110
800s, we can go and test that New York
open again.

1140
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120

 

1141
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,789

So, watching this opening range,

1142
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
So, watching this opening range,
 

1143
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,830
So, watching this opening range,
watching how we operate here

1144
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
watching how we operate here
 

1145
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,470
watching how we operate here
back to these sort of 800 780s. It's

1146
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
back to these sort of 800 780s. It's
 

1147
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,149
back to these sort of 800 780s. It's
clearly a key level for them to try and

1148
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:20,159
clearly a key level for them to try and
 

1149
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,230
clearly a key level for them to try and
hold at the moment. And if we start

1150
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
hold at the moment. And if we start
 

1151
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,470
hold at the moment. And if we start
failing here,

1152
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
failing here,
 

1153
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,950
failing here,
it's less than an ideal location, but

1154
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
it's less than an ideal location, but
 

1155
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,990
it's less than an ideal location, but
it's uh something I'd be watching, but I

1156
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
it's uh something I'd be watching, but I
 

1157
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,830
it's uh something I'd be watching, but I
think the squeeze higher is possible

1158
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
think the squeeze higher is possible
 

1159
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,909
think the squeeze higher is possible
still.

1160
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
still.
 

1161
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,669
still.
Here we go. So, they're trying again.

1162
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679

 

1163
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,510

Just waiting here, folks. Just waiting

1164
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520
Just waiting here, folks. Just waiting
 

1165
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,830
Just waiting here, folks. Just waiting
to see what we can get.

1166
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840

 

1167
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,190

Remember, if a seller gets caught

1168
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,200
Remember, if a seller gets caught
 

1169
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,750
Remember, if a seller gets caught
offside, this can rip faces very, very

1170
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
offside, this can rip faces very, very
 

1171
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,909
offside, this can rip faces very, very
quickly. So timing today going to be

1172
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
quickly. So timing today going to be
 

1173
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,710
quickly. So timing today going to be
very very very very hard. Yes, exactly.

1174
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
very very very very hard. Yes, exactly.
 

1175
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,310
very very very very hard. Yes, exactly.
Someone just said about the PC here.

1176
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
Someone just said about the PC here.
 

1177
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,510
Someone just said about the PC here.
That's exactly it. This is what we're

1178
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:57,520
That's exactly it. This is what we're
 

1179
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,710
That's exactly it. This is what we're
looking at fri from Friday last week.

1180
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
looking at fri from Friday last week.
 

1181
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,389
looking at fri from Friday last week.
These are interesting levels as

1182
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:02,399
These are interesting levels as
 

1183
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,789
These are interesting levels as
overunders.

1184
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
overunders.
 

1185
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,470
overunders.
My bias is still potentially for

1186
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
My bias is still potentially for
 

1187
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,389
My bias is still potentially for
downside, but we've lost location for

1188
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,399
downside, but we've lost location for
 

1189
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,630
downside, but we've lost location for
looking for downside. Okay, so easiest

1190
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
looking for downside. Okay, so easiest
 

1191
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,070
looking for downside. Okay, so easiest
way to put it. Still bulls are trying to

1192
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
way to put it. Still bulls are trying to
 

1193
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,389
way to put it. Still bulls are trying to
take control here.

1194
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
take control here.
 

1195
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,389
take control here.
Still squeeze potential here. So you're

1196
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
Still squeeze potential here. So you're
 

1197
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,710
Still squeeze potential here. So you're
seeing short covers coming in here.

1198
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
seeing short covers coming in here.
 

1199
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,070
seeing short covers coming in here.
When it's finished, it's finished. You

1200
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
When it's finished, it's finished. You
 

1201
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:33,510
When it's finished, it's finished. You
know, when it's done, it's done.

1202
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520

 

1203
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,590

Fix back to 22s.

1204
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600

 

1205
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,190

Coming up to this VW up through that we

1206
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
Coming up to this VW up through that we
 

1207
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,590
Coming up to this VW up through that we
have Globeex. So, big old squeeze. Maybe

1208
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
have Globeex. So, big old squeeze. Maybe
 

1209
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,870
have Globeex. So, big old squeeze. Maybe
they get all the way back to previous

1210
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
they get all the way back to previous
 

1211
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,549
they get all the way back to previous
day value area low. That would be a

1212
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:46,559
day value area low. That would be a
 

1213
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,909
day value area low. That would be a
really interesting level for me to think

1214
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
really interesting level for me to think
 

1215
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,510
really interesting level for me to think
about short if we can get that there.

1216
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:51,520
about short if we can get that there.
 

1217
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,669
about short if we can get that there.
Guess it's not that far away if they can

1218
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
Guess it's not that far away if they can
 

1219
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,350
Guess it's not that far away if they can
squeeze hundreds of points this quickly

1220
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
squeeze hundreds of points this quickly
 

1221
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,669
squeeze hundreds of points this quickly
cuz the range already today is already

1222
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
cuz the range already today is already
 

1223
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,389
cuz the range already today is already
212 points

1224
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
212 points
 

1225
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:13,590
212 points
already. Big old range.

1226
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,600

 

1227
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,470

No blowoff yet.

1228
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
No blowoff yet.
 

1229
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,230
No blowoff yet.
Bull still stepping in here. Still feels

1230
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
Bull still stepping in here. Still feels
 

1231
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,909
Bull still stepping in here. Still feels
like a squeeze to me. Once it's over,

1232
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:19,919
like a squeeze to me. Once it's over,
 

1233
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,990
like a squeeze to me. Once it's over,
it's over. I'd say once once they're

1234
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
it's over. I'd say once once they're
 

1235
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,750
it's over. I'd say once once they're
done, they're in big trouble. Right now,

1236
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
done, they're in big trouble. Right now,
 

1237
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,190
done, they're in big trouble. Right now,
they're still holding. Look how whippy

1238
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
they're still holding. Look how whippy
 

1239
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,029
they're still holding. Look how whippy
this is. These are not small candles,

1240
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:27,039
this is. These are not small candles,
 

1241
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,110
this is. These are not small candles,
folks. These are very, very big candles.

1242
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
folks. These are very, very big candles.
 

1243
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,510
folks. These are very, very big candles.
Here's your 800 test under here. There's

1244
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:31,520
Here's your 800 test under here. There's
 

1245
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,430
Here's your 800 test under here. There's
a bigger flush. I'm watching this now.

1246
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
a bigger flush. I'm watching this now.
 

1247
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,070
a bigger flush. I'm watching this now.
Probably sub 780s.

1248
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
Probably sub 780s.
 

1249
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,430
Probably sub 780s.
If they're going to let go, I'm watching

1250
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,440
If they're going to let go, I'm watching
 

1251
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,830
If they're going to let go, I'm watching
it sub 780s.

1252
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840

 

1253
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,669

Big exchange.

1254
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:43,679
Big exchange.
 

1255
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,549
Big exchange.
Huge exchange here. Are we going to

1256
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
Huge exchange here. Are we going to
 

1257
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,149
Huge exchange here. Are we going to
flush down through this now is my

1258
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
flush down through this now is my
 

1259
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,190
flush down through this now is my
question.

1260
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,200

 

1261
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,269

Feels tight. Feels very tight in this

1262
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
Feels tight. Feels very tight in this
 

1263
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,549
Feels tight. Feels very tight in this
range here. We've built out lots of

1264
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
range here. We've built out lots of
 

1265
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,789
range here. We've built out lots of
volume here. In fact, let me make sure

1266
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:56,799
volume here. In fact, let me make sure
 

1267
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,909
volume here. In fact, let me make sure
you've got this volume on.

1268
00:30:59,909 --> 00:30:59,919
you've got this volume on.
 

1269
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,110
you've got this volume on.
All right. This is why I'm saying sub

1270
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
All right. This is why I'm saying sub
 

1271
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,430
All right. This is why I'm saying sub
sort of 780s. There's a bigger move down

1272
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,440
sort of 780s. There's a bigger move down
 

1273
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,830
sort of 780s. There's a bigger move down
here for now. They are still holding it.

1274
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
here for now. They are still holding it.
 

1275
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,070
here for now. They are still holding it.
Still exchanging here for now. No

1276
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,080
Still exchanging here for now. No
 

1277
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:16,310
Still exchanging here for now. No
change. Nice and slow.

1278
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320

 

1279
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,750

Patience, patience, patience.

1280
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
Patience, patience, patience.
 

1281
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,870
Patience, patience, patience.
Yeah, 780 now the PC on the day for this

1282
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
Yeah, 780 now the PC on the day for this
 

1283
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,029
Yeah, 780 now the PC on the day for this
current session.

1284
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039

 

1285
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,510

Vick still sliding lower. There is a

1286
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,520
Vick still sliding lower. There is a
 

1287
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,190
Vick still sliding lower. There is a
shortcoming here. It's just whether it's

1288
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
shortcoming here. It's just whether it's
 

1289
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,710
shortcoming here. It's just whether it's
going to be now or all the way up

1290
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
going to be now or all the way up
 

1291
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,029
going to be now or all the way up
previous day at value area low. You do

1292
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039
previous day at value area low. You do
 

1293
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,310
previous day at value area low. You do
not want to get caught in the squeeze.

1294
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,320
not want to get caught in the squeeze.
 

1295
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,430
not want to get caught in the squeeze.
Remember, we're just repricing up. This

1296
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
Remember, we're just repricing up. This
 

1297
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,830
Remember, we're just repricing up. This
area here is the level of interest from

1298
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
area here is the level of interest from
 

1299
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,710
area here is the level of interest from
last Friday for me, right? From previous

1300
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,720
last Friday for me, right? From previous
 

1301
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,950
last Friday for me, right? From previous
week. This was sort of the balance zone

1302
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
week. This was sort of the balance zone
 

1303
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,230
week. This was sort of the balance zone
from the previous week. So, how we

1304
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
from the previous week. So, how we
 

1305
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,590
from the previous week. So, how we
acting here is key. If they get through

1306
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
acting here is key. If they get through
 

1307
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,870
acting here is key. If they get through
this, we're going all the way up here.

1308
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
this, we're going all the way up here.
 

1309
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,430
this, we're going all the way up here.
And this for me is going to be the prime

1310
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
And this for me is going to be the prime
 

1311
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,950
And this for me is going to be the prime
location to be short. If we fail

1312
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
location to be short. If we fail
 

1313
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,950
location to be short. If we fail
anywhere up here, this is a prime short

1314
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
anywhere up here, this is a prime short
 

1315
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,389
anywhere up here, this is a prime short
location. Remember, gap fill is all the

1316
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:02,399
location. Remember, gap fill is all the
 

1317
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,029
location. Remember, gap fill is all the
way up here. If we fail here, this is

1318
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
way up here. If we fail here, this is
 

1319
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,110
way up here. If we fail here, this is
any of these interest levels are of

1320
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
any of these interest levels are of
 

1321
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,110
any of these interest levels are of
interest to me. If we reclaim this, no

1322
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,120
interest to me. If we reclaim this, no
 

1323
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,149
interest to me. If we reclaim this, no
shorts for the day because we're going

1324
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
shorts for the day because we're going
 

1325
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,029
shorts for the day because we're going
to go back inside yesterday's range.

1326
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
to go back inside yesterday's range.
 

1327
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,029
to go back inside yesterday's range.
I am expecting like a squeeze out in the

1328
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,039
I am expecting like a squeeze out in the
 

1329
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,350
I am expecting like a squeeze out in the
morning maybe till maybe another 15

1330
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
morning maybe till maybe another 15
 

1331
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,669
morning maybe till maybe another 15
minutes or so and then we'll see what's

1332
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
minutes or so and then we'll see what's
 

1333
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,950
minutes or so and then we'll see what's
what.

1334
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:22,960

 

1335
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,710

Like I said, I want to play the protrend

1336
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
Like I said, I want to play the protrend
 

1337
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,230
Like I said, I want to play the protrend
which currently is down. It's down

1338
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240

 

1339
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,669

VWAP here. ES doing look.

1340
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
VWAP here. ES doing look.
 

1341
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,149
VWAP here. ES doing look.
Did ES take those lows on that morning

1342
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
Did ES take those lows on that morning
 

1343
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,430
Did ES take those lows on that morning
drive? Nope.

1344
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
drive? Nope.
 

1345
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,190
drive? Nope.
Okay,

1346
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
Okay,
 

1347
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,710
Okay,
ES coming back towards its VWAP as well.

1348
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:48,720

 

1349
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,470

Spider's already through their VWAP.

1350
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,480
Spider's already through their VWAP.
 

1351
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:01,110
Spider's already through their VWAP.
Back towards the 50-day.

1352
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120

 

1353
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,190

More squeeze possible, I think. More

1354
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
More squeeze possible, I think. More
 

1355
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,430
More squeeze possible, I think. More
squeeze possible. I want to time this

1356
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
squeeze possible. I want to time this
 

1357
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,029
squeeze possible. I want to time this
short. I want to make sure I'm on the

1358
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
short. I want to make sure I'm on the
 

1359
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,950
short. I want to make sure I'm on the
right side of it.

1360
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960

 

1361
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,509

So, wiggle here. I still think there's

1362
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
So, wiggle here. I still think there's
 

1363
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,909
So, wiggle here. I still think there's
more in this. The higher, remember, the

1364
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:19,919
more in this. The higher, remember, the
 

1365
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,909
more in this. The higher, remember, the
higher we shove up, if we're looking for

1366
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
higher we shove up, if we're looking for
 

1367
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,909
higher we shove up, if we're looking for
the protrend, the higher we squeeze out,

1368
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:23,919
the protrend, the higher we squeeze out,
 

1369
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,710
the protrend, the higher we squeeze out,
the better. To move lower, we need bulls

1370
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:26,720
the better. To move lower, we need bulls
 

1371
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,110
the better. To move lower, we need bulls
trapped. All right? So if we can squeeze

1372
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
trapped. All right? So if we can squeeze
 

1373
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,029
trapped. All right? So if we can squeeze
out here into a key level and bulls

1374
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
out here into a key level and bulls
 

1375
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,269
out here into a key level and bulls
chase that's when a great short

1376
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
chase that's when a great short
 

1377
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,389
chase that's when a great short
opportunity will arise. We have taken

1378
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
opportunity will arise. We have taken
 

1379
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,509
opportunity will arise. We have taken
out um low of weak previous week lows.

1380
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
out um low of weak previous week lows.
 

1381
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,029
out um low of weak previous week lows.
So we have to be aware of that low

1382
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039
So we have to be aware of that low
 

1383
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,029
So we have to be aware of that low
hanging fruit is gone. I'm not playing a

1384
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:45,039
hanging fruit is gone. I'm not playing a
 

1385
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,110
hanging fruit is gone. I'm not playing a
counter trend today. I said I'd like to

1386
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,120
counter trend today. I said I'd like to
 

1387
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,389
counter trend today. I said I'd like to
see this squeeze higher and then I'm

1388
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
see this squeeze higher and then I'm
 

1389
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,430
see this squeeze higher and then I'm
going to look for the shorts. This is

1390
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
going to look for the shorts. This is
 

1391
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,950
going to look for the shorts. This is
what I wanted to see. This is the first

1392
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
what I wanted to see. This is the first
 

1393
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,430
what I wanted to see. This is the first
thing I wanted to see. Now I need to see

1394
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
thing I wanted to see. Now I need to see
 

1395
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,190
thing I wanted to see. Now I need to see
if and when they get stuck. If they

1396
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
if and when they get stuck. If they
 

1397
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,029
if and when they get stuck. If they
don't get stuck, so be it. We have no

1398
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:57,039
don't get stuck, so be it. We have no
 

1399
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,110
don't get stuck, so be it. We have no
trade

1400
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
trade
 

1401
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,669
trade
so far. Intraday

1402
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
so far. Intraday
 

1403
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,509
so far. Intraday
the bulls are trying to take control. I

1404
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:03,519
the bulls are trying to take control. I
 

1405
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,029
the bulls are trying to take control. I
think this is just shorts covering to be

1406
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
think this is just shorts covering to be
 

1407
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,829
think this is just shorts covering to be
honest. And this is VWAP right here.

1408
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:09,839

 

1409
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,990

SPY and ES got a little bit to go to get

1410
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
SPY and ES got a little bit to go to get
 

1411
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,310
SPY and ES got a little bit to go to get
to their VWAP. I'm watching this GlobeEx

1412
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
to their VWAP. I'm watching this GlobeEx
 

1413
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,990
to their VWAP. I'm watching this GlobeEx
low as well. 900. Once we get through

1414
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
low as well. 900. Once we get through
 

1415
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,829
low as well. 900. Once we get through
900, maybe we get previous day value

1416
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
900, maybe we get previous day value
 

1417
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,190
900, maybe we get previous day value
area low. So again, I'm just letting

1418
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
area low. So again, I'm just letting
 

1419
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,669
area low. So again, I'm just letting
this squeeze out. Do what it wants. Can

1420
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679
this squeeze out. Do what it wants. Can
 

1421
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,829
this squeeze out. Do what it wants. Can
keep going. It's absolutely fine.

1422
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:25,839
keep going. It's absolutely fine.
 

1423
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,750
keep going. It's absolutely fine.
Orb now set. Yeah. Well, you're above

1424
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:27,760
Orb now set. Yeah. Well, you're above
 

1425
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,869
Orb now set. Yeah. Well, you're above
the orb.

1426
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,879

 

1427
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:49,109

This

1428
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:49,119

 

1429
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,349

globeex and then previous day low gap

globeex and then previous day low gap
 

1431
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,950
globeex and then previous day low gap
fill all the way up here if they can do

1432
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:52,960
fill all the way up here if they can do
 

1433
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,869
fill all the way up here if they can do
it. If you're longing this and you're

1434
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
it. If you're longing this and you're
 

1435
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,430
it. If you're longing this and you're
playing a counter trend, it does make

1436
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:57,440
playing a counter trend, it does make
 

1437
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,430
playing a counter trend, it does make
sense and you're making money from it.

1438
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
sense and you're making money from it.
 

1439
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,190
sense and you're making money from it.
But just remember, it's a counter trend.

1440
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
But just remember, it's a counter trend.
 

1441
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,470
But just remember, it's a counter trend.
If and when sellers come back in, all

1442
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,480
If and when sellers come back in, all
 

1443
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,589
If and when sellers come back in, all
right, it's going to be heavy.

1444
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:09,599

 

1445
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,829

It's still dropping down nicely, but

1446
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839
It's still dropping down nicely, but
 

1447
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,230
It's still dropping down nicely, but
still just at 2175. It's coming into

1448
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,240
still just at 2175. It's coming into
 

1449
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,109
still just at 2175. It's coming into
some areas of interest with pivots.

1450
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
some areas of interest with pivots.
 

1451
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,190
some areas of interest with pivots.
So 2160s

1452
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
So 2160s
 

1453
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,150
So 2160s
on the VIX all the way down to 21 is an

1454
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
on the VIX all the way down to 21 is an
 

1455
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,829
on the VIX all the way down to 21 is an
area where I think buyers might step

1456
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
area where I think buyers might step
 

1457
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,349
area where I think buyers might step
back in in the VIX unless it flushes

1458
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
back in in the VIX unless it flushes
 

1459
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,190
back in in the VIX unless it flushes
straight through which might indicate

1460
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
straight through which might indicate
 

1461
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,109
straight through which might indicate
when we start to top out again. I'm just

1462
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
when we start to top out again. I'm just
 

1463
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,990
when we start to top out again. I'm just
going to watch the tape here.

1464
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
going to watch the tape here.
 

1465
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:41,270
going to watch the tape here.
See what we get.

1466
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,280

 

1467
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,430

Nice Tonio.

This is GlobeEx 900 here. So if they

1506
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:20,880
This is GlobeEx 900 here. So if they
 

1507
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,550
This is GlobeEx 900 here. So if they
hold this then we should get those

1508
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560
hold this then we should get those
 

1509
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,870
hold this then we should get those
25,000s. Previous day value area low,

25,000s. Previous day value area low,

day low into into like 25,000s. There's
 

1515
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,550
day low into into like 25,000s. There's
an old New York VW up to 25,100. So I'm

1516
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,560
an old New York VW up to 25,100. So I'm
 

1517
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,190
an old New York VW up to 25,100. So I'm
interested either here or up there. The

00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,200
interested either here or up there. The
 

1519
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,109
interested either here or up there. The
edge of this red box or this box. It

1520
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
edge of this red box or this box. It
 

1521
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,510
edge of this red box or this box. It
depends where we where we see failures.

1522
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,520
depends where we where we see failures.
 

1523
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,069

1576
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:07,599

 

1577
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,270

1581
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,069
Shelf here. You can see we've built
volume here. I'm not convinced that

00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:12,079
volume here. I'm not convinced that
 

1583
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,589
volume here. I'm not convinced that
we've got enough excess in this yet,

1584
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:13,599
we've got enough excess in this yet,
 

1585
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,870
we've got enough excess in this yet,
which is why I'm not really quite

1586
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
which is why I'm not really quite
 

1587
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,430
which is why I'm not really quite
interested. We caught a little bit, but

1588
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:17,440
interested. We caught a little bit, but
 

1589
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,870
interested. We caught a little bit, but
really we had a PC there at 910

1590
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:20,880
really we had a PC there at 910
 

1591
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,790
really we had a PC there at 910
on a transition. So, I'm not convinced

1592
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800
on a transition. So, I'm not convinced
 

1593
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,190
on a transition. So, I'm not convinced
there's enough excess yet. Yes, I'm

1594
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,200
there's enough excess yet. Yes, I'm
 

1595
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,790
there's enough excess yet. Yes, I'm
being extra cautious today, guys,

1596
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
being extra cautious today, guys,
 

1597
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,390
being extra cautious today, guys,
because if you get this wrong, you're

1598
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:28,400
because if you get this wrong, you're
 

1599
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,470
because if you get this wrong, you're
going to get caught in 100 point ripper

1600
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
going to get caught in 100 point ripper
 

1601
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,510
going to get caught in 100 point ripper
the wrong way. So, very, very, very like

1602
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:33,520
the wrong way. So, very, very, very like
 

1603
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,030
the wrong way. So, very, very, very like
slow today. Interview up again.

1604
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,040

 

1605
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,109

VIX fi starting to find a bid at that

1606
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:41,119
VIX fi starting to find a bid at that
 

1607
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,270
VIX fi starting to find a bid at that
2160 that I talked about. All right, so

1608
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,280
2160 that I talked about. All right, so
 

1609
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,069
2160 that I talked about. All right, so
2160 down to 21 is an area where I think

1610
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:46,079
2160 down to 21 is an area where I think
 

1611
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,670
2160 down to 21 is an area where I think
VIX will start to find a bid. That's

1612
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:47,680
VIX will start to find a bid. That's
 

1613
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,150
VIX will start to find a bid. That's
what we've just started to do. If VIX

1614
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
what we've just started to do. If VIX
 

1615
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,910
what we've just started to do. If VIX
can start to turn, I'd like one more

1616
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
can start to turn, I'd like one more
 

1617
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,829
can start to turn, I'd like one more
push on excess here. Let me just check

1618
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
push on excess here. Let me just check
 

1619
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,030
push on excess here. Let me just check

1623
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,870

00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
quite there yet. The 50day is basically
 

1625
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,030
quite there yet. The 50day is basically
previous day low on the Q's. I would

1626
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,040
previous day low on the Q's. I would
 

1627
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,030

1644
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,160
this. Like I said, this is common for me
 

1645
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,589

1649
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,710
we see stuff like this. I'm not going to
short the lows. I'm going to stay

1650
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
short the lows. I'm going to stay
 

1651
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,470
short the lows. I'm going to stay
focused on one side of the trade, which

1652
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
focused on one side of the trade, which
 

1653
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,230
focused on one side of the trade, which
is the short. I'm going to wait for a

1654
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,240
is the short. I'm going to wait for a
 

1655
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,630
is the short. I'm going to wait for a
retest of some key areas and wait for

1656
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,640
retest of some key areas and wait for
 

1657
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,790
retest of some key areas and wait for
buyers to get trapped. If you wanted to

1658
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:38,800
buyers to get trapped. If you wanted to
 

1659
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,790
buyers to get trapped. If you wanted to
long this, you've had your triggers.

1660
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
long this, you've had your triggers.
 

1661

1666
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:45,760
focused on the short. It doesn't mean
 

1667
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,750
focused on the short. It doesn't mean
that this squeeze up isn't a good trade

1668
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:47,760
that this squeeze up isn't a good trade
 

1669

That's all you've got to do and wait.

That's all you've got to do and wait.
 

1707
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,510
That's all you've got to do and wait.
All right. If you got anyone that got

All right. If you got anyone that got

I'm interested how we operate here. I'm

That's absolutely fine by me.

00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
That's absolutely fine by me.

That's absolutely fine by me.
It's about waiting. Let the market come

1732
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
It's about waiting. Let the market come
 

1733
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,430
It's about waiting. Let the market come
to you and then once it's into an area,

1734
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:15,440
to you and then once it's into an area,
 

1735
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,510
to you and then once it's into an area,
then I zoom in in the order flow. Then I

1736
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
then I zoom in in the order flow. Then I
 

1737
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,589
then I zoom in in the order flow. Then I
zoom in looking for structure. Until

1738
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:19,599
zoom in looking for structure. Until
 

1739
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,270
zoom in looking for structure. Until
that point, just let it come to your

1740
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
that point, just let it come to your
 

1741
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,870
that point, just let it come to your
area of interest. Why important to have

1742
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:22,880
area of interest. Why important to have
 

1743
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,430
area of interest. Why important to have
a plan?

1744
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
a plan?
 

1745
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,109
a plan?
I didn't think we'd come up to previous

00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
I didn't think we'd come up to previous
 

1747
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,109
I didn't think we'd come up to previous
day value area low. I didn't think we'd

1748
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:29,119
day value area low. I didn't think we'd
 

1749
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,109
day value area low. I didn't think we'd
have the juice, but I'm very happy that

1750
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:31,119
have the juice, but I'm very happy that
 

1751
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,430
have the juice, but I'm very happy that
we are because this is where all the

1752
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
we are because this is where all the
 

1753
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,230
we are because this is where all the
volume was built yesterday. This is the

00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,240
volume was built yesterday. This is the
 

1755
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,150
volume was built yesterday. This is the
bottom of the B shape. Remember, big

1756
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,160
bottom of the B shape. Remember, big
 

1757
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,030

week value area low, previous day close.
This is a thick level where I expect

1764
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
This is a thick level where I expect
 

1765
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,190
This is a thick level where I expect
sellers to come back in. If they don't

1766
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,200
sellers to come back in. If they don't
 

1767
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,069
sellers to come back in. If they don't
come back in, then by all means, a giant

1768
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
come back in, then by all means, a giant
 

1769
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,309
come back in, then by all means, a giant
squeeze is very much possible to recover

1770
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
squeeze is very much possible to recover
 

1771
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,069
squeeze is very much possible to recover
yesterday. But I don't think that is

1772
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
yesterday. But I don't think that is
 

1773
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,510
yesterday. But I don't think that is
what we're going to get. All right. It's

1774
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:57,520
what we're going to get. All right. It's
 

1775
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,230
what we're going to get. All right. It's
not what we're going to get. Or it could

1776
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,240
not what we're going to get. Or it could
 

1777
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,030
not what we're going to get. Or it could
be. It's very unlikely that we get that.

1778
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
be. It's very unlikely that we get that.
 

1779
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,710
be. It's very unlikely that we get that.
It's much more likely that this is a

1780
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:04,720
It's much more likely that this is a
 

1781
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,309
It's much more likely that this is a
squeeze up into 10:00 10:15 met with

00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319
squeeze up into 10:00 10:15 met with
 

1783
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,190
squeeze up into 10:00 10:15 met with
sellers and bow back down we go and we

1784
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200
sellers and bow back down we go and we
 

1785
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,870
sellers and bow back down we go and we
go into a range rotation day.

1786
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:16,880
go into a range rotation day.
 

1787
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,950
go into a range rotation day.
Right. Your IB is massive right now,

1788
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
Right. Your IB is massive right now,
 

1789
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,829
Right. Your IB is massive right now,
folks. 328. We still got half an hour

1790
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:21,839
folks. 328. We still got half an hour
 

1791
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,430
folks. 328. We still got half an hour
left. So just be aware of that. Starting

1792
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:23,440
left. So just be aware of that. Starting
 

1793
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,589
left. So just be aware of that. Starting
to get stuck here. Want this market to

1794
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:25,599
to get stuck here. Want this market to
 

1795
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,550
to get stuck here. Want this market to
move higher.

1796
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560

 

1797
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,990

Yeah, Gatfield could be good. Troy.

1798
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah, Gatfield could be good. Troy.
 

1799
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,470
Yeah, Gatfield could be good. Troy.
Yeah, for sure.

1800
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:36,480
Yeah, for sure.
 

1801
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,309
Yeah, for sure.
For sure. But like we said, I'm not

1802
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
For sure. But like we said, I'm not
 

1803
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,230
For sure. But like we said, I'm not
going to short the lows today. The clue

1804
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,240
going to short the lows today. The clue
 

1805
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,630
going to short the lows today. The clue
was in the Ballinger band, wasn't it?

1806
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
was in the Ballinger band, wasn't it?
 

1807
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,990
was in the Ballinger band, wasn't it?
Remember very beginning of the show,

1808
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,000
Remember very beginning of the show,
 

1809
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,349
Remember very beginning of the show,
maybe some of you are joining late. We

1810
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:45,359
maybe some of you are joining late. We
 

1811
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,230
maybe some of you are joining late. We
do not in this channel short at these

1812
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
do not in this channel short at these
 

1813
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,750
do not in this channel short at these
lower Ballinger bands. All right, but

1814
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
lower Ballinger bands. All right, but
 

1815
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,910
lower Ballinger bands. All right, but
50-day gap fill like

1816
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:53,920
50-day gap fill like
 

1817
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,150
50-day gap fill like
this profile here into some of these.

1818
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
this profile here into some of these.
 

1819
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,829
this profile here into some of these.
Yes, very interested for a retest of

1820
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:57,839
Yes, very interested for a retest of
 

1821
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,510
Yes, very interested for a retest of
this low and then hold runners just in

1822
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
this low and then hold runners just in
 

1823
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,589
this low and then hold runners just in
case. But uh I'm not getting short down

1824
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
case. But uh I'm not getting short down
 

1825
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,630
case. But uh I'm not getting short down
here and I don't want to play the

1826
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:02,640
here and I don't want to play the
 

1827
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,069
here and I don't want to play the
counter trend long. There's not enough

1828
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
counter trend long. There's not enough
 

1829
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,510
counter trend long. There's not enough
for me to be thinking about a counter

1830
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
for me to be thinking about a counter
 

1831
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,069
for me to be thinking about a counter
trend long today.

1832
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:12,079

 

1833
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,349

That doesn't mean you guys can't do it.

1834
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
That doesn't mean you guys can't do it.
 

1835
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,510
That doesn't mean you guys can't do it.
Like I say, I just stick to my A+

1836
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,520
Like I say, I just stick to my A+
 

1837
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,190
Like I say, I just stick to my A+
setups. They are what gets me paid. They

1838
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
setups. They are what gets me paid. They
 

1839
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,910
setups. They are what gets me paid. They
are what makes me profitable.

1840
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:23,920

 

1841
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,630

So there is some resting liquidity at

1842
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
So there is some resting liquidity at
 

1843
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,190
So there is some resting liquidity at
25,000. I'd imagine if we take him, we

1844
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
25,000. I'd imagine if we take him, we
 

1845
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,750
25,000. I'd imagine if we take him, we
might as well go to uh 25,020 25,60.

1846
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:33,760
might as well go to uh 25,020 25,60.
 

1847
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,270
might as well go to uh 25,020 25,60.
Let's see. This is straight up squeeze.

1848
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
Let's see. This is straight up squeeze.
 

1849
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,870
Let's see. This is straight up squeeze.
Really nice. This is everything we

1850
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:36,880
Really nice. This is everything we
 

1851
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,470
Really nice. This is everything we
wanted to see. Come on, market. Up you

1852
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:38,480
wanted to see. Come on, market. Up you
 

1853
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,630
wanted to see. Come on, market. Up you
go. Up, up, up, up, up. We don't want

1854
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:40,640
go. Up, up, up, up, up. We don't want
 

1855
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,390
go. Up, up, up, up, up. We don't want
this to just be walked. We actually want

1856
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:42,400
this to just be walked. We actually want
 

1857
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,309
this to just be walked. We actually want
aggressive big candles up. That's where

1858
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:44,319
aggressive big candles up. That's where
 

1859
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,390
aggressive big candles up. That's where
buyers start to chase, right? Once we

1860
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:46,400
buyers start to chase, right? Once we
 

1861
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,870
buyers start to chase, right? Once we
like this, this is what we see. Want to

1862
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
like this, this is what we see. Want to
 

1863
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,150
like this, this is what we see. Want to
see big big big big big big candles

1864
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,160
see big big big big big big candles
 

1865
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,510
see big big big big big big candles
please

1866
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:55,520

 

1867
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,910

with lots of buyers market buying their

1868
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,920
with lots of buyers market buying their
 

1869
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,750
with lots of buyers market buying their
way in at the top after we've squeezed

1870
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760
way in at the top after we've squeezed
 

1871
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,950
way in at the top after we've squeezed
out 344 points. That is exactly what we

1872
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:02,960
out 344 points. That is exactly what we
 

1873
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,950
out 344 points. That is exactly what we
want to see.

1874
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:04,960
want to see.
 

1875
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,270
want to see.
Higher the better.

1876
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:11,280

 

1877
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,430

Just Yeah. Not it's a normal standard

1878
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:13,440
Just Yeah. Not it's a normal standard
 

1879
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,829
Just Yeah. Not it's a normal standard
deviation uh sloth. So when you put

1880
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
deviation uh sloth. So when you put
 

1881
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,069
deviation uh sloth. So when you put
Ballinger bands on, they will always

1882
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:18,079
Ballinger bands on, they will always
 

1883
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,550
Ballinger bands on, they will always
always be two standard deviation away

1884
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,560
always be two standard deviation away
 

1885
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,390
always be two standard deviation away
from your 20 SMA on any chart. Yeah. So

1886
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,400
from your 20 SMA on any chart. Yeah. So
 

1887
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,349
from your 20 SMA on any chart. Yeah. So
I use it on the daily chart. Why on the

1888
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:27,359
I use it on the daily chart. Why on the
 

1889
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,670
I use it on the daily chart. Why on the
daily chart? Well, your 20 SMA is your

1890
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
daily chart? Well, your 20 SMA is your
 

1891
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,190
daily chart? Well, your 20 SMA is your
average price for the last month because

1892
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
average price for the last month because
 

1893
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,349
average price for the last month because
we have 20 trading days in a month. So

1894
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359
we have 20 trading days in a month. So
 

1895
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,190
we have 20 trading days in a month. So
two standard deviation up, two standard

1896
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,200
two standard deviation up, two standard
 

1897
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,670
two standard deviation up, two standard
deviation down. That gives you the the

1898
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:37,680
deviation down. That gives you the the
 

1899
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,069
deviation down. That gives you the the
elastic bands. It's very rare that we

1900
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,079
elastic bands. It's very rare that we
 

1901
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,670
elastic bands. It's very rare that we
trade outside of that. We can trade

1902
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680
trade outside of that. We can trade
 

1903
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,309
trade outside of that. We can trade
outside, but we normally close inside.

1904
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
outside, but we normally close inside.
 

1905
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,069
outside, but we normally close inside.
Okay, which is why we don't get short

1906
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:46,079
Okay, which is why we don't get short
 

1907
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,390
Okay, which is why we don't get short
when we've just come down to it. Same as

1908
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:48,400
when we've just come down to it. Same as
 

1909
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,750
when we've just come down to it. Same as
everyone who tried to long at the top of

1910
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:49,760
everyone who tried to long at the top of
 

1911
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,190
everyone who tried to long at the top of
the Ballinger band, I don't know, two

1912
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,200
the Ballinger band, I don't know, two
 

1913
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,630
the Ballinger band, I don't know, two
weeks ago and got trapped. Same thing,

1914
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:52,640
weeks ago and got trapped. Same thing,
 

1915
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,030
weeks ago and got trapped. Same thing,
right? Sometimes we have black swan

1916
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:55,040
right? Sometimes we have black swan
 

1917
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,309
right? Sometimes we have black swan
events which change things. You know,

1918
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
events which change things. You know,
 

1919
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,150
events which change things. You know,
you go into COVID, you're going to slice

1920
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,160
you go into COVID, you're going to slice
 

1921
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,829
you go into COVID, you're going to slice
through those two standard deviations.

1922
00:45:59,829 --> 00:45:59,839
through those two standard deviations.
 

1923
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,589
through those two standard deviations.
If you trade small caps, you're going to

1924
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
If you trade small caps, you're going to
 

1925
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,270
If you trade small caps, you're going to
slice through three standard deviations.

1926
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:03,280
slice through three standard deviations.
 

1927
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,109
slice through three standard deviations.
Three standard deviations is normal for

1928
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
Three standard deviations is normal for
 

1929
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,829
Three standard deviations is normal for
small caps. Two standard deviations is

1930
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
small caps. Two standard deviations is
 

1931
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,030
small caps. Two standard deviations is
normal for the Q's and spy and the mega

1932
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,040
normal for the Q's and spy and the mega
 

1933
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,910
normal for the Q's and spy and the mega
caps because they move a bit slower.

1934
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:15,920

 

1935
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,309

Come on. We want more. You've got to get

1936
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:18,319
Come on. We want more. You've got to get
 

1937
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,990
Come on. We want more. You've got to get
higher here. I don't want this to just

1938
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:20,000
higher here. I don't want this to just
 

1939
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,510
higher here. I don't want this to just
sort of slowly roll over. We want a huge

1940
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
sort of slowly roll over. We want a huge
 

1941
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,230
sort of slowly roll over. We want a huge
face ripper where all the shorts get

1942
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,240
face ripper where all the shorts get
 

1943
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,190
face ripper where all the shorts get
scared, all the balls chase in, and then

1944
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
scared, all the balls chase in, and then
 

1945
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,750
scared, all the balls chase in, and then
they're met with a wall.

1946
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:31,760
they're met with a wall.
 

1947
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,870
they're met with a wall.
I tell you what though, that uh

1948
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880
I tell you what though, that uh
 

1949
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,630
I tell you what though, that uh
600 um cool wall or put wall I should

1950
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640
600 um cool wall or put wall I should
 

1951
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,790
600 um cool wall or put wall I should
say on QQQ held up, didn't it? All

1952
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
say on QQQ held up, didn't it? All

right. Big big transition here. I'm
 

1955
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,270
right. Big big transition here. I'm
still expecting higher prices, but we

1956
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,280
still expecting higher prices, but we
 

1957
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,030
still expecting higher prices, but we
are starting to see much more aggressive

1958
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
are starting to see much more aggressive
 

1959
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,710
are starting to see much more aggressive
selling up here. I want to see this move

1960
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
selling up here. I want to see this move
 

1961

You still look good. If you're in this
long, you look good.

Higher the better. Higher the better. I

1994
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:58,880
Higher the better. Higher the better. I
 

1995
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,230
Higher the better. Higher the better. I
want to treat this like a sort of

1996
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240
want to treat this like a sort of
 

1997
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,510
want to treat this like a sort of
blowoff top type scenario.

1998
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:03,520
blowoff top type scenario.
 

1999
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,870
blowoff top type scenario.
Still not I don't think there's enough

2000
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
Still not I don't think there's enough
 

2001
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,309
Still not I don't think there's enough
excess up here. It's starting to go

2002
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:06,319
excess up here. It's starting to go
 

2003
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,750
excess up here. It's starting to go
sideways. So, we could trap volume up

2004
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:07,760
sideways. So, we could trap volume up
 

2005
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,390
sideways. So, we could trap volume up
here and do like a volume shelf crack,

2006
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,400
here and do like a volume shelf crack,
 

2007
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,030
here and do like a volume shelf crack,
but I'd much rather see a squeeze out

2008
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,040
but I'd much rather see a squeeze out
 

2009
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,230
but I'd much rather see a squeeze out
than that play.

2010
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,240
than that play.
 

2011
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,230
than that play.
Here's the new H1. So, hopefully we can

2012
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
Here's the new H1. So, hopefully we can
 

2013
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,230
Here's the new H1. So, hopefully we can
make a new H1 H4 high here. One 1 2 3 4.

2014
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:22,240
make a new H1 H4 high here. One 1 2 3 4.
 

2015
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,630
make a new H1 H4 high here. One 1 2 3 4.
So, the H4's printed a new high. Yeah, a

2016
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640
So, the H4's printed a new high. Yeah, a
 

2017
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,790
So, the H4's printed a new high. Yeah, a
little squeeze higher and then sold into

2018
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:26,800
little squeeze higher and then sold into
 

2019
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,270
little squeeze higher and then sold into
would make sense on every time frame now

2020
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
would make sense on every time frame now
 

2021
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,030
would make sense on every time frame now
because we could rebalance this H1.

2022
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:31,040
because we could rebalance this H1.
 

2023
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,109
because we could rebalance this H1.
Please move higher first though. Please

going to give me an A+ setup. I'm

2028
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:37,440
going to give me an A+ setup. I'm
 

2029
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,349
going to give me an A+ setup. I'm
looking for H1 to make a new high above

Don't just leave this volume trapped

Remove this. Now, we don't need this,

It's going to be a pain. I want to move

Okay. If they keep rejecting this volume

2064
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:27,440
Okay. If they keep rejecting this volume
 

2065
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,430
Okay. If they keep rejecting this volume
here at 30s, there's potential for a

2066
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,440
here at 30s, there's potential for a
 

2067
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,950
here at 30s, there's potential for a
short. This is like a couple weeks ago.

2068
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
short. This is like a couple weeks ago.
 

2069

short. This is like a couple weeks ago.
I don't want to see this. I would much

2070
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:33,359
I don't want to see this. I would much
 

2071
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,190
I don't want to see this. I would much
rather we see three drives higher and

2072
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
rather we see three drives higher and
 

2073
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,430
rather we see three drives higher and
sold into. I don't think there's enough

2074
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
sold into. I don't think there's enough
 

2075
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,349
sold into. I don't think there's enough
excess here and we haven't made a new H1

2076
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
excess here and we haven't made a new H1
 

2077
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,950
excess here and we haven't made a new H1
high. Well, we have, but

2078
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
high. Well, we have, but
 

2079
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,549
high. Well, we have, but
we haven't. Sorry. I want to see us

2080
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:44,559
we haven't. Sorry. I want to see us
 

2081
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,309
we haven't. Sorry. I want to see us
print over whatever this is 70. I'd much

2082
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:48,319
print over whatever this is 70. I'd much
 

2083
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,870
print over whatever this is 70. I'd much
rather

2084
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:50,880
rather
 

2085
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,910
rather
we do this. If we reject this though,

2086
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:53,920
we do this. If we reject this though,
 

2087
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,670
we do this. If we reject this though,
it's a legit play. It's just not very

2088
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
it's a legit play. It's just not very
 

2089
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,230
it's a legit play. It's just not very
nice.

2090
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:58,240
nice.
 

2091
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,990
nice.
Ah,

2092
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,000

 

2093
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,710

please find a bid here.

up. Please go up. Please go up. Please
go up. Please go up. Please trap them.

2105
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,549
go up. Please go up. Please trap them.
Please trap them higher. I need you to

2106
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559
Please trap them higher. I need you to
 

2107
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,990
Please trap them higher. I need you to
take the low hanging fruits. The reason

2108
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:18,000
take the low hanging fruits. The reason
 

2109
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,589
take the low hanging fruits. The reason
being we're this close to previous day

2110
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
being we're this close to previous day
 

2111
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,470
being we're this close to previous day
low and value. Taking a short here is

2112
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:22,480
low and value. Taking a short here is
 

2113
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,150
low and value. Taking a short here is
very risky because we've not fulfilled

2114
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,160
very risky because we've not fulfilled
 

2115
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,829
very risky because we've not fulfilled
the obligation. Now we've got this close

2116
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:25,839
the obligation. Now we've got this close
 

2117
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,349
the obligation. Now we've got this close
to taking all this. we might as well

2118
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:27,359
to taking all this. we might as well
 

2119
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,190
to taking all this. we might as well
come and test it, which is where my

2120
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
come and test it, which is where my
 

2121
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,270
come and test it, which is where my
head's at. Please come and test it and

2122
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
head's at. Please come and test it and
 

2123
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,670
head's at. Please come and test it and
leave no more lowhanging fruits. So then

2124
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:33,680
leave no more lowhanging fruits. So then
 

2125
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,910
leave no more lowhanging fruits. So then
I know the trade should be downside.

2126
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:35,920
I know the trade should be downside.
 

2127
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,069
I know the trade should be downside.
Remember this is that H1 high. So a trap

2128
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:38,079
Remember this is that H1 high. So a trap
 

2129
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,589
Remember this is that H1 high. So a trap
over here would be absolutely ideal at

2130
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
over here would be absolutely ideal at
 

2131
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,270
over here would be absolutely ideal at
the moment. They keep rejecting this

2132
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,280
the moment. They keep rejecting this
 

2133
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,430
the moment. They keep rejecting this
volume up here.

2134
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,440
volume up here.
 

2135
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,270
volume up here.
They definitely keep rejecting volume up

2136
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:45,280
They definitely keep rejecting volume up
 

2137
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,190
They definitely keep rejecting volume up
here. Oh my god, you buggers.

2138
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200
here. Oh my god, you buggers.
 

2139
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,470
here. Oh my god, you buggers.
You absolute buggers.

2140
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480

 

2141
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,470

So A+ would be up here. This would be a

2142
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
So A+ would be up here. This would be a
 

2143
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,950
So A+ would be up here. This would be a
B a B setup I guess only because we're

2144
00:50:58,950 --> 00:50:58,960
B a B setup I guess only because we're
 

2145
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,870
B a B setup I guess only because we're
leaving lowh hanging fruit so close but

2146
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
leaving lowh hanging fruit so close but
 

2147
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,309
leaving lowh hanging fruit so close but
it's possible if they reject this volume

2148
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:02,319
it's possible if they reject this volume
 

2149
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,309
it's possible if they reject this volume
we do a full rotation back down into

2150
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:04,319
we do a full rotation back down into
 

2151
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,309
we do a full rotation back down into
839s. All right. So there's a 100 point

2152
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:06,319
839s. All right. So there's a 100 point
 

2153
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,030
839s. All right. So there's a 100 point
trade there available. I want to see us

2154
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:09,040
trade there available. I want to see us
 

2155
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,630
trade there available. I want to see us
come into here first to make that very

2156
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,640
come into here first to make that very
 

2157
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,710
come into here first to make that very
very clear. I want to see us trade

2158
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:12,720
very clear. I want to see us trade
 

2159
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,150
very clear. I want to see us trade
through this volume and squeeze higher.

2160
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,160
through this volume and squeeze higher.
 

2161
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,630
through this volume and squeeze higher.
But at the moment they are unwilling to

2162
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:16,640
But at the moment they are unwilling to
 

2163
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,109
But at the moment they are unwilling to
do it. We have left some buying excess

2164
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:19,119
do it. We have left some buying excess
 

2165
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,510
do it. We have left some buying excess
at those highs. We are over GlobeEx

2166
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:21,520
at those highs. We are over GlobeEx
 

2167
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,270
at those highs. We are over GlobeEx
though. We're over both VWAPs. It's

2168
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:23,280
though. We're over both VWAPs. It's
 

2169
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,470
though. We're over both VWAPs. It's
worth being aware of that. We are

2170
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
worth being aware of that. We are
 

2171
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,470
worth being aware of that. We are
holding flow zones. We have not flipped

2172
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:26,480
holding flow zones. We have not flipped
 

2173
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,349
holding flow zones. We have not flipped
yet. So, I'm trying to remain patient

2174
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:29,359
yet. So, I'm trying to remain patient
 

2175
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,270
yet. So, I'm trying to remain patient
here. I'm talking to you almost like I'm

2176
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,280
here. I'm talking to you almost like I'm
 

2177
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,549
here. I'm talking to you almost like I'm
talking to myself so you can see what

2178
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:32,559
talking to myself so you can see what
 

2179
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,990
talking to myself so you can see what
I'm thinking. I want this to trade

2180
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
I'm thinking. I want this to trade
 

2181
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,870
I'm thinking. I want this to trade
higher first because I think that is a

2182
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:36,880
higher first because I think that is a
 

2183
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,630
higher first because I think that is a
much much better trade. It would be a

2184
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:38,640
much much better trade. It would be a
 

2185
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,950
much much better trade. It would be a
much much better trade if we can trade

2186
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:40,960
much much better trade if we can trade
 

2187
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,030
much much better trade if we can trade
up anywhere into into previous day

2188
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
up anywhere into into previous day
 

2189
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,190
up anywhere into into previous day
value, previous day close, and then find

2190
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
value, previous day close, and then find
 

2191
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,349
value, previous day close, and then find
rejection after a blowoff top. But at

2192
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359
rejection after a blowoff top. But at
 

2193
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:48,950
rejection after a blowoff top. But at
the moment, this gray box, you can see

2194
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:48,960
the moment, this gray box, you can see
 

2195
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,390
the moment, this gray box, you can see
it's starting to reject. Point of

2196
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,400
it's starting to reject. Point of
 

2197
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,790
it's starting to reject. Point of
control is now up here. is now the most

2198
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:52,800
control is now up here. is now the most
 

2199
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,270
control is now up here. is now the most
traded level on the day is up here in

2200
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
traded level on the day is up here in
 

2201
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,190
traded level on the day is up here in
terms of volume. So, it's a big level.

2202
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:57,200
terms of volume. So, it's a big level.
 

2203
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,870
terms of volume. So, it's a big level.
We can get over that. Maybe we can get

2204
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
We can get over that. Maybe we can get
 

2205
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,270
We can get over that. Maybe we can get
up into here, which would be great. Come

2206
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
up into here, which would be great. Come
 

2207
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,670
up into here, which would be great. Come
on, market. Be kind. Give us the A+. Get

2208
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:03,680
on, market. Be kind. Give us the A+. Get
 

2209
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,829
on, market. Be kind. Give us the A+. Get
up into there. Squeeze everyone out and

2210
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:05,839
up into there. Squeeze everyone out and
 

2211
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,829
up into there. Squeeze everyone out and
then offer it.

2212
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:07,839
then offer it.
 

2213
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,470
then offer it.
Would I call this parabolic? Um, no, not

2214
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,480
Would I call this parabolic? Um, no, not
 

2215
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,510
Would I call this parabolic? Um, no, not
really. I mean, it's very aggressive.

2216
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
really. I mean, it's very aggressive.
 

2217
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,109
really. I mean, it's very aggressive.
It's very aggressive, but we have sort

2218
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:15,119
It's very aggressive, but we have sort
 

2219
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,030
It's very aggressive, but we have sort
of walked it. It's aggressive, but we've

2220
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040
of walked it. It's aggressive, but we've
 

2221
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,390
of walked it. It's aggressive, but we've
walked it. I'd say if they were all like

2222
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
walked it. I'd say if they were all like
 

2223
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,990
walked it. I'd say if they were all like
these candles, I would call that

2224
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,000
these candles, I would call that
 

2225
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,990
these candles, I would call that
parabolic. But this is like fairly

2226
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,000
parabolic. But this is like fairly
 

2227
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,670
parabolic. But this is like fairly
controlled right now. We need something

2228
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:23,680
controlled right now. We need something
 

2229
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,069
controlled right now. We need something
like this, like a big nasty candle and

2230
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:26,079
like this, like a big nasty candle and
 

2231
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,750
like this, like a big nasty candle and
then we leave a wick on it and we go see

2232
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:27,760
then we leave a wick on it and we go see
 

2233
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,549
then we leave a wick on it and we go see
you. Right. That's what I'm looking for.

2234
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
you. Right. That's what I'm looking for.
 

2235
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,470
you. Right. That's what I'm looking for.
It's a hard trade because the uh moves

2236
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:34,480
It's a hard trade because the uh moves
 

2237
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,230
It's a hard trade because the uh moves
are aggressive. You're still trading at

2238
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:36,240
are aggressive. You're still trading at
 

2239
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,270
are aggressive. You're still trading at
34 ATR per one minute candle here. Even

2240
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
34 ATR per one minute candle here. Even
 

2241
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,589
34 ATR per one minute candle here. Even
going sideways.

2242
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:41,599
going sideways.
 

2243
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,430
going sideways.
So if you're someone that risks 20

2244
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:43,440
So if you're someone that risks 20
 

2245
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,390
So if you're someone that risks 20
points a candle, you or 20 points to

2246
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,400
points a candle, you or 20 points to
 

2247
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,910
points a candle, you or 20 points to
trade, you can't trade this. So, you

2248
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:47,920
trade, you can't trade this. So, you
 

2249
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,309
trade, you can't trade this. So, you
need to size down so you can give

2250
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:50,319
need to size down so you can give
 

2251
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:56,630
need to size down so you can give
yourself more room.

2252
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640

 

2253
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,069

Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, Scott.

2254
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:58,079
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, Scott.
 

2255
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,510
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, Scott.
That's what I need to see. We're still

2256
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,520
That's what I need to see. We're still
 

2257
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,430
That's what I need to see. We're still
rejecting this volume, though. Oh my

2258
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
rejecting this volume, though. Oh my
 

2259
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,069
rejecting this volume, though. Oh my
god. This is getting heavy. This is not

2260
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
god. This is getting heavy. This is not
 

2261
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,190
god. This is getting heavy. This is not
what I wanted. But, uh, you can see this

2262
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:07,200
what I wanted. But, uh, you can see this
 

2263
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,950
what I wanted. But, uh, you can see this
volume just rejected. They failed to

2264
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:08,960
volume just rejected. They failed to
 

2265
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,549
volume just rejected. They failed to
make a new high. They did just reject

2266
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:10,559
make a new high. They did just reject
 

2267
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:16,630
make a new high. They did just reject
it. This is getting heavy here. Oh gosh.

2268
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640

 

2269
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,230

This is not what we want. Can they do a

2270
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:18,240
This is not what we want. Can they do a
 

2271
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,309
This is not what we want. Can they do a
two-legged hold and go higher? Pretty

2272
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:20,319
two-legged hold and go higher? Pretty
 

2273
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,990
two-legged hold and go higher? Pretty

2286
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319

 

2287
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,030

What we going to do team?

2288
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:41,040
What we going to do team?
 

2289
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,630
What we going to do team?
It's building out thicker volume here as

2290
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
It's building out thicker volume here as
 

2291
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,230
It's building out thicker volume here as
well to make it very tricky. So, this

2292
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,240
well to make it very tricky. So, this
 

2293
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,069
well to make it very tricky. So, this
has gone from being here to really

2294
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:46,079
has gone from being here to really
 

2295
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,589
has gone from being here to really
they've built it out all the way down to

2296
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
they've built it out all the way down to
 

2297
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,670
they've built it out all the way down to
here now, which is not ideal, is it?

2298
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,680
here now, which is not ideal, is it?
 

2299
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,349
here now, which is not ideal, is it?
Look how much thicker we've got because

2300
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:51,359
Look how much thicker we've got because
 

2301
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,870
Look how much thicker we've got because
we've traded in this range. They've made

2302
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:52,880
we've traded in this range. They've made
 

2303
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,390
we've traded in this range. They've made
a very big range up here. Much better

2304
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:54,400
a very big range up here. Much better
 

2305
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,470
a very big range up here. Much better
when the ranges are small in terms of

2306
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:56,480
when the ranges are small in terms of
 

2307
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,230
when the ranges are small in terms of
being able to risk off. So, let's just

2308
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
being able to risk off. So, let's just
 

2309
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,790
being able to risk off. So, let's just
see. And still no position for me. I'm

2310
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:00,800
see. And still no position for me. I'm
 

2311
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,030
see. And still no position for me. I'm
still I know what I want to see. I've

2312
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040

If we start basing, I want to make this

If we start basing, I want to make this
really clear. I will not short. It would

really clear. I will not short. It would
 

2355
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,870
really clear. I will not short. It would
just mean I'm wrong on my thesis. If we

00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:54,880
just mean I'm wrong on my thesis. If we

2447
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,630

This is tight and gross.

2448
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
This is tight and gross.

PC here. This this candle structure here
 

2455
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,349
PC here. This this candle structure here
is really bad. All right. So on

2456
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:27,359
is really bad. All right. So on
 

2457
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,710
is really bad. All right. So on
basically from 63 we have a void from 63

2458
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
basically from 63 we have a void from 63
 

2459
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,630
basically from 63 we have a void from 63
up to 80. There was no transactions

2460
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
up to 80. There was no transactions
 

2461
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,670
up to 80. There was no transactions
really above 80 in terms of market. The

2462
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:35,680
really above 80 in terms of market. The
 

2463
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,030
really above 80 in terms of market. The
delta there a little bit. You can see

2464
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,040
delta there a little bit. You can see
 

2465
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,870
delta there a little bit. You can see
delta was buy side but it wasn't great

2466
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:38,880
delta was buy side but it wasn't great
 

2467
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,190
delta was buy side but it wasn't great

2468
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:41,200
up there. It's not a good looking candle
 

2469
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,510
up there. It's not a good looking candle
for a reversal at the moment. But let's

2470
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,520
for a reversal at the moment. But let's
 

2471
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,150
for a reversal at the moment. But let's
just see. Still not seeing exactly what

2472
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:46,160
just see. Still not seeing exactly what
 

2473
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,349
just see. Still not seeing exactly what
I want. But we're back to the edge of

I want. But we're back to the edge of
 

2475
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,390
I want. But we're back to the edge of
this shelf. We can pull this gray out.

2476
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:50,400
this shelf. We can pull this gray out.
 

2477
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,309
this shelf. We can pull this gray out.
I'm still not convinced the top is in

chase down here. They can still soak
this. Want to see how we act into this

2622
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:46,480
this. Want to see how we act into this
 

2623
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,230
this. Want to see how we act into this
shelf here at 15s. We've left an

2624
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
shelf here at 15s. We've left an
 

2625
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,390
shelf here at 15s. We've left an
imbalance at 40s. So, that's probably

2626
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:50,400
imbalance at 40s. So, that's probably
 

2627
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,430
imbalance at 40s. So, that's probably
the key level. If they fail back into

2628
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
the key level. If they fail back into
 

2629
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,109
the key level. If they fail back into
this shelf, we're going to move lower.

2630
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,119
this shelf, we're going to move lower.
 

2631
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,549
this shelf, we're going to move lower.
We're just at VWAP right now. I need to

2632
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:56,559
We're just at VWAP right now. I need to
 

2633
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,990
We're just at VWAP right now. I need to
be careful here.

2634
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
be careful here.
 

2635
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,910
be careful here.
No position. Missed missed my entry

2636
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:01,920
No position. Missed missed my entry
 

2637
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,230
No position. Missed missed my entry
there, unfortunately. That was probably

2638
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,240
there, unfortunately. That was probably
 

2639
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,069
there, unfortunately. That was probably
it now. I've probably missed it, folks.

2640
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:06,079
it now. I've probably missed it, folks.
 

2641
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,109
it now. I've probably missed it, folks.
I've probably missed it. I'm going to be

2642
01:01:07,109 --> 01:01:07,119
I've probably missed it. I'm going to be
 

2643
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,950
I've probably missed it. I'm going to be
honest with you. That was probably That

2644
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:08,960
honest with you. That was probably That
 

2645
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,190
honest with you. That was probably That
wick there was probably it into 17s. me

2646
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:11,200
wick there was probably it into 17s. me
 

2647
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,789
wick there was probably it into 17s. me
waiting for 40s was probably a bit

2648
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:12,799
waiting for 40s was probably a bit
 

2649
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,190
waiting for 40s was probably a bit
greedy, but let's see.

2650
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,200
greedy, but let's see.
 

2651
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,870
greedy, but let's see.
We didn't take low hanging fruit above.

2652
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
We didn't take low hanging fruit above.
 

2653
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,309
We didn't take low hanging fruit above.
That is one thing I'm very very aware

2654
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:18,319
That is one thing I'm very very aware
 

2655
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,109
That is one thing I'm very very aware
of. Yeah, 200 on the 5minute.

I'm not going to get my entry. I'm going
 

2665
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,950
I'm not going to get my entry. I'm going
to be very upset, man.

Very hard when you're this patient and

2668
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:34,400
Very hard when you're this patient and
 

2669
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,750
Very hard when you're this patient and
then you miss it.

2670
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
then you miss it.
 

2671
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,030
then you miss it.
They're trying to buy this and they're

2672
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:39,040
They're trying to buy this and they're
 

2673
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,150
They're trying to buy this and they're
not getting a move higher here. There's

2674
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:40,160
not getting a move higher here. There's
 

2675
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,430
not getting a move higher here. There's
a passive seller here. They're trying to

2676
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:41,440
a passive seller here. They're trying to

buy. I want to see a squeeze higher
 

2679
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,430
buy. I want to see a squeeze higher
first.

2680
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:45,440
first.
 

2681
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,510
first.
Oh, you [\h__\h] You're really not going

2682
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:47,520
Oh, you [\h__\h] You're really not going
 

2683
01:01:47,520 --> 01:02:01,190
Oh, you [\h__\h] You're really not going
to let me in at all.

2684
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200

 

2685
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,589

Be calm.

2686

Be calm.
 

2687
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,270
Be calm.
I think it's cooked, guys. I think I

2688
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:05,280
I think it's cooked, guys. I think I
 

2689
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,829
I think it's cooked, guys. I think I
think I think that was it. I think that

2690
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
think I think that was it. I think that
 

2691
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,630
think I think that was it. I think that
was it. I think that was it. I think

2692
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:10,640
was it. I think that was it. I think
 

2693
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,470
was it. I think that was it. I think
Alex has missed it. I think we didn't

2694
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:12,480
Alex has missed it. I think we didn't
 

2695
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,309
Alex has missed it. I think we didn't
repric and they're trapped now. [\h__\h] So

2696
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:16,319
repric and they're trapped now. [\h__\h] So
 

2697
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,950
repric and they're trapped now. [\h__\h] So
patient.

2698
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:18,960
patient.
 

2699
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,150
patient.
Okay, so I'll tell you what I'm looking

2700
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,160
Okay, so I'll tell you what I'm looking
 

2701
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,990
Okay, so I'll tell you what I'm looking
at on the order flow. There was an

2702
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000
at on the order flow. There was an
 

2703
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,270
at on the order flow. There was an
exchange at 1010 and uh that level of

2704
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
exchange at 1010 and uh that level of
 

2705
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,670
exchange at 1010 and uh that level of
24,941

2706
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
24,941
 

2707
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,390
24,941
was massive. We failed under it and I

2708
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400
was massive. We failed under it and I
 

2709
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,829
was massive. We failed under it and I
was just looking for one more retest

2710
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:33,839
was just looking for one more retest
 

2711
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,430
was just looking for one more retest
into it at that point and it hasn't

2712
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,440
into it at that point and it hasn't
 

2713
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,309
into it at that point and it hasn't
come. So 941 which is up here. So this

2714
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:40,319
come. So 941 which is up here. So this
 

2715
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,069
come. So 941 which is up here. So this
exchange here at PC was really big in

2716
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
exchange here at PC was really big in
 

2717
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,589
exchange here at PC was really big in
these candles here and this was the

2718
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:45,599
these candles here and this was the
 

2719
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,910
these candles here and this was the
transition from buy delta to sell delta

2720
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:47,920
transition from buy delta to sell delta
 

2721
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,270
transition from buy delta to sell delta
and I was waiting just waiting for that

2722
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
and I was waiting just waiting for that
 

2723
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,030
and I was waiting just waiting for that
little look there and all that we did is

2724
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:51,040
little look there and all that we did is
 

2725
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,710
little look there and all that we did is
fail this volume and that volume is now

2726
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:52,720
fail this volume and that volume is now
 

2727
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,230
fail this volume and that volume is now
trapped. You're probably going to get a

2728
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
trapped. You're probably going to get a
 

2729
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,829
trapped. You're probably going to get a
wash. Now if I get very lucky

2730
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:57,839
wash. Now if I get very lucky
 

2731
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,390
wash. Now if I get very lucky
they offer this and I see selling in

2732
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
they offer this and I see selling in
 

2733
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,990
they offer this and I see selling in
here and I can consider it. What's

2734
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,000
here and I can consider it. What's
 

2735
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,750
here and I can consider it. What's
careful now is one, two, and if they

2736
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:03,760
careful now is one, two, and if they
 

2737
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,030
careful now is one, two, and if they
reclaim again, they still have

2738
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:05,040
reclaim again, they still have
 

2739
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,750
reclaim again, they still have
lowhanging fruit. So, still no position

2740
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:07,760
lowhanging fruit. So, still no position
 

2741
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:14,630
lowhanging fruit. So, still no position
for me. Let's see. Let's see.

2742
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640

 

2743
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,390

At least you get to see emotions raw.

2744
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
At least you get to see emotions raw.
 

2745
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,950
At least you get to see emotions raw.
You get to see how patient I am and how

2746
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
You get to see how patient I am and how
 

2747
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,470
You get to see how patient I am and how
sometimes it just doesn't come. Okay,

2748
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
sometimes it just doesn't come. Okay,
 

2749
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,309
sometimes it just doesn't come. Okay,
maybe they come back to that 41 now.

2750
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:22,319
maybe they come back to that 41 now.
 

2751
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,029
maybe they come back to that 41 now.
Let's see.

2752
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
Let's see.
 

2753
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,270
Let's see.
So, 35 to 52 with 41 being the thickest

2754
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
So, 35 to 52 with 41 being the thickest
 

2755
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,750
So, 35 to 52 with 41 being the thickest
level. 35 to 52. If they trade through

2756
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
level. 35 to 52. If they trade through
 

2757
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,789
level. 35 to 52. If they trade through
that, we're going to make new highs.

2758
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:36,799

 

2759
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,510

Here we come. Almost there at 35. 35 to

2760
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,520
Here we come. Almost there at 35. 35 to
 

2761
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:45,510
Here we come. Almost there at 35. 35 to
52 is where there's no volume at all.

2762
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520

 

2763
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,589

Watching the book here. If we just buy

2764
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:47,599
Watching the book here. If we just buy
 

2765
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:48,870
Watching the book here. If we just buy
through this, we go straight back to new

2766
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:48,880
through this, we go straight back to new
 

2767
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,510
through this, we go straight back to new
highs because it's done a two leg.

2768
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,520
highs because it's done a two leg.
 

2769
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,309
highs because it's done a two leg.
Very calm here. They're not repricing

2770
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:54,319
Very calm here. They're not repricing
 

2771
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:58,789
Very calm here. They're not repricing
yet. 35 to 52.

2772
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799

 

2773
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,870

They've tapped the imbalance. There's

2774
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:00,880
They've tapped the imbalance. There's
 

2775
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,789
They've tapped the imbalance. There's
some sellers up there. No aggressive

2776
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
some sellers up there. No aggressive
 

2777
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,630
some sellers up there. No aggressive
buying up there. We're rejecting it so

2778
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
buying up there. We're rejecting it so
 

2779
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,069
buying up there. We're rejecting it so
far. Bit early though. Structure- wise

2780
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079
far. Bit early though. Structure- wise
 

2781
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,829
far. Bit early though. Structure- wise
still bullish. I would say structure

2782
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:09,839
still bullish. I would say structure
 

2783
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,470
still bullish. I would say structure
wise still bullish. Here's the imbalance

2784
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
wise still bullish. Here's the imbalance
 

2785
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,710
wise still bullish. Here's the imbalance
being tagged into. Okay, this is the

2786
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:14,720
being tagged into. Okay, this is the
 

2787
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,029
being tagged into. Okay, this is the
area. If they don't reject, if we trade

2788
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
area. If they don't reject, if we trade
 

2789
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,710
area. If they don't reject, if we trade
through this new highs, trading through

2790
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
through this new highs, trading through
 

2791
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,430
through this new highs, trading through
it, not touching it. So, no short here

2792
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:21,440
it, not touching it. So, no short here
 

2793
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,870
it, not touching it. So, no short here
for me because we've just traded

2794
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:22,880
for me because we've just traded
 

2795
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,470
for me because we've just traded
straight through it. So, would have had

2796
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,480
straight through it. So, would have had
 

2797
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,829
straight through it. So, would have had
to see sellers defend that and not

2798
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:25,839
to see sellers defend that and not
 

2799
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,549
to see sellers defend that and not
seeing it. So, no entry still.

2800
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
seeing it. So, no entry still.
 

2801
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,710
seeing it. So, no entry still.
I'm just watching the order flow.

2802
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:32,720
I'm just watching the order flow.
 

2803
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,390
I'm just watching the order flow.
So, I expect new highs now at this

2804
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:34,400
So, I expect new highs now at this
 

2805
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,990
So, I expect new highs now at this
point. Now, we've got this flat top with

2806
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
point. Now, we've got this flat top with
 

2807
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,789
point. Now, we've got this flat top with
no excess. Traded through the imbalance,

2808
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:38,799
no excess. Traded through the imbalance,
 

2809
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,870
no excess. Traded through the imbalance,
reclaimed this volume. No rejection.

2810
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:40,880
reclaimed this volume. No rejection.
 

2811
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,029
reclaimed this volume. No rejection.
There was nothing in here for me to see

2812
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:43,039
There was nothing in here for me to see
 

2813
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,390
There was nothing in here for me to see
a rejection, which is why there was no

2814
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:44,400
a rejection, which is why there was no
 

2815
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,750
a rejection, which is why there was no
entry. I thought maybe that would have

2816
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:45,760
entry. I thought maybe that would have
 

2817
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,670
entry. I thought maybe that would have
been it and they flew away, but they've

2818
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:47,680
been it and they flew away, but they've
 

2819
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,750
been it and they flew away, but they've
reclaimed and now you know what they're

2820
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
reclaimed and now you know what they're
 

2821
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,190
reclaimed and now you know what they're
looking for. Previous day value low,

Hands off the mouse. Off the mouse.

Are they adding liquidity higher?

2858
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:47,440

2861
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,750

which would be

2862
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:51,760
which would be
 

2863
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,470
which would be
gap fill. Okay.

01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,200
waiting. I I'm very interested. Just
 

2871
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,029
waiting. I I'm very interested. Just
still not quite seen what I want. We're

2872
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:07,039
still not quite seen what I want. We're
 

2873
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,190
still not quite seen what I want. We're
close. We're close to it. I've just not

2874
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:09,200
close. We're close to it. I've just not
 

2875
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,029
close. We're close to it. I've just not
quite seen what I want yet. VIX also

2876
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:11,039
quite seen what I want yet. VIX also
 

2877
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,950
quite seen what I want yet. VIX also
just rejected 22. Worth being aware of

2878
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
just rejected 22. Worth being aware of
 

2879
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,349
just rejected 22. Worth being aware of
coming back down to PDH. VIX needs to

2880
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
coming back down to PDH. VIX needs to
 

2881
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,870
coming back down to PDH. VIX needs to
hold bids between 2160 and 21. If VIX

2882
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
hold bids between 2160 and 21. If VIX
 

2883
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,789
hold bids between 2160 and 21. If VIX
can't hold a bid between that level, all

2884
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:20,799
can't hold a bid between that level, all
 

2885
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,150
can't hold a bid between that level, all
shorts will be off the table today

2886
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
shorts will be off the table today
 

2887
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,150
shorts will be off the table today
because we will probably snap back down

2888
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,160
because we will probably snap back down
 

2889
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,349
because we will probably snap back down
lower, which will allow a bigger relief.

2890
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:29,359

 

2891
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,190

Time and sales. Yeah, when I'm order

2892
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:31,200
Time and sales. Yeah, when I'm order
 

2893
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,069
Time and sales. Yeah, when I'm order
flow is time and sales, mate. So,

2894
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
flow is time and sales, mate. So,
 

2895
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,390
flow is time and sales, mate. So,
I'm looking at I don't look at the time

2896
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
I'm looking at I don't look at the time
 

2897
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,270
I'm looking at I don't look at the time
and sales for what goes through on a on

2898
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:41,280
and sales for what goes through on a on
 

2899
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,190
and sales for what goes through on a on
a physical time and sales. I look at it

2900
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:43,200
a physical time and sales. I look at it
 

2901
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,190
a physical time and sales. I look at it
on bookmap. That's what that is time and

2902
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,200
on bookmap. That's what that is time and
 

2903
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,870
on bookmap. That's what that is time and
sales. All right. This is time and

2904
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:46,880
sales. All right. This is time and
 

2905
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,309
sales. All right. This is time and
sales. I can see what's going through

2906
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:48,319
sales. I can see what's going through
 

2907
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,390
sales. I can see what's going through
with the bubbles. So, it's just a visual

2908
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,400
with the bubbles. So, it's just a visual
 

2909
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,950
with the bubbles. So, it's just a visual
representation. The bubbles being market

2910
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:52,960
representation. The bubbles being market
 

2911
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,990
representation. The bubbles being market
orders, the uh lines being the limit

2912
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:56,000
orders, the uh lines being the limit
 

2913
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,510
orders, the uh lines being the limit
orders, right? And then I can see the

2914
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,520
orders, right? And then I can see the
 

2915
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,589
orders, right? And then I can see the
transactions here of who's taking

2916
01:06:59,589 --> 01:06:59,599
transactions here of who's taking
 

2917
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,029
transactions here of who's taking
control. I still want to see this higher

2918
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:01,039
control. I still want to see this higher
 

2919
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,230
control. I still want to see this higher
at this point.

2920
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
at this point.
 

2921
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,069
at this point.
I had my hands on the mouse as you said,

2922
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
I had my hands on the mouse as you said,
 

2923

just good to

2928
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:11,119
just good to
 

2929
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,910
just good to
let it let it set up. Let it present

2930
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:13,920
let it let it set up. Let it present
 

2931
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,910
let it let it set up. Let it present
itself. At the moment, we're still going

2932
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:15,920
itself. At the moment, we're still going
 

2933
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,430
itself. At the moment, we're still going
sideways. We can still build this volume

2934
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,440
sideways. We can still build this volume
 

2935
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,430
sideways. We can still build this volume
up. I want to see this trade higher at

2936
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:19,440
up. I want to see this trade higher at
 

2937
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,270
up. I want to see this trade higher at
this point. If we fail from here, it's a

2938
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,280
this point. If we fail from here, it's a
 

2939
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:32,390
this point. If we fail from here, it's a
very, very ugly move.

2940
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400

 

2941
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,589

MC guy, I took 46s down to 73s towards

2942
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:35,599
MC guy, I took 46s down to 73s towards
 

2943
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,270
MC guy, I took 46s down to 73s towards
the VWAP using footprint and your

2944
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:37,280
the VWAP using footprint and your
 

2945
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,430
the VWAP using footprint and your
education. I'm more of a lurker after

2946
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:39,440
education. I'm more of a lurker after
 

2947
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,430
education. I'm more of a lurker after
four months of tuning in every day and

2948
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
four months of tuning in every day and
 

2949
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,950
four months of tuning in every day and
starting to take my own trades for

2950
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:42,960
starting to take my own trades for
 

2951
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,029
starting to take my own trades for
confidence. I'm a slow learner, but I do

2952
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
confidence. I'm a slow learner, but I do
 

2953
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,870
confidence. I'm a slow learner, but I do
learn. Thank you for do all you do.

2954
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:46,880
learn. Thank you for do all you do.
 

2955
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,470
learn. Thank you for do all you do.
You're welcome, dude. Good trade. Okay,

2956
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
You're welcome, dude. Good trade. Okay,
 

2957
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,109
You're welcome, dude. Good trade. Okay,
back to PC. Back into this volume shelf.

2958
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:51,119
back to PC. Back into this volume shelf.
 

2959
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,390
back to PC. Back into this volume shelf.
This was where the big exchange

2960
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:52,400
This was where the big exchange
 

2961
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,470
This was where the big exchange
happened. What, five minutes ago or so?

2962
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:54,480
happened. What, five minutes ago or so?
 

2963
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,430
happened. What, five minutes ago or so?
Oh, don't don't make it so hard. ENQ,

2964
01:07:59,430 --> 01:07:59,440
Oh, don't don't make it so hard. ENQ,
 

2965
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:08,069
Oh, don't don't make it so hard. ENQ,
don't get up.

2966
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:08,079

 

2967
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,829

I think we're going to go into an IB

2968
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:09,839
I think we're going to go into an IB
 

2969
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:11,829
I think we're going to go into an IB
rotation day. We've got 10 minutes left

2970
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:11,839
rotation day. We've got 10 minutes left
 

2971
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,750
rotation day. We've got 10 minutes left
to IB. I just want this IB to be

2972
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:13,760
to IB. I just want this IB to be
 

2973
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:20,070
to IB. I just want this IB to be
expanded a little bit more. Come on.

2974
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:20,080

 

2975
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,829

I think this is probably retail buying

2976
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:21,839
I think this is probably retail buying
 

2977
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,430
I think this is probably retail buying
short covering and then we're going to

2978
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,440
short covering and then we're going to
 

2979
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:30,470
short covering and then we're going to
see what institutions want to do soon.

2980
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:30,480

 

2981
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,669

No, stop failing here. Stop failing

2982
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
No, stop failing here. Stop failing
 

2983
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,550
No, stop failing here. Stop failing
here.

2984
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:38,560

 

2985
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,149

We're going into a range now.

2986
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:42,159
We're going into a range now.
 

2987
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,669
We're going into a range now.
As you can see, we're just creating a

2988
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
As you can see, we're just creating a
 

2989
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,430
As you can see, we're just creating a
range now. And we've got no excess. This

2990
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,440
range now. And we've got no excess. This
 

2991
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,349
range now. And we've got no excess. This
is a look below and fail. This is a

2992
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:47,359
is a look below and fail. This is a
 

2993
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,510
is a look below and fail. This is a
reclaim. This is no excess. I want to

2994
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520
reclaim. This is no excess. I want to
 

2995
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,789
reclaim. This is no excess. I want to
see excess up into here. If we base

2996
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799
see excess up into here. If we base
 

2997
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,590
see excess up into here. If we base
above this, there is no short trade. I

2998
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:55,600
above this, there is no short trade. I
 

2999
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,149
above this, there is no short trade. I
want that to be very, very clear. I am

3000
01:08:58,149 --> 01:08:58,159
want that to be very, very clear. I am
 

3001
01:08:58,159 --> 01:08:59,910
want that to be very, very clear. I am
looking for something like this. And

3002
01:08:59,910 --> 01:08:59,920
looking for something like this. And
 

3003
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,149
looking for something like this. And
then I'll add on under here as well. If

3004
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,159
then I'll add on under here as well. If
 

3005
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:04,789
then I'll add on under here as well. If
we base above this, there is no short

3006
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
we base above this, there is no short
 

3007
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,950
we base above this, there is no short
trade. That would be a rotational day

3008
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
trade. That would be a rotational day
 

3009
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,630
trade. That would be a rotational day
inside of yesterday's range. It's not

3010
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,640
inside of yesterday's range. It's not
 

3011
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,910
inside of yesterday's range. It's not
what I want to see. If they want to come

3012
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:09,920
what I want to see. If they want to come
 

3013
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,829
what I want to see. If they want to come
all the way up to yesterday's point of

3014
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:11,839
all the way up to yesterday's point of
 

3015
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,590
all the way up to yesterday's point of
control, yesterday's value area high,

3016
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,600
control, yesterday's value area high,
 

3017
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,510
control, yesterday's value area high,
they can do so on a squeeze. So, you

3018
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:15,520
they can do so on a squeeze. So, you
 

3019
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,269
they can do so on a squeeze. So, you
cannot be front side in this. If this is

3020
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:17,279
cannot be front side in this. If this is
 

3021
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,709
cannot be front side in this. If this is
accumulation, they're like, "Fuck it.

3022
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:18,719
accumulation, they're like, "Fuck it.
 

3023
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,550
accumulation, they're like, "Fuck it.
We're going all the way back here." So

3024
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:20,560
We're going all the way back here." So
 

3025
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,470
We're going all the way back here." So
be it. It means the trade sets up for

3026
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:22,480
be it. It means the trade sets up for
 

3027
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,550
be it. It means the trade sets up for
Monday. I know what I'm looking for. If

3028
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:24,560
Monday. I know what I'm looking for. If
 

3029
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,669
Monday. I know what I'm looking for. If
it doesn't happen today, it's going to

3030
01:09:25,669 --> 01:09:25,679
it doesn't happen today, it's going to
 

3031
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,470
it doesn't happen today, it's going to
come Monday.

3032
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,480

 

3033
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,590

Big exchange. How long to the new 5

3034
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,600
Big exchange. How long to the new 5
 

3035
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,189
Big exchange. How long to the new 5
minute? 9 minutes until new 15minute

3036
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
minute? 9 minutes until new 15minute
 

3037
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:38,870
minute? 9 minutes until new 15minute
bar.

3038
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:38,880

3039
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,550
bar.
And we're just range rotating here.

3040
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
And we're just range rotating here.
 

3041
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,950
And we're just range rotating here.
What's ES doing? Stuck at GlobeEx. Stuck

3042
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:44,960
What's ES doing? Stuck at GlobeEx. Stuck
 

3043
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,789
What's ES doing? Stuck at GlobeEx. Stuck
at 50day. I want to see ES get up to

3044
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:46,799
at 50day. I want to see ES get up to
 

3045
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,430
at 50day. I want to see ES get up to
previous day low as well.

3046
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:49,440
previous day low as well.
 

3047
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,910
previous day low as well.
Come on market.

3048
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:53,920

 

3049
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,470

Yeah. So, sorry folks. Nothing I can do

3050
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:56,480
Yeah. So, sorry folks. Nothing I can do
 

3051
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,070
Yeah. So, sorry folks. Nothing I can do
here. Just waiting for my setup to come.

3052
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
here. Just waiting for my setup to come.
 

3053
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,270
here. Just waiting for my setup to come.
Any of you who took the long, the

3054
01:09:59,270 --> 01:09:59,280
Any of you who took the long, the
 

3055
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,830
Any of you who took the long, the
counter trend, good for you. Really nice

3056
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:01,840
counter trend, good for you. Really nice
 

3057
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,990
counter trend, good for you. Really nice
trade. Soon as you reclaimed New York

3058
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
trade. Soon as you reclaimed New York
 

3059
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,070
trade. Soon as you reclaimed New York
really and trigger over here was the

3060
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:06,080
really and trigger over here was the
 

3061
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,550
really and trigger over here was the
squeeze really. 65. Like I said, I'm

3062
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:08,560
squeeze really. 65. Like I said, I'm
 

3063
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,070
squeeze really. 65. Like I said, I'm
focused on one side of the trade, which

3064
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
focused on one side of the trade, which
 

3065
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:15,510
focused on one side of the trade, which
is the protrend side.

3066
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520

 

3067
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,550

Delta at 50 still buy side delta at 50.

3068
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
Delta at 50 still buy side delta at 50.
 

3069
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,590
Delta at 50 still buy side delta at 50.
It's a it's a big exchange there.

3070
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600
It's a it's a big exchange there.
 

3071
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,590
It's a it's a big exchange there.
So, it's a bit of an outlier that 50.

3072
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:23,600
So, it's a bit of an outlier that 50.
 

3073
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,750
So, it's a bit of an outlier that 50.
165 buy side and then 52 100 lot uh

3074
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
165 buy side and then 52 100 lot uh
 

3075
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,990
165 buy side and then 52 100 lot uh
sellside delta. So, those are the those

3076
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
sellside delta. So, those are the those
 

3077
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,950
sellside delta. So, those are the those
50s are a big uh big battle zone.

3078
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:34,960
50s are a big uh big battle zone.
 

3079
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,870
50s are a big uh big battle zone.
We had imbalances there for

3080
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:38,880
We had imbalances there for
 

3081
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,669
We had imbalances there for
where's my mouse? Imbalances there at

3082
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:41,679
where's my mouse? Imbalances there at
 

3083
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,470
where's my mouse? Imbalances there at
10:11 10:16 and now we're just sort of

3084
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:44,480
10:11 10:16 and now we're just sort of
 

3085
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,070
10:11 10:16 and now we're just sort of
basing around those zones. I want to see

3086
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,080
basing around those zones. I want to see
 

3087
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:52,630
basing around those zones. I want to see
this trade higher.

3088
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:52,640

 

3089
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,950

Love my patience and consistency. Hey,

3090
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960
Love my patience and consistency. Hey,
 

3091
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,270
Love my patience and consistency. Hey,
the consistency came from being patient,

3092
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
the consistency came from being patient,
 

3093
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,550
the consistency came from being patient,
letting the trade come to me and then

3094
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
letting the trade come to me and then
 

3095
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,910
letting the trade come to me and then
waiting to to see the setup. And also

3096
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:01,920
waiting to to see the setup. And also
 

3097
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,149
waiting to to see the setup. And also
understanding if it doesn't set up,

3098
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:04,159
understanding if it doesn't set up,
 

3099
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,149
understanding if it doesn't set up,
there's nothing lost, right? Like if it

3100
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
there's nothing lost, right? Like if it
 

3101
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:07,750
there's nothing lost, right? Like if it
doesn't set up, having to get that into

3102
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:07,760
doesn't set up, having to get that into
 

3103
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,910
doesn't set up, having to get that into
my head. If I don't get the trade today,

3104
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,920
my head. If I don't get the trade today,
 

3105
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,510
my head. If I don't get the trade today,
I will get this trade on Monday or

3106
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,520
I will get this trade on Monday or
 

3107
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,910
I will get this trade on Monday or
Tuesday, right? The same as we tra we

3108
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:13,920
Tuesday, right? The same as we tra we
 

3109
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,750
Tuesday, right? The same as we tra we
tried Wednesday. We were looking for

3110
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
tried Wednesday. We were looking for
 

3111
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,350
tried Wednesday. We were looking for
that clean out of those lows. Didn't

3112
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:17,360
that clean out of those lows. Didn't
 

3113
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,950
that clean out of those lows. Didn't
come. We had a couple attempts, didn't

3114
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
come. We had a couple attempts, didn't
 

3115
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,470
come. We had a couple attempts, didn't
come. We made money, but it wasn't what

3116
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:20,480
come. We made money, but it wasn't what
 

3117
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,790
come. We made money, but it wasn't what
we wanted. Yesterday, we get it right.

3118
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,800
we wanted. Yesterday, we get it right.
 

3119
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:30,870
we wanted. Yesterday, we get it right.
We get the exact move. We get it.

3120
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:30,880

 

3121
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,709

Nice fall forward. Very nice. Okay, back

3122
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:34,719
Nice fall forward. Very nice. Okay, back
 

3123
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:37,189
Nice fall forward. Very nice. Okay, back
to GlobeEx again.

3124
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:37,199
to GlobeEx again.
 

3125
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,350
to GlobeEx again.
Some stronger selling here again. Still

3126
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:39,360
Some stronger selling here again. Still
 

3127
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,189
Some stronger selling here again. Still
not making excess at those highs, which

3128
01:11:41,189 --> 01:11:41,199
not making excess at those highs, which
 

3129
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,950
not making excess at those highs, which
concerns me, but we're coming back to

3130
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:42,960
concerns me, but we're coming back to
 

3131
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,390
concerns me, but we're coming back to
the bottom side of this range. This is

3132
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:44,400
the bottom side of this range. This is
 

3133
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,070
the bottom side of this range. This is
where they keep bidding off. They fail

3134
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
where they keep bidding off. They fail
 

3135
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,350
where they keep bidding off. They fail
this range. There is a collapse

3136
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:47,360
this range. There is a collapse
 

3137
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,350
this range. There is a collapse
possible. The moment they keep holding

3138
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
possible. The moment they keep holding
 

3139
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,950
possible. The moment they keep holding
this range, and we haven't put excess at

3140
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:50,960
this range, and we haven't put excess at
 

3141
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,390
this range, and we haven't put excess at
the highs. Still not seeing what I'd

3142
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:52,400
the highs. Still not seeing what I'd
 

3143
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,070
the highs. Still not seeing what I'd
want. I'd need to see us leave this

3144
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,080
want. I'd need to see us leave this
 

3145
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,070
want. I'd need to see us leave this
range aggressively. Now, if I'm

3146
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:56,080
range aggressively. Now, if I'm
 

3147
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,430
range aggressively. Now, if I'm
thinking, okay, we're not going to do an

3148
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:57,440
thinking, okay, we're not going to do an
 

3149
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,350
thinking, okay, we're not going to do an
excess day at the highs and we're just

3150
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
excess day at the highs and we're just
 

3151
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,830
excess day at the highs and we're just
going to drift lower. At the moment they

3152
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,840
going to drift lower. At the moment they
 

3153
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,510
going to drift lower. At the moment they
keep absorbing that. I would still

3154
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:03,520
keep absorbing that. I would still
 

3155
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,990
keep absorbing that. I would still
prefer to see excess. I'd like to see

3156
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,000
prefer to see excess. I'd like to see
 

3157
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,550
prefer to see excess. I'd like to see
lowhanging fruits get taken out which

3158
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:08,560
lowhanging fruits get taken out which
 

3159
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,870
lowhanging fruits get taken out which
would be at least previous day low and

3160
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:10,880
would be at least previous day low and
 

3161
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,510
would be at least previous day low and
ideally into previous day value area

3162
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
ideally into previous day value area
 

3163
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,149
ideally into previous day value area
low.

3164
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159

 

3165
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:22,229

That last push what the push at uh 1022

3166
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
That last push what the push at uh 1022
 

3167
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,950
That last push what the push at uh 1022
there was some like it's just like this

3168
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
there was some like it's just like this
 

3169
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,110
there was some like it's just like this
is so small up here. It's It's okay, but

3170
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,120
is so small up here. It's It's okay, but
 

3171
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,830
is so small up here. It's It's okay, but
not the best. The move into from 50 to

3172
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:31,840
not the best. The move into from 50 to
 

3173
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,229
not the best. The move into from 50 to
60 was interesting, but we haven't It's

3174
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
60 was interesting, but we haven't It's
 

3175
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,390
60 was interesting, but we haven't It's
not like we've aggressively let go.

3176
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,400
not like we've aggressively let go.
 

3177
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,310
not like we've aggressively let go.
We're starting to get interesting here

3178
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,320
We're starting to get interesting here
 

3179
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,830
We're starting to get interesting here
to the bottom side of this range. But

3180
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:39,840
to the bottom side of this range. But
 

3181
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,950
to the bottom side of this range. But
you can see every time we've come down

3182
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:40,960
you can see every time we've come down
 

3183
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,630
you can see every time we've come down
here, we've absorbed and you know, they

3184
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:42,640
here, we've absorbed and you know, they
 

3185
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,149
here, we've absorbed and you know, they
can absorb this and go right back up

3186
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
can absorb this and go right back up
 

3187
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,470
can absorb this and go right back up
again. So, I'm not convinced. I don't

3188
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:46,480
again. So, I'm not convinced. I don't
 

3189
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,390
again. So, I'm not convinced. I don't
see this as like this one tick or

3190
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:48,400
see this as like this one tick or
 

3191
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,270
see this as like this one tick or
whatever as excess at that high. We

3192
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,280
whatever as excess at that high. We
 

3193
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,790
whatever as excess at that high. We
haven't left a lot of buyers there. I

3194
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,800
haven't left a lot of buyers there. I
 

3195
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,310
haven't left a lot of buyers there. I
mean, yes. Okay. from 78 to 83 there was

3196
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:56,320
mean, yes. Okay. from 78 to 83 there was
 

3197
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,270
mean, yes. Okay. from 78 to 83 there was
some buy side left up there but not not

3198
01:12:59,270 --> 01:12:59,280
some buy side left up there but not not
 

3199
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,430
some buy side left up there but not not
a huge amount on the delta 122 64 like

3200
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
a huge amount on the delta 122 64 like
 

3201
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,070
a huge amount on the delta 122 64 like
it's not massive

3202
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
it's not massive
 

3203
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,870
it's not massive
there was more left in the push up into

3204
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:08,880
there was more left in the push up into
 

3205
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,470
there was more left in the push up into
58

3206
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:10,480
58
 

3207
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,350
58
and even that again I just don't like

3208
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:13,360
and even that again I just don't like
 

3209
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,870
and even that again I just don't like
knowing we've got low hanging fruits

3210
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:14,880
knowing we've got low hanging fruits
 

3211
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,790
knowing we've got low hanging fruits
above and we're just in a range here if

3212
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:16,800
above and we're just in a range here if
 

3213
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,430
above and we're just in a range here if
we leave the range yeah fun we we can go

3214
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:19,440
we leave the range yeah fun we we can go
 

3215
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,709
we leave the range yeah fun we we can go
much lower but

3216
01:13:22,709 --> 01:13:22,719
much lower but
 

3217
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:24,870
much lower but
It's It's iffy. Is that a better better

3218
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:24,880
It's It's iffy. Is that a better better
 

3219
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,030
It's It's iffy. Is that a better better
way of saying it? This feels iffy.

3220
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
way of saying it? This feels iffy.
 

3221
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,950
way of saying it? This feels iffy.
I think there's a a mega trade setting

3222
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:30,960
I think there's a a mega trade setting
 

3223
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,590
I think there's a a mega trade setting
up here when it's done.

3224
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:33,600
up here when it's done.
 

3225
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,310
up here when it's done.
Like, we're not seeing buyers get

3226
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:36,320
Like, we're not seeing buyers get
 

3227
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,470
Like, we're not seeing buyers get
trapped up on a spike. We're not seeing

3228
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
trapped up on a spike. We're not seeing
 

3229
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,390
trapped up on a spike. We're not seeing
sellers really aggressive slam this

3230
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
sellers really aggressive slam this
 

3231
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,310
sellers really aggressive slam this
market. We're not seeing that right now.

3232
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:42,320
market. We're not seeing that right now.
 

3233
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,110
market. We're not seeing that right now.
We're just seeing sideways action. Okay.

3234
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
We're just seeing sideways action. Okay.
 

3235
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,070
We're just seeing sideways action. Okay.
So, I don't want to bet short here and

3236
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:48,080
So, I don't want to bet short here and
 

3237
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,590
So, I don't want to bet short here and
watch myself get stopped out because I

3238
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
watch myself get stopped out because I
 

3239
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,669
watch myself get stopped out because I
wasn't patient enough to see it take

3240
01:13:51,669 --> 01:13:51,679
wasn't patient enough to see it take
 

3241
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:54,229
wasn't patient enough to see it take
this out. I will play short here. If we

3242
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
this out. I will play short here. If we
 

3243
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,550
this out. I will play short here. If we
move away from it and they and I see

3244
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,560
move away from it and they and I see
 

3245
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,310
move away from it and they and I see
sellers come flying in, then we can play

3246
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:58,320
sellers come flying in, then we can play
 

3247
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,830
sellers come flying in, then we can play
that short, which we're trying to do a

3248
01:13:59,830 --> 01:13:59,840
that short, which we're trying to do a
 

3249
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,030
that short, which we're trying to do a
little bit at the moment, but it's still

3250
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
little bit at the moment, but it's still
 

3251
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,709
little bit at the moment, but it's still
just remember we've got this pivot now.

3252
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
just remember we've got this pivot now.
 

3253
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,550
just remember we've got this pivot now.
It's like they've made it very very hard

3254
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,560
It's like they've made it very very hard
 

3255
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,990
It's like they've made it very very hard
by how they've built the structure out.

3256
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,000

 

3257
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,189

Back to GlobeEx.

3258
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:15,199

 

3259
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,510

still holding.

3260
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:17,520
still holding.
 

3261
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,030
still holding.
How we act here becomes important. I

3262
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,040
How we act here becomes important. I
 

3263
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,310
How we act here becomes important. I
think we can probably slice straight

3264
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:20,320
think we can probably slice straight
 

3265
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,669
think we can probably slice straight
through if they reclaim. There you go.

3266
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:21,679
through if they reclaim. There you go.
 

3267
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,590
through if they reclaim. There you go.
So, this is why you have the patience is

3268
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:23,600
So, this is why you have the patience is
 

3269
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,830
So, this is why you have the patience is
so important.

3270
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:25,840
so important.
 

3271
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,750
so important.
Not seeing what I would want to see for

01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:27,760
Not seeing what I would want to see for
 

3273
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,310
Not seeing what I would want to see for
my A+. And I'm not going to gamble on a

C setup up here when the ATR is still
 

3277
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,590
C setup up here when the ATR is still
right. Even in even in the range, our

3278
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
right. Even in even in the range, our
 

3279
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,350
right. Even in even in the range, our
ATR per M1 is about 37 points right now.

01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:39,360
ATR per M1 is about 37 points right now.
 

3281
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:44,229
ATR per M1 is about 37 points right now.
You get this wrong, you get hurt.

3282
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:44,239

 

3283
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,550

Previous day value high would be

3284
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
Previous day value high would be
 

3285
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,830
Previous day value high would be
preferred. I mean, I would prefer

3286
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:47,840
preferred. I mean, I would prefer
 

3287
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,669
preferred. I mean, I would prefer
previous day value area low. Value area

3288
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:49,679
previous day value area low. Value area
 

3289
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,510
previous day value area low. Value area
high would mean a full reclaim, wouldn't

3290
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:51,520
high would mean a full reclaim, wouldn't
 

3291
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,430
high would mean a full reclaim, wouldn't
it? It's all up here. I don't want to I

3292
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:53,440
it? It's all up here. I don't want to I
 

3293
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,630
it? It's all up here. I don't want to I
don't want to be short up there. I want

3294
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:54,640
don't want to be short up there. I want
 

3295
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,310
don't want to be short up there. I want
to be short into here. If we get through

3296
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
to be short into here. If we get through
 

3297
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,590
to be short into here. If we get through
this, there's probably a long all the

3298
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
this, there's probably a long all the
 

3299
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,110
this, there's probably a long all the
way back up. I don't want to trade in

3300
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,120
way back up. I don't want to trade in
 

3301
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,790
way back up. I don't want to trade in
yesterday's value. It's a B-shaped

3302
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:00,800
yesterday's value. It's a B-shaped
 

3303
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,709
yesterday's value. It's a B-shaped
profile. We want to reject the bottom

3304
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:02,719
profile. We want to reject the bottom
 

3305
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,310
profile. We want to reject the bottom
side of that B-shaped profile. If we

3306
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:04,320
side of that B-shaped profile. If we
 

3307
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,149
side of that B-shaped profile. If we
can't do that, that's showing weakness

3308
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:06,159
can't do that, that's showing weakness
 

3309
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,149
can't do that, that's showing weakness
from bulls, right? Because if we zoom

3310
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:08,159
from bulls, right? Because if we zoom
 

3311
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,270
from bulls, right? Because if we zoom
out,

3312
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:11,280

 

3313
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,750

right, big selling profile,

3314
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:13,760
right, big selling profile,
 

3315
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,830
right, big selling profile,
we need to reject this, don't we? Right,

3316
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:15,840
we need to reject this, don't we? Right,
 

3317
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,350
we need to reject this, don't we? Right,
to move lower. Because if we reclaim

3318
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
to move lower. Because if we reclaim
 

3319
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,350
to move lower. Because if we reclaim
that, that happens. I don't want to get

3320
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:19,360
that, that happens. I don't want to get
 

3321
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,590
that, that happens. I don't want to get
short up here because then we're we're

3322
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
short up here because then we're we're
 

3323
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,350
short up here because then we're we're
liable for a squeeze. This is a

3324
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
liable for a squeeze. This is a
 

3325
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,870
liable for a squeeze. This is a
rotation. I don't want to trade rotation

3326
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
rotation. I don't want to trade rotation
 

3327
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,110
rotation. I don't want to trade rotation
on a Friday after a big sell. I want to

3328
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:27,120
on a Friday after a big sell. I want to
 

3329
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:32,550
on a Friday after a big sell. I want to
trade continuation if it will allow it.

3330
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:32,560

 

3331
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,630

Okay, here we go. So, can we see this

3332
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:34,640
Okay, here we go. So, can we see this
 

3333
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,550
Okay, here we go. So, can we see this
now? Into previous day low. previous day

3334
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
now? Into previous day low. previous day
 

3335
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,270
now? Into previous day low. previous day
value area low above. Let's see some

3336
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
value area low above. Let's see some
 

3337
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,590
value area low above. Let's see some
exchanges here. That's better. That's

3338
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:41,600
exchanges here. That's better. That's
 

3339
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,189
exchanges here. That's better. That's
much better what we've just seen in

3340
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:43,199
much better what we've just seen in
 

3341
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:45,669
much better what we've just seen in
terms of delta. Now it's all about the

3342
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
terms of delta. Now it's all about the
 

3343
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,189
terms of delta. Now it's all about the
reaction.

3344
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:49,199

 

3345
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,950

So, first time we've seen more buy side.

3346
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:50,960
So, first time we've seen more buy side.
 

3347
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,350
So, first time we've seen more buy side.
Still didn't quite tag previous day low.

Still wonder if there's one more big old

getting close to previous day low. You

getting close to previous day low. You
 

3363
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,350

got to wonder, are they going to fill

3364
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,360
got to wonder, are they going to fill
 

3365
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,550
got to wonder, are they going to fill
the gap at this point? They're that

3366
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:12,560
the gap at this point? They're that
 

3367
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,669

01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,229

Like I said, I might be wrong today,

01:16:20,229 --> 01:16:20,239
Like I said, I might be wrong today,
 

3371
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,669
Like I said, I might be wrong today,

Look at the size of these last few

Look at the size of these last few
 

3409
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,750
Look at the size of these last few
candles. That's the kind of thing we

3410
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
candles. That's the kind of thing we
 

3411
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,430
candles. That's the kind of thing we
want to see. Maybe one more push would

3412
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:21,440
want to see. Maybe one more push would
 

3413
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,110
want to see. Maybe one more push would
be nice at this point. Starting to see

This is where buyers came in. So, I'm

This is where buyers came in. So, I'm
 

3421
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,149
This is where buyers came in. So, I'm
still not too interested here. I'd

01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:32,159
still not too interested here. I'd
 

3423
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,310

see some sellers come in, but

3430
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,120
see some sellers come in, but
 

3431
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:46,310
see some sellers come in, but
structurally they can still hold a 87s.

3449
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:27,510

Possible I'm wrong today. Possible.

Possible I'm wrong today. Possible.

3453
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,149

I think a short's coming, though. But I

3454
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:34,159
I think a short's coming, though. But I
 

3455
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:35,750
I think a short's coming, though. But I
have to be very aware if we reclaim all

3456
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:35,760
have to be very aware if we reclaim all
 

3457
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,070
have to be very aware if we reclaim all
this area without a reaction, I have to

3458
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,080
this area without a reaction, I have to
 

3459
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,870
this area without a reaction, I have to
be willing to take no trades today.

3460
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:40,880
be willing to take no trades today.
 

3461
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:49,030
be willing to take no trades today.
That's okay.

3462
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,040

 

3463
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,189

Yeah, I I think we're going to get an IB

3464
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:51,199
Yeah, I I think we're going to get an IB
 

3465
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,950
Yeah, I I think we're going to get an IB
rotation. I think we're going to get a

3466
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:52,960
rotation. I think we're going to get a
 

3467
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,830
rotation. I think we're going to get a
failed auction and an IB rotation.

3468
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:55,840
failed auction and an IB rotation.
 

3469
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,189
failed auction and an IB rotation.
It's just going to be a question of how

3470
01:18:57,189 --> 01:18:57,199
It's just going to be a question of how
 

3471
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,709
It's just going to be a question of how
much patience do people have. I have to

3472
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
much patience do people have. I have to
 

3473
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:02,229
much patience do people have. I have to
be aware of the mag a little bit. Have

3474
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:02,239
be aware of the mag a little bit. Have
 

3475
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,950
be aware of the mag a little bit. Have
to be aware of that mag. Oracle's gone

3476
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:04,960
to be aware of that mag. Oracle's gone
 

3477
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,790
to be aware of that mag. Oracle's gone
green. Nvidia's gone green. Microsoft's

3478
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:06,800

others are still red on the day. This is
 

3483
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,630
others are still red on the day. This is
huge here. There's massive selling and

huge here. There's massive selling and
 

3485

No excess. The excess was in these and

3490
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:21,120
No excess. The excess was in these and
 

3491
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,189
No excess. The excess was in these and
we printed above it. So, I'm still not

3492
01:19:23,189 --> 01:19:23,199
we printed above it. So, I'm still not
 

3493
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,550
we printed above it. So, I'm still not
convinced there's too much buying at the

3494
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:24,560
convinced there's too much buying at the
 

3495
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,990
convinced there's too much buying at the
high of day yet that's been trapped.

3496
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,000

 

3497
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,990

And if we flush without me, it's okay.

3498
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:32,000
And if we flush without me, it's okay.
 

3499
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,990
And if we flush without me, it's okay.
We can join on a breakdown of structure.

3500
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,000
We can join on a breakdown of structure.
 

3501
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,390
We can join on a breakdown of structure.
We don't need to pick the top right now.

3502
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,400
We don't need to pick the top right now.
 

3503
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,550
We don't need to pick the top right now.
Structure is bullish in the intraday

3504

Structure is bullish in the intraday
 

3505
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,070
Structure is bullish in the intraday
time frame. We're holding flow zones.

We're above all the key levels for now.

We're above all the key levels for now.
 

3509
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,310
We're above all the key levels for now.
We're coming into areas of interest for

3510
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:44,320
We're coming into areas of interest for
 

3511
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,470
We're coming into areas of interest for
us to play short. I've not seen what I'd

3512
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:46,480
us to play short. I've not seen what I'd
 

3513
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:52,870
us to play short. I've not seen what I'd
want to see on the book yet.

3514
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:52,880

 

3515
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,229

Back to this imbalance. Like we said,

3516
01:19:54,229 --> 01:19:54,239
Back to this imbalance. Like we said,
 

3517
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:56,709
Back to this imbalance. Like we said,
there is no selling under this level

3518
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:56,719
there is no selling under this level
 

3519
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,110
there is no selling under this level
right now down to 60. We're back to this

3520
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
right now down to 60. We're back to this
 

3521
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,709
right now down to 60. We're back to this
imbalance. They sell through it, we'll

3522
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
imbalance. They sell through it, we'll
 

3523
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,950
imbalance. They sell through it, we'll
probably go much, much heavier again. I

3524
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
probably go much, much heavier again. I
 

3525
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,030
probably go much, much heavier again. I
don't like that high. I don't think

3526
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
don't like that high. I don't think
 

3527
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,790
don't like that high. I don't think
there's much excess here. Three candles

3528
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:06,800
there's much excess here. Three candles
 

3529
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,709
there's much excess here. Three candles
are equal equal size up here. It's not.

3530
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:10,719
are equal equal size up here. It's not.
 

3531
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,709
are equal equal size up here. It's not.
No. And I can give you the prince of the

3532
01:20:12,709 --> 01:20:12,719
No. And I can give you the prince of the
 

3533
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,310
No. And I can give you the prince of the
highs. There's no delta up there.

3534
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
highs. There's no delta up there.
 

3535
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,669
highs. There's no delta up there.
Not I'm not convinced. Still not

3536
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:17,679
Not I'm not convinced. Still not
 

3537
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,990
Not I'm not convinced. Still not
convinced the highs in. Not convinced

3538
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:20,000
convinced the highs in. Not convinced
 

3539
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,590
convinced the highs in. Not convinced
the highs in.

3540
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600

 

3541
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,510

So if you're long, you're still okay.

3542
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:25,520
So if you're long, you're still okay.
 

3543
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,950
So if you're long, you're still okay.
And I'd say you're okay all the time you

3544
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:26,960
And I'd say you're okay all the time you
 

3545
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,110
And I'd say you're okay all the time you
hold 60. Failure of 60. this thing can

3546
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,120
hold 60. Failure of 60. this thing can
 

3547
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,470
hold 60. Failure of 60. this thing can
be in trouble because all the buying

3548
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:32,480
be in trouble because all the buying
 

3549
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,430
be in trouble because all the buying
the buying which happened at 10:27

3550
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:35,440
the buying which happened at 10:27
 

3551
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,310
the buying which happened at 10:27
right started at 60 got very aggressive

3552
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:38,320
right started at 60 got very aggressive
 

3553
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,550
right started at 60 got very aggressive
at 77

3554
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
at 77
 

3555
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,750
at 77
all the way up to 12. So 77 to 12 if

3556
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
all the way up to 12. So 77 to 12 if
 

3557
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,990
all the way up to 12. So 77 to 12 if
you're a bull is where you need to hold

3558
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,000
you're a bull is where you need to hold
 

3559
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,550
you're a bull is where you need to hold
it's 40 points but that's the range. If

3560
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:48,560
it's 40 points but that's the range. If
 

3561
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,229
it's 40 points but that's the range. If
they don't hold that there is possible

3562
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:50,239
they don't hold that there is possible
 

3563
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:51,830
they don't hold that there is possible
bigger flush because that is where

3564
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
bigger flush because that is where
 

3565
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,950
bigger flush because that is where
buyers came flying in. I'm not convinced

3566
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:54,960
buyers came flying in. I'm not convinced
 

3567
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,790
buyers came flying in. I'm not convinced
how I have days in yet, but I can see

3568
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
how I have days in yet, but I can see
 

3569
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,630
how I have days in yet, but I can see
where those buyers came flying in and

3570
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:58,640
where those buyers came flying in and
 

3571
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,910
where those buyers came flying in and
where their pain point would be. And

3572
01:20:59,910 --> 01:20:59,920
where their pain point would be. And
 

3573
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,270
where their pain point would be. And
their pain point would be under

3574
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:01,280
their pain point would be under
 

3575
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,990
their pain point would be under
basically under 75 is their pain point

3576
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,000
basically under 75 is their pain point
 

3577
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,790
basically under 75 is their pain point
and definitely under 60. Huge exchange

3578
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:06,800
and definitely under 60. Huge exchange
 

3579

place here again. And we're not moving

3584
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
place here again. And we're not moving
 

3585
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,229

right? You just had 128 lot, 155 lot,

3588
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:19,760
right? You just had 128 lot, 155 lot,

the market and we didn't move lower. So,

3592
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:24,239
the market and we didn't move lower. So,
 

3593
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:25,350
the market and we didn't move lower. So,
what happens? We're going to move

3594
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:25,360
what happens? We're going to move
 

3595
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,030
what happens? We're going to move
higher. If they're trying to sell and

3596
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,040
higher. If they're trying to sell and
 

3597
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,229
higher. If they're trying to sell and
we're not moving down, they're going to

3598
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:28,239
we're not moving down, they're going to
 

3599
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:31,270
we're not moving down, they're going to
get squeezed out is why I'm still not

01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:31,280
get squeezed out is why I'm still not
 

3601
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:38,390

It's coming down. If it can't hold 21s,

01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
It's coming down. If it can't hold 21s,
 

3629
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,750
It's coming down. If it can't hold 21s,
our thesis for the day might be wrong

3630
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:17,760
our thesis for the day might be wrong
 

3631
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,590
our thesis for the day might be wrong
and it might be thesis for Monday. Just

3632
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:19,600
and it might be thesis for Monday. Just
 

3633
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:27,669
and it might be thesis for Monday. Just
be aware of that.

3634

3641
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,550

Yeah, exactly. Capp that 21s. If you

3642
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:36,560
Yeah, exactly. Capp that 21s. If you
 

3643
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,310
Yeah, exactly. Capp that 21s. If you
look at that pivot from was it overnight

3644
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:38,320
look at that pivot from was it overnight
 

3645
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,030
look at that pivot from was it overnight
or was it yesterday? Let's see. From

3646
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:41,040
or was it yesterday? Let's see. From
 

3647
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,550
or was it yesterday? Let's see. From
overnight that pivot at at uh 20 I'm

3648
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:44,560
overnight that pivot at at uh 20 I'm
 

3649
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,870
overnight that pivot at at uh 20 I'm
calling it 21s. It's actually like 2080

3650
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
calling it 21s. It's actually like 2080
 

3651
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,430
calling it 21s. It's actually like 2080
2088. If they fail that they get gap

3652
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,440
2088. If they fail that they get gap
 

3653
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,390
2088. If they fail that they get gap
fill down to 20. We cannot be sure if

3654
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:52,400
fill down to 20. We cannot be sure if
 

3655
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,229
fill down to 20. We cannot be sure if
fix is going to go for gap fill, right?

3656
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
fix is going to go for gap fill, right?
 

3657
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,910
fix is going to go for gap fill, right?
We cannot be sure if fix is going to go

3658
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:55,920
We cannot be sure if fix is going to go
 

3659
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:01,189
We cannot be sure if fix is going to go
for gap fill.

3660

3661
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:16,390

acquiring

3662
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:16,400

 

3663
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,390

so much patience here. This is where it

3664
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,400
so much patience here. This is where it
 

3665
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,709
so much patience here. This is where it
get where trading trading is tricky is

3666
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:20,719
get where trading trading is tricky is
 

3667
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,470
get where trading trading is tricky is
where you're waiting and waiting and

waiting and waiting and waiting and then
 

3671
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,229
waiting and waiting and waiting and then
what happens is you lose patience and

3672
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:26,239
what happens is you lose patience and
 

3673
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:27,990
what happens is you lose patience and
you either do one of two things. you

01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,000
you either do one of two things. you
 

3675
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,790
you either do one of two things. you
enter a not a valid trade because you

3676
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:30,800
enter a not a valid trade because you
 

3677
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,229
enter a not a valid trade because you
lack patience and you get hurt and then

3678
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239
lack patience and you get hurt and then
 

3679
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:36,470
lack patience and you get hurt and then
you get very upset or you lose focus and

3680
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
you get very upset or you lose focus and
 

3681
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,709
you get very upset or you lose focus and
then you miss the setup when it comes.

3682
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:40,719
then you miss the setup when it comes.
 

3683
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,470
then you miss the setup when it comes.
And I don't I'm going to say this I say

And I don't I'm going to say this I say

Gap fill would be here. All right. And

3850
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:36,400
Gap fill would be here. All right. And
 

3851
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,149
Gap fill would be here. All right. And
if they want to come up here, like I I

3852
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:38,159
if they want to come up here, like I I
 

3853
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:40,149
if they want to come up here, like I I
the more we're inside previous day

3854
01:27:40,149 --> 01:27:40,159
the more we're inside previous day
 

3855
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:41,990
the more we're inside previous day
value, the less I'm interested in this

3856
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:42,000
value, the less I'm interested in this
 

3857
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,990
value, the less I'm interested in this
now. All right.

3858
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,000
now. All right.
 

3859
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,629
now. All right.
This is previous day's value.

3860
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:46,639
This is previous day's value.
 

3861
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:48,229
This is previous day's value.
The more we're holding inside here, the

3862
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:48,239
The more we're holding inside here, the
 

3863
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,149
The more we're holding inside here, the
more likely we are to come up and f and

3864
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
more likely we are to come up and f and
 

3865
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,149
more likely we are to come up and f and
come into these. And then I'm not

3866
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:52,159
come into these. And then I'm not
 

3867
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,750
come into these. And then I'm not
interested in that because that's a full

3868
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:53,760
interested in that because that's a full
 

3869
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,149
interested in that because that's a full
reclaim. And what that means is this is

3870
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:56,159
reclaim. And what that means is this is
 

3871
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,550
reclaim. And what that means is this is
a look below previous day value and fail

3872
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:58,560
a look below previous day value and fail
 

3873
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,030
a look below previous day value and fail
reclaiming value. Maybe they rotate in

3874
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:01,040
reclaiming value. Maybe they rotate in
 

3875
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,390
reclaiming value. Maybe they rotate in
here. But at that point, you know,

3876
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:02,400
here. But at that point, you know,
 

3877
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,310
here. But at that point, you know,
what's to say they don't repric thin

3878
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,320
what's to say they don't repric thin
 

3879

So like I said, it might be that I am

3884
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:12,080
So like I said, it might be that I am
 

3885
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,270
So like I said, it might be that I am
wrong today. I'm a day early looking for

3886
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:15,280
wrong today. I'm a day early looking for
 

3887
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,350
wrong today. I'm a day early looking for
this trade.

3888
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,360
this trade.
 

3889
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,990
this trade.
I will sit here and watch and that's

3890
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:20,000
I will sit here and watch and that's
 

3891
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,070
I will sit here and watch and that's
okay. Like I said, I'm absolutely fine

3892
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:24,080
okay. Like I said, I'm absolutely fine
 

3893
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:27,430
okay. Like I said, I'm absolutely fine
with being wrong. I'm cannot control the

3894
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,440
with being wrong. I'm cannot control the
 

3895
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,510
with being wrong. I'm cannot control the
market. If the market wants to reclaim

3896
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:29,520
market. If the market wants to reclaim
 

3897
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,669
market. If the market wants to reclaim
all key levels, it is what it is. Gap

3898
01:28:31,669 --> 01:28:31,679
all key levels, it is what it is. Gap
 

3899
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,470
all key levels, it is what it is. Gap
fill on spy. Is it really not for me,

3900
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
fill on spy. Is it really not for me,
 

3901
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,430
fill on spy. Is it really not for me,
mate? Gap fill on spy for me is uh or is

3902
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:37,440
mate? Gap fill on spy for me is uh or is
 

3903
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,750
mate? Gap fill on spy for me is uh or is
that what you're calling for? 72s,

3904
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:39,760
that what you're calling for? 72s,
 

3905
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:40,629
that what you're calling for? 72s,
right? Right. So, I think you've got

3906
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:40,639
right? Right. So, I think you've got
 

3907
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,669
right? Right. So, I think you've got
another dollar to go basically on spy.

3908
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:43,679
another dollar to go basically on spy.
 

3909
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,590
another dollar to go basically on spy.
Remember, the gap fill for me is always

3910
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
Remember, the gap fill for me is always
 

3911
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,510
Remember, the gap fill for me is always
the 4:00 close. I'm interested in the

3912
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:47,520
the 4:00 close. I'm interested in the
 

3913
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,270
the 4:00 close. I'm interested in the
cash gap. If you're playing ES, the gap

3914
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:49,280
cash gap. If you're playing ES, the gap
 

3915
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:53,990
cash gap. If you're playing ES, the gap
fill is 760. That uh 600 level on uh the

selling in here in this node and they
 

3937
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,950
selling in here in this node and they
failed to move lower. That's telling you

3938
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:24,960
failed to move lower. That's telling you
 

3939
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,709
failed to move lower. That's telling you
currently that shorts are getting

3940

currently that shorts are getting
 

3941
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,709
currently that shorts are getting
trapped. This is why I'm very patient.

I'm not forcing my way in. And this is a
level of interest. We're going to remove

3946
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:33,440
level of interest. We're going to remove
 

3947
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,870
level of interest. We're going to remove
this now as well because we've traded

3948
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:34,880
this now as well because we've traded

01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,229

I don't have an ego, guys. If I'm wrong,

3954
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:52,239
I don't have an ego, guys. If I'm wrong,
 

3955
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:53,910
I don't have an ego, guys. If I'm wrong,
I'm wrong. It is like, it just is what

01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:53,920
I'm wrong. It is like, it just is what
 

3957
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,149
I'm wrong. It is like, it just is what
it is. I have a trade thesis, but you

3958
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
it is. I have a trade thesis, but you
 

3959
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,229
it is. I have a trade thesis, but you
can see on days where my trade thesis is

3960
01:29:58,229 --> 01:29:58,239
can see on days where my trade thesis is
 

3961
01:29:58,239 --> 01:29:59,669
can see on days where my trade thesis is
wrong, I'm either taking very small

3962
01:29:59,669 --> 01:29:59,679
wrong, I'm either taking very small
 

3963
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,590
wrong, I'm either taking very small
losses or I'm just not entering like

3964
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,600
losses or I'm just not entering like
 

3965
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,790
losses or I'm just not entering like
today because I'm not seeing what I

3966
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,800
today because I'm not seeing what I
 

3967
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,390
today because I'm not seeing what I
want.

3968
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:04,400
want.
 

3969
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,430
want.
So like

3970
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:07,440
So like

of previous week's value area low. This
 

3979
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,470
of previous week's value area low. This
is yesterday's VWAP. All right.

3980
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:20,480
is yesterday's VWAP. All right.
 

3981
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:27,590
is yesterday's VWAP. All right.
Yesterday's VWAP anchored here into 80.

VIX not looking good here, folks. I'm

VIX not looking good here, folks. I'm
 

3985
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,550
VIX not looking good here, folks. I'm
going to be honest. If Vix is going to

3986
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:30,560
going to be honest. If Vix is going to
 

3987
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,790
going to be honest. If Vix is going to
go for the gap fill,

3988
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:32,800
go for the gap fill,
 

3989
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,750
go for the gap fill,
I think my thesis is wrong.

3990
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,760
I think my thesis is wrong.
 

3991
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,790
I think my thesis is wrong.
If big big level here on Vicks, if we

3992
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:38,800
If big big level here on Vicks, if we
 

3993
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,070
If big big level here on Vicks, if we
fail here, we're going to go gap fill

3994
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,080
fail here, we're going to go gap fill
 

3995
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,390
fail here, we're going to go gap fill
all the way down to 20. And it's looking

3996
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:42,400
all the way down to 20. And it's looking
 

3997
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,350
all the way down to 20. And it's looking
like it's going to fail. So, hand off

3998
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:45,360
like it's going to fail. So, hand off
 

3999
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:50,629
like it's going to fail. So, hand off
the mouse.

We've built out structure, but bulls
 

4113
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,189

4119
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,149

But do you think bulls are going to hold

4120
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
But do you think bulls are going to hold
 

4121
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,709
But do you think bulls are going to hold
calls and hold their positions for next

01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
calls and hold their positions for next
 

4123
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:27,750

01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:27,760
week? That's what you got to ask
 

4125
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,430
week? That's what you got to ask
yourself after such a big sell-off. I'm

4126
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:31,440
yourself after such a big sell-off. I'm
 

4127
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:34,229
yourself after such a big sell-off. I'm
not convinced, but

4128
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:34,239
not convinced, but
 

4129
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:42,390
not convinced, but
at the moment I'm clearly wrong.

4130
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400

 

4131
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,550

Big buying in this move. Big market

VIX filled. No, VIX is not filled. All
 

4137
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,669
VIX filled. No, VIX is not filled. All
right. VIX is into its gap. The the gap

4138
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:51,679
right. VIX is into its gap. The the gap
 

4139
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,790
right. VIX is into its gap. The the gap
fill on VIX would be 20 for me.

4140
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:54,800
fill on VIX would be 20 for me.
 

4141
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,950
fill on VIX would be 20 for me.
Yeah. So 20.

4142
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:56,960
Yeah. So 20.
 

4143
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,310
Yeah. So 20.
20 is your gap fill. You're training at

4144
01:33:58,310 --> 01:33:58,320
20 is your gap fill. You're training at
 

4145
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,110
20 is your gap fill. You're training at
20.61. You're into the gap now on VIX.

4146
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:01,120
20.61. You're into the gap now on VIX.
 

4147
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,629
20.61. You're into the gap now on VIX.
Yeah. Which is why I'm saying like this

4148
01:34:02,629 --> 01:34:02,639
Yeah. Which is why I'm saying like this
 

4149
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,390
Yeah. Which is why I'm saying like this
could be very very dangerous for more

4150
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:04,400
could be very very dangerous for more
 

4151
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,870
could be very very dangerous for more
upside now because VIX VIX has gone risk

4152
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:06,880
upside now because VIX VIX has gone risk
 

4153
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,790
upside now because VIX VIX has gone risk
off. It's still very high. Let's get

4154
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:08,800
off. It's still very high. Let's get
 

4155
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,110
off. It's still very high. Let's get
this. Let's not forget one thing. VIX

4156
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:11,120
this. Let's not forget one thing. VIX
 

4157
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,229
this. Let's not forget one thing. VIX
above the teens, all right, is not a

4158
01:34:14,229 --> 01:34:14,239
above the teens, all right, is not a
 

4159
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:16,790
above the teens, all right, is not a
risk-on scenario. It's a high risk

4160
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:16,800
risk-on scenario. It's a high risk
 

4161
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,870
risk-on scenario. It's a high risk
scenario. Is a riskoff scenario, but

4162
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:18,880
scenario. Is a riskoff scenario, but
 

4163
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,950
scenario. Is a riskoff scenario, but
you're seeing a fade from 23s down to

4164
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:20,960
you're seeing a fade from 23s down to
 

4165
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,189
you're seeing a fade from 23s down to
potential gap to 20s on the VIX. It's

4166
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:25,199
potential gap to 20s on the VIX. It's
 

4167
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,110
potential gap to 20s on the VIX. It's
this is not a position where I would

4168
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:27,120
this is not a position where I would
 

4169
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,550
this is not a position where I would
feel comfortable as a bull when we're

4170
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:28,560
feel comfortable as a bull when we're
 

4171
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,830
feel comfortable as a bull when we're
printing. It's not like when we're

4172
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:29,840
printing. It's not like when we're
 

4173
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,830
printing. It's not like when we're
printing in the low teens and we're in

4174
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:31,840
printing in the low teens and we're in
 

4175
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:46,550
printing in the low teens and we're in
like a steady grind healthy market.

4176
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:46,560

 

4177
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,070

previous week close coming up. This is

4178
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:48,080
previous week close coming up. This is
 

4179
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,910
previous week close coming up. This is
so impressive. Really, really

4180
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:49,920
so impressive. Really, really
 

4181
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,790
so impressive. Really, really
impressive. Can do nothing but applaud

4182
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:52,800
impressive. Can do nothing but applaud

01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:54,480
the strength of these guys. All of the
 

4185
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,149
the strength of these guys. All of the
mag now gone green other than Google.

01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
mag now gone green other than Google.
 

4187
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:59,270
mag now gone green other than Google.
Very, very strong reaction.

4188
01:34:59,270 --> 01:34:59,280
Very, very strong reaction.
 

4189
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,189
Very, very strong reaction.
And a previous day point of control. I

4190
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:01,199
And a previous day point of control. I
 

4191
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,350
And a previous day point of control. I
cannot believe that they have been able

4192
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:03,360
cannot believe that they have been able
 

4193
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,830
cannot believe that they have been able
to do this in one in one move. It's very

4194
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:05,840
to do this in one in one move. It's very
 

4195
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,270
to do this in one in one move. It's very
very impressive. And not just in one

4196
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:07,280
very impressive. And not just in one
 

4197
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,390
very impressive. And not just in one
move, in an hour and 15 minutes. All

4198
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,400
move, in an hour and 15 minutes. All
 

4199
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,470
move, in an hour and 15 minutes. All
right, we're looking at a 500 plus point

4200
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,480
right, we're looking at a 500 plus point
 

4201
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:15,830
right, we're looking at a 500 plus point
move. Is that right? 20 over 500 point

4202
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:15,840
move. Is that right? 20 over 500 point
 

4203
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,390
move. Is that right? 20 over 500 point
move in the first hour and 15 minutes.

4204
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:18,400
move in the first hour and 15 minutes.
 

4205
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,709
move in the first hour and 15 minutes.
That is the size of uh weekly moves we

4206
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:20,719
That is the size of uh weekly moves we
 

4207
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,270
That is the size of uh weekly moves we
used to get. All right, so just be aware

4208
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:23,280
used to get. All right, so just be aware
 

4209
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,310
used to get. All right, so just be aware
of that. It's very very very impressive.

4210
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:26,320
of that. It's very very very impressive.
 

4211
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,229
of that. It's very very very impressive.
They are starting to get extended from

4212
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:28,239
They are starting to get extended from
 

4213
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,470
They are starting to get extended from
flow zones. We're starting to get very

4214
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:30,480
flow zones. We're starting to get very
 

4215
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,030
flow zones. We're starting to get very
thin in here, folks. If you're a buyer,

4216
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:33,040
thin in here, folks. If you're a buyer,
 

4217
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:38,229
thin in here, folks. If you're a buyer,
I'd be very very careful right now.

4218
01:35:38,229 --> 01:35:38,239

 

4219
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,870

I'd be uh locking in the majority of

4220
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:40,880
I'd be uh locking in the majority of
 

4221
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,870
I'd be uh locking in the majority of
your gains here. Here's pre week closed.

4222
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:42,880
your gains here. Here's pre week closed.
 

4223
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,790
your gains here. Here's pre week closed.
Next stops, previous day point control.

4224
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,800
Next stops, previous day point control.
 

4225
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,350
Next stops, previous day point control.
Like I said, my short thesis is could

4226
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:47,360
Like I said, my short thesis is could
 

4227
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:56,950
Like I said, my short thesis is could
easily be wrong.

4228
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960

 

4229
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,189

Yeah, definitely MC guy. I mean, they

4230
01:35:59,189 --> 01:35:59,199
Yeah, definitely MC guy. I mean, they
 

4231
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:00,709
Yeah, definitely MC guy. I mean, they
definitely got short at the lows. That's

4232
01:36:00,709 --> 01:36:00,719
definitely got short at the lows. That's
 

4233
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,229
definitely got short at the lows. That's
the one thing, you know, we were not

4234
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:02,239
the one thing, you know, we were not
 

4235
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,310
the one thing, you know, we were not
willing to do today. But we've cut

4236
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
willing to do today. But we've cut
 

4237
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,590
willing to do today. But we've cut
through the key levels. The only thing

4238
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:05,600
through the key levels. The only thing
 

4239
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,950
through the key levels. The only thing
left is up here. And you have to ask

4240
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:06,960
left is up here. And you have to ask
 

4241
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,629
left is up here. And you have to ask
yourself,

4242
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:08,639
yourself,
 

4243
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:11,990
yourself,
do you want to be short

4244
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:12,000
do you want to be short
 

4245
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,830
do you want to be short
into these key levels now? Now that

4246
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:13,840
into these key levels now? Now that
 

4247
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,149
into these key levels now? Now that
we've reclaimed with strength, there

4248
01:36:16,149 --> 01:36:16,159
we've reclaimed with strength, there
 

4249
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,070
we've reclaimed with strength, there
might be a scalp down. But what I would

4250
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,080
might be a scalp down. But what I would
 

4251
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,590
might be a scalp down. But what I would
suggest today is probably going to

4252
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:19,600
suggest today is probably going to
 

4253
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,629
suggest today is probably going to
happen is we're probably going to trade

4254
01:36:22,629 --> 01:36:22,639
happen is we're probably going to trade
 

4255
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,149
happen is we're probably going to trade
is that yesterday's value inside

4256
01:36:24,149 --> 01:36:24,159
is that yesterday's value inside
 

4257
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:27,270
is that yesterday's value inside
yesterday's value. If we get acceptance

4258
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,280
yesterday's value. If we get acceptance
 

4259
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,750
yesterday's value. If we get acceptance
above here, we're very, very thin from

4260
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:29,760
above here, we're very, very thin from
 

4261
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,430
above here, we're very, very thin from
yesterday above there. We can trade

4262
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
yesterday above there. We can trade
 

4263
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,229
yesterday above there. We can trade
right the way up to 500s. Should be

4264
01:36:34,229 --> 01:36:34,239
right the way up to 500s. Should be
 

4265
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:35,910
right the way up to 500s. Should be
would that be over an,000 point move. It

4266
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:35,920
would that be over an,000 point move. It
 

4267
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:41,350
would that be over an,000 point move. It
would be basically a 900 point move. Um

4268
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:41,360

 

4269
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,470

yeah, I mean it is what it is. We are we

4270
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:44,480
yeah, I mean it is what it is. We are we
 

4271
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,709
yeah, I mean it is what it is. We are we
are where we are. Big exchange here

4272
01:36:46,709 --> 01:36:46,719
are where we are. Big exchange here
 

4273
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,790
are where we are. Big exchange here
again. How are we looking on ES? Has it

4274
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:48,800
again. How are we looking on ES? Has it
 

4275
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,390
again. How are we looking on ES? Has it
filled it yet? Okay, ES has now filled

4276
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,400
filled it yet? Okay, ES has now filled
 

4277
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,669
filled it yet? Okay, ES has now filled
the gap. Globex is above it. Okay, so

4278
01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:53,679
the gap. Globex is above it. Okay, so
 

4279
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:55,270
the gap. Globex is above it. Okay, so
obligation for everything has been

4280
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:55,280
obligation for everything has been
 

4281
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,870
obligation for everything has been
achieved. Just waiting to see if VIX

4282
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:56,880
achieved. Just waiting to see if VIX
 

4283
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,950
achieved. Just waiting to see if VIX
completes its gap fill. You got to think

4284
01:36:58,950 --> 01:36:58,960
completes its gap fill. You got to think
 

4285
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,470
completes its gap fill. You got to think
maybe previous day. This is previous

4286
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:00,480
maybe previous day. This is previous
 

4287
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,149
maybe previous day. This is previous
week close where we're starting to see

4288
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:02,159
week close where we're starting to see
 

4289
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,470
week close where we're starting to see
some profit taking out. Uh maybe

4290
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:04,480
some profit taking out. Uh maybe
 

4291
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,189
some profit taking out. Uh maybe
previous day point of control. Why is

4292
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:07,199
previous day point of control. Why is
 

4293
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:11,109
previous day point of control. Why is
that? 280. That is wrong on my chart.

4294
01:37:11,109 --> 01:37:11,119
that? 280. That is wrong on my chart.
 

4295
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:13,189
that? 280. That is wrong on my chart.
280. Previous day value area high. Let's

4296
01:37:13,189 --> 01:37:13,199
280. Previous day value area high. Let's
 

4297
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:16,149
280. Previous day value area high. Let's
move this down to 80. Make sure that's

4298
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:16,159
move this down to 80. Make sure that's
 

4299
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:17,910
move this down to 80. Make sure that's
correct.

4300
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:17,920
correct.
 

4301
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:24,310
correct.
Have it a bit lower on here. 260s. Okay.

4302
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,320
Have it a bit lower on here. 260s. Okay.
 

4303
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:29,430
Have it a bit lower on here. 260s. Okay.
But yeah, bulls in absolute control.

4304
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:29,440

 

4305
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,270

No trade for me in New York session is

4306
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:31,280
No trade for me in New York session is
 

4307
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,830
No trade for me in New York session is
what it is. If we start if we start

4308
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:33,840
what it is. If we start if we start
 

4309
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,910
what it is. If we start if we start
letting go.

4310
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:35,920
letting go.
 

4311
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,390
letting go.
It's uh probably just a pullback at this

4312
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:38,400
It's uh probably just a pullback at this
 

4313
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,790
It's uh probably just a pullback at this
point, but we will see. We'll see. I'll

4314
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:40,800
point, but we will see. We'll see. I'll
 

4315
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:48,629
point, but we will see. We'll see. I'll
continue to watch it.

4316
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:48,639

 

4317
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,070

Vix almost filled the gap. It's got

4318
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:50,080
Vix almost filled the gap. It's got
 

4319
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,990
Vix almost filled the gap. It's got
another 50 cents 50 um half a point to

4320
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,000
another 50 cents 50 um half a point to
 

4321
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,390
another 50 cents 50 um half a point to
go basically.

4322
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400

 

4323
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,310

Still not buy too much buy side delta at

4324
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
Still not buy too much buy side delta at
 

4325
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,669
Still not buy too much buy side delta at
the highs. I mean there was a transition

4326
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:01,679
the highs. I mean there was a transition
 

4327
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,830
the highs. I mean there was a transition
here but the highest player that's just

4328
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
here but the highest player that's just
 

4329
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,830
here but the highest player that's just
changed. That's weird.

4330
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:07,840

 

4331
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,390

See delta.

4332
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:10,400
See delta.
 

4333
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,310
See delta.
Yeah, I don't see that as buy side delta

4334
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,320
Yeah, I don't see that as buy side delta
 

4335
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:29,750
Yeah, I don't see that as buy side delta
up there.

4336
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:29,760

 

4337
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,189

Little bit caught here. They're a little

4338
01:38:31,189 --> 01:38:31,199
Little bit caught here. They're a little
 

4339
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,910
Little bit caught here. They're a little
bit caught here at the gap, Phil. I

4340
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:33,920
bit caught here at the gap, Phil. I
 

4341
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,510
bit caught here at the gap, Phil. I
think they want point of control now.

4342
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:35,520
think they want point of control now.
 

4343
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,350
think they want point of control now.
They might as well. They've done the

4344
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:37,360
They might as well. They've done the
 

4345
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,910
They might as well. They've done the
hard work now to trap all the bears.

4346
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:39,920
hard work now to trap all the bears.
 

4347
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:46,310
hard work now to trap all the bears.
They might as well go for PC.

4348
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320

 

4349
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,390

Why is it just lost my previous day

4350
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:48,400
Why is it just lost my previous day
 

4351
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,310
Why is it just lost my previous day
value area high? Thought I just moved

4352
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:50,320
value area high? Thought I just moved
 

4353
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:54,470
value area high? Thought I just moved
that down

4354
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:54,480

 

4355
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:59,750

4359
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:19,030

It's 260. 260 to 280.

4360
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:19,040

4373
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,310

a giant giant short squeeze out.

4374
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:46,320
a giant giant short squeeze out.

01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:56,400
to fight against what we're seeing going
 

4387
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,229
to fight against what we're seeing going
on here. Bulls have taken control. They

01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:58,239
on here. Bulls have taken control. They
 

4389
01:39:58,239 --> 01:39:59,750
on here. Bulls have taken control. They
reaccumulated here. They had the

01:39:59,750 --> 01:39:59,760
reaccumulated here. They had the
 

4391
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,109
reaccumulated here. They had the
opportunity here. They failed. Big

4392
01:40:01,109 --> 01:40:01,119
opportunity here. They failed. Big
 

4393

sellers came in here, failed. If they
 

4399
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:07,669
sellers came in here, failed. If they
want a complete rotation back up to the

4400

want a complete rotation back up to the
 

4401
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:10,070
want a complete rotation back up to the
top side of value, that is an incredibly

4402
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,080
top side of value, that is an incredibly
 

4403
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,109
top side of value, that is an incredibly
impressive move. It will be like a by

4404
01:40:13,109 --> 01:40:13,119
impressive move. It will be like a by
 

4405
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:14,790
impressive move. It will be like a by
the time we get up there, 700 plus

4406
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:14,800
the time we get up there, 700 plus
 

4407
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,310
the time we get up there, 700 plus
points. If they do that, we're starting

4408
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:16,320
points. If they do that, we're starting
 

4409
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,750
points. If they do that, we're starting
to see a bit of volume being built out

4410
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:17,760
to see a bit of volume being built out
 

4411
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,830
to see a bit of volume being built out
here. Same story

4412
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:19,840
here. Same story
 

4413
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:32,070
here. Same story
is Little shelf being built out here.

4414
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:32,080

 

4415
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:35,510

Draw that on Ninja.

4416
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:35,520
Draw that on Ninja.
 

4417
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,270
Draw that on Ninja.
Someone needs to invent like some kind

4418
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:37,280
Someone needs to invent like some kind
 

4419
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,709
Someone needs to invent like some kind
of thing where you can draw something on

4420
01:40:40,709 --> 01:40:40,719
of thing where you can draw something on
 

4421
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:42,310
of thing where you can draw something on
Trading View and it replicates it on

4422
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:42,320
Trading View and it replicates it on
 

4423
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,669
Trading View and it replicates it on
Ninja so I don't have to draw everything

4424
01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:43,679
Ninja so I don't have to draw everything
 

4425
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:46,629
Ninja so I don't have to draw everything
twice.

4426
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:46,639
twice.
 

4427
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:50,070
twice.
Amazing.

4428
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:50,080

 

4429
01:40:50,080 --> 01:41:04,550

Saved me so much time.

4430
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:04,560

 

4431
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:08,310

I mean, do they test that old gap? Wild.

4432
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:08,320
I mean, do they test that old gap? Wild.
 

4433
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:12,709
I mean, do they test that old gap? Wild.
Wild. We've swept now

4434
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:12,719
Wild. We've swept now
 

4435
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:17,189
Wild. We've swept now
above that 67s.

4436
01:41:17,189 --> 01:41:17,199

 

4437
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:20,070

I'm just really impressed. Like, I'm

4438
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:20,080
I'm just really impressed. Like, I'm
 

4439
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,070
I'm just really impressed. Like, I'm
really really impressed by the size of

4440
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:22,080
really really impressed by the size of
 

4441
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,229
really really impressed by the size of
the move.

4442
01:41:24,229 --> 01:41:24,239
the move.
 

4443
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:26,950
the move.
You got to think if this ends with it

4444
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:26,960
You got to think if this ends with it
 

4445
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,310
You got to think if this ends with it
being so drastic.

4446
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,320
being so drastic.
 

4447
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:36,229
being so drastic.
It's going to be nasty.

4448
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:36,239

 

4449
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:40,149

Is this the letgo volume?

4450
01:41:40,149 --> 01:41:40,159
Is this the letgo volume?
 

4451
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:41,510
Is this the letgo volume?
I'm going to try a small piece here.

4452
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:41,520
I'm going to try a small piece here.
 

4453
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:46,870
I'm going to try a small piece here.
Just a little tiny tiny little nibble.

4454
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:46,880

 

4455
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,270

Tiny Libble versus 40 just in case

4456
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:49,280
Tiny Libble versus 40 just in case
 

4457
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,709
Tiny Libble versus 40 just in case
they're going to drop it down to 90s.

4458
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
they're going to drop it down to 90s.
 

4459
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:53,270
they're going to drop it down to 90s.
Here we go. Selling coming in here.

4460
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:53,280
Here we go. Selling coming in here.
 

4461
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,030
Here we go. Selling coming in here.
Nice. Going to cover a little bit into

4462
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:55,040
Nice. Going to cover a little bit into
 

4463
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,629
Nice. Going to cover a little bit into
flow zones here into this low volume

4464
01:41:56,629 --> 01:41:56,639
flow zones here into this low volume
 

4465
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,470
flow zones here into this low volume
node while we build some out. If we get

4466
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:58,480
node while we build some out. If we get
 

4467
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:01,189
node while we build some out. If we get
a drift into here, great. But stopped

4468
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:01,199
a drift into here, great. But stopped
 

4469
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:07,030
a drift into here, great. But stopped
gone break even.

4470
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:07,040

 

4471
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:11,430

It's still holding.

4472
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:11,440

 

4473
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,030

It's not an A+ scenario, but we did

4474
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:13,040
It's not an A+ scenario, but we did
 

4475
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,750
It's not an A+ scenario, but we did
leave that volume. If they reject this,

4476
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:15,760
leave that volume. If they reject this,
 

4477
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,709
leave that volume. If they reject this,
great. If not, if they reclaim 45s here,

4478
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
great. If not, if they reclaim 45s here,
 

4479
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:22,229
great. If not, if they reclaim 45s here,
I'll cut this.

4480
01:42:22,229 --> 01:42:22,239

 

4481
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,950

What's that actual pivot? 12764. I'm not

4482
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960
What's that actual pivot? 12764. I'm not
 

4483
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,149
What's that actual pivot? 12764. I'm not
willing to risk that. If they reclaim

4484
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:26,159
willing to risk that. If they reclaim
 

4485
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,550
willing to risk that. If they reclaim
that, we're gone.

4486
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:28,560
that, we're gone.
 

4487
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,310
that, we're gone.
Okay. Stopped out be on the rest. So,

4488
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:30,320
Okay. Stopped out be on the rest. So,
 

4489
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,149
Okay. Stopped out be on the rest. So,
just added, I don't know, a little bit

4490
01:42:32,149 --> 01:42:32,159
just added, I don't know, a little bit
 

4491
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,790
just added, I don't know, a little bit
to my day.

4492
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:34,800
to my day.
 

4493
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,470
to my day.
If we reject this, I'm willing to get

4494
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:36,480
If we reject this, I'm willing to get
 

4495
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,910
If we reject this, I'm willing to get
back in because we're building out a

4496
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:37,920
back in because we're building out a
 

4497
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,830
back in because we're building out a
shelf here. The only thing is, do we

4498
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:39,840
shelf here. The only thing is, do we
 

4499
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,669
shelf here. The only thing is, do we
want to come up here? I hate it when we

4500
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:41,679
want to come up here? I hate it when we
 

4501
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:43,109
want to come up here? I hate it when we
get this close, but we have filled the

4502
01:42:43,109 --> 01:42:43,119
get this close, but we have filled the
 

4503
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:46,950
get this close, but we have filled the
gap. We are have taken GlobeEx highs,

4504
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:46,960
gap. We are have taken GlobeEx highs,
 

4505
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,550
gap. We are have taken GlobeEx highs,
but every time we've done this move,

4506
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:48,560
but every time we've done this move,
 

4507
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,149
but every time we've done this move,
we've trapped in these low volume nodes

4508
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:50,159
we've trapped in these low volume nodes
 

4509
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:51,669
we've trapped in these low volume nodes
and reclaimed and gone higher. That's

4510
01:42:51,669 --> 01:42:51,679
and reclaimed and gone higher. That's
 

4511
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,590
and reclaimed and gone higher. That's
why I'm being very, very aggressive with

4512
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:53,600
why I'm being very, very aggressive with
 

4513
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,189
why I'm being very, very aggressive with
my stops. I'm now completely out of

4514
01:42:55,189 --> 01:42:55,199
my stops. I'm now completely out of
 

4515
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:56,709
my stops. I'm now completely out of
this, like I said. But if we reject

4516
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:56,719
this, like I said. But if we reject
 

4517
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,430
this, like I said. But if we reject
here, there is a potential move. VIX

4518
01:42:59,430 --> 01:42:59,440
here, there is a potential move. VIX
 

4519
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,270
here, there is a potential move. VIX
trying to find a bid. I'd almost rather

4520
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,280
trying to find a bid. I'd almost rather
 

4521
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,109
trying to find a bid. I'd almost rather
us just go and complete the gap fill on

4522
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
us just go and complete the gap fill on
 

4523
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,189
us just go and complete the gap fill on
VIX at this point. And I want to be

4524
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:05,199
VIX at this point. And I want to be
 

4525
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:06,629
VIX at this point. And I want to be
careful. Like, I'm still trying to trade

4526
01:43:06,629 --> 01:43:06,639
careful. Like, I'm still trying to trade
 

4527
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,470
careful. Like, I'm still trying to trade
short. I need to talk to myself. Why are

4528
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:08,480
short. I need to talk to myself. Why are
 

4529
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,910
short. I need to talk to myself. Why are
you trying to trade short too much if

4530
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:09,920
you trying to trade short too much if
 

4531
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:16,390
you trying to trade short too much if
we're inside value?

4532
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:16,400

 

4533
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,629

Big exchange happened at 50. Is it 50?

4534
01:43:18,629 --> 01:43:18,639
Big exchange happened at 50. Is it 50?
 

4535
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:24,149
Big exchange happened at 50. Is it 50?
At 52.

4536
01:43:24,149 --> 01:43:24,159

 

4537
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:26,709

Yeah, huge exchange. Buy side delta

4538
01:43:26,709 --> 01:43:26,719
Yeah, huge exchange. Buy side delta
 

4539
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:29,350
Yeah, huge exchange. Buy side delta
caught above 50.

4540
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:29,360
caught above 50.
 

4541
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,950
caught above 50.
Might be a bigger drift down here when

4542
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:30,960
Might be a bigger drift down here when
 

4543
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:48,870
Might be a bigger drift down here when
it's ready.

4544
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:48,880

 

4545
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,950

Starting to see cell pressure here.

4546
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:52,960
Starting to see cell pressure here.
 

4547
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,790
Starting to see cell pressure here.
And remember, we're very, very, very

4548
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:54,800
And remember, we're very, very, very
 

4549
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,030
And remember, we're very, very, very
steep.

4550
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,040
steep.
 

4551
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,950
steep.
Starting to see cell pressure step in

4552
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:58,960
Starting to see cell pressure step in
 

4553
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,109
Starting to see cell pressure step in
here. If they start letting go, this can

4554
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:01,119
here. If they start letting go, this can
 

4555
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:02,790
here. If they start letting go, this can
be a straight wash down. Okay, here we

4556
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:02,800
be a straight wash down. Okay, here we
 

4557
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,390
be a straight wash down. Okay, here we
go. Here we go. I'm in this. I'm already

4558
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:06,400
go. Here we go. I'm in this. I'm already
 

4559
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,070
go. Here we go. I'm in this. I'm already
taking some off because I don't know if

4560
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:08,080
taking some off because I don't know if
 

4561
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,910
taking some off because I don't know if
they're going to trap. So, if we can get

4562
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:09,920
they're going to trap. So, if we can get
 

4563
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,629
they're going to trap. So, if we can get
through PDC, big buyers trying to step

4564
01:44:12,629 --> 01:44:12,639
through PDC, big buyers trying to step
 

4565
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:14,310
through PDC, big buyers trying to step
in here. Limit orders here and big

4566
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:14,320
in here. Limit orders here and big
 

4567
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,149
in here. Limit orders here and big
market buyers stepping in here. Still in

4568
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:16,159
market buyers stepping in here. Still in
 

4569
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:18,629
market buyers stepping in here. Still in
this.

4570
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:18,639
this.
 

4571
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,149
this.
Come on. But that move for me. I need to

4572
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:20,159
Come on. But that move for me. I need to
 

4573
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,709
Come on. But that move for me. I need to
be able to read you now. Watching that

4574
01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:22,719
be able to read you now. Watching that
 

4575
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:26,149
be able to read you now. Watching that
control at 30. If they fail 30, we look

4576
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:26,159
control at 30. If they fail 30, we look
 

4577
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,669
control at 30. If they fail 30, we look
good for a bit more downside pressure.

4578
01:44:27,669 --> 01:44:27,679
good for a bit more downside pressure.
 

4579
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,510
good for a bit more downside pressure.
If they reclaim 30, I'm not interested.

4580
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:29,520
If they reclaim 30, I'm not interested.
 

4581
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,790
If they reclaim 30, I'm not interested.
That's where the big buyer stepped in

4582
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:30,800
That's where the big buyer stepped in
 

4583
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,350
That's where the big buyer stepped in
and got himself caught. Looks good so

4584
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
and got himself caught. Looks good so
 

4585
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:37,109
and got himself caught. Looks good so
far.

4586
01:44:37,109 --> 01:44:37,119

 

4587
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:38,870

Nice.

4588
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:38,880
Nice.
 

4589
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,510
Nice.
Let's go.

4590
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:41,520
Let's go.
 

4591
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:48,629
Let's go.
Let's go.

4592
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:48,639

 

4593
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,030

Watching these 100's whole number.

4594
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:51,040
Watching these 100's whole number.
 

4595
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,390
Watching these 100's whole number.
Buyers have got themselves caught in

4596
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,400
Buyers have got themselves caught in
 

4597
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:56,790
Buyers have got themselves caught in
this now at the tops. Looking good.

4598
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:56,800
this now at the tops. Looking good.
 

4599
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,270
this now at the tops. Looking good.
Partial here into PDC. If we flush this

4600
01:44:59,270 --> 01:44:59,280
Partial here into PDC. If we flush this
 

4601
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,709
Partial here into PDC. If we flush this
watching this gray box and then really

4602
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:00,719
watching this gray box and then really
 

4603
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:03,590
watching this gray box and then really
I'd like to get down into 30s,

4604
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:03,600
I'd like to get down into 30s,
 

4605
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,910
I'd like to get down into 30s,
but I I know this can still be front

4606
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:05,920
but I I know this can still be front
 

4607
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,350
but I I know this can still be front
side. I'm just trying to time it well,

4608
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:07,360
side. I'm just trying to time it well,
 

4609
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,590
side. I'm just trying to time it well,
but hopefully you're managing this well

4610
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:09,600
but hopefully you're managing this well
 

4611
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,470
but hopefully you're managing this well
with me. You do not want to see a

4612
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:12,480
with me. You do not want to see a
 

4613
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:16,149
with me. You do not want to see a
reclaim into into 50s. Ideally, they

4614
01:45:16,149 --> 01:45:16,159
reclaim into into 50s. Ideally, they
 

4615
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:21,189
reclaim into into 50s. Ideally, they
reject 32s, but where is this player?

4616
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:21,199
reject 32s, but where is this player?
 

4617
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:23,189
reject 32s, but where is this player?
33s.

4618
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:23,199
33s.
 

4619
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:24,790
33s.
Don't really want to see it reclaim this

4620
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:24,800
Don't really want to see it reclaim this
 

4621
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,470
Don't really want to see it reclaim this
shelf here. Definitely don't want to see

4622
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:26,480
shelf here. Definitely don't want to see
 

4623
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,830
shelf here. Definitely don't want to see
it reclaim any of this. So, I'm not even

4624
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:27,840
it reclaim any of this. So, I'm not even
 

4625
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:28,950
it reclaim any of this. So, I'm not even
going to give it to up there. I want to

4626
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:28,960
going to give it to up there. I want to
 

4627
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,189
going to give it to up there. I want to
see this block here where this buyer

4628
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:31,199
see this block here where this buyer
 

4629
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,750
see this block here where this buyer
where this big buyer came in in and

4630
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:33,760
where this big buyer came in in and
 

4631
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,070
where this big buyer came in in and
around 30. If they reclaim this, I'm out

4632
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:36,080
around 30. If they reclaim this, I'm out
 

4633
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,149
around 30. If they reclaim this, I'm out
and it will just be a small win again

4634
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:38,159
and it will just be a small win again
 

4635
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,430
and it will just be a small win again
and we can just let this squeeze out

4636
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:39,440
and we can just let this squeeze out
 

4637
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,030
and we can just let this squeeze out
again. We are not going to fight the

4638
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:41,040
again. We are not going to fight the
 

4639
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,189
again. We are not going to fight the
tape, folks. Okay? We're not here to

4640
01:45:43,189 --> 01:45:43,199
tape, folks. Okay? We're not here to
 

4641
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,270
tape, folks. Okay? We're not here to
fight the tape. If they want to take

4642
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:45,280
fight the tape. If they want to take
 

4643
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,870
fight the tape. If they want to take
control, let them take control. Very

4644
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:46,880
control, let them take control. Very
 

4645
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,629
control, let them take control. Very
much like yesterday. If they want to

4646
01:45:48,629 --> 01:45:48,639
much like yesterday. If they want to
 

4647
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:51,270
much like yesterday. If they want to
take control, you do not go add ad. You

4648
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:51,280
take control, you do not go add ad. You
 

4649
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,669
take control, you do not go add ad. You
stop out, make your money, and you let

4650
01:45:53,669 --> 01:45:53,679
stop out, make your money, and you let
 

4651
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,430
stop out, make your money, and you let
it squeeze out again.

4652
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:57,440

 

4653
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,109

It's a nice rejection there in front of

4654
01:45:59,109 --> 01:45:59,119
It's a nice rejection there in front of
 

4655
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,830
It's a nice rejection there in front of
those 30s.

4656
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:01,840
those 30s.
 

4657
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,790
those 30s.
Big battle here. Watching bookmat. I'm

4658
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:04,800
Big battle here. Watching bookmat. I'm
 

4659
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,550
Big battle here. Watching bookmat. I'm
playing against this buyer who got

4660
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:06,560
playing against this buyer who got
 

4661
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:09,350
playing against this buyer who got
himself caught into sort of his uh price

4662
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:09,360
himself caught into sort of his uh price
 

4663
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,830
himself caught into sort of his uh price
was at 3375,

4664
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:11,840
was at 3375,
 

4665
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,229
was at 3375,
right? I want him to say stay heavy. If

4666
01:46:14,229 --> 01:46:14,239
right? I want him to say stay heavy. If
 

4667
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:16,950
right? I want him to say stay heavy. If
we start reclaiming 30s, I will cut this

4668
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
we start reclaiming 30s, I will cut this
 

4669
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,070
we start reclaiming 30s, I will cut this
because I'm not going to get caught in

4670
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:18,080
because I'm not going to get caught in
 

4671
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,950
because I'm not going to get caught in
like a 60 70 point swipe up. Very very

4672
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:20,960
like a 60 70 point swipe up. Very very
 

4673
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,870
like a 60 70 point swipe up. Very very
close here to stopping out. Need to see

4674
01:46:22,870 --> 01:46:22,880
close here to stopping out. Need to see
 

4675
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,790
close here to stopping out. Need to see
this reject. We don't reject, I'm out of

4676
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:24,800
this reject. We don't reject, I'm out of
 

4677
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,189
this reject. We don't reject, I'm out of
this. And I can always re-enter in as we

4678
01:46:27,189 --> 01:46:27,199
this. And I can always re-enter in as we
 

4679
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,910
this. And I can always re-enter in as we
reapproach the shelf.

4680
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:29,920
reapproach the shelf.
 

4681
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,189
reapproach the shelf.
Remember, I'm a bit later on my

4682
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:31,199
Remember, I'm a bit later on my
 

4683
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:39,990
Remember, I'm a bit later on my
execution here. The downside,

4684
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,000

 

4685
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,470

we are holding flow zone. So, be aware

4686
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:42,480
we are holding flow zone. So, be aware
 

4687
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,990
we are holding flow zone. So, be aware
of that. Technically, we're bullish. I

4688
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:44,000
of that. Technically, we're bullish. I
 

4689
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,550
of that. Technically, we're bullish. I
know I'm playing this counter trend on

4690
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:46,560
know I'm playing this counter trend on
 

4691
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,430
know I'm playing this counter trend on
the day, trying to play the protrend.

4692
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:49,440
the day, trying to play the protrend.
 

4693
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,950
the day, trying to play the protrend.
Okay, starting to reclaim here out of

4694
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:50,960
Okay, starting to reclaim here out of
 

4695
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,189
Okay, starting to reclaim here out of
this before we get the squeeze. can

4696
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:53,199
this before we get the squeeze. can
 

4697
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,790
this before we get the squeeze. can
always re-enter if we stay heavy versus

4698
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:54,800
always re-enter if we stay heavy versus
 

4699
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,629
always re-enter if we stay heavy versus
volume, but I'm not going to give it any

4700
01:46:56,629 --> 01:46:56,639
volume, but I'm not going to give it any
 

4701
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:58,950
volume, but I'm not going to give it any
more room. If this buyer gets his way,

4702
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:58,960
more room. If this buyer gets his way,
 

4703
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:17,510
more room. If this buyer gets his way,
we squee resqueeze up.

4704
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:17,520

 

4705
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,030

Where's this shelf coming into the

4706
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:19,040
Where's this shelf coming into the
 

4707
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,629
Where's this shelf coming into the
shelf? We reclaim the shelf. We make new

4708
01:47:20,629 --> 01:47:20,639
shelf? We reclaim the shelf. We make new
 

4709
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,709
shelf? We reclaim the shelf. We make new
highs. reject this shelf and we could

4710
01:47:22,709 --> 01:47:22,719
highs. reject this shelf and we could
 

4711
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:24,229
highs. reject this shelf and we could
put in a lower high because we do have

4712
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:24,239
put in a lower high because we do have
 

4713
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:28,470
put in a lower high because we do have
excess on this high and we did leave

4714
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:28,480
excess on this high and we did leave
 

4715
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,430
excess on this high and we did leave
118 lot and 88 lot and another guy at 91

4716
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:31,440
118 lot and 88 lot and another guy at 91
 

4717
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,109
118 lot and 88 lot and another guy at 91
lot tried to reclaim that and they all

4718
01:47:33,109 --> 01:47:33,119
lot tried to reclaim that and they all
 

4719
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,510
lot tried to reclaim that and they all
failed. All right, so we do have market

4720
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
failed. All right, so we do have market
 

4721
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,510
failed. All right, so we do have market
order buying at the highs who are

4722
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:37,520
order buying at the highs who are
 

4723
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,070
order buying at the highs who are
currently caught. So if we reject this

4724
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,080
currently caught. So if we reject this
 

4725
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,310
currently caught. So if we reject this
volume there is potential to make lower

4726
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:42,320
volume there is potential to make lower
 

4727
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,790
volume there is potential to make lower
lows and roll over. If we reclaim this

4728
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:44,800
lows and roll over. If we reclaim this
 

4729
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,229
lows and roll over. If we reclaim this
volume then I think we will go previous

4730
01:47:46,229 --> 01:47:46,239
volume then I think we will go previous
 

4731
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:50,709
volume then I think we will go previous
day point of control.

4732
01:47:50,709 --> 01:47:50,719

 

4733
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:54,629

ES back under its gap

4734
01:47:54,629 --> 01:47:54,639
ES back under its gap
 

4735
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,709
ES back under its gap
relative strength in NQ today. Also need

4736
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:56,719
relative strength in NQ today. Also need
 

4737
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:57,910
relative strength in NQ today. Also need
to be aware of that we're shorting

4738
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:57,920
to be aware of that we're shorting
 

4739
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,270
to be aware of that we're shorting
something relative strength because the

4740
01:47:59,270 --> 01:47:59,280
something relative strength because the
 

4741
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:02,070
something relative strength because the
rebound has been

4742
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:02,080
rebound has been
 

4743
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:06,390
rebound has been
decent out of tech.

4744
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:06,400

 

4745
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,030

Currently flatten this now and just

4746
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:09,040
Currently flatten this now and just
 

4747
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,470
Currently flatten this now and just
waiting to see what we do. And again, if

4748
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:10,480
waiting to see what we do. And again, if
 

4749
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,229
waiting to see what we do. And again, if
we reclaim volume, then I would expect

4750
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:12,239
we reclaim volume, then I would expect
 

4751
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,550
we reclaim volume, then I would expect
new highs. And I just have to not be

4752
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:14,560
new highs. And I just have to not be
 

4753
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:29,590
new highs. And I just have to not be
stubborn today and keep trying to force.

4754
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:29,600

 

4755
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,030

There's the squeeze. They've reclaimed

4756
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:31,040
There's the squeeze. They've reclaimed
 

4757
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,189
There's the squeeze. They've reclaimed
that level where he was stuck. This is

4758
01:48:33,189 --> 01:48:33,199
that level where he was stuck. This is
 

4759
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,270
that level where he was stuck. This is
why order flow is important. Now, the

4760
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:35,280
why order flow is important. Now, the
 

4761
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:38,790
why order flow is important. Now, the
next level is these highs here.

4762
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:38,800
next level is these highs here.
 

4763
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,629
next level is these highs here.
There isn't too much delta above. There

4764
01:48:40,629 --> 01:48:40,639
There isn't too much delta above. There
 

4765
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:42,229
There isn't too much delta above. There
was buying up there, but it got paired

4766
01:48:42,229 --> 01:48:42,239
was buying up there, but it got paired
 

4767
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,790
was buying up there, but it got paired
off with selling aggressively.

4768
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:44,800
off with selling aggressively.
 

4769
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,270
off with selling aggressively.
So 65

4770
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:47,280
So 65
 

4771
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,030
So 65
to

4772
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:49,040
to
 

4773
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,470
to
to 75, that 10point range

4774
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:52,480
to 75, that 10point range
 

4775
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,870
to 75, that 10point range
up here on bookmap is where these buyers

4776
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:54,880
up here on bookmap is where these buyers
 

4777
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,709
up here on bookmap is where these buyers
got a little bit caught, but so far

4778
01:48:56,709 --> 01:48:56,719
got a little bit caught, but so far
 

4779
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:02,470
got a little bit caught, but so far
they're comfortable. Okay, right here.

4780
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,480

 

4781
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,270

Right, these guys here got caught.

4782
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:05,280
Right, these guys here got caught.
 

4783
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,550
Right, these guys here got caught.
Okay. And then I was playing against

4784
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:06,560
Okay. And then I was playing against
 

4785
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,550
Okay. And then I was playing against
these big players here as we started to

4786
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:08,560
these big players here as we started to
 

4787
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,790
these big players here as we started to
sell under them and came a little

4788
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:10,800
sell under them and came a little
 

4789
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,310
sell under them and came a little
further into volume. We actually tested

4790
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:12,320
further into volume. We actually tested
 

4791
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,189
further into volume. We actually tested
the other side of volume there,

4792
01:49:15,189 --> 01:49:15,199
the other side of volume there,
 

4793
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:16,790
the other side of volume there,
which is interesting. So, we cut through

4794
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:16,800
which is interesting. So, we cut through
 

4795
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,629
which is interesting. So, we cut through
it. Think about this gray box. We tested

4796
01:49:18,629 --> 01:49:18,639
it. Think about this gray box. We tested
 

4797
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:19,830
it. Think about this gray box. We tested
to the other side of volume. That's

4798
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:19,840
to the other side of volume. That's
 

4799
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,350
to the other side of volume. That's
where they were trapped. And we can

4800
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,360
where they were trapped. And we can
 

4801
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,109
where they were trapped. And we can
still put in a higher low here. So, it's

4802
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119
still put in a higher low here. So, it's
 

4803
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:26,070
still put in a higher low here. So, it's
very, very tricky timing. This is not

4804
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:26,080
very, very tricky timing. This is not
 

4805
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,070
very, very tricky timing. This is not
going to be easy. This is very hard

4806
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:28,080
going to be easy. This is very hard
 

4807
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,510
going to be easy. This is very hard
trade to be taking.

4808
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:31,520
trade to be taking.
 

4809
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,590
trade to be taking.
And we still have we're close now. If

4810
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:33,600
And we still have we're close now. If
 

4811
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,350
And we still have we're close now. If
they want to go PC and value area high

4812
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,360
they want to go PC and value area high
 

4813
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,629
they want to go PC and value area high
from yesterday, I mean, they can, can't

4814
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:36,639
from yesterday, I mean, they can, can't
 

4815
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:39,030
from yesterday, I mean, they can, can't
they? We're that close. It's a good

4816
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:39,040
they? We're that close. It's a good
 

4817
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,629
they? We're that close. It's a good
reaction off that box that you've got

4818
01:49:40,629 --> 01:49:40,639
reaction off that box that you've got
 

4819
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:49,990
reaction off that box that you've got
drawn out on bookmap.

4820
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:50,000

 

4821
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,790

Nice aggressive selling here. Now, can

4822
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:52,800
Nice aggressive selling here. Now, can
 

4823
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,310
Nice aggressive selling here. Now, can
they get follow through is the question

4824
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:54,320
they get follow through is the question
 

4825
01:49:54,320 --> 01:50:01,510
they get follow through is the question
after rejecting volume?

4826
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:01,520

 

4827
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,109

No breakdown yet. Look at the edge of

4828
01:50:03,109 --> 01:50:03,119
No breakdown yet. Look at the edge of
 

4829
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,830
No breakdown yet. Look at the edge of
this gray box. Uh this little shelf

4830
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:05,840
this gray box. Uh this little shelf
 

4831
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,590
this gray box. Uh this little shelf
we're on here. That's your sort of new

4832
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:07,600
we're on here. That's your sort of new
 

4833
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,070
we're on here. That's your sort of new
node. We can move this down. Look here.

4834
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:10,080
node. We can move this down. Look here.
 

4835
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,629
node. We can move this down. Look here.
They've built out volume in here now. So

4836
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:12,639
They've built out volume in here now. So
 

4837
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:14,629
They've built out volume in here now. So
that's what we're watching. If we start

4838
01:50:14,629 --> 01:50:14,639
that's what we're watching. If we start
 

4839
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,790
that's what we're watching. If we start
rejecting that, there's a bigger wash.

4840
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
rejecting that, there's a bigger wash.
 

4841
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,270
rejecting that, there's a bigger wash.
This can still build and come up into

4842
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:19,280
This can still build and come up into
 

4843
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,109
This can still build and come up into
here. The structure is still bullish. I

4844
01:50:21,109 --> 01:50:21,119
here. The structure is still bullish. I
 

4845
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,669
here. The structure is still bullish. I
want you to understand that.

4846
01:50:23,669 --> 01:50:23,679
want you to understand that.
 

4847
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:25,189
want you to understand that.
I'm trying to time this really, really

4848
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:25,199
I'm trying to time this really, really
 

4849
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:26,310
I'm trying to time this really, really
well. It's the hardest trade in the

4850
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:26,320
well. It's the hardest trade in the
 

4851
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,750
well. It's the hardest trade in the
book. It's going to much easier when we

4852
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:27,760
book. It's going to much easier when we
 

4853
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,109
book. It's going to much easier when we
start leaving all this and the flow

4854
01:50:29,109 --> 01:50:29,119
start leaving all this and the flow
 

4855
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:30,790
start leaving all this and the flow
zones start turning and we can have

4856
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:30,800
zones start turning and we can have
 

4857
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,310
zones start turning and we can have
space down into here. The overall

4858
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,320
space down into here. The overall
 

4859
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,510
space down into here. The overall
momentum on the day is definitely

4860
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:33,520
momentum on the day is definitely
 

4861
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:44,310
momentum on the day is definitely
bullish. Cannot argue with that.

4862
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,320

 

4863
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,830

Some more aggressive selling here. This

4864
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:45,840
Some more aggressive selling here. This
 

4865
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,590
Some more aggressive selling here. This
is sort of that edge of that gray box.

4866
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:47,600
is sort of that edge of that gray box.
 

4867
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,109
is sort of that edge of that gray box.
How we act here is going to become very

4868
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,119
How we act here is going to become very
 

4869
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:51,430
How we act here is going to become very
very important if they let go of it for

4870
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:51,440
very important if they let go of it for
 

4871
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:54,470
very important if they let go of it for
a bigger move down towards that PDC. So

4872
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:54,480
a bigger move down towards that PDC. So
 

4873
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,910
a bigger move down towards that PDC. So
far they are absorbing absolutely

4874
01:50:55,910 --> 01:50:55,920
far they are absorbing absolutely
 

4875
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:57,990
far they are absorbing absolutely
everything. But there is some selling

4876
01:50:57,990 --> 01:50:58,000
everything. But there is some selling
 

4877
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,350
everything. But there is some selling
trying to come in here. But this can be

4878
01:50:59,350 --> 01:50:59,360
trying to come in here. But this can be
 

4879
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:01,189
trying to come in here. But this can be
a two-leg and straight back up. Like

4880
01:51:01,189 --> 01:51:01,199
a two-leg and straight back up. Like
 

4881
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:02,470
a two-leg and straight back up. Like
there's no doubt about it. If they want

4882
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:02,480
there's no doubt about it. If they want
 

4883
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,590
there's no doubt about it. If they want
to save this, they're going to save it.

4884
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:05,600
to save this, they're going to save it.
 

4885
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,430
to save this, they're going to save it.
That previous day up into that next

4886
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:07,440
That previous day up into that next
 

4887
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:10,149
That previous day up into that next
shelf at 80s. Get rid of him so I can

4888
01:51:10,149 --> 01:51:10,159
shelf at 80s. Get rid of him so I can
 

4889
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:11,430
shelf at 80s. Get rid of him so I can
see a bit cleaner. They're still

4890
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:11,440
see a bit cleaner. They're still
 

4891
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:15,350
see a bit cleaner. They're still
absorbing here.

4892
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:15,360

 

4893
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,669

Bears need a breakdown and new low here.

4894
01:51:17,669 --> 01:51:17,679
Bears need a breakdown and new low here.
 

4895
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:19,510
Bears need a breakdown and new low here.
And bulls will just want to absorb here.

4896
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:19,520
And bulls will just want to absorb here.
 

4897
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,830
And bulls will just want to absorb here.
Do a two-leg sort of trap to go back to

4898
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:21,840
Do a two-leg sort of trap to go back to
 

4899
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,590
Do a two-leg sort of trap to go back to
the highs, which they're holding

4900
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:23,600
the highs, which they're holding
 

4901
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:26,149
the highs, which they're holding
underneath this volume node.

4902
01:51:26,149 --> 01:51:26,159
underneath this volume node.
 

4903
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:34,310
underneath this volume node.
Can we move this? There we go.

4904
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320

 

4905
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:37,350

It's a good job by Bulls so far. Here we

4906
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:37,360
It's a good job by Bulls so far. Here we
 

4907
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:40,149
It's a good job by Bulls so far. Here we
go. All right.

4908
01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:40,159
go. All right.
 

4909
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:42,390
go. All right.
Can we get follow through? Man, what a

4910
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:42,400
Can we get follow through? Man, what a
 

4911
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,149
Can we get follow through? Man, what a
battle.

4912
01:51:44,149 --> 01:51:44,159
battle.
 

4913
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:45,750
battle.
Passive buyer down here that I can't

4914
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:45,760
Passive buyer down here that I can't
 

4915
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,070
Passive buyer down here that I can't
see. Once he gets out the way, there's a

4916
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
see. Once he gets out the way, there's a
 

4917
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:59,109
see. Once he gets out the way, there's a
flush coming. if he gets out of the way.

4918
01:51:59,109 --> 01:51:59,119

 

4919
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:01,030

Yeah, passive buyer down here. Still

4920
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:01,040
Yeah, passive buyer down here. Still
 

4921
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,510
Yeah, passive buyer down here. Still
soaking for now.

4922
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:03,520
soaking for now.
 

4923
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:07,030
soaking for now.
I think the flush is coming soon.

4924
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:07,040
I think the flush is coming soon.
 

4925
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:12,229
I think the flush is coming soon.
Someone's about to get stuck.

4926
01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:12,239

 

4927
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:14,629

Here we go.

4928
01:52:14,629 --> 01:52:14,639
Here we go.
 

4929
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:17,109
Here we go.
It's very close.

4930
01:52:17,109 --> 01:52:17,119
It's very close.
 

4931
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:19,030
It's very close.
Here

4932
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,040
Here
 

4933
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:21,430
Here
we go. They need to take out this low,

4934
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:21,440
we go. They need to take out this low,

good job building liquidity. If they
 

4973
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,750
good job building liquidity. If they
hold this, it'll be a two-leg and if

4974
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:13,760
hold this, it'll be a two-leg and if
 

4975
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,189
hold this, it'll be a two-leg and if
they reclaim, you know what happens. But

the whole thing. Let's do like a 300
 

5017
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,589
the whole thing. Let's do like a 300
point absolute slam on all of their

01:54:03,589 --> 01:54:03,599
point absolute slam on all of their
 

5019

Where did they get stuck?
 

5025
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:22,950
Where did they get stuck?
You want to see sellers maintain control

5026
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:22,960
You want to see sellers maintain control
 

5027
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,030
You want to see sellers maintain control
of 100s. All right. You want to see

5028
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:25,040
of 100s. All right. You want to see
 

5029
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,430
of 100s. All right. You want to see
sellers ma maintain control of 100s. I'm

5030
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:27,440
sellers ma maintain control of 100s. I'm
 

5031
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:28,470
sellers ma maintain control of 100s. I'm
just zooming out to see where the big

5032
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:28,480
just zooming out to see where the big
 

5033
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:33,510
just zooming out to see where the big
buyers came in in this last lot.

5034
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:33,520

 

5035
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,870

Yeah, I think there's a move down to

5036
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:34,880
Yeah, I think there's a move down to
 

5037
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,270
Yeah, I think there's a move down to
25,000 and below, but we have to

5038
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:37,280
25,000 and below, but we have to
 

5039
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:39,910
25,000 and below, but we have to
maintain control uh towards these 100s,

5040
01:54:39,910 --> 01:54:39,920
maintain control uh towards these 100s,
 

5041
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:42,470
maintain control uh towards these 100s,
I would say. Otherwise, this is a

5042
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:42,480
I would say. Otherwise, this is a
 

5043
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,030
I would say. Otherwise, this is a
rotation,

5044
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:45,040
rotation,
 

5045
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,750
rotation,
right? This is the rotation,

5046
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:47,760
right? This is the rotation,
 

5047
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,430
right? This is the rotation,
right? If they reject this, they retest

5048
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
right? If they reject this, they retest
 

5049
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,790
right? If they reject this, they retest
this. If they reject this, they retest

5050
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:50,800
this. If they reject this, they retest
 

5051
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,229
this. If they reject this, they retest
this. If they hold this and then reclaim

5052
01:54:52,229 --> 01:54:52,239
this. If they hold this and then reclaim
 

5053
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:54,390
this. If they hold this and then reclaim
this, then we go back to highs. So, you

5054
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:54,400
this, then we go back to highs. So, you
 

5055
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,510
this, then we go back to highs. So, you
have to pay yourself because like we

5056
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:55,520
have to pay yourself because like we
 

5057
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:56,950
have to pay yourself because like we
said, if this is a two-leg and they want

5058
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:56,960
said, if this is a two-leg and they want
 

5059
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,310
said, if this is a two-leg and they want
to bid off this, then we go back to

5060
01:54:58,310 --> 01:54:58,320
to bid off this, then we go back to
 

5061
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,470
to bid off this, then we go back to
highs. But so far, we're in control of

5062
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:00,480
highs. But so far, we're in control of
 

5063
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,109
highs. But so far, we're in control of
this move. You want to see bears take

5064
01:55:03,109 --> 01:55:03,119
this move. You want to see bears take
 

5065
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:05,830

anymore. Here we go. Can we get follow
through here? Pretty please. Flushito.

5092
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:53,520
through here? Pretty please. Flushito.
 

5093
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,030
through here? Pretty please. Flushito.
Let's go through previous week value

5094
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:55,040
Let's go through previous week value
 

5095
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,790
Let's go through previous week value
area low. Let's not fanny around in this

5096
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:56,800
area low. Let's not fanny around in this
 

5097
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:03,589
area low. Let's not fanny around in this
level. Just come and wipe them all out.

5098
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:03,599

 

5099
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:17,109

Come on, baby.

5100
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:17,119

 

5101
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:24,629

Bit of absorption here.

5102
01:56:24,629 --> 01:56:24,639

 

5103
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:27,109

115 to 118 looks like the level, but I

5104
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:27,119
115 to 118 looks like the level, but I
 

5105
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:28,550
115 to 118 looks like the level, but I
don't want to see them reclaim 100.

5106
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,560
don't want to see them reclaim 100.
 

5107
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:29,990
don't want to see them reclaim 100.
Otherwise, they're going to do that rip

5108
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:30,000
Otherwise, they're going to do that rip
 

5109
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:37,990
Otherwise, they're going to do that rip
straight back up to 15 to 20.

5110
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:38,000

 

5111
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,669

Let's go.

5112
01:56:41,669 --> 01:56:41,679

 

5113
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:43,189

Have to respect this shelf. It's why

5114
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
Have to respect this shelf. It's why
 

5115
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,629
Have to respect this shelf. It's why
it's here, folks. Right? These gray

5116
01:56:44,629 --> 01:56:44,639
it's here, folks. Right? These gray
 

5117
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:46,070
it's here, folks. Right? These gray
boxes are here because we've created

5118
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:46,080
boxes are here because we've created
 

5119
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,070
boxes are here because we've created
volume. That thing that um Michael

5120
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,080
volume. That thing that um Michael
 

5121
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,830
volume. That thing that um Michael
Huddston thinks doesn't matter and

5122
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:49,840
Huddston thinks doesn't matter and
 

5123
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,589
Huddston thinks doesn't matter and
bizarre. That thing that actually

5124
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:51,599
bizarre. That thing that actually
 

5125
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:54,149
bizarre. That thing that actually
matters um is holding up. All right. So

5126
01:56:54,149 --> 01:56:54,159
matters um is holding up. All right. So
 

5127
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:55,669
matters um is holding up. All right. So
the rotation can happen all the way back

5128
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:55,679
the rotation can happen all the way back
 

5129
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:57,750
the rotation can happen all the way back
to here. I don't really want to see that

5130
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:57,760
to here. I don't really want to see that
 

5131
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,990
to here. I don't really want to see that
because I think it means bears start to

5132
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:00,000
because I think it means bears start to
 

5133
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:17,910
because I think it means bears start to
lose impetus for this downside moveing

5134
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:17,920

 

5135
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:19,350

these 100s. Remember if we get through

5136
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:19,360
these 100s. Remember if we get through
 

5137
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:22,070
these 100s. Remember if we get through
100s we can rotate straight back to 20s.

5138
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:22,080
100s we can rotate straight back to 20s.
 

5139
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,990
100s we can rotate straight back to 20s.
Don't really want to see that. All

5140
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,000
Don't really want to see that. All
 

5141
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,430
Don't really want to see that. All
right? Because if we start reclaiming

5142
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:25,440
right? Because if we start reclaiming
 

5143
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,030
right? Because if we start reclaiming
that volume above, this would be a

5144
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,040
that volume above, this would be a
 

5145
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,629
that volume above, this would be a
two-legged pullback that holds and can

5146
01:57:28,629 --> 01:57:28,639
two-legged pullback that holds and can
 

5147
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:31,109
two-legged pullback that holds and can
squeeze back out to previous day point

5148
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:31,119
squeeze back out to previous day point
 

5149
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:34,070
squeeze back out to previous day point
control. So, stops into break even. And

5150
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:34,080
control. So, stops into break even. And
 

5151
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,310
control. So, stops into break even. And
again, we can stop out if well for me

5152
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:36,320
again, we can stop out if well for me
 

5153
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:37,669
again, we can stop out if well for me
stops are into break even and we can

5154
01:57:37,669 --> 01:57:37,679
stops are into break even and we can
 

5155
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:40,229
stops are into break even and we can
stop out if we need to.

5156
01:57:40,229 --> 01:57:40,239
stop out if we need to.
 

5157
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:41,910
stop out if we need to.
And we can always reenter. And we always

5158
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:41,920
And we can always reenter. And we always
 

5159
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,830
And we can always reenter. And we always
talk about like don't force away against

5160
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:43,840
talk about like don't force away against
 

5161
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,109
talk about like don't force away against
this. If they're going to hold a two-leg

5162
01:57:45,109 --> 01:57:45,119
this. If they're going to hold a two-leg
 

5163
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:46,629
this. If they're going to hold a two-leg
pullback and they want to achieve

5164
01:57:46,629 --> 01:57:46,639
pullback and they want to achieve
 

5165
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:47,990
pullback and they want to achieve
previous day point control, they're

5166
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:48,000
previous day point control, they're
 

5167
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,430
previous day point control, they're
going to do it. And if you don't have

5168
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:49,440
going to do it. And if you don't have
 

5169
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,830
going to do it. And if you don't have
the discipline to walk away, then you

5170
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:51,840
the discipline to walk away, then you
 

5171
01:57:51,840 --> 01:58:03,990
the discipline to walk away, then you
will get hurt.

5172
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:04,000

 

5173
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,430

Very big level here. They can squeeze

5174
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:05,440
Very big level here. They can squeeze
 

5175
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:08,229
Very big level here. They can squeeze
straight through this on a reclaim.

5176
01:58:08,229 --> 01:58:08,239
straight through this on a reclaim.
 

5177
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:10,790
straight through this on a reclaim.
Flat now on this into tens. Can always

5178
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:10,800
Flat now on this into tens. Can always
 

5179
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:19,109
Flat now on this into tens. Can always
re-enter into 20s if I want.

5180
01:58:19,109 --> 01:58:19,119

 

5181
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:21,990

Well, the H1 swept uh a major level for

5182
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:22,000
Well, the H1 swept uh a major level for
 

5183
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,070
Well, the H1 swept uh a major level for
me.

5184
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,080

 

5185
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,910

If they want to rebuild here, I think

5186
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:27,920
If they want to rebuild here, I think
 

5187
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:29,030
If they want to rebuild here, I think
they're going to have to rebuild

5188
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:29,040
they're going to have to rebuild
 

5189
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,709
they're going to have to rebuild
structure on an H1 more than a small

5190
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:30,719
structure on an H1 more than a small
 

5191
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:33,990
structure on an H1 more than a small
pullback. But I mean, we'll see. You

5192
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,000
pullback. But I mean, we'll see. You
 

5193
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,510
pullback. But I mean, we'll see. You
might well be right. If they want to do

5194
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:35,520
might well be right. If they want to do
 

5195
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,790
might well be right. If they want to do
this inverted head and shoulders, but it

5196
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:36,800
this inverted head and shoulders, but it
 

5197
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,149
this inverted head and shoulders, but it
still means there's a short back down.

5198
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:38,159
still means there's a short back down.
 

5199
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:39,669
still means there's a short back down.
But I'm not convinced. We've just swept

5200
01:58:39,669 --> 01:58:39,679
But I'm not convinced. We've just swept
 

5201
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:44,629
But I'm not convinced. We've just swept
out all that liquidity from GloEx

5202
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:44,639

 

5203
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,550

01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,310
and what time was this yesterday? All
the way up to close yesterday. If they

01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:48,320
the way up to close yesterday. If they
 

5207
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,070
the way up to close yesterday. If they
want to squeeze above this, we get very

5208
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:50,080
want to squeeze above this, we get very
 

5209
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:54,070
want to squeeze above this, we get very
thick above this from sort of 93s

thick above this from sort of 93s

thick above this from sort of 93s
up to 77. Is that right? 193 to 77. If

up to 77. Is that right? 193 to 77. If
 

5213
01:58:58,800 --> 01:58:59,910
up to 77. Is that right? 193 to 77. If
they want to keep going, like I said,

5214
01:58:59,910 --> 01:58:59,920
they want to keep going, like I said,
 

5215
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:03,750
they want to keep going, like I said,
they can keep going.

you're almost 600 points straight upside
on the session. Just just remember that.

5248
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:38,960
on the session. Just just remember that.
 

5249
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,070
on the session. Just just remember that.
So, if you're looking for any more

5250
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:40,080
So, if you're looking for any more
 

5251
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:43,830
So, if you're looking for any more
longs, you're already 600 points out.

5252
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:43,840
longs, you're already 600 points out.
 

5253
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:54,470
longs, you're already 600 points out.
It's a big move.

5254
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:54,480

 

5255
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,870

Reclaiming volume. If they reclaim this,

5256
01:59:56,870 --> 01:59:56,880
Reclaiming volume. If they reclaim this,
 

5257
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:58,790
Reclaiming volume. If they reclaim this,
you'd expect them to trade out to new

5258
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:58,800
you'd expect them to trade out to new
 

5259
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,470
you'd expect them to trade out to new
highs because we could we should really

5260
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:00,480
highs because we could we should really
 

5261
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,070
highs because we could we should really
at least trade to here now. If they're

5262
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,080
at least trade to here now. If they're
 

5263
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,189
at least trade to here now. If they're
going to trade through this, they should

5264
02:00:03,189 --> 02:00:03,199
going to trade through this, they should
 

5265
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:09,109
going to trade through this, they should
trade up here into new highs.

5266
02:00:09,109 --> 02:00:09,119

 

5267
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,550

Are you going to use a bathroom while it

5268
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:10,560
Are you going to use a bathroom while it
 

5269
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,790
Are you going to use a bathroom while it
does this?

5270
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:12,800
does this?
 

5271
02:00:12,800 --> 02:01:41,350
does this?
Put on my phone.

5272
02:01:41,350 --> 02:01:41,360

 

5273
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,510

Oh, I've lost my phone somewhere. Don't

5274
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:43,520
Oh, I've lost my phone somewhere. Don't
 

5275
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,990
Oh, I've lost my phone somewhere. Don't
know where.

5276
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:46,000
know where.
 

5277
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:56,149
know where.
Not good if my wife tries to call me.

5278
02:01:56,149 --> 02:01:56,159

 

5279
02:01:56,159 --> 02:02:00,229

All right, back into volume.

5280
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:00,239

 

5281
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:01,669

I'm probably going to give this one more

5282
02:02:01,669 --> 02:02:01,679
I'm probably going to give this one more
 

5283
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:04,470
I'm probably going to give this one more
shot if at all, but

5284
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:04,480
shot if at all, but
 

5285
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,470
shot if at all, but
you know, just have to admit this is uh

5286
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:06,480
you know, just have to admit this is uh
 

5287
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:08,310
you know, just have to admit this is uh
a rebalance day higher. I thought this

5288
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:08,320
a rebalance day higher. I thought this
 

5289
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,229
a rebalance day higher. I thought this
might come on

5290
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:10,239
might come on
 

5291
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:13,189
might come on
uh Monday to be honest. I thought we'd

5292
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:13,199
uh Monday to be honest. I thought we'd
 

5293
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:15,510
uh Monday to be honest. I thought we'd
go into a rotation day and then offer

5294
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:15,520
go into a rotation day and then offer
 

5295
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,990
go into a rotation day and then offer
this price up Monday.

5296

passed.
Today is day four or five. It's in the

5530
02:08:08,790 --> 02:08:08,800
Today is day four or five. It's in the
 

5531
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:13,189
Today is day four or five. It's in the
legacy accounts. I'm up like $3,600

5532
02:08:13,189 --> 02:08:13,199
legacy accounts. I'm up like $3,600
 

5533
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:16,390
legacy accounts. I'm up like $3,600
plus dollars. I'm due 50% of it. What

5534
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:16,400
plus dollars. I'm due 50% of it. What
 

5535
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,550
plus dollars. I'm due 50% of it. What
happens to my draw down when I take 50%.

5536
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:18,560
happens to my draw down when I take 50%.
 

5537
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,550
happens to my draw down when I take 50%.
So, if I take one and a half out and and

5538
02:08:20,550 --> 02:08:20,560
So, if I take one and a half out and and
 

5539
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:24,550
So, if I take one and a half out and and
it's 100 100k account, I'll move down to

5540
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:24,560
it's 100 100k account, I'll move down to
 

5541
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:28,069
it's 100 100k account, I'll move down to
let's call it uh $2,000 profit. What

5542
02:08:28,069 --> 02:08:28,079
let's call it uh $2,000 profit. What
 

5543
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:29,669
let's call it uh $2,000 profit. What
happens to my draw down? Does it move up

5544
02:08:29,669 --> 02:08:29,679
happens to my draw down? Does it move up
 

5545
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:38,069
happens to my draw down? Does it move up
to 100,000?

5546
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:38,079

 

5547
02:08:38,079 --> 02:08:41,109

I need to check.

5548
02:08:41,109 --> 02:08:41,119
I need to check.
 

5549
02:08:41,119 --> 02:08:42,790
I need to check.
So, I don't want to draw too much out or

5550
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:42,800
So, I don't want to draw too much out or
 

5551
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,270
So, I don't want to draw too much out or
anything. Locked at zero. So, once

5552
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:45,280
anything. Locked at zero. So, once
 

5553
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:47,189
anything. Locked at zero. So, once
you're past buffer, it it does it lock

5554
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:47,199
you're past buffer, it it does it lock
 

5555
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:51,830
you're past buffer, it it does it lock
there. Is that what you mean?

5556
02:08:51,830 --> 02:08:51,840

 

5557
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:53,830

Or will I will I always have three? What

5558
02:08:53,830 --> 02:08:53,840
Or will I will I always have three? What
 

5559
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:56,390
Or will I will I always have three? What
I'm trying to say is

5560
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:56,400
I'm trying to say is
 

5561
02:08:56,400 --> 02:09:00,390
I'm trying to say is
will I always have $3,000 draw down

5562
02:09:00,390 --> 02:09:00,400
will I always have $3,000 draw down
 

5563
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,390
will I always have $3,000 draw down
or if I draw some out? There's a big

5564
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:02,400
or if I draw some out? There's a big
 

5565
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,709
or if I draw some out? There's a big
exchange there again. Oh my gosh, that's

5566
02:09:04,709 --> 02:09:04,719
exchange there again. Oh my gosh, that's
 

5567
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:06,470
exchange there again. Oh my gosh, that's
a huge exchange. Look at this guy at the

5568
02:09:06,470 --> 02:09:06,480
a huge exchange. Look at this guy at the
 

5569
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:09,669
a huge exchange. Look at this guy at the
high got caught.

5570
02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
high got caught.
 

5571
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:18,870
high got caught.
This is so so tricky

5572
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:18,880

 

5573
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:21,990

original balance.

5574
02:09:21,990 --> 02:09:22,000
original balance.
 

5575
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,990
original balance.
So, so if I only had 2 and a half

5576
02:09:23,990 --> 02:09:24,000
So, so if I only had 2 and a half
 

5577
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,149
So, so if I only had 2 and a half
thousand left in the count, I'd only

5578
02:09:26,149 --> 02:09:26,159
thousand left in the count, I'd only
 

5579
02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:27,589
thousand left in the count, I'd only
have two and a half thousand draw down.

5580
02:09:27,589 --> 02:09:27,599
have two and a half thousand draw down.
 

5581
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:29,589
have two and a half thousand draw down.
Is that what you're saying? Rather than

5582
02:09:29,589 --> 02:09:29,599
Is that what you're saying? Rather than
 

5583
02:09:29,599 --> 02:09:31,830
Is that what you're saying? Rather than
it wouldn't go under the buffer, is that

5584
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:31,840
it wouldn't go under the buffer, is that
 

5585
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:37,270
it wouldn't go under the buffer, is that
right?

5586
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:37,280

 

5587
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,750

Big exchange here. Big big big exchange

5588
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:39,760
Big exchange here. Big big big exchange
 

5589
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,109
Big exchange here. Big big big exchange
here. Delta left at the highs there.

5590
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:43,119
here. Delta left at the highs there.
 

5591
02:09:43,119 --> 02:09:45,430
here. Delta left at the highs there.
Still buyers are absorbing this. They

5592

Still buyers are absorbing this. They
 

5593
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:48,069
Still buyers are absorbing this. They

Cannot fight this. I've had it, like you

02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:49,679
Cannot fight this. I've had it, like you
 

5597

would have seen today, I've had a go at
 

5599
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:52,229
would have seen today, I've had a go at
trying to play the backside when it's

5600
02:09:52,229 --> 02:09:52,239
trying to play the backside when it's
 

5601
02:09:52,239 --> 02:09:54,390
trying to play the backside when it's
when I felt people are trapped. I'm up

5602
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:54,400
when I felt people are trapped. I'm up
 

5603
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:59,430
when I felt people are trapped. I'm up
on the day. I'm up uh not a lot.

02:09:59,430 --> 02:09:59,440
on the day. I'm up uh not a lot.
 

5605
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:01,910
on the day. I'm up uh not a lot.
$25,000 or something on the day. Not up

5606
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:01,920
$25,000 or something on the day. Not up
 

5607

$25,000 or something on the day. Not up
huge considering this is huge move

5608
02:10:03,669 --> 02:10:03,679
huge considering this is huge move
 

5609
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:09,990
huge considering this is huge move
upside. But there we go.

5610
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:10,000

 

5611
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,750

If you're at 100K, you're locked. So go

5612
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:11,760
If you're at 100K, you're locked. So go
 

5613

If you're at 100K, you're locked. So go
below. Okay, I understand. Thanks, mate.

Appreciate it. This is still bullish,

5620

Appreciate it. This is still bullish,
 

5621
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:22,149
Appreciate it. This is still bullish,
guys. The flow zones are hot. Like, you

5622
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:22,159
guys. The flow zones are hot. Like, you
 

5623
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:23,589
guys. The flow zones are hot. Like, you
can't fight it. You cannot fight it.

5624
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:23,599
can't fight it. You cannot fight it.
 

5625
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:24,629
can't fight it. You cannot fight it.
Look, the flow zones are holding.

5626
02:10:24,629 --> 02:10:24,639
Look, the flow zones are holding.
 

5627
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:26,069
Look, the flow zones are holding.
There's your buy signal on the reclaim

5628
02:10:26,069 --> 02:10:26,079
There's your buy signal on the reclaim
 

5629
02:10:26,079 --> 02:10:28,950
There's your buy signal on the reclaim
of New York. I knew that this needed a

5630
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:28,960
of New York. I knew that this needed a
 

5631
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:31,270
of New York. I knew that this needed a
squeeze out today and I was looking for

5632
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:31,280
squeeze out today and I was looking for
 

5633
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:35,109
squeeze out today and I was looking for
shorts either in here or here.

5634
02:10:35,109 --> 02:10:35,119
shorts either in here or here.
 

5635
02:10:35,119 --> 02:10:37,189
shorts either in here or here.
Um, this kind of area here was the prime

5636
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:37,199
Um, this kind of area here was the prime
 

5637
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:38,870
Um, this kind of area here was the prime
area. We're basing above this is what I

5638
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:38,880
area. We're basing above this is what I
 

5639
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,629
area. We're basing above this is what I
said. If we base above this, it's

5640
02:10:40,629 --> 02:10:40,639
said. If we base above this, it's
 

5641
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:42,870
said. If we base above this, it's
probably not a good short day because

5642
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:42,880
probably not a good short day because
 

5643
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,550
probably not a good short day because
we've reclaimed value. If we zoom out

5644
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:44,560
we've reclaimed value. If we zoom out
 

5645
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:46,390
we've reclaimed value. If we zoom out
yesterday, this is your B shape from

5646
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:46,400
yesterday, this is your B shape from
 

5647
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,149
yesterday, this is your B shape from
yesterday.

5648
02:10:48,149 --> 02:10:48,159
yesterday.
 

5649
02:10:48,159 --> 02:10:50,709
yesterday.
All right. And we've reclaimed this now.

5650
02:10:50,709 --> 02:10:50,719
All right. And we've reclaimed this now.
 

5651
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:53,510
All right. And we've reclaimed this now.
All right. And we can rotate in here. If

5652
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:53,520
All right. And we can rotate in here. If
 

5653
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:57,030
All right. And we can rotate in here. If
they rotate in here for a session,

5654
02:10:57,030 --> 02:10:57,040
they rotate in here for a session,
 

5655
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:58,790
they rotate in here for a session,
what happens next week becomes important

5656
02:10:58,790 --> 02:10:58,800
what happens next week becomes important
 

5657
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,270
what happens next week becomes important
because if we rotate in here, if we gap

5658
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:01,280
because if we rotate in here, if we gap
 

5659
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:03,109
because if we rotate in here, if we gap
up next week, we use this as a base. We

5660
02:11:03,109 --> 02:11:03,119
up next week, we use this as a base. We
 

5661
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:05,109
up next week, we use this as a base. We
repric. If we gap down next week, we use

5662
02:11:05,109 --> 02:11:05,119
repric. If we gap down next week, we use
 

5663
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:07,669
repric. If we gap down next week, we use
a two-day balance to move lower. All

5664
02:11:07,669 --> 02:11:07,679
a two-day balance to move lower. All
 

5665
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:09,589
a two-day balance to move lower. All
right, so that they are pinning this in

5666
02:11:09,589 --> 02:11:09,599
right, so that they are pinning this in
 

5667
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:12,870
right, so that they are pinning this in
here at the moment. It's unfortunate. It

5668
02:11:12,870 --> 02:11:12,880
here at the moment. It's unfortunate. It
 

5669
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,550
here at the moment. It's unfortunate. It
just it didn't give me what I wanted. It

5670
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:14,560
just it didn't give me what I wanted. It
 

5671
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:16,229
just it didn't give me what I wanted. It
is what it is. Like we said, I might be

5672
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:16,239
is what it is. Like we said, I might be
 

5673
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:18,550
is what it is. Like we said, I might be
wrong today.

5674
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:18,560
wrong today.
 

5675
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:20,709
wrong today.
If you all thought we had the ability to

5676
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,719
If you all thought we had the ability to
 

5677
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:22,310
If you all thought we had the ability to
squeeze

5678
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:22,320
squeeze
 

5679
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,390
squeeze
uh 800 points in the first couple of

5680
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:24,400
uh 800 points in the first couple of
 

5681
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:31,669
uh 800 points in the first couple of
hours, then you're absolute geniuses.

5682
02:11:31,669 --> 02:11:31,679

 

5683
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:33,830

previous day point of control.
 

5691
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:41,910
previous day point of control.
This is straight upside market buying.

5692
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:41,920
This is straight upside market buying.
 

5693
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:44,310
This is straight upside market buying.
This is just shorts getting popped. Uh

02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:44,320
This is just shorts getting popped. Uh

when this is exhaust, it's going to be
 

5697
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:53,510
when this is exhaust, it's going to be
awful.

week. He's been wrong then. I think
 

5717
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:29,830

actually one day he had a good winner.
 

5719

Okay. Reaction of previous day point of
 

5721
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,589
Okay. Reaction of previous day point of
control. This is where we get thick

5722
02:12:33,589 --> 02:12:33,599
control. This is where we get thick
 

5723
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:36,229
control. This is where we get thick
value area high 60 through there. Very

02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:14,000
you got value area high. And this is the
 

5751
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,229
you got value area high. And this is the
old gap now. But that's the old weekly

It can't go up forever. It can go up all

5812
02:14:23,830 --> 02:14:23,840
It can't go up forever. It can go up all
 

5813
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,669
It can't go up forever. It can go up all
day. It can go up next week. It can't go

5814
02:14:25,669 --> 02:14:25,679
day. It can go up next week. It can't go
 

5815
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:27,910
day. It can go up next week. It can't go
up forever because at some point there'd

5816
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:27,920
up forever because at some point there'd
 

5817
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:30,709
up forever because at some point there'd
be no more shorts to get squeezed.

5818
02:14:30,709 --> 02:14:30,719
be no more shorts to get squeezed.
 

5819

the previous day value high next spot
 

5823
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:49,990
the previous day value high next spot
and then the gap.

someone's so hurt right now.
You see why we don't fight the tape,

5866
02:15:40,709 --> 02:15:40,719
You see why we don't fight the tape,
 

5867
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:43,189
You see why we don't fight the tape,
folks? You have not seen me pick a top

5868
02:15:43,189 --> 02:15:43,199
folks? You have not seen me pick a top
 

5869
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:45,750
folks? You have not seen me pick a top
today. We we wait for the top to come in

5870
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:45,760
today. We we wait for the top to come in
 

5871
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:59,030
today. We we wait for the top to come in
and if it's not in, we cut the uh trade.

5872
02:15:59,030 --> 02:15:59,040

 

5873
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,350

Uh yeah, I mean, if you were on a a

5874
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:01,360
Uh yeah, I mean, if you were on a a
 

5875
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:03,430
Uh yeah, I mean, if you were on a a
yearly chart, yeah, u technically

5876
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:03,440
yearly chart, yeah, u technically
 

5877
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:06,149
yearly chart, yeah, u technically
speaking, BEu be. But I'd say like we've

5878
02:16:06,149 --> 02:16:06,159
speaking, BEu be. But I'd say like we've
 

5879
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:11,270
speaking, BEu be. But I'd say like we've
pivoted. We're in we're into uh daily

5880
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:11,280
pivoted. We're in we're into uh daily
 

5881
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,589
pivoted. We're in we're into uh daily
daily downtrend now because we've made a

5882
02:16:13,589 --> 02:16:13,599
daily downtrend now because we've made a
 

5883
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:16,149
daily downtrend now because we've made a
lower low. So we made a lower high lower

5884
02:16:16,149 --> 02:16:16,159
lower low. So we made a lower high lower
 

5885
02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:18,229
lower low. So we made a lower high lower
low. You'd want to see it close lower

5886
02:16:18,229 --> 02:16:18,239
low. You'd want to see it close lower
 

5887
02:16:18,239 --> 02:16:19,750
low. You'd want to see it close lower
though. I just think this is a squeeze

5888
02:16:19,750 --> 02:16:19,760
though. I just think this is a squeeze
 

5889
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:22,069
though. I just think this is a squeeze
out. Honestly, this is a squeeze out.

5890
02:16:22,069 --> 02:16:22,079
out. Honestly, this is a squeeze out.
 

5891
02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:23,669
out. Honestly, this is a squeeze out.
Big exchange here into previous day

5894
02:16:25,109 --> 02:16:25,119
value area higher. We know if they don't
 

5895
02:16:25,119 --> 02:16:30,310
value area higher. We know if they don't
hold this. I don't know what to say. Uh

5896
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:30,320
hold this. I don't know what to say. Uh

02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:32,070
hold this. I don't know what to say. Uh
yeah, I don't know what to say. Maybe

5898
02:16:32,070 --> 02:16:32,080
yeah, I don't know what to say. Maybe
 

5899
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:35,349
yeah, I don't know what to say. Maybe
gap back to the top of the gap. Um maybe

5900
02:16:35,349 --> 02:16:35,359
gap back to the top of the gap. Um maybe
 

5901
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:36,790
gap back to the top of the gap. Um maybe
all the way up here. I mean, it's

5902
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:36,800
all the way up here. I mean, it's
 

5903
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:39,910
all the way up here. I mean, it's
mental, but look how vertical this is.

5904
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:39,920
mental, but look how vertical this is.
 

5905
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,830
mental, but look how vertical this is.
There's not a pullback here. It's

5906
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:41,840
There's not a pullback here. It's
 

5907
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:44,309
There's not a pullback here. It's
literally vertical.

literally vertical.
This is just stops getting run over.

5910
02:16:48,790 --> 02:16:48,800

 

5911
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:52,629

They are getting run over here.

5912
02:16:52,629 --> 02:16:52,639
They are getting run over here.
 

5913
02:16:52,639 --> 02:16:54,389
They are getting run over here.
Nothing else you can say about it. They

5914
02:16:54,389 --> 02:16:54,399
Nothing else you can say about it. They
 

5915
02:16:54,399 --> 02:16:57,030
Nothing else you can say about it. They
are absolutely wrecked. A flush will

5916
02:16:57,030 --> 02:16:57,040
are absolutely wrecked. A flush will
 

5917
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,429
are absolutely wrecked. A flush will
come soon once they once all the buyers

5918
02:16:59,429 --> 02:16:59,439
come soon once they once all the buyers
 

5919
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:01,270
come soon once they once all the buyers
get trapped at the highs and they're

5920
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,280
get trapped at the highs and they're
 

5921
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,509
get trapped at the highs and they're
finished with this because we lack

5922
02:17:03,509 --> 02:17:03,519
finished with this because we lack
 

5923
02:17:03,519 --> 02:17:04,870
finished with this because we lack
structure. We'll come straight back down

5924
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:04,880
structure. We'll come straight back down
 

5925
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:06,150
structure. We'll come straight back down
into this. Look how thin this is.

5926
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:06,160
into this. Look how thin this is.
 

5927
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:07,270
into this. Look how thin this is.
There's no volume here. This is straight

There's no volume here. This is straight
 

5929
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:08,709
There's no volume here. This is straight
up. It's a straight up squeeze. Once

5930
02:17:08,709 --> 02:17:08,719
up. It's a straight up squeeze. Once
 

5931
02:17:08,719 --> 02:17:11,990
up. It's a straight up squeeze. Once
it's done, there will be a pullback.

5932
02:17:11,990 --> 02:17:12,000
it's done, there will be a pullback.
 

5933
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,750
it's done, there will be a pullback.
Failing previous day value area high

Failing previous day value area high
 

5935
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:15,509
Failing previous day value area high
here. Here we go. So, here's the bigger

5936

Previous day point of control. We can

5940
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:18,960
Previous day point of control. We can
 

5941
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:20,950
Previous day point of control. We can
move way way lower if there's an

5942
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:20,960
move way way lower if there's an
 

5943
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:23,429
move way way lower if there's an
exchange here. At the moment, they don't

5944
02:17:23,429 --> 02:17:23,439
exchange here. At the moment, they don't
 

5945
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:28,070
exchange here. At the moment, they don't
seem done with it quite yet.

5946
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:28,080

 

5947
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:30,070

We need to remove this big exchange

5948
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:30,080
We need to remove this big exchange
 

5949
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:36,389
We need to remove this big exchange
there. Big big big exchange.

5950
02:17:36,389 --> 02:17:36,399

 

5951
02:17:36,399 --> 02:17:37,990

I'm watching this because we put a pin

5952
02:17:37,990 --> 02:17:38,000
I'm watching this because we put a pin
 

5953
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,589
I'm watching this because we put a pin
high in.

5954
02:17:41,589 --> 02:17:41,599

 

5955
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:44,309

It's moving so quick though. I mean,

5956
02:17:44,309 --> 02:17:44,319
It's moving so quick though. I mean,
 

5957
02:17:44,319 --> 02:17:45,669
It's moving so quick though. I mean,
it's actually quite hard to tape read

5958
02:17:45,669 --> 02:17:45,679
it's actually quite hard to tape read
 

5959
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:47,110
it's actually quite hard to tape read
this. It's moving that quick. We did

5960
02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:47,120
this. It's moving that quick. We did
 

5961
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:49,990
this. It's moving that quick. We did
leave by delta at the highs. We did fail

5962
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:50,000
leave by delta at the highs. We did fail
 

5963
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,469
leave by delta at the highs. We did fail
previous day value area high on Ninja

5964
02:17:52,469 --> 02:17:52,479
previous day value area high on Ninja
 

5965
02:17:52,479 --> 02:17:54,790
previous day value area high on Ninja
Trader actually have this here. So, we

5966
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:54,800
Trader actually have this here. So, we
 

5967
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,790
Trader actually have this here. So, we
were aware.

5968
02:17:56,790 --> 02:17:56,800
were aware.
 

5969
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:57,910
were aware.
Someone asked that. It might have been

5970
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:57,920
Someone asked that. It might have been
 

5971
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:00,230
Someone asked that. It might have been
MO. So, that's an example of where Ninja

5972
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:00,240
MO. So, that's an example of where Ninja
 

5973
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,750
MO. So, that's an example of where Ninja
Trader was more accurate, isn't it? At

5974
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:01,760
Trader was more accurate, isn't it? At
 

5975
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:04,150
Trader was more accurate, isn't it? At
the moment.

5976
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:04,160
the moment.
 

5977
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:10,950
the moment.
Okay, this might be the end of it soon.

5978
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:10,960

 

5979
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:13,830

Let's see how much more juice have they

5980
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:13,840
Let's see how much more juice have they
 

5981
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,669
Let's see how much more juice have they
got. Google probably wants to get to

5982
02:18:15,669 --> 02:18:15,679
got. Google probably wants to get to
 

5983
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:17,669
got. Google probably wants to get to
PDC. Has it done it yet? I don't think

5984
02:18:17,669 --> 02:18:17,679
PDC. Has it done it yet? I don't think
 

5985

PDC. Has it done it yet? I don't think
it's done it yet.

5987
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,270

Almost don't want to look away because

5988
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:23,280
Almost don't want to look away because
 

5989
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,870
Almost don't want to look away because
it feels like every time I look away,

5990
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:24,880
it feels like every time I look away,
 

5991
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:34,950
it feels like every time I look away,
something moves so quick.

5992
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:34,960

 

5993
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:37,750

5 10 look at this straight up upsh shot

5994
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:37,760
5 10 look at this straight up upsh shot
 

5995
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:40,950
5 10 look at this straight up upsh shot
since breaking out of that volume. Wow.

5996
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:40,960
since breaking out of that volume. Wow.
 

5997
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:43,509
since breaking out of that volume. Wow.
Okay, here we go. Big exchange starting

5998
02:18:43,509 --> 02:18:43,519
Okay, here we go. Big exchange starting
 

5999

to see a flush. I am in this now. Small
 

6001

it's counter trend. What I'm doing is

6008
02:18:53,589 --> 02:18:53,599
it's counter trend. What I'm doing is
 

6009
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:55,589
it's counter trend. What I'm doing is
very risky here, folks. You do do not

6010
02:18:55,589 --> 02:18:55,599
very risky here, folks. You do do not
 

6011
02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:57,110
very risky here, folks. You do do not
need to follow me and I'm just watching

6012
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:57,120
need to follow me and I'm just watching
 

6013
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,950
need to follow me and I'm just watching
order flow.

6014
02:18:58,950 --> 02:18:58,960
order flow.
 

6015
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:02,070
order flow.
I'm not going to give it any room.

6016
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:02,080
I'm not going to give it any room.
 

6017
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,270
I'm not going to give it any room.
They let go previous day point of

6018
02:19:03,270 --> 02:19:03,280
They let go previous day point of
 

6019
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:05,349
They let go previous day point of
control. I think we can flush down 65.

6020
02:19:05,349 --> 02:19:05,359
control. I think we can flush down 65.
 

6021
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:06,549
control. I think we can flush down 65.
So, if they hold previous day point of

6022
02:19:06,549 --> 02:19:06,559
So, if they hold previous day point of
 

6023
02:19:06,559 --> 02:19:07,669
So, if they hold previous day point of
control, probably going to have more

6024
02:19:07,669 --> 02:19:07,679
control, probably going to have more
 

6025
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:12,790
control, probably going to have more
excess put on at the high.

6026
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:12,800

 

6027
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:14,790

Here we go.

6028
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:14,800
Here we go.
 

6029
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:17,429
Here we go.
Okay, TP1 here. See if I can get some

6030
02:19:17,429 --> 02:19:17,439
Okay, TP1 here. See if I can get some
 

6031
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:20,389
Okay, TP1 here. See if I can get some
more out of this.

6032
02:19:20,389 --> 02:19:20,399
more out of this.
 

6033
02:19:20,399 --> 02:19:21,750
more out of this.
Not expecting too much because I'm

6034
02:19:21,750 --> 02:19:21,760
Not expecting too much because I'm
 

6035
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:23,990
Not expecting too much because I'm
counter trend. Remember, don't need to

6036
02:19:23,990 --> 02:19:24,000
counter trend. Remember, don't need to
 

6037
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,509
counter trend. Remember, don't need to
follow me. This is the hardest trade in

6038
02:19:25,509 --> 02:19:25,519
follow me. This is the hardest trade in
 

6039
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:26,709
follow me. This is the hardest trade in
the book what I'm doing right now. I'm

6040
02:19:26,709 --> 02:19:26,719
the book what I'm doing right now. I'm
 

6041
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:28,230
the book what I'm doing right now. I'm
watching the exchange at 40 now because

6042
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:28,240
watching the exchange at 40 now because
 

6043
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:31,110
watching the exchange at 40 now because
there's a 113 lot coming in at 40.

6044
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,120
there's a 113 lot coming in at 40.
 

6045
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:33,669
there's a 113 lot coming in at 40.
Between 40 and 45 is where buyers came

6046
02:19:33,669 --> 02:19:33,679
Between 40 and 45 is where buyers came
 

6047
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:35,910
Between 40 and 45 is where buyers came
in in this last pull down. So if they

6048
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:35,920
in in this last pull down. So if they
 

6049
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:37,429
in in this last pull down. So if they
remain stuck, this is where we can trade

6050
02:19:37,429 --> 02:19:37,439
remain stuck, this is where we can trade
 

6051
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:41,190
remain stuck, this is where we can trade
lower. This is a big level. 40 to 45ish.

6052
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:41,200
lower. This is a big level. 40 to 45ish.
 

6053
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:42,549
lower. This is a big level. 40 to 45ish.
I've already covered some of my position

6054
02:19:42,549 --> 02:19:42,559
I've already covered some of my position
 

6055
02:19:42,559 --> 02:19:43,910
I've already covered some of my position
here into previous day point of control.

6056
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:43,920
here into previous day point of control.
 

6057
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:45,349
here into previous day point of control.
I want to make that clear. If we flush

6058
02:19:45,349 --> 02:19:45,359
I want to make that clear. If we flush
 

6059
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:46,870
I want to make that clear. If we flush
this, then there's a chance to move back

6060
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:46,880
this, then there's a chance to move back
 

6061
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:50,070
this, then there's a chance to move back
to this volume area into 60.

6062
02:19:50,070 --> 02:19:50,080
to this volume area into 60.
 

6063
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,750
to this volume area into 60.
Trying to make this as transparent as

6064
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:51,760
Trying to make this as transparent as
 

6065
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,910
Trying to make this as transparent as
possible for you.

6066
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:53,920
possible for you.
 

6067
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:57,750
possible for you.
But 40 to 45 is the big exchange level.

6068
02:19:57,750 --> 02:19:57,760
But 40 to 45 is the big exchange level.
 

6069
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:59,030
But 40 to 45 is the big exchange level.
Reclaim that. We're going to make new

6070
02:19:59,030 --> 02:19:59,040
Reclaim that. We're going to make new
 

6071
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:00,950
Reclaim that. We're going to make new
highs. Reject that. I think we trade all

6072
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:00,960
highs. Reject that. I think we trade all
 

6073
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:04,790
highs. Reject that. I think we trade all
the way back down to here. Looks good.

6074
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:04,800
the way back down to here. Looks good.
 

6075
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:14,630
the way back down to here. Looks good.
So, I've already taken money out of this

6076
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:14,640

 

6077
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:16,150

sellers trying to take control here. I

6078
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:16,160
sellers trying to take control here. I
 

6079
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:17,910
sellers trying to take control here. I
want to see a pop to 45 and see sellers

6080
02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:17,920
want to see a pop to 45 and see sellers
 

6081
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:19,270
want to see a pop to 45 and see sellers
sell it. That's when I'm going to be

6082
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:19,280
sell it. That's when I'm going to be
 

6083
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,030
sell it. That's when I'm going to be
like, okay, we're firming up. If we

6084
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:21,040
like, okay, we're firming up. If we
 

6085
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:23,670
like, okay, we're firming up. If we
don't sell 40 to 45, then we're going to

6086
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:23,680
don't sell 40 to 45, then we're going to
 

6087
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,670
don't sell 40 to 45, then we're going to
make new highs. So, this is kind of the

6088
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:25,680
make new highs. So, this is kind of the
 

6089
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:27,510
make new highs. So, this is kind of the
first drive up to test that level I've

6090
02:20:27,510 --> 02:20:27,520
first drive up to test that level I've
 

6091
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:34,710
first drive up to test that level I've
just talked about.

6092
02:20:34,710 --> 02:20:34,720

 

6093
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:36,150

02:29:22,389 --> 02:29:22,399
he's not real and he's pulling,
 

6479
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:30,309
he's not real and he's pulling,
they're going to keep searching for him.

6480
02:29:30,309 --> 02:29:30,319

 

6481
02:29:30,319 --> 02:29:32,309

It's just a short squeeze, Mo. It's a

6482
02:29:32,309 --> 02:29:32,319
It's just a short squeeze, Mo. It's a
 

6483
02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:33,750
It's just a short squeeze, Mo. It's a
short squeeze. That's all this is. It's

6484
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:33,760
short squeeze. That's all this is. It's
 

6485
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:43,429
short squeeze. That's all this is. It's
why it's so violent.

6486
02:29:43,429 --> 02:29:43,439

 

6487
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:44,870

I'm starting to wonder, are they going

6488
02:29:44,870 --> 02:29:44,880
I'm starting to wonder, are they going
 

6489
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:47,750
I'm starting to wonder, are they going
to go all the way to 500s here?

6490
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:47,760
to go all the way to 500s here?
 

6491
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:49,190
to go all the way to 500s here?
I'm starting to think you're right. Be

6492
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:49,200
I'm starting to think you're right. Be
 

6493
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:54,150
I'm starting to think you're right. Be
you because

6494
02:29:54,150 --> 02:29:54,160

 

6495
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:55,990

I mean there's no sign. Every time

6496
02:29:55,990 --> 02:29:56,000
I mean there's no sign. Every time
 

6497
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,309
I mean there's no sign. Every time
they've had the chance to trap someone,

6498
02:29:58,309 --> 02:29:58,319
they've had the chance to trap someone,
 

6499
02:29:58,319 --> 02:30:01,670
they've had the chance to trap someone,
there's no sign of weakness.

6500
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:01,680
there's no sign of weakness.
 

6501
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:07,910
there's no sign of weakness.
Let's see.

6502
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:07,920

 

6503
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:09,190

Let's see.

6504
02:30:09,190 --> 02:30:09,200
Let's see.
 

6505
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,630
Let's see.
selling at the highs there. Not really

6506
02:30:10,630 --> 02:30:10,640
selling at the highs there. Not really
 

6507
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:13,590
selling at the highs there. Not really
buying at the highs there. Let's see.

6508
02:30:13,590 --> 02:30:13,600
buying at the highs there. Let's see.
 

6509
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:15,349
buying at the highs there. Let's see.
Same levels. 40 to 45. That's your

6510
02:30:15,349 --> 02:30:15,359
Same levels. 40 to 45. That's your
 

6511
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:16,710
Same levels. 40 to 45. That's your
overunder. That's where the big buyers

6512
02:30:16,710 --> 02:30:16,720
overunder. That's where the big buyers
 

6513
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:18,070
overunder. That's where the big buyers
came in. If we start letting go of that

6514
02:30:18,070 --> 02:30:18,080
came in. If we start letting go of that
 

6515
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:19,830
came in. If we start letting go of that
and snap below 20, then I think there's

6516
02:30:19,830 --> 02:30:19,840
and snap below 20, then I think there's
 

6517
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:22,630
and snap below 20, then I think there's
a move. But we keep holding 4045s.

6518
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,640
a move. But we keep holding 4045s.
 

6519
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:24,790
a move. But we keep holding 4045s.
There's no move lower.

6520
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:24,800
There's no move lower.
 

6521
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:26,389
There's no move lower.
In my opinion, that's where they kept

6522
02:30:26,389 --> 02:30:26,399
In my opinion, that's where they kept
 

6523
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:29,429
In my opinion, that's where they kept
absorbing. So, here's the test of 40s.

6524
02:30:29,429 --> 02:30:29,439
absorbing. So, here's the test of 40s.
 

6525
02:30:29,439 --> 02:30:31,670
absorbing. So, here's the test of 40s.
If we snap this and snap 20s, we're

6526
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:31,680
If we snap this and snap 20s, we're
 

6527
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,429
If we snap this and snap 20s, we're
going to get the move. It's the first

6528
02:30:33,429 --> 02:30:33,439
going to get the move. It's the first
 

6529
02:30:33,439 --> 02:30:35,030
going to get the move. It's the first
retest.

6530
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:35,040
retest.
 

6531
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:37,590
retest.
Okay. What are we doing here? Are you

6532
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:37,600
Okay. What are we doing here? Are you
 

6533
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:39,830
Okay. What are we doing here? Are you
going to let go of this shelf for me? We

6534
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:39,840
going to let go of this shelf for me? We
 

6535
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:41,830
going to let go of this shelf for me? We
going to get aggressive here. This is

6536
02:30:41,830 --> 02:30:41,840
going to get aggressive here. This is
 

6537
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:43,910
going to get aggressive here. This is
nice. Got to let go of previous day

6538
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:43,920
nice. Got to let go of previous day
 

6539
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:45,349
nice. Got to let go of previous day
point of control. Going to keep

6540
02:30:45,349 --> 02:30:45,359
point of control. Going to keep
 

6541
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:51,910
point of control. Going to keep
absorbing here.

6542
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:51,920

 

6543
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,230

Big selling. Heavy, heavy, heavy. That

6544
02:30:54,230 --> 02:30:54,240
Big selling. Heavy, heavy, heavy. That
 

6545
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:56,469
Big selling. Heavy, heavy, heavy. That
buyers caught. Maybe you needed to

6546
02:30:56,469 --> 02:30:56,479
buyers caught. Maybe you needed to
 

6547
02:30:56,479 --> 02:31:00,230
buyers caught. Maybe you needed to
advertise just to get into it.

6548
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:00,240
advertise just to get into it.
 

6549
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:02,710
advertise just to get into it.
Very interested now in slamming this

6550
02:31:02,710 --> 02:31:02,720
Very interested now in slamming this
 

6551
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:04,950
Very interested now in slamming this
back down for 60s, which is what I'm

6552
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:04,960
back down for 60s, which is what I'm
 

6553
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:09,270
back down for 60s, which is what I'm
looking for. Again,

6554
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:09,280

 

6555
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:10,870

you don't need to follow me into this,

6556
02:31:10,870 --> 02:31:10,880
you don't need to follow me into this,
 

6557
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:12,389
you don't need to follow me into this,
guys. It's the hardest trade of the

6558
02:31:12,389 --> 02:31:12,399
guys. It's the hardest trade of the
 

6559
02:31:12,399 --> 02:31:14,950
guys. It's the hardest trade of the
book. This is not a easy trade. This is

6560
02:31:14,950 --> 02:31:14,960
book. This is not a easy trade. This is
 

6561
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:16,950
book. This is not a easy trade. This is
a very, very, very hard trade because

6562
02:31:16,950 --> 02:31:16,960
a very, very, very hard trade because
 

6563
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:18,150
a very, very, very hard trade because
you're going to have to time with order

6564
02:31:18,150 --> 02:31:18,160
you're going to have to time with order
 

6565
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:19,750
you're going to have to time with order
flow. I do not advise you take this if

6566
02:31:19,750 --> 02:31:19,760
flow. I do not advise you take this if
 

6567
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:21,590
flow. I do not advise you take this if
you're a newer trader. The easy trade

6568
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:21,600
you're a newer trader. The easy trade
 

6569
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,510
you're a newer trader. The easy trade
today, unfortunately, has been the short

6570
02:31:23,510 --> 02:31:23,520
today, unfortunately, has been the short
 

6571
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,190
today, unfortunately, has been the short
squeeze upside, and it has not stopped.

6572
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:25,200
squeeze upside, and it has not stopped.
 

6573
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,790
squeeze upside, and it has not stopped.
So, I just want to make you aware of

6574
02:31:26,790 --> 02:31:26,800
So, I just want to make you aware of
 

6575
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:29,270
So, I just want to make you aware of
that. But right now, I am going to try

6576
02:31:29,270 --> 02:31:29,280
that. But right now, I am going to try
 

6577
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,790
that. But right now, I am going to try
and see if I can time this, if I can

6578
02:31:30,790 --> 02:31:30,800
and see if I can time this, if I can
 

6579
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:33,830
and see if I can time this, if I can
catch someone off guard.

6580
02:31:33,830 --> 02:31:33,840
catch someone off guard.
 

6581
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,590
catch someone off guard.
I think there's a flush to 60 is coming.

6582
02:31:35,590 --> 02:31:35,600
I think there's a flush to 60 is coming.
 

6583
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:39,750
I think there's a flush to 60 is coming.
Here we go.

6584
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:39,760

 

6585
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:41,349

They're still trying to absorb in front

6586
02:31:41,349 --> 02:31:41,359
They're still trying to absorb in front
 

6587
02:31:41,359 --> 02:31:43,990
They're still trying to absorb in front
of these 200s. Have we got anyone at

6588
02:31:43,990 --> 02:31:44,000
of these 200s. Have we got anyone at
 

6589
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,630
of these 200s. Have we got anyone at
80s? 80s 60s are there. I think it's

6590
02:31:46,630 --> 02:31:46,640
80s? 80s 60s are there. I think it's
 

6591
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:49,270
80s? 80s 60s are there. I think it's
coming. It's going to have to be very

6592
02:31:49,270 --> 02:31:49,280
coming. It's going to have to be very
 

6593
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:53,910
coming. It's going to have to be very
tricky. It's going to be very tricky.

6594
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:53,920

 

6595
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:56,550

Big exchange here. Once this snaps, we

6596
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:56,560
Big exchange here. Once this snaps, we
 

6597
02:31:56,560 --> 02:31:58,870
Big exchange here. Once this snaps, we
should go down to 60s.

6598
02:31:58,870 --> 02:31:58,880
should go down to 60s.
 

6599
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:01,990
should go down to 60s.
Stop hunt. So basically under the 200s,

6600
02:32:01,990 --> 02:32:02,000
Stop hunt. So basically under the 200s,
 

6601
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:10,070
Stop hunt. So basically under the 200s,
we might get a really nice wick. See,

6602
02:32:10,070 --> 02:32:10,080

 

6603
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:12,469

still absorbing. Need this absorber to

6604
02:32:12,469 --> 02:32:12,479
still absorbing. Need this absorber to
 

6605
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:15,349
still absorbing. Need this absorber to
get out the way.

6606
02:32:15,349 --> 02:32:15,359
get out the way.
 

6607
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:19,030
get out the way.
Meta now red with Google. Come on, baby.

6608
02:32:19,030 --> 02:32:19,040
Meta now red with Google. Come on, baby.
 

6609
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,750
Meta now red with Google. Come on, baby.
Enough already. This is your chance,

6610
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:21,760
Enough already. This is your chance,
 

6611
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:27,110
Enough already. This is your chance,
Bears. This is your chance. Here we go.

6612
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:27,120

 

6613
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:29,910

Okay, second attempt.

6614
02:32:29,910 --> 02:32:29,920
Okay, second attempt.
 

6615
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:30,950
Okay, second attempt.
This is going to be a final attempt

6616
02:32:30,950 --> 02:32:30,960
This is going to be a final attempt
 

6617
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:34,150
This is going to be a final attempt
because we got 15 minutes to lunch.

6618
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:34,160
because we got 15 minutes to lunch.
 

6619
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:37,510
because we got 15 minutes to lunch.
Can we get to 60s?

6620
02:32:37,510 --> 02:32:37,520
Can we get to 60s?
 

6621
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:39,110
Can we get to 60s?
Here's the 200s. Whole number here. You

6622
02:32:39,110 --> 02:32:39,120
Here's the 200s. Whole number here. You
 

6623
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:40,389
Here's the 200s. Whole number here. You
can take some profit here if you want.

6624
02:32:40,389 --> 02:32:40,399
can take some profit here if you want.
 

6625
02:32:40,399 --> 02:32:44,309
can take some profit here if you want.
Can we get all the way down?

6626
02:32:44,309 --> 02:32:44,319
Can we get all the way down?
 

6627
02:32:44,319 --> 02:32:47,270
Can we get all the way down?
Stop. Just stop. Stop the absorption,

6628
02:32:47,270 --> 02:32:47,280
Stop. Just stop. Stop the absorption,
 

6629
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:50,710
Stop. Just stop. Stop the absorption,
please. [\h__\h] off with your absorption.

02:33:53,910 --> 02:33:53,920
That is the key to trading. So, I'm
 

6671
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:54,950
That is the key to trading. So, I'm
going to see a little bit of a bounce

6672
02:33:54,950 --> 02:33:54,960
going to see a little bit of a bounce
 

6673
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:56,870
going to see a little bit of a bounce
here. I want to see 200s and 220s stay

6675
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,710

heavy. This node here, we're going to

6676
02:33:58,710 --> 02:33:58,720
heavy. This node here, we're going to
 

6677
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,670
heavy. This node here, we're going to
have to draw this node out.

6678
02:34:01,670 --> 02:34:01,680
have to draw this node out.
 

6679
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:03,510
have to draw this node out.
This guy here has got to stay heavy.

6680
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:03,520
This guy here has got to stay heavy.
 

6681
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:05,270

Right here. What's the edge of this? 208
 

6685

Right here. What's the edge of this? 208
to 220. That has to stay heavy for the

6686
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:10,720
to 220. That has to stay heavy for the
 

6687
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:14,870
to 220. That has to stay heavy for the
rotation into this volume. We look good.

6688
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:14,880
rotation into this volume. We look good.
 

6689
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,870
rotation into this volume. We look good.

we look good.
Starting to see some imbalances here on

6694
02:34:21,349 --> 02:34:21,359
Starting to see some imbalances here on
 

6695
02:34:21,359 --> 02:34:23,030
Starting to see some imbalances here on
a tape where it's all sell side. So,

6696
02:34:23,030 --> 02:34:23,040
a tape where it's all sell side. So,
 

6697
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:25,030
a tape where it's all sell side. So,
just be aware they might repric to 210

6698
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,040
just be aware they might repric to 210
 

6699
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,590
just be aware they might repric to 210
220 before we get any further. I'm

6700
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:27,600
220 before we get any further. I'm
 

6701
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,190
220 before we get any further. I'm
really sorry this took all day and this

6702
02:34:29,190 --> 02:34:29,200
really sorry this took all day and this
 

6703
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:30,790
really sorry this took all day and this
is a tiny move. I'm going to be honest.

6704
02:34:30,790 --> 02:34:30,800
is a tiny move. I'm going to be honest.
 

6705
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:32,950
is a tiny move. I'm going to be honest.
This is a pathetic tiny move compared to

6706
02:34:32,950 --> 02:34:32,960
This is a pathetic tiny move compared to
 

6707
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:36,230
This is a pathetic tiny move compared to
the 6700 points up we've done. I know. I

6708
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,240
the 6700 points up we've done. I know. I
 

6709
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:39,030
the 6700 points up we've done. I know. I
know team. I know. But I made it clear

6710
02:34:39,030 --> 02:34:39,040
know team. I know. But I made it clear
 

6711
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:40,550
know team. I know. But I made it clear
what I was looking for today. I really

6712
02:34:40,550 --> 02:34:40,560
what I was looking for today. I really
 

6713
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:41,990
what I was looking for today. I really
actually didn't want to take this short

6714
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:42,000
actually didn't want to take this short
 

6715
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,990
actually didn't want to take this short
all the way up here. But we are in what

6716
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:44,000
all the way up here. But we are in what
 

6717
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,270
all the way up here. But we are in what
we're in. Let's see if we can get down

6718
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:45,280
we're in. Let's see if we can get down
 

6719
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:47,990
we're in. Let's see if we can get down
to here now.

6720
02:34:47,990 --> 02:34:48,000
to here now.
 

6721
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:58,950
to here now.
Oh my gosh.

6722
02:34:58,950 --> 02:34:58,960

 

6723
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:01,270

That guy advertising price just had to

6724
02:35:01,270 --> 02:35:01,280
That guy advertising price just had to
 

6725
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,750
That guy advertising price just had to
make our life very hard, didn't he? Had

6726
02:35:03,750 --> 02:35:03,760
make our life very hard, didn't he? Had
 

6727
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:05,110
make our life very hard, didn't he? Had
to make our life hard. All right, we're

02:35:05,110 --> 02:35:05,120
to make our life hard. All right, we're
 

6729
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:07,510

almost there. We're almost there at your

6730
02:35:07,510 --> 02:35:07,520
almost there. We're almost there at your
 

6731
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:09,030
almost there. We're almost there at your
TP1.

6732
02:35:09,030 --> 02:35:09,040
TP1.
 

6733
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:11,110
TP1.
If we start snapping through that, what

6734
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:11,120
If we start snapping through that, what
 

6735
02:35:11,120 --> 02:35:12,790
If we start snapping through that, what
I would say is if bulls have had their

6736
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:12,800
I would say is if bulls have had their
 

6737
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:14,630
I would say is if bulls have had their
exit, right? If Smart Money understands

6738
02:35:14,630 --> 02:35:14,640
exit, right? If Smart Money understands
 

6739
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:16,070
exit, right? If Smart Money understands
that this is a squeeze and they've

6740
02:35:16,070 --> 02:35:16,080
that this is a squeeze and they've
 

6741
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:18,230
that this is a squeeze and they've
exited up there, if this doesn't hold,

6742
02:35:18,230 --> 02:35:18,240
exited up there, if this doesn't hold,
 

6743
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:20,150
exited up there, if this doesn't hold,
we can come all the way down to here,

6744
02:35:20,150 --> 02:35:20,160
we can come all the way down to here,
 

6745
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:22,870
we can come all the way down to here,
right? It is very possible if this shelf

6746
02:35:22,870 --> 02:35:22,880
right? It is very possible if this shelf
 

6747
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,389
right? It is very possible if this shelf
doesn't hold, we can come all the way

6748
02:35:24,389 --> 02:35:24,399
doesn't hold, we can come all the way
 

6749
02:35:24,399 --> 02:35:27,110
doesn't hold, we can come all the way
down to the 950s. Very, very possible.

6750
02:35:27,110 --> 02:35:27,120
down to the 950s. Very, very possible.
 

6751
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:29,990
down to the 950s. Very, very possible.
Okay, so TP1 runners, if we get lucky,

Okay, so TP1 runners, if we get lucky,

6782
02:36:14,070 --> 02:36:14,080
looking at. Maybe you're looking at that
 

6783
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,389
looking at. Maybe you're looking at that
that wick at 78.

6784
02:36:16,389 --> 02:36:16,399
that wick at 78.
 

6785
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:17,750
that wick at 78.
I think we're going to trade to volume,

6786
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:17,760
I think we're going to trade to volume,
 

6787
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:19,270
I think we're going to trade to volume,
mate. Like I'm just going to be honest

6788
02:36:19,270 --> 02:36:19,280
mate. Like I'm just going to be honest
 

6789
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:20,550
mate. Like I'm just going to be honest
with you. I think we're going to trade

6790
02:36:20,550 --> 02:36:20,560
with you. I think we're going to trade
 

6791
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:21,990
with you. I think we're going to trade
down to previous week lows. If you want

6792
02:36:21,990 --> 02:36:22,000
down to previous week lows. If you want
 

6793
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,429
down to previous week lows. If you want
to take partial here, you can. But I

6794
02:36:23,429 --> 02:36:23,439
to take partial here, you can. But I
 

6795
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:24,790
to take partial here, you can. But I
think we're trading into this volume

6796
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:24,800
think we're trading into this volume
 

6797
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:26,870
think we're trading into this volume
shelf here, right? Because this is thin.

6798
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:26,880
shelf here, right? Because this is thin.
 

6799
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:29,750
shelf here, right? Because this is thin.
Think about just basics. Thin liquidity,

6800
02:36:29,750 --> 02:36:29,760
Think about just basics. Thin liquidity,
 

6801
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:32,230
Think about just basics. Thin liquidity,
thick liquidity. This is a good what?

6802
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:32,240
thick liquidity. This is a good what?
 

6803
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:33,750
thick liquidity. This is a good what?
RBS

6804
02:36:33,750 --> 02:36:33,760
RBS
 

6805
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:37,590
RBS
zone. This is what an SBR zone. We're

6806
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:37,600
zone. This is what an SBR zone. We're
 

6807
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:40,790
zone. This is what an SBR zone. We're
trading failure here. Breakaway into

6808
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:40,800
trading failure here. Breakaway into
 

6809
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:43,190
trading failure here. Breakaway into
this. Ideally into this. So we're

6810
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:43,200
this. Ideally into this. So we're
 

6811
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:44,469
this. Ideally into this. So we're
looking for this move here. If they

6812
02:36:44,469 --> 02:36:44,479
looking for this move here. If they
 

6813
02:36:44,479 --> 02:36:46,790
looking for this move here. If they
reclaim this, so be it. I know exactly

6814
02:36:46,790 --> 02:36:46,800
reclaim this, so be it. I know exactly
 

6815
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:47,830
reclaim this, so be it. I know exactly
what you're looking at. You're looking

6816
02:36:47,830 --> 02:36:47,840
what you're looking at. You're looking
 

6817
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:49,510
what you're looking at. You're looking
at that wick. I don't really want it to

6818
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:49,520
at that wick. I don't really want it to
 

6819
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:52,630
at that wick. I don't really want it to
hold that wick. It's like

6820
02:36:52,630 --> 02:36:52,640
hold that wick. It's like
 

6821
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:54,309
hold that wick. It's like
this here is what you're looking at,

6822
02:36:54,309 --> 02:36:54,319
this here is what you're looking at,
 

6823
02:36:54,319 --> 02:36:58,070
this here is what you're looking at,
right? That resistance, which I get, but

6824
02:36:58,070 --> 02:36:58,080
right? That resistance, which I get, but
 

6825
02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:00,070
right? That resistance, which I get, but
I think we can drift into this. This is

6826
02:37:00,070 --> 02:37:00,080
I think we can drift into this. This is
 

6827
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:01,990
I think we can drift into this. This is
the thick liquidity pool that I'd like

6828
02:37:01,990 --> 02:37:02,000
the thick liquidity pool that I'd like
 

6829
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,150
the thick liquidity pool that I'd like
to see us move into. Like I said,

6830
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:04,160
to see us move into. Like I said,
 

6831
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:09,510
to see us move into. Like I said,
already locking some money in.

6832
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:09,520

 

6833
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:11,990

Some idiot just sold the low there.

6834
02:37:11,990 --> 02:37:12,000
Some idiot just sold the low there.
 

6835
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,349
Some idiot just sold the low there.
Yeah, you [\h__\h] idiots.

02:37:15,349 --> 02:37:15,359
Yeah, you [\h__\h] idiots.

Yeah, you [\h__\h] idiots.
Can't help yourselves, can you? Okay, we

Can't help yourselves, can you? Okay, we
 

6839
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,670
Can't help yourselves, can you? Okay, we
still look good

6840
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:19,680
still look good
 

6841
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:21,510
still look good
all the time. We're rejecting that gray

6842
02:37:21,510 --> 02:37:21,520
all the time. We're rejecting that gray
 

6843
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:22,870
all the time. We're rejecting that gray
box that I've got lined up for you. The

6844
02:37:22,870 --> 02:37:22,880
box that I've got lined up for you. The
 

6845
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:24,469
box that I've got lined up for you. The
first gray box. We can do it as red if

6846
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:24,479
first gray box. We can do it as red if
 

6847
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:26,070
first gray box. We can do it as red if
you want. So you can see it all the

looking for lower.

6853
02:37:32,399 --> 02:37:33,910

Yeah, I see what you're looking at. It

Yeah, I see what you're looking at. It
 

6855
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:36,070
Yeah, I see what you're looking at. It
does make sense like that to wick, but I

6856
02:37:36,070 --> 02:37:36,080
does make sense like that to wick, but I
 

6857
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:37,190
does make sense like that to wick, but I
would like to see us trade into the

6858
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:37,200
would like to see us trade into the
 

6859
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:42,870
would like to see us trade into the
volume shell.

6860
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:42,880

 

6861
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:44,950

Man, these sellers just ruined this at

Oh, really? All right. Two leg. If they

Either way, added some nice money. What

Either way, added some nice money. What

Nihow was right. They went to wick to

6888
02:38:18,710 --> 02:38:18,720
Nihow was right. They went to wick to
 

6889
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:21,750
Nihow was right. They went to wick to
wick. Nihow was right. They held above

6890
02:38:21,750 --> 02:38:21,760
wick. Nihow was right. They held above
 

6891
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:23,190
wick. Nihow was right. They held above
the volume. We didn't even get to the

6892
02:38:23,190 --> 02:38:23,200
the volume. We didn't even get to the
 

6893
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,750
the volume. We didn't even get to the
volume. We're still rejecting above

6894
02:38:25,750 --> 02:38:25,760
volume. We're still rejecting above
 

6895
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:28,469
volume. We're still rejecting above
here. But I think those shorts, if you

6896
02:38:28,469 --> 02:38:28,479
here. But I think those shorts, if you
 

6897
02:38:28,479 --> 02:38:30,230
here. But I think those shorts, if you
look at Bitmap, these are the guys that

6898
02:38:30,230 --> 02:38:30,240
look at Bitmap, these are the guys that
 

6899
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:31,590
look at Bitmap, these are the guys that
just ruined this trade. So you

6900
02:38:31,590 --> 02:38:31,600
just ruined this trade. So you
 

6901
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:33,270
just ruined this trade. So you
understand what I'm looking at. See

6902
02:38:33,270 --> 02:38:33,280
understand what I'm looking at. See
 

6903
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:38,630
understand what I'm looking at. See
these guys come piling in.

6904
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:38,640

 

6905
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:42,550

These guys here, right? 137 lot, 42 lot,

6906
02:38:42,550 --> 02:38:42,560
These guys here, right? 137 lot, 42 lot,
 

6907
02:38:42,560 --> 02:38:46,389
These guys here, right? 137 lot, 42 lot,
46 lot, 28 lot, 8 lot, 63 lot. That's

6908
02:38:46,389 --> 02:38:46,399
46 lot, 28 lot, 8 lot, 63 lot. That's
 

6909
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:47,830
46 lot, 28 lot, 8 lot, 63 lot. That's
the end of the auction. There's no more

6910
02:38:47,830 --> 02:38:47,840
the end of the auction. There's no more
 

6911
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,190
the end of the auction. There's no more
sellers under there. And then they let

6912
02:38:49,190 --> 02:38:49,200
sellers under there. And then they let
 

6913
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:50,710
sellers under there. And then they let
them reclaim this. And then look, higher

6914
02:38:50,710 --> 02:38:50,720
them reclaim this. And then look, higher
 

6915
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:53,590
them reclaim this. And then look, higher
low there and we're gone. Right. So

6916
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:53,600
low there and we're gone. Right. So
 

6917
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:55,830
low there and we're gone. Right. So
these sellers just just ruined it

6918
02:38:55,830 --> 02:38:55,840
these sellers just just ruined it
 

6919
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:58,710
these sellers just just ruined it
because they added too low

6920
02:38:58,710 --> 02:38:58,720
because they added too low
 

6921
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:01,990
because they added too low
and Mr. 250 is left. Has he gone higher?

6922
02:39:01,990 --> 02:39:02,000
and Mr. 250 is left. Has he gone higher?
 

6923
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,630
and Mr. 250 is left. Has he gone higher?
No, he's completely gone. Maybe done for

6924
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:04,640
No, he's completely gone. Maybe done for
 

6925
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:07,349
No, he's completely gone. Maybe done for
lunch. That might be me. That might be

6926
02:39:07,349 --> 02:39:07,359
lunch. That might be me. That might be
 

6927
02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:12,230
lunch. That might be me. That might be
me for the day.

6928
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:12,240

 

6929
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:14,309

Is there a way to edit on? This is one

6930
02:39:14,309 --> 02:39:14,319
Is there a way to edit on? This is one
 

6931
02:39:14,319 --> 02:39:16,070
Is there a way to edit on? This is one
thing I can't understand on bookmap. I

6932
02:39:16,070 --> 02:39:16,080
thing I can't understand on bookmap. I
 

6933
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:21,349
thing I can't understand on bookmap. I
draw it, change drawing style. No, and I

6934
02:39:21,349 --> 02:39:21,359
draw it, change drawing style. No, and I
 

6935
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:23,110
draw it, change drawing style. No, and I
can't pull it any longer. It's really

6936
02:39:23,110 --> 02:39:23,120
can't pull it any longer. It's really
 

6937
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:27,750
can't pull it any longer. It's really
annoying.

6938
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:27,760

 

6939
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:36,230

We just traded into where he spoofed.

6940
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:36,240

 

6941
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:39,830

Alex is having to scalp out 30 and 40

6942
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:39,840
Alex is having to scalp out 30 and 40
 

6943
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:42,150
Alex is having to scalp out 30 and 40
point trades when the market's up 6700.

6944
02:39:42,150 --> 02:39:42,160
point trades when the market's up 6700.
 

6945
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:50,309
point trades when the market's up 6700.
That is embarrassing.

6946
02:39:50,309 --> 02:39:50,319

 

6947
02:39:50,319 --> 02:39:52,309

When do I get Discord access? Yeah.

6948
02:39:52,309 --> 02:39:52,319
When do I get Discord access? Yeah.
 

6949
02:39:52,319 --> 02:39:53,670
When do I get Discord access? Yeah.
Well, if you go to the end of the

6950
02:39:53,670 --> 02:39:53,680
Well, if you go to the end of the
 

6951
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:55,510
Well, if you go to the end of the
course, contorted, go to the very end of

6952
02:39:55,510 --> 02:39:55,520
course, contorted, go to the very end of
 

6953
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:58,070
course, contorted, go to the very end of
it. Um, if you want to fast forward,

6954
02:39:58,070 --> 02:39:58,080
it. Um, if you want to fast forward,
 

6955
02:39:58,080 --> 02:39:59,670
it. Um, if you want to fast forward,
shoot me an email. There's an email on

6956
02:39:59,670 --> 02:39:59,680
shoot me an email. There's an email on
 

6957
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:02,950
shoot me an email. There's an email on
there on what what to do.

6958
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:02,960
there on what what to do.
 

6959
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:07,910
there on what what to do.
And uh we go there.

6960
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:07,920

 

6961
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:10,070

No, no momentum indicator bar. I'm just

6962
02:40:10,070 --> 02:40:10,080
No, no momentum indicator bar. I'm just
 

6963
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:11,190
No, no momentum indicator bar. I'm just
looking for failures. I mean, like I

6964
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:11,200
looking for failures. I mean, like I
 

6965
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:12,389
looking for failures. I mean, like I
said, it's the hardest trade in the book

6966
02:40:12,389 --> 02:40:12,399
said, it's the hardest trade in the book
 

6967
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:14,469
said, it's the hardest trade in the book
because you're fighting flow zones and

6968
02:40:14,469 --> 02:40:14,479
because you're fighting flow zones and
 

6969
02:40:14,479 --> 02:40:16,550
because you're fighting flow zones and
you're looking for potential collapse.

6970
02:40:16,550 --> 02:40:16,560
you're looking for potential collapse.
 

6971
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:18,150
you're looking for potential collapse.
This is the hardest trade in the book is

6972
02:40:18,150 --> 02:40:18,160
This is the hardest trade in the book is
 

6973
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:23,750
This is the hardest trade in the book is
to try and trade these um when

6974
02:40:23,750 --> 02:40:23,760
to try and trade these um when
 

6975
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:25,670
to try and trade these um when
we're doing this on the session, right?

6976
02:40:25,670 --> 02:40:25,680
we're doing this on the session, right?
 

6977
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:27,270
we're doing this on the session, right?
This is the hardest trade on the book.

6978
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:27,280
This is the hardest trade on the book.
 

6979
02:40:27,280 --> 02:40:28,710
This is the hardest trade on the book.
The reason I'm looking for this trade,

6980
02:40:28,710 --> 02:40:28,720
The reason I'm looking for this trade,
 

6981
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:31,349
The reason I'm looking for this trade,
I'm trying to time it when we might

6982
02:40:31,349 --> 02:40:31,359
I'm trying to time it when we might
 

6983
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:33,270
I'm trying to time it when we might
rotate back down to here. All right,

6984
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:33,280
rotate back down to here. All right,
 

6985
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:35,750
rotate back down to here. All right,
because I think unless we base above

6986
02:40:35,750 --> 02:40:35,760
because I think unless we base above
 

6987
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:37,590
because I think unless we base above
this value today, all right, then what

6988
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:37,600
this value today, all right, then what
 

6989
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:39,750
this value today, all right, then what
should happen today is we should do this

6990
02:40:39,750 --> 02:40:39,760
should happen today is we should do this
 

6991
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:41,670
should happen today is we should do this
the remainder of the day, right? And

6992
02:40:41,670 --> 02:40:41,680
the remainder of the day, right? And
 

6993
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:44,630
the remainder of the day, right? And
then into next week, that sets out this

6994
02:40:44,630 --> 02:40:44,640
then into next week, that sets out this
 

6995
02:40:44,640 --> 02:40:47,030
then into next week, that sets out this
or this. So, I'm trying to time that

6996
02:40:47,030 --> 02:40:47,040
or this. So, I'm trying to time that
 

6997
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:50,710
or this. So, I'm trying to time that
rotation back down to a to to at least

6998
02:40:50,710 --> 02:40:50,720
rotation back down to a to to at least
 

6999
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:54,950
rotation back down to a to to at least
the midpoint, if not a value area low.

7000
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:54,960
the midpoint, if not a value area low.
 

7001
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:57,030
the midpoint, if not a value area low.
And it's just looking for when the

7002
02:40:57,030 --> 02:40:57,040
And it's just looking for when the
 

7003
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:59,670
And it's just looking for when the
aggressive sellers come in after

7004
02:40:59,670 --> 02:40:59,680
aggressive sellers come in after
 

7005
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:01,429
aggressive sellers come in after
trapping buyers, which is we've seen

7006
02:41:01,429 --> 02:41:01,439
trapping buyers, which is we've seen
 

7007
02:41:01,439 --> 02:41:06,710
trapping buyers, which is we've seen
twice, where they fail to take control.

7008
02:41:06,710 --> 02:41:06,720

 

7009
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:10,950

Yeah. Nice. Contorted.

7010
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:10,960

 

7011
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,950

Yeah. I mean, it's true, Miguel. I mean,

7012
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:12,960
Yeah. I mean, it's true, Miguel. I mean,
 

7013
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:16,389
Yeah. I mean, it's true, Miguel. I mean,
the So, this has been the most hated

7014
02:41:16,389 --> 02:41:16,399
the So, this has been the most hated
 

7015
02:41:16,399 --> 02:41:19,830
the So, this has been the most hated
market of the year by um hedge funds

7016
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:19,840
market of the year by um hedge funds
 

7017
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:21,349
market of the year by um hedge funds
because they're not net long. They're

7018
02:41:21,349 --> 02:41:21,359
because they're not net long. They're
 

7019
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:24,550
because they're not net long. They're
net cash. They didn't buy that April dip

7020
02:41:24,550 --> 02:41:24,560
net cash. They didn't buy that April dip
 

7021
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:26,630
net cash. They didn't buy that April dip
and they waited for a pullback. Same as

7022
02:41:26,630 --> 02:41:26,640
and they waited for a pullback. Same as
 

7023
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:28,630
and they waited for a pullback. Same as
me. I'll be honest. I am mainly net

7024
02:41:28,630 --> 02:41:28,640
me. I'll be honest. I am mainly net
 

7025
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:31,190
me. I'll be honest. I am mainly net
cash. I waited for a pullback. I waited

7026

cash. I waited for a pullback. I waited
 

7027
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:32,950
cash. I waited for a pullback. I waited
from April. I waited in May. I waited in

7028
02:41:32,950 --> 02:41:32,960
from April. I waited in May. I waited in
 

7029
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:34,550
from April. I waited in May. I waited in
June. I waited in July. I waited in

7030
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:34,560
June. I waited in July. I waited in
 

7031
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:36,309
June. I waited in July. I waited in
August and so on and so on so on. And it

7032
02:41:36,309 --> 02:41:36,319
August and so on and so on so on. And it
 

7033
02:41:36,319 --> 02:41:38,710
August and so on and so on so on. And it
never came. You'll know the only big

7034
02:41:38,710 --> 02:41:38,720
never came. You'll know the only big
 

7035
02:41:38,720 --> 02:41:42,070
never came. You'll know the only big
tech stocks I got uh net long in were

7036
02:41:42,070 --> 02:41:42,080
tech stocks I got uh net long in were
 

7037
02:41:42,080 --> 02:41:45,349
tech stocks I got uh net long in were
AMD at 158 and Apple at 202. That's all

7038
02:41:45,349 --> 02:41:45,359
AMD at 158 and Apple at 202. That's all
 

7039
02:41:45,359 --> 02:41:46,790
AMD at 158 and Apple at 202. That's all
I've been net longing and holding. They

7040
02:41:46,790 --> 02:41:46,800
I've been net longing and holding. They
 

7041
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:48,309
I've been net longing and holding. They
were the only ones that gave me a setup

7042
02:41:48,309 --> 02:41:48,319
were the only ones that gave me a setup
 

7043
02:41:48,319 --> 02:41:50,710
were the only ones that gave me a setup
that I liked. That is the same as most

7044
02:41:50,710 --> 02:41:50,720
that I liked. That is the same as most
 

7045
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:51,990
that I liked. That is the same as most
of the hedge funds. they're not going to

7046
02:41:51,990 --> 02:41:52,000
of the hedge funds. they're not going to
 

7047
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,230
of the hedge funds. they're not going to
get net long at the highs without a a

7048
02:41:54,230 --> 02:41:54,240
get net long at the highs without a a
 

7049
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:58,230
get net long at the highs without a a
good pullback. And uh

7050
02:41:58,230 --> 02:41:58,240
good pullback. And uh
 

7051
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:00,309
good pullback. And uh
that's why they hate it. And retail is

7052
02:42:00,309 --> 02:42:00,319
that's why they hate it. And retail is
 

7053
02:42:00,319 --> 02:42:02,150
that's why they hate it. And retail is
flying in. And you know, these hedge

7054
02:42:02,150 --> 02:42:02,160
flying in. And you know, these hedge
 

7055
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:04,630
flying in. And you know, these hedge
funds won't get their Christmas bonuses

7056
02:42:04,630 --> 02:42:04,640
funds won't get their Christmas bonuses
 

7057
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:11,429
funds won't get their Christmas bonuses
if they can't get net long for a push.

7058
02:42:11,429 --> 02:42:11,439

 

7059
02:42:11,439 --> 02:42:13,750

Maybe they got net long this morning.

7060
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:13,760
Maybe they got net long this morning.
 

7061
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:15,750
Maybe they got net long this morning.
And if we go back to if we make new

7062
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:15,760
And if we go back to if we make new
 

7063
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:18,150
And if we go back to if we make new
all-time highs by January, you know, is

7064
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:18,160
all-time highs by January, you know, is
 

7065
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:20,389
all-time highs by January, you know, is
that enough of a pullback for them to

7066
02:42:20,389 --> 02:42:20,399
that enough of a pullback for them to
 

7067
02:42:20,399 --> 02:42:21,750
that enough of a pullback for them to
make money from? I would argue probably

7068
02:42:21,750 --> 02:42:21,760
make money from? I would argue probably
 

7069
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:24,070
make money from? I would argue probably
not. But let's have a little look. We

7070
02:42:24,070 --> 02:42:24,080
not. But let's have a little look. We
 

7071
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:25,510
not. But let's have a little look. We
went over this yesterday. How big is

7072
02:42:25,510 --> 02:42:25,520
went over this yesterday. How big is
 

7073
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:27,750
went over this yesterday. How big is
this pullback? It's not very big. If

7074
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:27,760
this pullback? It's not very big. If
 

7075
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:30,070
this pullback? It's not very big. If
they got net long at the absolute low,

7076
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,080
they got net long at the absolute low,
 

7077
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:33,190
they got net long at the absolute low,
right, 6.7% pullback,

7078
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:33,200
right, 6.7% pullback,
 

7079
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:35,349
right, 6.7% pullback,
right? We want to see 10 11% pullback at

7080
02:42:35,349 --> 02:42:35,359
right? We want to see 10 11% pullback at
 

7081
02:42:35,359 --> 02:42:37,510
right? We want to see 10 11% pullback at
least. It probably needs 20. And I'm not

7082
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:37,520
least. It probably needs 20. And I'm not
 

7083
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:39,429
least. It probably needs 20. And I'm not
convinced that this isn't going lower.

7084
02:42:39,429 --> 02:42:39,439
convinced that this isn't going lower.
 

7085
02:42:39,439 --> 02:42:41,910
convinced that this isn't going lower.
where you think about retail who bought

7086
02:42:41,910 --> 02:42:41,920
where you think about retail who bought
 

7087
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:46,870
where you think about retail who bought
the April dip.

7088
02:42:46,870 --> 02:42:46,880

 

7089
02:42:46,880 --> 02:42:48,469

Why trading? Why do I have to click it

7090
02:42:48,469 --> 02:42:48,479
Why trading? Why do I have to click it
 

7091
02:42:48,479 --> 02:42:51,830
Why trading? Why do I have to click it
10 times? We bought the April dip are

7092
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:51,840
10 times? We bought the April dip are
 

7093
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:55,510
10 times? We bought the April dip are
currently up 60%. All right, 60%. All

7094
02:42:55,510 --> 02:42:55,520
currently up 60%. All right, 60%. All
 

7095
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:58,309
currently up 60%. All right, 60%. All
right, no pullback in here. So, what why

7096
02:42:58,309 --> 02:42:58,319
right, no pullback in here. So, what why
 

7097
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:01,270
right, no pullback in here. So, what why
hedge funds hate this? Once we got over

7098
02:43:01,270 --> 02:43:01,280
hedge funds hate this? Once we got over
 

7099
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:02,550
hedge funds hate this? Once we got over
this, they would have been waiting for a

7100
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:02,560
this, they would have been waiting for a
 

7101
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:04,550
this, they would have been waiting for a
pullback into this. Didn't come. Once we

7102
02:43:04,550 --> 02:43:04,560
pullback into this. Didn't come. Once we
 

7103
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:06,309
pullback into this. Didn't come. Once we
got over the 200 day and broke out, they

7104
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:06,319
got over the 200 day and broke out, they
 

7105
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:07,270
got over the 200 day and broke out, they
would have been waiting for a pullback

7106
02:43:07,270 --> 02:43:07,280
would have been waiting for a pullback
 

7107
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:09,270
would have been waiting for a pullback
into the 200 day. Didn't come. Even this

7108
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:09,280
into the 200 day. Didn't come. Even this
 

7109
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:11,030
into the 200 day. Didn't come. Even this
tiny. They're looking for a retest of

7110
02:43:11,030 --> 02:43:11,040
tiny. They're looking for a retest of
 

7111
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:13,349
tiny. They're looking for a retest of
this. Didn't come. How about here? Had

7112
02:43:13,349 --> 02:43:13,359
this. Didn't come. How about here? Had
 

7113
02:43:13,359 --> 02:43:14,870
this. Didn't come. How about here? Had
the ability to break down. Come down to

7114
02:43:14,870 --> 02:43:14,880
the ability to break down. Come down to
 

7115
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:16,870
the ability to break down. Come down to
this shelf. Doesn't come. Squeeze,

7143
02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:45,750
we've built in 2025. We are currently
trading from here to here. I would

7144
02:43:45,750 --> 02:43:45,760
trading from here to here. I would
 

7145
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:47,670
trading from here to here. I would
expect some rotation here. If bears win

7146
02:43:47,670 --> 02:43:47,680
expect some rotation here. If bears win
 

7147
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:49,510
expect some rotation here. If bears win
that, we will get this rotation down to

7148
02:43:49,510 --> 02:43:49,520
that, we will get this rotation down to
 

7149
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:51,269
that, we will get this rotation down to
this, right? Because that's very thin in

7150
02:43:51,269 --> 02:43:51,279
this, right? Because that's very thin in
 

7151
02:43:51,279 --> 02:43:53,269
this, right? Because that's very thin in
there. If bulls win it, they will hold

7152
02:43:53,269 --> 02:43:53,279
there. If bulls win it, they will hold
 

7153
02:43:53,279 --> 02:43:55,110
there. If bulls win it, they will hold
this, reclaim this, and this will be

7154
02:43:55,110 --> 02:43:55,120
this, reclaim this, and this will be
 

7155
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:57,510
this, reclaim this, and this will be
bump bump bump bump bump bump for the

02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:57,520
bump bump bump bump bump bump for the
 

7157
02:43:57,520 --> 02:43:59,910
bump bump bump bump bump bump for the
end of the year. They have a choice to

7158
02:43:59,910 --> 02:43:59,920
end of the year. They have a choice to
 

7159
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:02,150
end of the year. They have a choice to
make. I would argue this is our lower

7160
02:44:02,150 --> 02:44:02,160
make. I would argue this is our lower
 

7161
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:05,030
make. I would argue this is our lower
high now set. We have a gap above it.

7162
02:44:05,030 --> 02:44:05,040
high now set. We have a gap above it.
 

7163
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:08,150
high now set. We have a gap above it.
Lower high is now set. For me, it's very

7164
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:08,160
Lower high is now set. For me, it's very
 

7165
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:11,349
Lower high is now set. For me, it's very
simple. I expected a squeeze out today

7166
02:44:11,349 --> 02:44:11,359
simple. I expected a squeeze out today
 

7167
02:44:11,359 --> 02:44:13,510
simple. I expected a squeeze out today
or Monday

7168
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:13,520
or Monday
 

7169
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:17,670
or Monday
based on structure,

7170
02:44:17,670 --> 02:44:17,680

 

7171
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:20,389

right? We expect this we expect this to

02:44:20,389 --> 02:44:20,399
right? We expect this we expect this to

where we close. It's why I'm trying not
 

7189

it's available. Like

I will review today and I will probably

7224
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:27,200
I will review today and I will probably
 

7225
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:29,670
I will review today and I will probably
question this is three drives now. I

7226
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:29,680
question this is three drives now. I
 

7227
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:31,110
question this is three drives now. I
will probably question if I should have

7228
02:45:31,110 --> 02:45:31,120
will probably question if I should have
 

7229
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:35,429
will probably question if I should have
got long here

02:45:35,429 --> 02:45:35,439

 

7231
02:45:35,439 --> 02:45:37,030

and I probably I've probably been I'm

going to be honest. I've probably been

02:45:38,070 --> 02:45:38,080
going to be honest. I've probably been
 

7235
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:40,710
going to be honest. I've probably been
too focused on the rotation because that

7236
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:40,720
too focused on the rotation because that
 

7237
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:43,830
too focused on the rotation because that
is a long that is a long flow zones are

7238
02:45:43,830 --> 02:45:43,840
is a long that is a long flow zones are
 

7239
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:45,830
is a long that is a long flow zones are
long. We're net long over value once we

7240
02:45:45,830 --> 02:45:45,840
long. We're net long over value once we
 

7241
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:48,150
long. We're net long over value once we
reclaim value. If you go premarket, I

7242
02:45:48,150 --> 02:45:48,160
reclaim value. If you go premarket, I
 

7243
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:51,030
reclaim value. If you go premarket, I
probably said it. Once we reclaim value,

7244
02:45:51,030 --> 02:45:51,040
probably said it. Once we reclaim value,
 

7245
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:52,710
probably said it. Once we reclaim value,
there is probably a long opportunity up

7246
02:45:52,710 --> 02:45:52,720
there is probably a long opportunity up
 

7247
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:54,790
there is probably a long opportunity up
to previous day value area high. The

7248
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:54,800
to previous day value area high. The
 

7249
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:57,830
to previous day value area high. The
hard thing there is we've already done

7250
02:45:57,830 --> 02:45:57,840
hard thing there is we've already done
 

7251
02:45:57,840 --> 02:45:59,510
hard thing there is we've already done
this.

7252
02:45:59,510 --> 02:45:59,520
this.
 

7253
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:01,429
this.
My expectation

7254
02:46:01,429 --> 02:46:01,439
My expectation
 

7255
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:06,870
My expectation
is not to do another 500 points up, but

7256
02:46:06,870 --> 02:46:06,880
is not to do another 500 points up, but
 

7257
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:08,710
is not to do another 500 points up, but
this market don't give a [\h__\h] about my

7258
02:46:08,710 --> 02:46:08,720
this market don't give a [\h__\h] about my
 

7259
02:46:08,720 --> 02:46:11,269
this market don't give a [\h__\h] about my
expectation or yours or anyone else's.

right?
And uh it is about controlling your

7266
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:19,040
And uh it is about controlling your
 

7267
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,429
And uh it is about controlling your
risk. All right? Controlling your risk.

7268
02:46:21,429 --> 02:46:21,439
risk. All right? Controlling your risk.
 

7269

risk. All right? Controlling your risk.

7286
02:46:45,750 --> 02:46:45,760

 

7287
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:49,190

Have a good weekend. I use TV footprint
 

7293
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:57,349
Have a good weekend. I use TV footprint
as you do. Noticing PC near the high

7294
02:46:57,349 --> 02:46:57,359
as you do. Noticing PC near the high
 

7295
02:46:57,359 --> 02:46:59,269
as you do. Noticing PC near the high
lows with accompanying delta combined

7296
02:46:59,269 --> 02:46:59,279
lows with accompanying delta combined
 

7297
02:46:59,279 --> 02:47:01,190
lows with accompanying delta combined
with price fading the volume has been a

7298
02:47:01,190 --> 02:47:01,200
with price fading the volume has been a
 

7299
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:03,429
with price fading the volume has been a
nice sign of reversal. Yeah, probably

7300
02:47:03,429 --> 02:47:03,439
nice sign of reversal. Yeah, probably
 

7301
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:08,469
nice sign of reversal. Yeah, probably
very right there. I would say

7302
02:47:08,469 --> 02:47:08,479

 

7303
02:47:08,479 --> 02:47:10,070

crazy. Yeah, I mean the news I don't

7304
02:47:10,070 --> 02:47:10,080
crazy. Yeah, I mean the news I don't
 

7305
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:10,950
crazy. Yeah, I mean the news I don't
know how I'm going to write this

7306
02:47:10,950 --> 02:47:10,960
know how I'm going to write this
 

7307
02:47:10,960 --> 02:47:14,150
know how I'm going to write this
newsletter right now.

7308
02:47:14,150 --> 02:47:14,160
newsletter right now.
 

7309

newsletter right now.
If we close high today, it's going to

7310

If we close high today, it's going to
 

7311
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:19,269
If we close high today, it's going to
say this. Yet again, bears had the

7312
02:47:19,269 --> 02:47:19,279
say this. Yet again, bears had the
 

7313
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:24,389
say this. Yet again, bears had the
chance to take control and didn't.

7314
02:47:24,389 --> 02:47:24,399

 

7315
02:47:24,399 --> 02:47:26,230

That's what it would probably say at the

7316
02:47:26,230 --> 02:47:26,240
That's what it would probably say at the
 

7317
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:28,950
That's what it would probably say at the
moment if we we [\h__\h] squeeze up and

7318
02:47:28,950 --> 02:47:28,960
moment if we we [\h__\h] squeeze up and
 

7319
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:31,590
moment if we we [\h__\h] squeeze up and
reclaim a previous day value high.

7320
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:31,600
reclaim a previous day value high.
 

7321
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:34,870
reclaim a previous day value high.
That's probably what it's going to say.

7322
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:34,880
That's probably what it's going to say.
 

7323
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:36,630
That's probably what it's going to say.

02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:09,349

VIX still under PDC. So, just failing on

7348
02:48:09,349 --> 02:48:09,359
VIX still under PDC. So, just failing on
 

7349
02:48:09,359 --> 02:48:12,230
VIX still under PDC. So, just failing on
a VIX. Man, my timing is off. I thought

7350
02:48:12,230 --> 02:48:12,240
a VIX. Man, my timing is off. I thought
 

7351
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:14,469
a VIX. Man, my timing is off. I thought
I really thought this move today would

7352
02:48:14,469 --> 02:48:14,479
I really thought this move today would
 

7353
02:48:14,479 --> 02:48:17,510
I really thought this move today would
come Monday. I thought we would probably

7354
02:48:17,510 --> 02:48:17,520
come Monday. I thought we would probably
 

7355
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:19,750
come Monday. I thought we would probably
stay in a range rotation near the lows

7356
02:48:19,750 --> 02:48:19,760
stay in a range rotation near the lows
 

7357
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:21,269
stay in a range rotation near the lows
and we would do this move Monday. My

7358
02:48:21,269 --> 02:48:21,279
and we would do this move Monday. My
 

7359
02:48:21,279 --> 02:48:27,510
and we would do this move Monday. My
timing is off.

02:48:39,590 --> 02:48:39,600
But I mean, I'm trying to remember what
 

7369
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:40,950
But I mean, I'm trying to remember what
were the levels. Let's go through that

Let's get through the first bit. Let's
 

7397

Let's get through the first bit. Let's

work cut out for them. Momentum has
 

7469
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:13,349

7491
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:40,070
with a divi divisive pivot at 26,000. So
where were the highs of this week? Let's

where were the highs of this week? Let's

where were the highs of this week? Let's
see how accurate was I.

02:51:43,910 --> 02:51:43,920
see how accurate was I.

We said 25,680

sorry. So Wednesday's high going to
 

7503
02:51:53,920 --> 02:51:56,150
sorry. So Wednesday's high going to
Thursday. So Wednesday's high was shy of

Thursday. So Wednesday's high was shy of
 

7505
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:59,349

that. So no reclaim of 26,000. All

7506
02:51:59,349 --> 02:51:59,359
that. So no reclaim of 26,000. All
 

7507
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:01,030
that. So no reclaim of 26,000. All
right, which is what bulls needed to

02:52:01,030 --> 02:52:01,040
right, which is what bulls needed to
 

7509
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:02,710
right, which is what bulls needed to
reclaim.

the exhaustion is whether they can build

the exhaustion is whether they can build
 

7517
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:11,030
the exhaustion is whether they can build
out on it. Friday's session showed

volume trapped above, bears simply need
 

7527

volume trapped above, bears simply need
to defend resistance levels to remain in

to defend resistance levels to remain in
 

7529

03:00:01,680 --> 03:00:03,590
That definitely would have been me back
in the day.

7864
03:00:03,590 --> 03:00:03,600
in the day.
 

7865
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:05,590
in the day.
Trying to pick the top and not admitting

7866
03:00:05,590 --> 03:00:05,600
Trying to pick the top and not admitting
 

7867
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:08,469
Trying to pick the top and not admitting
when you're offside.

7868
03:00:08,469 --> 03:00:08,479
when you're offside.
 

7869
03:00:08,479 --> 03:00:10,150
when you're offside.
One thing I'd say, not once today have I

7870
03:00:10,150 --> 03:00:10,160
One thing I'd say, not once today have I
 

7871
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:11,670
One thing I'd say, not once today have I
tried to short up here. I've been tra

7872
03:00:11,670 --> 03:00:11,680
tried to short up here. I've been tra
 

7873
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:13,429
tried to short up here. I've been tra
trying to take the breakdowns when they

7874
03:00:13,429 --> 03:00:13,439
trying to take the breakdowns when they
 

7875
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:14,870
trying to take the breakdowns when they
come, which is always safer because

7876
03:00:14,870 --> 03:00:14,880
come, which is always safer because
 

7877
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:17,590
come, which is always safer because
you've got set risk.

7878
03:00:17,590 --> 03:00:17,600
you've got set risk.
 

7879
03:00:17,600 --> 03:00:19,269
you've got set risk.
I would imagine you're right. I would

7880
03:00:19,269 --> 03:00:19,279
I would imagine you're right. I would
 

7881
03:00:19,279 --> 03:00:20,790
I would imagine you're right. I would
imagine I'd imagine by the end of the

7882
03:00:20,790 --> 03:00:20,800
imagine I'd imagine by the end of the
 

7883
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:23,429
imagine I'd imagine by the end of the
day there's blown longs and blown

7884
03:00:23,429 --> 03:00:23,439
day there's blown longs and blown
 

7885
03:00:23,439 --> 03:00:25,110
day there's blown longs and blown
shorts.

7886
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:25,120
shorts.
 

7887
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:28,070
shorts.
I would really think that is probably

7888
03:00:28,070 --> 03:00:28,080
I would really think that is probably
 

7889
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:29,750
I would really think that is probably
going to happen right back to where

7890
03:00:29,750 --> 03:00:29,760
going to happen right back to where
 

7891
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:31,110
going to happen right back to where
we've just broken out. I'm really

we've just broken out. I'm really
 

7893
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:33,349
we've just broken out. I'm really
interested like what are they doing?

7894
03:00:33,349 --> 03:00:33,359
interested like what are they doing?

interested like what are they doing?
What is the uh overall intention and

7896
03:00:36,710 --> 03:00:36,720
What is the uh overall intention and
 

7897
03:00:36,720 --> 03:00:38,469
What is the uh overall intention and
game? They're holding every single key

7898
03:00:38,469 --> 03:00:38,479
game? They're holding every single key
 

7899
03:00:38,479 --> 03:00:41,349
game? They're holding every single key
level now.

7900
03:00:41,349 --> 03:00:41,359
level now.
 

7901
03:00:41,359 --> 03:00:42,950
level now.
What is it that they want to do today?

7902
03:00:42,950 --> 03:00:42,960
What is it that they want to do today?
 

7903
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:45,910
What is it that they want to do today?
How do they inflict max pain? Can we

7904
03:00:45,910 --> 03:00:45,920
How do they inflict max pain? Can we
 

7905
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:49,750
How do they inflict max pain? Can we
really go back to the 500s?

7906
03:00:49,750 --> 03:00:49,760
really go back to the 500s?
 

7907
03:00:49,760 --> 03:00:53,030
really go back to the 500s?
Like really, can they actually do that?

7908
03:00:53,030 --> 03:00:53,040
Like really, can they actually do that?
 

7909
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,429

I'm not sure I've ever seen a move that
big if they do um off a big cell. I'm

7914
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:00,560
big if they do um off a big cell. I'm
 

7915
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:02,870
big if they do um off a big cell. I'm
trying to think how big was last week.

7916
03:01:02,870 --> 03:01:02,880
trying to think how big was last week.
 

7917
03:01:02,880 --> 03:01:05,030
trying to think how big was last week.
It was I guess it's the same kind of

7918
03:01:05,030 --> 03:01:05,040
It was I guess it's the same kind of
 

7919
