00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,869
sell. Thursday breaking Monday low. All
right. So maybe maybe a back test in

50
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
right. So maybe maybe a back test in
 

51
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,030
right. So maybe maybe a back test in
here. somewhere in here before a resell

52
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
here. somewhere in here before a resell
 

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,030
here. somewhere in here before a resell
down maybe. We don't know. But what we

54
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
down maybe. We don't know. But what we
 

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,550
down maybe. We don't know. But what we
do know is we've got now this lower

56
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
do know is we've got now this lower
 

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,910
do know is we've got now this lower
ballinger band and what do you know the

58
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
ballinger band and what do you know the
 

59
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,710
ballinger band and what do you know the
fiveday playing catchup? Some smart

60
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
fiveday playing catchup? Some smart
 

61
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,070
fiveday playing catchup? Some smart
person told you that will probably

62
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
person told you that will probably
 

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,390
person told you that will probably
happen and then it's all depends whether

64
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
happen and then it's all depends whether
 

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,309
happen and then it's all depends whether
we can set a trend under here. All

66
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
we can set a trend under here. All
 

67
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,190
we can set a trend under here. All
right. What we are looking at here is

68
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
right. What we are looking at here is
 

69
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,990
right. What we are looking at here is
are we going to go expansion again and

70
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
are we going to go expansion again and
 

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,309
are we going to go expansion again and
come and try and take out these lows

72
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
come and try and take out these lows
 

73
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,869
come and try and take out these lows
down here which we have not swept yet,

74
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
down here which we have not swept yet,
 

75
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,430
down here which we have not swept yet,
right? because we've held the 200 day or

76
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
right? because we've held the 200 day or
 

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,190
right? because we've held the 200 day or
are we going to wait a few days and

78
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
are we going to wait a few days and
 

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,350
are we going to wait a few days and
maybe do that next week? Very possible.

80
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
maybe do that next week? Very possible.
 

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,229
maybe do that next week? Very possible.
All right. So, we're going to watch

82
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
All right. So, we're going to watch
 

83
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,110
All right. So, we're going to watch
these levels inside here. Big week

84
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
these levels inside here. Big week
 

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,350
these levels inside here. Big week
already. So, don't go forcing today.

86
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
already. So, don't go forcing today.
 

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,110
already. So, don't go forcing today.
Please folks, don't be forcing yourself

88
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
Please folks, don't be forcing yourself
 

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,270
Please folks, don't be forcing yourself
on the market today.

90
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
on the market today.
 

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,309
on the market today.
All right. Hourly. Let's focus on here.

92
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
All right. Hourly. Let's focus on here.
 

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,789
All right. Hourly. Let's focus on here.
Hourly. You can see we are currently

94
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
Hourly. You can see we are currently
 

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,350
Hourly. You can see we are currently
trading right inside yesterday's range.

96
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
trading right inside yesterday's range.
 

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,830
trading right inside yesterday's range.
So if we look at yesterday's range,

98
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
So if we look at yesterday's range,
 

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,229
So if we look at yesterday's range,
previous day value area low right here

100
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
previous day value area low right here
 

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,910
previous day value area low right here
725.

102
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
725.
 

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,750
725.
Okay, we are bouncing between previous

104
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
Okay, we are bouncing between previous
 

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,229
Okay, we are bouncing between previous
day value area low and previous day

106
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
day value area low and previous day
 

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,830
day value area low and previous day
point of previous week we point of

108
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
point of previous week we point of
 

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,830
point of previous week we point of
control. Sorry. All right, so this is

110
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
control. Sorry. All right, so this is
 

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,070
control. Sorry. All right, so this is
currently the rotation. We have been in

112
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
currently the rotation. We have been in
 

113
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,270
currently the rotation. We have been in
a strong sell. We have some degree of

114
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
a strong sell. We have some degree of
 

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,429
a strong sell. We have some degree of
compression. Doesn't mean it can't go

116
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
compression. Doesn't mean it can't go
 

117
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,429
compression. Doesn't mean it can't go
lower, but shorting down here starts to

118
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
lower, but shorting down here starts to
 

119
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,190
lower, but shorting down here starts to
become very very risky, doesn't it?

120
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
become very very risky, doesn't it?
 

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,509
become very very risky, doesn't it?
Because any break, I would say

122
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
Because any break, I would say
 

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,110
Because any break, I would say
especially over previous day point

124
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
especially over previous day point
 

125
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,909
especially over previous day point
control, any break over here, you will

126
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
control, any break over here, you will
 

127
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,710
control, any break over here, you will
start to see potential upside lift for a

128
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
start to see potential upside lift for a
 

129
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,790
start to see potential upside lift for a
retest up here. Look how thin we are

130
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
retest up here. Look how thin we are
 

131
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,710
retest up here. Look how thin we are
yesterday. All right, so we're watching

132
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
yesterday. All right, so we're watching
 

133

137
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,550
very, very careful. All right, very
careful into that kind of level. Can we

138
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
careful into that kind of level. Can we
 

139
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,230
careful into that kind of level. Can we
get rid of you, mate? All right, so

141
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,790
get rid of you, mate? All right, so
we're watching a rotation here between

142
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
we're watching a rotation here between
 

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,590
we're watching a rotation here between
these levels here. Okay. And if we get

144
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
these levels here. Okay. And if we get
 

145
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,909
these levels here. Okay. And if we get
over once, certainly if we keep

146
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
over once, certainly if we keep
 

147
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,270
over once, certainly if we keep
rejecting this gray box, we're going to

148
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
rejecting this gray box, we're going to
 

149
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,950
rejecting this gray box, we're going to
keep coming back down into these sort of

150
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
keep coming back down into these sort of
 

151
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,469
keep coming back down into these sort of
725s.

152
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
725s.
 

153
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,590
725s.
Under 725s, acceptance under 725s, we

154
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
Under 725s, acceptance under 725s, we
 

155
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,510
Under 725s, acceptance under 725s, we
can look for overnight low and previous

156
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
can look for overnight low and previous
 

157
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,870
can look for overnight low and previous
week value area low. All right. Over

158
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
week value area low. All right. Over
 

159
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,390
week value area low. All right. Over
sort of 810ish, over 810ish. And

160
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
sort of 810ish, over 810ish. And
 

161
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,390
sort of 810ish, over 810ish. And
certainly over these pivots here, 850,

162
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
certainly over these pivots here, 850,
 

163
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,029
certainly over these pivots here, 850,
we can lift towards 900. So, I'd say in

164
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
we can lift towards 900. So, I'd say in
 

165
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,510
we can lift towards 900. So, I'd say in
here is going to be somewhat chop and

166
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
here is going to be somewhat chop and
 

167
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,350
here is going to be somewhat chop and
slop, right? And the range isn't bad.

168
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
slop, right? And the range isn't bad.
 

169
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,710
slop, right? And the range isn't bad.
It's about 100 points of chop and slop

170
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
It's about 100 points of chop and slop
 

171
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,110
It's about 100 points of chop and slop
in there if you want to play it. Uh I

172
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
in there if you want to play it. Uh I
 

173
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,150
in there if you want to play it. Uh I
will prefer this move here or this move

174
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
will prefer this move here or this move
 

175
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,510
will prefer this move here or this move
here or a failed look and down or like a

176
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
here or a failed look and down or like a
 

177
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,590
here or a failed look and down or like a
failed break and up. That's going to be

178
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
failed break and up. That's going to be
 

179
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,070
failed break and up. That's going to be
the easier play in my mind. Um if we

180
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
the easier play in my mind. Um if we
 

181
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,749
the easier play in my mind. Um if we
have a look up here on fiveminute chart,

182
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
have a look up here on fiveminute chart,
 

183
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,350
have a look up here on fiveminute chart,
you will notice I have put the GEX

184
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
you will notice I have put the GEX
 

185
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,710
you will notice I have put the GEX
levels on here for you today. All right.

186
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
levels on here for you today. All right.
 

187
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,909
levels on here for you today. All right.
So you can see there is a currently a

188
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
So you can see there is a currently a
 

189
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,830
So you can see there is a currently a
put wall before the open at least. This

190
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
put wall before the open at least. This
 

191
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,189
put wall before the open at least. This
will change after the open at at uh 7:25

192
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
will change after the open at at uh 7:25
 

193
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,629
will change after the open at at uh 7:25
which lines up perfectly with previous

194
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
which lines up perfectly with previous
 

195
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,270
which lines up perfectly with previous
day value. Currently we keep holding

196
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
day value. Currently we keep holding
 

197
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,990
day value. Currently we keep holding
this and currently we keep getting stuck

198
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
this and currently we keep getting stuck
 

199
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,150
this and currently we keep getting stuck
as we come into the call wall 850. So

200
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
as we come into the call wall 850. So
 

201
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,749
as we come into the call wall 850. So
like I said 725 850 lines up pretty well

202
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
like I said 725 850 lines up pretty well
 

203
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,230
like I said 725 850 lines up pretty well
with this up here 900. All right same

204
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
with this up here 900. All right same
 

205
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,350
with this up here 900. All right same
kind of levels. So if we fail 825 there

206
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
kind of levels. So if we fail 825 there
 

207
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,270
kind of levels. So if we fail 825 there
is a wash down to previous week value

208
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
is a wash down to previous week value
 

209
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,110
is a wash down to previous week value
area low which lines up pretty well with

210
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
area low which lines up pretty well with
 

211
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,870
area low which lines up pretty well with
the next call wall. Surprise surprise.

212
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
the next call wall. Surprise surprise.
 

213
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,350
the next call wall. Surprise surprise.
All right it's the same areas. right

214
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
All right it's the same areas. right
 

215
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,550
All right it's the same areas. right
over uh 825 and 900s there is a lift up

216
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
over uh 825 and 900s there is a lift up
 

217
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,390
over uh 825 and 900s there is a lift up
the previous day value area high which

218
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
the previous day value area high which
 

219
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,550
the previous day value area high which
lines pretty well with the cool wall.

220
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
lines pretty well with the cool wall.
 

221
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,230
lines pretty well with the cool wall.
All right, so they line up pretty well

222
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
All right, so they line up pretty well
 

223
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,670
All right, so they line up pretty well
this morning. We'll see if they move

224
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
this morning. We'll see if they move
 

225
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,189
this morning. We'll see if they move
during the day. They will move in the

226
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
during the day. They will move in the
 

227
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,430
during the day. They will move in the
next hour or 30 minutes. But really,

228
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
next hour or 30 minutes. But really,
 

229
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,270
next hour or 30 minutes. But really,
we're very very careful here because

230
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
we're very very careful here because
 

231
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,749
we're very very careful here because
this can definitely be compression. I'm

232
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
this can definitely be compression. I'm
 

233
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,430
this can definitely be compression. I'm
not saying to long it. It's not what I'm

234
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
not saying to long it. It's not what I'm
 

235
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,749
not saying to long it. It's not what I'm
saying. But it can get relief to here

236
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
saying. But it can get relief to here
 

237
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,749
saying. But it can get relief to here
and it can get relief up here. And if we

238
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
and it can get relief up here. And if we
 

239
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,710
and it can get relief up here. And if we
get up here, you know, then we maybe

240
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
get up here, you know, then we maybe
 

241
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,309
get up here, you know, then we maybe
look for the sell back down once we

242
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
look for the sell back down once we
 

243
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,070
look for the sell back down once we
clear out all these stops like we always

244
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
clear out all these stops like we always
 

245
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,990
clear out all these stops like we always
talk about. Doesn't have to do that. It

246
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
talk about. Doesn't have to do that. It
 

247
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,469
talk about. Doesn't have to do that. It
can absolutely just go [\h__\h] no. We don't

248
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
can absolutely just go [\h__\h] no. We don't
 

249
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,230
can absolutely just go [\h__\h] no. We don't
want to hold over the weekend. We're

250
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
want to hold over the weekend. We're
 

251
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,309
want to hold over the weekend. We're
expecting gap down Monday. Sell, sell,

252
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
expecting gap down Monday. Sell, sell,
 

253
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,390
expecting gap down Monday. Sell, sell,
sell, sell, sell. Get rid of all of our

254
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
sell, sell, sell. Get rid of all of our
 

255
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,629
sell, sell, sell. Get rid of all of our
inventory, which is what happened late

256
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
inventory, which is what happened late
 

257
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,309
inventory, which is what happened late
in the afternoon yesterday as we talked

258
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
in the afternoon yesterday as we talked
 

259
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,629
in the afternoon yesterday as we talked
about in Discord before it happened. All

260
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
about in Discord before it happened. All
 

261
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,350
about in Discord before it happened. All
right, moving up. Lower time frame.

262
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
right, moving up. Lower time frame.
 

263
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,350
right, moving up. Lower time frame.
Lower time frame. Right. So you can see

264
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
Lower time frame. Right. So you can see
 

265
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,990
Lower time frame. Right. So you can see
just this compression, right? We're in

266
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
just this compression, right? We're in
 

267
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,070
just this compression, right? We're in
stuck in here, right? Just for those of

268
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
stuck in here, right? Just for those of
 

269
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,670
stuck in here, right? Just for those of
you who can't see, we're stuck in here

270
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
you who can't see, we're stuck in here
 

271
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,070
you who can't see, we're stuck in here
right now and with some stops up here.

272
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
right now and with some stops up here.
 

273
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,870
right now and with some stops up here.
So this is the rotation. This is a stop

274
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
So this is the rotation. This is a stop
 

275
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,270
So this is the rotation. This is a stop
hunt area up here. Very thin above.

276
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
hunt area up here. Very thin above.
 

277
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,550
hunt area up here. Very thin above.
Right, let's have a look at ES. It's

278
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
Right, let's have a look at ES. It's
 

279
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,749
Right, let's have a look at ES. It's
going to look pretty much the same here.

280
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
going to look pretty much the same here.
 

281
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,309
going to look pretty much the same here.
Pretty much the same here. We can flip

282
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
Pretty much the same here. We can flip
 

283
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,230
Pretty much the same here. We can flip
this. It's very much.

284
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
this. It's very much.
 

285
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,830
this. It's very much.
Okay. And a little box here. So we're

286
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
Okay. And a little box here. So we're
 

287
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,510
Okay. And a little box here. So we're
holding uh 25. trading 25s to 60s right

288
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
holding uh 25. trading 25s to 60s right
 

289
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,309
holding uh 25. trading 25s to 60s right
now. Um, I have one of these on there.

290
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
now. Um, I have one of these on there.
 

291
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,230
now. Um, I have one of these on there.
Probably put this on there for you. See

292
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
Probably put this on there for you. See
 

293
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,430
Probably put this on there for you. See
if it lines up.

294
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440

 

295
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,550

Yeah. So, same kind of levels, 20s.

296
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
Yeah. So, same kind of levels, 20s.
 

297
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,350
Yeah. So, same kind of levels, 20s.
Um, I mean, I don't see it doing that.

298
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
Um, I mean, I don't see it doing that.
 

299
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,029
Um, I mean, I don't see it doing that.
So, 20s, it's just where they hold these

300
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
So, 20s, it's just where they hold these
 

301
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,629
So, 20s, it's just where they hold these
dips. The highest one's right down here.

302
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
dips. The highest one's right down here.
 

303
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,990
dips. The highest one's right down here.
So, they're expecting a sell through

304
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
So, they're expecting a sell through
 

305
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,309
So, they're expecting a sell through
here on ES by the looks of it. We'll

306
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
here on ES by the looks of it. We'll
 

307
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,230
here on ES by the looks of it. We'll
see. But, same kind of story. Let's have

308
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
see. But, same kind of story. Let's have
 

309
00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:00,790
see. But, same kind of story. Let's have
a look at the spiders and the ETFs.

310
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800

 

311
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,270

Five minute here.

312
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
Five minute here.
 

313
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,869
Five minute here.
All right, into this we have an old gap

314
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
All right, into this we have an old gap
 

315
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,110
All right, into this we have an old gap
down here. It's worth noting into 73s.

316
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
down here. It's worth noting into 73s.
 

317
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,309
down here. It's worth noting into 73s.
Let's quick look out of interest.

318
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
Let's quick look out of interest.
 

319
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,029
Let's quick look out of interest.
Oh, surprise surprise for the gap fill

320
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
Oh, surprise surprise for the gap fill
 

321
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,390
Oh, surprise surprise for the gap fill
at 75s. All right, so bit of a

322
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
at 75s. All right, so bit of a
 

323
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,150
at 75s. All right, so bit of a
resistance here that we I imagine we've

324
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
resistance here that we I imagine we've
 

325
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,430
resistance here that we I imagine we've
chopped this morning before they make

326
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
chopped this morning before they make
 

327
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,950
chopped this morning before they make
their mind up on what it is that they

328
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
their mind up on what it is that they
 

329
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,430
their mind up on what it is that they
want to do here. Uh, but we definitely

330
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
want to do here. Uh, but we definitely
 

331
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,830
want to do here. Uh, but we definitely
have potential for an old gap fill here.

332
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
have potential for an old gap fill here.
 

333
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,749
have potential for an old gap fill here.
I just want to make sure that's legit.

334
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
I just want to make sure that's legit.
 

335
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,630
I just want to make sure that's legit.
It's the overnight gap. It's not the

336
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
It's the overnight gap. It's not the
 

337
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,630
It's the overnight gap. It's not the
best, but there is something. All right.

338
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
best, but there is something. All right.
 

339
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,350
best, but there is something. All right.
So, we'll see. We'll see.

340
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
So, we'll see. We'll see.
 

341
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,190
So, we'll see. We'll see.
Uh, no. What's just happened there?

342
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
Uh, no. What's just happened there?
 

343
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,750
Uh, no. What's just happened there?

349
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,550
massive level. 600. We lose 600. All
right. we sell through. Okay, we can

350
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
right. we sell through. Okay, we can
 

351
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,590
right. we sell through. Okay, we can
start thinking about a wash further down

352
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
start thinking about a wash further down
 

353
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,829
start thinking about a wash further down
uh 595ish

354
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
uh 595ish
 

355
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,990
uh 595ish
down into here. Yeah, these old lows

356
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
down into here. Yeah, these old lows
 

357
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,670
down into here. Yeah, these old lows
here. Like I said to everyone in

358
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
here. Like I said to everyone in
 

359
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,829
here. Like I said to everyone in
Discord, watch this fifth and sixth the

360
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
Discord, watch this fifth and sixth the
 

361
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,550
Discord, watch this fifth and sixth the
uh fifth and sixth pivots. We lose that,

362
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
uh fifth and sixth pivots. We lose that,
 

363
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,070
uh fifth and sixth pivots. We lose that,
we're going to watch this low. We lose

364
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
we're going to watch this low. We lose
 

365
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,350
we're going to watch this low. We lose
that, we're going to start really

366
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
that, we're going to start really
 

367
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,269
that, we're going to start really
attacking. Remember, QQQs have got to

368
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
attacking. Remember, QQQs have got to
 

369
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,509
attacking. Remember, QQQs have got to
catch up to to go to get to the 200 day

370
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
catch up to to go to get to the 200 day
 

371
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,829
catch up to to go to get to the 200 day
like we talked about. ETFs have not hit

372
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
like we talked about. ETFs have not hit
 

373
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,750
like we talked about. ETFs have not hit
the 200 day the same way the futures

374
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
the 200 day the same way the futures
 

375
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,150
the 200 day the same way the futures
have. So if they want to sell, they

376
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
have. So if they want to sell, they
 

377
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,990
have. So if they want to sell, they
still have a back test of that 200 day

378
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
still have a back test of that 200 day
 

379
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,949
still have a back test of that 200 day
to go, right? Dixie trying, desperately

380
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
to go, right? Dixie trying, desperately
 

381
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,190
to go, right? Dixie trying, desperately
trying to find a bid, right, after

382
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
trying to find a bid, right, after
 

383
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,910
trying to find a bid, right, after
curling. Not a great attempt yet, but

384
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
curling. Not a great attempt yet, but
 

385
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,470
curling. Not a great attempt yet, but
it's better than nothing, I guess. Uh, a

386
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
it's better than nothing, I guess. Uh, a
 

387
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,230
it's better than nothing, I guess. Uh, a
little bit of a bounce back on gold, I

388
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
little bit of a bounce back on gold, I
 

389
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,910
little bit of a bounce back on gold, I
guess, after those huge sells that we

390
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
guess, after those huge sells that we
 

391
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,509
guess, after those huge sells that we
talked about. Again, still pinned in

392
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
talked about. Again, still pinned in
 

393
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,750

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
here. Same thing on silver weakness like
 

395
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,990

over 20s, we can have a run up towards

over 20s, we can have a run up towards
 

407
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,190
over 20s, we can have a run up towards
what's this pivot here? 22 and 23. If we

408
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
what's this pivot here? 22 and 23. If we
 

409
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,190
what's this pivot here? 22 and 23. If we
start taking that out on VIX, right? Any

410
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
start taking that out on VIX, right? Any
 

411
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,630
start taking that out on VIX, right? Any
run up here, this market's going to get

412
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
run up here, this market's going to get
 

413
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,870
run up here, this market's going to get
so weak, I cannot explain. All right, if

414
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
so weak, I cannot explain. All right, if
 

415
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,350
so weak, I cannot explain. All right, if
we go on a rip on a Friday on VIX, the

416
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
we go on a rip on a Friday on VIX, the
 

417
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,590
we go on a rip on a Friday on VIX, the
market will start tanking. So, worth

418
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
market will start tanking. So, worth
 

419
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,509
market will start tanking. So, worth
setting some price alerts at these

420
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
setting some price alerts at these
 

421
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,030
setting some price alerts at these
pivots.

422
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040

431
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,230
consolidation. Maybe it needs a bit of a
back test to resell and then we see if

432
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
back test to resell and then we see if
 

433
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,509
back test to resell and then we see if
there's a failed breakdown or

this kind of level here. 88 into 90s, I
 

497
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,790
this kind of level here. 88 into 90s, I

516
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
the high. That's why it's a double top
 

517

of this move. So any fails into 22s,
 

523
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,550
of this move. So any fails into 22s,
even argue 20s, but 22s and 26s, any

fails into here, you'd look for downside
 

527
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,910

you in case you do not know. I'm not a
 

615
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,509
you in case you do not know. I'm not a
financial adviser, guys. I'm telling you

616
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
financial adviser, guys. I'm telling you
 

617
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,829
financial adviser, guys. I'm telling you
what I will do with my accounts. Maybe I

618
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
what I will do with my accounts. Maybe I
 

619
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,829
what I will do with my accounts. Maybe I
get them wrong. All right? So, make sure

620
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
get them wrong. All right? So, make sure
 

621
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,509
get them wrong. All right? So, make sure
you do your own due diligence, but this

622
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
you do your own due diligence, but this
 

623
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,829
you do your own due diligence, but this
is certainly something I'll be looking

624
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
is certainly something I'll be looking
 

625
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,509
is certainly something I'll be looking
at into here. Here I've already got a

626
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
at into here. Here I've already got a
 

627
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,990
at into here. Here I've already got a
piece on as we know. Any drift lower I

628
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
piece on as we know. Any drift lower I
 

629
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,509
piece on as we know. Any drift lower I
will start scooping this aggressively.

630
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
will start scooping this aggressively.
 

631
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,350
will start scooping this aggressively.
Aggressively.

632
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
Aggressively.
 

633
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,829
Aggressively.
Um that is pretty much it. That is

634
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
Um that is pretty much it. That is
 

635
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,949
Um that is pretty much it. That is
pretty much it.

636
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
pretty much it.
 

637
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,870
pretty much it.

So many lines on the chart. It's ugly

644
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
So many lines on the chart. It's ugly
 

645
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,949
So many lines on the chart. It's ugly
right now, isn't it? It is ugly. Let's

646
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
right now, isn't it? It is ugly. Let's
 

647
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,990
right now, isn't it? It is ugly. Let's
uh see if we can move some of these

648
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000

 

649
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,670

That's a big level there on the edge.

650
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
That's a big level there on the edge.
 

651
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,750
That's a big level there on the edge.
Give me a second, folks.

652
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760

 

653
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,910

Don't think we need this node. Don't

Don't think we need this node. Don't

think we need this node. Do think we
need this one.

658
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
need this one.
 

659
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:46,389
need this one.
Cleaning the chart up for a moment.

685
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,350

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
that back today on a Friday. The best
 

687
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,189
that back today on a Friday. The best
moves for the week have probably

moves for the week have probably
 

689
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,069

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
I think we're clear for news. Yeah,
 

703
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,949

we're pretty much clear for news today.

704
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
we're pretty much clear for news today.
 

705
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,509

We had CPI this morning.
 

707
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,710
We had CPI this morning.
We look good.

708
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
We look good.
 

709
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,910
We look good.
I'll be taking it nice and easy today

710
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
I'll be taking it nice and easy today
 

711
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,670
I'll be taking it nice and easy today
unless there's something very very

712
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
unless there's something very very
 

713
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,189
unless there's something very very
clean. We know the levels. We've gone

714
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
clean. We know the levels. We've gone
 

715
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,350
clean. We know the levels. We've gone
over the levels. We're currently holding

716
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
over the levels. We're currently holding
 

717
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,470
over the levels. We're currently holding
into here. This uh

718
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
into here. This uh
 

719
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,150
into here. This uh
put wall at the moment. If we start to

720
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
put wall at the moment. If we start to
 

721
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,150
put wall at the moment. If we start to
lose that, maybe we we can wash down to

722
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
lose that, maybe we we can wash down to
 

723
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,590
lose that, maybe we we can wash down to
previous week value area low. So, I'm

724
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
previous week value area low. So, I'm
 

725
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,749
previous week value area low. So, I'm
watching the rotation between here and

726
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
watching the rotation between here and
 

727
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,749
watching the rotation between here and
this gray box. All right. And if we lose

728
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
this gray box. All right. And if we lose
 

729
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,749
this gray box. All right. And if we lose
one side, maybe like we talked about the

730
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
one side, maybe like we talked about the
 

731
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,470
one side, maybe like we talked about the
rotation at the moment is between these,

732
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
rotation at the moment is between these,
 

733
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,910
rotation at the moment is between these,
right? If we lose this, there's an

734
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
right? If we lose this, there's an
 

735
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,749
right? If we lose this, there's an
argument for it to come down here. If we

736
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
argument for it to come down here. If we
 

737
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,269
argument for it to come down here. If we
get above this, there's an argument for

738
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
get above this, there's an argument for
 

739
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,590
get above this, there's an argument for
a squeeze up to here. But we need to be

740
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
a squeeze up to here. But we need to be
 

741
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,829
a squeeze up to here. But we need to be
very careful of fail breakouts in

742
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
very careful of fail breakouts in
 

743
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,829
very careful of fail breakouts in
inside. Right?

744
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839

 

745
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:44,470

755
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,829

757
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,430

Do I know if I can use take profit in

Do I know if I can use take profit in

Number 25 that uh previous day value
 

791
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,630
Number 25 that uh previous day value
area low currently holding. If we lose

792
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
area low currently holding. If we lose
 

793
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,710
area low currently holding. If we lose
that and stay heavy underneath, there is

794
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
that and stay heavy underneath, there is
 

795
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,630
that and stay heavy underneath, there is
potential for a wash down into here. We

796
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
potential for a wash down into here. We
 

797
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,549
potential for a wash down into here. We
don't know, but there's potential for a

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,950
don't know, but there's potential for a
wash down into previous week value area

800
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
wash down into previous week value area
 

801
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,190
wash down into previous week value area
low. So, they're holding dips so far

802
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
low. So, they're holding dips so far
 

803
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,549
low. So, they're holding dips so far
this morning into that um previous day.

into it. If they lose this, we can get

808
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
into it. If they lose this, we can get
 

809
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,070

Certainly some absorption there into
 

877
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,870
Certainly some absorption there into
25s. There we go. So maybe here's

878

933
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,830
0.40% down. Amazon 0.5% down. Here's the
squeeze back up. They're trying to get

934
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
squeeze back up. They're trying to get
 

935
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,070
squeeze back up. They're trying to get
this move back up. So they've held 25s a

936
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
this move back up. So they've held 25s a
 

937
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,270
this move back up. So they've held 25s a
few times. They're going to look for the

938
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
few times. They're going to look for the
 

939
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,750
few times. They're going to look for the
800s here if they can. All right. and

940
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
800s here if they can. All right. and
 

941
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,150
800s here if they can. All right. and
then through 800. They've got a shot at

942
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,160
then through 800. They've got a shot at
 

943
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,310
then through 800. They've got a shot at
moving up towards 850. If they run these

944
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
moving up towards 850. If they run these
 

945
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,870
moving up towards 850. If they run these
stops uh 830, 850, 900. So, here's the

946
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
stops uh 830, 850, 900. So, here's the
 

947
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,549
stops uh 830, 850, 900. So, here's the
squeeze. They held 25s. They're trying

948
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
squeeze. They held 25s. They're trying
 

949
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,149
squeeze. They held 25s. They're trying
to get up to 800. We've pretty much

950
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
to get up to 800. We've pretty much
 

951
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,830
to get up to 800. We've pretty much
tagged it. So, if you took 25s, you

952
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
tagged it. So, if you took 25s, you
 

953
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,149
tagged it. So, if you took 25s, you
should be peeling some off here at 800.

954
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
should be peeling some off here at 800.
 

955
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,909
should be peeling some off here at 800.
And then you should be looking to run

956
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
And then you should be looking to run
 

957
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,470
And then you should be looking to run
the stops at 835 and 850.

958
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
the stops at 835 and 850.
 

959
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,990
the stops at 835 and 850.
I didn't want to take that today on a

960
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
I didn't want to take that today on a
 

961
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,430
I didn't want to take that today on a
Friday, but you could see it was there

962
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
Friday, but you could see it was there
 

963
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,870
Friday, but you could see it was there
and kept dipping and holding the 25s.

964
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
and kept dipping and holding the 25s.
 

965
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,430
and kept dipping and holding the 25s.
So, they hit the 800 previous week point

966
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
So, they hit the 800 previous week point
 

967
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,830
So, they hit the 800 previous week point
of control. Huge, huge level from the

968
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
of control. Huge, huge level from the
 

969
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,549
of control. Huge, huge level from the
previous week.

970
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559

 

971
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,549

Can they get a lift here is what they're

972
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
Can they get a lift here is what they're
 

973
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,350
Can they get a lift here is what they're
asking. Can they lift it?

974
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360
asking. Can they lift it?
 

975
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,270
asking. Can they lift it?
Spy looks a little bit stuck up here at

976
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
Spy looks a little bit stuck up here at
 

977
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,110
Spy looks a little bit stuck up here at
the top of GlobeEx. Let's try it a

978
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
the top of GlobeEx. Let's try it a
 

979
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:23,110
the top of GlobeEx. Let's try it a
couple times.

980
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120

 

981
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,470

Not sure they know what they want to do

982
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
Not sure they know what they want to do
 

983
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,750
Not sure they know what they want to do
with it right now. Don't blame them

984
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:25,760
with it right now. Don't blame them
 

985
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,710
with it right now. Don't blame them
after yesterday was so big.

986
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
after yesterday was so big.
 

987
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,430
after yesterday was so big.
Okay, back down to the 50s and the 25s

988
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
Okay, back down to the 50s and the 25s
 

989
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,789
Okay, back down to the 50s and the 25s
again. So, failing to break out of the

990
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
again. So, failing to break out of the
 

991
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,470
again. So, failing to break out of the
800s rotation all the way back down.

992
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
800s rotation all the way back down.
 

993
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,830
800s rotation all the way back down.
This is what we talked about where the

994
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
This is what we talked about where the
 

995
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,110
This is what we talked about where the
rotation will take place. Why I'm

996
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
rotation will take place. Why I'm
 

997
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,590
rotation will take place. Why I'm
avoiding this right now, waiting to see

998
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
avoiding this right now, waiting to see
 

999
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,430
avoiding this right now, waiting to see
what we do each side of the rotation.

1000
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440

 

1001
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,510

Quick 120 on a micro there. Thank you,

1002
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
Quick 120 on a micro there. Thank you,
 

1003
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,470
Quick 120 on a micro there. Thank you,
sir. You're welcome. Back to the 800s

1004
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
sir. You're welcome. Back to the 800s
 

1005
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,110
sir. You're welcome. Back to the 800s
again. They're going to try.

1006
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
again. They're going to try.
 

1007
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,990
again. They're going to try.
Can they make their mind up? Can we get

1008
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
Can they make their mind up? Can we get
 

1009
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,350
Can they make their mind up? Can we get
something today which is a little bit

1010
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
something today which is a little bit
 

1011
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,190
something today which is a little bit
cleaner? Doesn't look great on the tape

1012
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
cleaner? Doesn't look great on the tape
 

1013
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,870
cleaner? Doesn't look great on the tape
right now.

1014
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880

 

1015
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,630

Big buyers and big sellers down here.

1016
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
Big buyers and big sellers down here.
 

1017
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,470
Big buyers and big sellers down here.
It's not very clean. Just going to let

1018
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
It's not very clean. Just going to let
 

1019
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,390
It's not very clean. Just going to let
them let them figure it out for a

1020
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
them let them figure it out for a
 

1021
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,470
them let them figure it out for a
minute.

1022
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
minute.
 

1023
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:20,789
minute.
Let them figure it out for a minute.

1024
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799

 

1025
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,310

Yeah, we got to understand, guys, we did

1026
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
Yeah, we got to understand, guys, we did
 

1027
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,470
Yeah, we got to understand, guys, we did
a huge bleed yesterday, right? Huge,

1028
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
a huge bleed yesterday, right? Huge,
 

1029
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,789
a huge bleed yesterday, right? Huge,
huge sell yesterday.

1030
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:26,799
huge sell yesterday.
 

1031
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,310
huge sell yesterday.
We're right, we're opening up like if

1032
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
We're right, we're opening up like if
 

1033
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,830
We're right, we're opening up like if
you guys joined me for the pre-market,

1034
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
you guys joined me for the pre-market,
 

1035
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,510
you guys joined me for the pre-market,
we are opening up right on the lower

1036
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
we are opening up right on the lower
 

1037
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,669
we are opening up right on the lower
Ballinger band. Okay, right on the lower

1038
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
Ballinger band. Okay, right on the lower
 

1039
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,149
Ballinger band. Okay, right on the lower
Ballinger band. The only thing left to

1040
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
Ballinger band. The only thing left to
 

1041
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,070
Ballinger band. The only thing left to
go through would be an expansion. We

1042
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
go through would be an expansion. We
 

1043
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,669
go through would be an expansion. We
haven't really given it much time. If

1044
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
haven't really given it much time. If
 

1045
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,669
haven't really given it much time. If
we're going to expand under here now,

1046
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
we're going to expand under here now,
 

1047
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,470
we're going to expand under here now,
then there is a possibility of a move

1048
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
then there is a possibility of a move
 

1049
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,110
then there is a possibility of a move
down to the previous week value area

1050
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,120
down to the previous week value area
 

1051
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,029
down to the previous week value area
low. All right. So, if they stay heavy

1052
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
low. All right. So, if they stay heavy
 

1053
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,630
low. All right. So, if they stay heavy
under here, it would be TP1, TP2. If

1054
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
under here, it would be TP1, TP2. If
 

1055
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,390
under here, it would be TP1, TP2. If
they reclaim it, they will try and go to

1056
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
they reclaim it, they will try and go to
 

1057
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,909
they reclaim it, they will try and go to
here and here again. And we will keep

1058
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
here and here again. And we will keep
 

1059
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,390
here and here again. And we will keep
chopping in this building liquidity. Why

1060
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
chopping in this building liquidity. Why
 

1061
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,750
chopping in this building liquidity. Why
are we building liquidity? Because we've

1062
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
are we building liquidity? Because we've
 

1063
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,350
are we building liquidity? Because we've
done a huge move. Okay, just think about

1064
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
done a huge move. Okay, just think about
 

1065
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,590
done a huge move. Okay, just think about
what we've done already. We've done a

1066
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
what we've done already. We've done a
 

1067
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,870
what we've done already. We've done a
monstrous move. This was a straight

1068
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
monstrous move. This was a straight
 

1069
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,830
monstrous move. This was a straight
sell. This is some form of compression.

1070
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
sell. This is some form of compression.
 

1071
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,549
sell. This is some form of compression.
You cannot rule out this here and a run

1072
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
You cannot rule out this here and a run
 

1073
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,990
You cannot rule out this here and a run
of these stops here. What would be

1074
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
of these stops here. What would be
 

1075
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,149
of these stops here. What would be
better? That that would be better. Might

1076
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
better? That that would be better. Might

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
Small caps acting like a safe haven is
 

1231
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,149
Small caps acting like a safe haven is
crazy. Yeah, they're not. It's not like

1232
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
crazy. Yeah, they're not. It's not like
 

1233
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,149
crazy. Yeah, they're not. It's not like
they're a safe haven. It's just a when

1234
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
they're a safe haven. It's just a when
 

1235
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,590
they're a safe haven. It's just a when
you've got to think, we've talked about

1236
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
you've got to think, we've talked about
 

1237
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,830
you've got to think, we've talked about
this numerous times, right? How much how

1238
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:17,840
this numerous times, right? How much how
 

1239
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,510
this numerous times, right? How much how
big has the tech run been for the last

1240
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
big has the tech run been for the last
 

1241
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,110
big has the tech run been for the last
two, three, four years? It's been

1242
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
two, three, four years? It's been
 

1243
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,350
two, three, four years? It's been
monstrous. Monstrous. All right. So,

1244
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360
monstrous. Monstrous. All right. So,
 

1245
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,430
monstrous. Monstrous. All right. So,
you're seeing profit taking from tech

1246
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
you're seeing profit taking from tech
 

1247
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,230
you're seeing profit taking from tech
rotation out of that into names which

1248
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
rotation out of that into names which
 

1249
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,070
rotation out of that into names which
need to catch up like small caps. They

1250
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
need to catch up like small caps. They
 

1251
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,669
need to catch up like small caps. They
know that they can force some small caps

1252
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
know that they can force some small caps
 

1253
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,230
know that they can force some small caps
up, which is why the RTY is moving,

1254
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
up, which is why the RTY is moving,
 

1255
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,830
up, which is why the RTY is moving,
right? Why you've had like positive

1256
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
right? Why you've had like positive
 

1257
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,149
right? Why you've had like positive
divergence in the RTY. Once they're done

1258
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
divergence in the RTY. Once they're done
 

1259
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,070
divergence in the RTY. Once they're done
with it, you'll see a rotation back into

1260
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
with it, you'll see a rotation back into
 

1261
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,990
with it, you'll see a rotation back into
the mega caps again. It's always the

1262
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,000
the mega caps again. It's always the
 

1263
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,310
the mega caps again. It's always the
same, right? You buy something cheap,

1264
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
same, right? You buy something cheap,
 

1265
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,070
same, right? You buy something cheap,
you pump it up to it's expensive, you

1266
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
you pump it up to it's expensive, you
 

1267
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,510
you pump it up to it's expensive, you
sell it. You buy the other thing cheap,

1268
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:47,520
sell it. You buy the other thing cheap,
 

1269
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,070

TP1 if you took it. Caught monologuing

1278
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
TP1 if you took it. Caught monologuing
 

1279
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,750
TP1 if you took it. Caught monologuing
there. And your next TP is down here

should have just absolutely hammered
 

1293
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,710
should have just absolutely hammered
that at 16s. All right, so TP1 here, if

1294
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
that at 16s. All right, so TP1 here, if
 

1295
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,029
that at 16s. All right, so TP1 here, if
you're short, TP2 is down here, 550s,

1296
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
you're short, TP2 is down here, 550s,
 

1297

you're short, TP2 is down here, 550s,
and then you can hold. All right, if you

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,950
550. There's a big lot down at 500.
There's a huge buyer down at 500 281 lot

1380
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
There's a huge buyer down at 500 281 lot
 

1381
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,350
There's a huge buyer down at 500 281 lot
sat there at the moment. Let's see if I

1382
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
sat there at the moment. Let's see if I
 

1383
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,269
sat there at the moment. Let's see if I
can swipe this lower for you guys at the

1384
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
can swipe this lower for you guys at the
 

1385
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,389
can swipe this lower for you guys at the
moment. Big bleed out. VIX absolutely

1386
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
moment. Big bleed out. VIX absolutely
 

1387
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,149
moment. Big bleed out. VIX absolutely
tearing. This is exactly what we talked

1388
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159
tearing. This is exactly what we talked
 

1389
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,389
tearing. This is exactly what we talked
about pre-market.

1390
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
about pre-market.
 

1391
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,510
about pre-market.
Oh my god, look at this nice like build

1392
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:19,520
Oh my god, look at this nice like build
 

1393
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,669
Oh my god, look at this nice like build
out here with the failing to re reclaim.

1394
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
out here with the failing to re reclaim.
 

1395
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,830
out here with the failing to re reclaim.
That was it. Okay, huge seller coming in

1396
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:23,840
That was it. Okay, huge seller coming in
 

1397
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,669
That was it. Okay, huge seller coming in
here on the tape at 95. Worth

1398
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
here on the tape at 95. Worth
 

1399
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,230
here on the tape at 95. Worth
remembering that number now. you should

1400
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
remembering that number now. you should
 

1401
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,750
remembering that number now. you should
still move lower, but there is a big

1402
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
still move lower, but there is a big
 

1403
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,669
still move lower, but there is a big
seller just came on the tape here at 95.

1404
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
seller just came on the tape here at 95.
 

1405
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,070
seller just came on the tape here at 95.
So above him, there is potential for a

1406
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
So above him, there is potential for a
 

1407
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,750
So above him, there is potential for a
little bit of a retracement up, but I

1408
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:35,760
little bit of a retracement up, but I
 

1409
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,909
little bit of a retracement up, but I
think we are due to move lower overall.

1410
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
think we are due to move lower overall.
 

1411
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,909
think we are due to move lower overall.
But here we go. We're above that that

1412
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
But here we go. We're above that that
 

1413
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,750
But here we go. We're above that that
seller now. Here's the retracement back

1414
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:41,760
seller now. Here's the retracement back
 

1415
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,750
seller now. Here's the retracement back
up into the next seller at 21. So

1416
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:43,760
up into the next seller at 21. So
 

1417
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,470
up into the next seller at 21. So
they're pricing between 95 21s. Here's

1418
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
they're pricing between 95 21s. Here's
 

1419
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,630
they're pricing between 95 21s. Here's
the squeeze back up. All right, here you

1420
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
the squeeze back up. All right, here you
 

1421
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,630
the squeeze back up. All right, here you
go. So that seller getting caught. This

1422
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
go. So that seller getting caught. This
 

1423
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,830
go. So that seller getting caught. This
was just going to be a short-term

1424
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
was just going to be a short-term
 

1425
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,190
was just going to be a short-term
squeeze up. I think they will resell

1426
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
squeeze up. I think they will resell
 

1427
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,870
squeeze up. I think they will resell
this, but it's just about this seller

1428
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
this, but it's just about this seller
 

1429
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,990
this, but it's just about this seller
who got caught into 93s. Again, I can

1430
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
who got caught into 93s. Again, I can
 

1431
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,549
who got caught into 93s. Again, I can
show you here. This guy right here got

1432
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:00,559
show you here. This guy right here got
 

1433
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,149
show you here. This guy right here got
caught and now we're lifting and we're

1434
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
caught and now we're lifting and we're
 

1435
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,190
caught and now we're lifting and we're
going to look for where these other

1436
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200
going to look for where these other
 

1437
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,710
going to look for where these other
sellers came back in. Right, look at

1438
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
sellers came back in. Right, look at
 

1439
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,430
sellers came back in. Right, look at
that lift straight out of it. He did the

1440
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
that lift straight out of it. He did the
 

1441
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,909
that lift straight out of it. He did the
damage. He shorted at the lows. He

1442
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
damage. He shorted at the lows. He
 

1443
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,510
damage. He shorted at the lows. He
shorted at the lows. So, back up to

1444
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:11,520
shorted at the lows. So, back up to
 

1445
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,510
shorted at the lows. So, back up to
value area low here. You have to see if

1446
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:13,520
value area low here. You have to see if
 

1447
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,710
value area low here. You have to see if
you reject this now.

1448
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:16,720
you reject this now.
 

1449
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,789
you reject this now.
See if you reject this now.

1450
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799

 

1451
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,630

Right the way back up. All the way back

1452
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
Right the way back up. All the way back
 

1453
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,029
Right the way back up. All the way back
up. Right the way back up to value. And

1454
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
up. Right the way back up to value. And
 

1455
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,710
up. Right the way back up to value. And
these 20s. Probably if they get back

1456
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
these 20s. Probably if they get back
 

1457
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,190
these 20s. Probably if they get back
over 25, you're going to see us squeeze

1458
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
over 25, you're going to see us squeeze
 

1459
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:42,789
over 25, you're going to see us squeeze
further.

1460
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:42,799

 

1461
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,389

Do they come back down here? They can

1462
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
Do they come back down here? They can
 

1463
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,430
Do they come back down here? They can
retest 20s and 25s if they want. Looking

1464
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440
retest 20s and 25s if they want. Looking
 

1465
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,509
retest 20s and 25s if they want. Looking
for the short. If they do, we'll play

1466
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
for the short. If they do, we'll play
 

1467
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,269
for the short. If they do, we'll play
the long if we reclaim everything. Oh,

1468
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
the long if we reclaim everything. Oh,
 

1469
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,630
the long if we reclaim everything. Oh,
we've just held a bid there at those

1470
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
we've just held a bid there at those
 

1471
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,549
we've just held a bid there at those
sellers at 700. So, we've reclaimed

1472
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
sellers at 700. So, we've reclaimed
 

1473
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,389
sellers at 700. So, we've reclaimed
value.

1474
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
value.
 

1475
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,909
value.
We will see.

1476
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919

 

1477
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,830

Where are we at?

1478
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
Where are we at?
 

1479
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,190
Where are we at?
680s. By reclaiming 680s, they might

1480
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
680s. By reclaiming 680s, they might
 

1481
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,830
680s. By reclaiming 680s, they might
start squeezing here. We get over we

1482
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:07,840
start squeezing here. We get over we
 

1483
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,950
start squeezing here. We get over we
might see a squeeze here. We will see.

1484
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
might see a squeeze here. We will see.
 

1485
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,470
might see a squeeze here. We will see.
Be very aggressive if they get over

1486
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
Be very aggressive if they get over
 

1487
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,389
Be very aggressive if they get over
these 25s. They might absolutely rip

1488
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
these 25s. They might absolutely rip
 

1489
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:23,350
these 25s. They might absolutely rip
some faces.

1490
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360

 

1491
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,710

Come put that. There's the 25s. What

1492
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
Come put that. There's the 25s. What
 

1493
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,430
Come put that. There's the 25s. What
they going to do?

1494
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
they going to do?
 

1495
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,430
they going to do?
Very washy.

1496
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440

 

1497
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,630

What do you want to do, Mark? You going

1498
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
What do you want to do, Mark? You going
 

1499
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,149
What do you want to do, Mark? You going
to reject this and come right back down

1500
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
to reject this and come right back down
 

1501
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,070
to reject this and come right back down
or you going to hold and squeeze up?

1502
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,080
or you going to hold and squeeze up?
 

1503
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,909
or you going to hold and squeeze up?
Right in the middle of this range.

1504
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:41,919
Right in the middle of this range.
 

1505
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,149
Right in the middle of this range.
Squeeze up. It is then. Here's the

1506
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
Squeeze up. It is then. Here's the
 

1507
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,750
Squeeze up. It is then. Here's the
squeeze.

1508
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
squeeze.
 

1509
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,549
squeeze.
[\h__\h] me. Can't do much with this.

1510
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
[\h__\h] me. Can't do much with this.
 

1511
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,549
[\h__\h] me. Can't do much with this.
Cannot do much with this right now.

1512
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:54,559

 

1513
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,310

This is just the options market more

1514
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,320
This is just the options market more
 

1515
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,830
This is just the options market more
than anything else here by the looks of

1516
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:57,840
than anything else here by the looks of
 

1517
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,190
than anything else here by the looks of
it to me. Straight down. Straight back

1518
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
it to me. Straight down. Straight back
 

1519
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,549
it to me. Straight down. Straight back
up because that player got caught

1520
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
up because that player got caught
 

1521
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,070
up because that player got caught
straight into these trap buyers here at

1522
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,080
straight into these trap buyers here at
 

1523
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,549
straight into these trap buyers here at
50s. Now

1524
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559

 

1525
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,990

we might keep going here. Oh my god.

1526
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
we might keep going here. Oh my god.
 

1527
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,750
we might keep going here. Oh my god.
It's missed the play down. Misses a play

1528
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:13,760
It's missed the play down. Misses a play
 

1529
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,909
It's missed the play down. Misses a play
up. He's not with it today, that's for

1530
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:15,919
up. He's not with it today, that's for
 

1531
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,509
up. He's not with it today, that's for

Point of control is possible now. And
 

1537
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,190
Point of control is possible now. And
then through that, we can get going as

1538
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,200
then through that, we can get going as
 

1539
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,389
then through that, we can get going as
well. All the way up to 50s. So up here,

see if they hold sort of 25s. Otherwise,

1544
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
see if they hold sort of 25s. Otherwise,
 

1545
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,830
see if they hold sort of 25s. Otherwise,
I can't do anything. They're just going

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:33,840
I can't do anything. They're just going
 

1547
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,190
I can't do anything. They're just going

1548
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
to rip it. Oh my god, man.
 

1549
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,789

Right off that trap player.
Oh, they are on a mega squeeze.

00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:00,720

 

1557
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,870

1603
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,069

825s. Let's get through this and go

1604
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
825s. Let's get through this and go
 

1605
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,910
825s. Let's get through this and go
850s. Let's get through this and go

1606

Through the 25 [\h__\h] sake.

1610
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
Through the 25 [\h__\h] sake.
 

1611
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,710
Through the 25 [\h__\h] sake.
320 lot here. If we get through that, we

1612
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
320 lot here. If we get through that, we
 

1613
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,829
320 lot here. If we get through that, we
should see a little squeeze through.

1614
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:37,839
should see a little squeeze through.
 

1615
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,950
should see a little squeeze through.
Come on.

1616
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960

 

1617
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,510

There we go. Yeah, there we go. There's

40s. Can we get 50s? Here we go, folks.
 

1621
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,870

But me finally getting something. And

1622
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:48,880
But me finally getting something. And
 

1623
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,470
But me finally getting something. And
then we look look for 900s. We're going

1624
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,480
then we look look for 900s. We're going
 

1625
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,310
then we look look for 900s. We're going
to trim up here. Pay myself some into

1626
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
to trim up here. Pay myself some into
 

1627
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,910
to trim up here. Pay myself some into
this level here into the gray box and

1628
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:53,920
this level here into the gray box and
 

1629
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,190
this level here into the gray box and
then see if we can get 900s now. What a

1630
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,200
then see if we can get 900s now. What a
 

1631
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,750
then see if we can get 900s now. What a
[\h__\h] rip, man. Oh my god. If I just

1632
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,760
[\h__\h] rip, man. Oh my god. If I just
 

1633
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,430
[\h__\h] rip, man. Oh my god. If I just
entered where that player was trapped at

1634
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
entered where that player was trapped at
 

1635
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,190
entered where that player was trapped at
the bottom, we would be up huge,

1636
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,200
the bottom, we would be up huge,
 

1637
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,310
the bottom, we would be up huge,
wouldn't we? Here we go. 50s now. All

1638
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
wouldn't we? Here we go. 50s now. All
 

1639
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,950
wouldn't we? Here we go. 50s now. All
right. Small piece left and we'll see if

1640
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
right. Small piece left and we'll see if
 

1641
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:19,190
right. Small piece left and we'll see if
we get 900s.

1642
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,200

 

1643
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:31,589

Other

1644
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:31,599

 

1645
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,430

right into the 50s. That might be it. If

1646
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
right into the 50s. That might be it. If
 

1647
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,870
right into the 50s. That might be it. If
it can't get 900s, I'll cut the rest.

1648
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:40,880

 

1649
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,349

If we get 350s, I'm looking for 900s.

1650
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:43,359
If we get 350s, I'm looking for 900s.
 

1651
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,069
If we get 350s, I'm looking for 900s.
Then we can really get going.

1652
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
Then we can really get going.
 

1653
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,990
Then we can really get going.
We still haven't tested 25 since we

1654
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,000
We still haven't tested 25 since we
 

1655
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,109
We still haven't tested 25 since we
broke back over it. I'll say that much.

1656
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
broke back over it. I'll say that much.
 

1657
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,990
broke back over it. I'll say that much.
If we drop below 80 here, I'm out. It's

1658
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,000
If we drop below 80 here, I'm out. It's
 

1659
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,990
If we drop below 80 here, I'm out. It's
where the sellers got stuck at 80.

1660
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000

 

1661
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,750

How do I maintain sanity when I miss the

1662
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:05,760
How do I maintain sanity when I miss the
 

1663
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,109
How do I maintain sanity when I miss the
moves? Well, I mean, there's not much I

1664
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:07,119
moves? Well, I mean, there's not much I
 

1665
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,230
moves? Well, I mean, there's not much I
can do. I mean, I would have had to be

1666
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,240
can do. I mean, I would have had to be
 

1667
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,829
can do. I mean, I would have had to be
so quick once we saw the seller down

1668
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
so quick once we saw the seller down
 

1669
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,349
so quick once we saw the seller down
here. It's a big buyers just got stuck

1670
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:11,359
here. It's a big buyers just got stuck
 

1671
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,190
here. It's a big buyers just got stuck
up top now, right? Once I saw this

1672
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
up top now, right? Once I saw this
 

1673
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,550
up top now, right? Once I saw this
seller down here, I would have just had

1674
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:14,560
seller down here, I would have just had
 

1675
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,710
seller down here, I would have just had
to enter long off no structure and we

1676
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:16,720
to enter long off no structure and we
 

1677
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,630
to enter long off no structure and we
should have really come down into here,

1678
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:18,640
should have really come down into here,
 

1679
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,870
should have really come down into here,
right? So, we didn't get we missed it.

1680
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:20,880
right? So, we didn't get we missed it.
 

1681
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,030
right? So, we didn't get we missed it.
So, it's very hard. Needed a 50 more. If

1682
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,040
So, it's very hard. Needed a 50 more. If
 

1683
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,430
So, it's very hard. Needed a 50 more. If
we done a break of of a previous week

1684
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,440
we done a break of of a previous week
 

1685
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,030
we done a break of of a previous week
value area low, if we'd come here and

1686
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
value area low, if we'd come here and
 

1687
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,550
value area low, if we'd come here and
then reclaimed, I would have been happy

1688
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:28,560
then reclaimed, I would have been happy
 

1689
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,390
then reclaimed, I would have been happy
to long at the bottom. But just a dip

1690
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
to long at the bottom. But just a dip
 

1691
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,069
to long at the bottom. But just a dip
and rip like that and now stuck into the

1692
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:32,079
and rip like that and now stuck into the
 

1693
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,550
and rip like that and now stuck into the
50s. Look at the 50s, right? Big big

1694
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,560
50s. Look at the 50s, right? Big big
 

1695
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,390
50s. Look at the 50s, right? Big big
buyer now. Stuck at 24. So, we're

1696
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
buyer now. Stuck at 24. So, we're
 

1697
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,829
buyer now. Stuck at 24. So, we're
probably going to come back down and

1698
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
probably going to come back down and
 

1699
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,069
probably going to come back down and
test these 20s again. It's messy. It's

1700
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079
test these 20s again. It's messy. It's
 

1701
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,630
test these 20s again. It's messy. It's
very messy. I'm out now, folks, because

1702
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
very messy. I'm out now, folks, because
 

1703
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,750
very messy. I'm out now, folks, because
it's probably going to come back to the

1704
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760
it's probably going to come back to the
 

1705
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,630
it's probably going to come back to the
25s again.

1706
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:48,640

 

1707
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,870

I have to see if they bid 25s now or

1708
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:50,880
I have to see if they bid 25s now or
 

1709
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,230
I have to see if they bid 25s now or
somewhere around there. And if they

1710
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,240
somewhere around there. And if they
 

1711
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,069
somewhere around there. And if they
don't, we might wash all the way back

1712
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
don't, we might wash all the way back
 

1713
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,990
don't, we might wash all the way back
down and finish the auction down here,

1714
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
down and finish the auction down here,
 

1715
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,349
down and finish the auction down here,
right? We might come all the way back

1716
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
right? We might come all the way back
 

1717
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,349
right? We might come all the way back
down here if they don't hold these sort

1718
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359
down here if they don't hold these sort
 

1719
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,750
down here if they don't hold these sort
of 20s, 25s because we're very thin up,

1720
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
of 20s, 25s because we're very thin up,
 

1721
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,349
of 20s, 25s because we're very thin up,
aren't we? Very, very, very thin up. So,

1722
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
aren't we? Very, very, very thin up. So,
 

1723
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,710
aren't we? Very, very, very thin up. So,
they need to bid here and bid now.

1724
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:06,720
they need to bid here and bid now.
 

1725
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,910
they need to bid here and bid now.
Otherwise, we're probably going to go

1726
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
Otherwise, we're probably going to go
 

1727
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,910
Otherwise, we're probably going to go
low of day.

1728
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:09,920
low of day.
 

1729
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:17,430
low of day.
Watching this.

1730
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,440

 

1731
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,390

No, they're not bidding. Not yet.

1732
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,400
No, they're not bidding. Not yet.
 

1733
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,230
No, they're not bidding. Not yet.
It might go lower day here folks. This

1734
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
It might go lower day here folks. This
 

1735
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:31,190
It might go lower day here folks. This
is awful. You reclaim 25s.

1736
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,200

 

1737
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,310

What is this market? What are we doing?

1738
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
What is this market? What are we doing?
 

1739
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,670
What is this market? What are we doing?
What do you want to do market?

1740
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
What do you want to do market?
 

1741
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,150
What do you want to do market?
If they bid here, they might retest 80s.

1742
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
If they bid here, they might retest 80s.
 

1743
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,710
If they bid here, they might retest 80s.
It is terrible both ways though in back

1744
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
It is terrible both ways though in back
 

1745
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,589
It is terrible both ways though in back
inside the orb. It's not uh not an A+

1746
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
inside the orb. It's not uh not an A+
 

1747
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,109
inside the orb. It's not uh not an A+
setup, is it? they lose this, we're

1748
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:49,119
setup, is it? they lose this, we're
 

1749
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,390
setup, is it? they lose this, we're
going to probably go back to the low of

1750
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
going to probably go back to the low of
 

1751
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,390
going to probably go back to the low of
day, back towards where that seller was

1752
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,400
day, back towards where that seller was
 

1753
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,950
day, back towards where that seller was
stuck at 90. What was it? 592.

1754
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:56,960
stuck at 90. What was it? 592.
 

1755
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,150
stuck at 90. What was it? 592.
So, you got to make a decision. We're

1756
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
So, you got to make a decision. We're
 

1757
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,550
So, you got to make a decision. We're
right in the middle. We are right in the

1758
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:00,560
right in the middle. We are right in the
 

1759
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:18,950
right in the middle. We are right in the
middle right now.

1760
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960

 

1761
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,470

It just feels like they don't know what

1762
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,480
It just feels like they don't know what
 

1763
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,470
It just feels like they don't know what
to do. They're like, "We should sell,

1764
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:22,480
to do. They're like, "We should sell,
 

1765
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,550
to do. They're like, "We should sell,
but you know, we're really extended. We

1766
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
but you know, we're really extended. We
 

1767
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,310
but you know, we're really extended. We
don't want to sell. We want to push up

1768
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,320
don't want to sell. We want to push up
 

1769
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,589
don't want to sell. We want to push up
before we sell." Okay, they're trying to

1770
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
before we sell." Okay, they're trying to
 

1771
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,390
before we sell." Okay, they're trying to
rebid 25s here now. How much of a

1772
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,400
rebid 25s here now. How much of a
 

1773
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,829
rebid 25s here now. How much of a
squeeze can they go? Can they go back to

1774
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:31,839
squeeze can they go? Can they go back to
 

1775
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,750
squeeze can they go? Can they go back to
80s if we're going to join this? I need

1776
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760
80s if we're going to join this? I need
 

1777
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,190
80s if we're going to join this? I need
to get it over the New York Open and see

1778
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,200
to get it over the New York Open and see
 

1779
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,790
to get it over the New York Open and see
if we want to go back to 80s if I'm

1780
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:36,800
if we want to go back to 80s if I'm
 

1781
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,550
if we want to go back to 80s if I'm
going to play.

1782
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:38,560
going to play.
 

1783
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,190
going to play.
And we have to trim some at 80s. Oh, I

1784
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
And we have to trim some at 80s. Oh, I
 

1785
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,270
And we have to trim some at 80s. Oh, I
got stuck there at 50s. Can't play. Not

1786
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,280
got stuck there at 50s. Can't play. Not
 

1787
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,829
got stuck there at 50s. Can't play. Not
over that New York open.

1788
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
over that New York open.
 

1789
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,710
over that New York open.
Still waiting

1790
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:52,720

 

1791
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,790

back underneath now. I think this just

1792
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:54,800
back underneath now. I think this just
 

1793
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,670
back underneath now. I think this just
needs to be leave alone for a bit. I

1794
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:57,680
needs to be leave alone for a bit. I
 

1795
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,870
needs to be leave alone for a bit. I
don't think they know what they want to

1796
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880
don't think they know what they want to
 

1797
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:06,550
don't think they know what they want to
do.

1798
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,560

 

1799
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,470

So, we got a big buyer stuck at uh 8.

1800
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
So, we got a big buyer stuck at uh 8.
 

1801
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,230
So, we got a big buyer stuck at uh 8.
What's his actual level? 825

1802
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240
What's his actual level? 825
 

1803
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,230
What's his actual level? 825
and we've got a big seller stuck at 593.

1804
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240

 

1805
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,230

How mad's that the volatility 593 825 in

1806
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,240
How mad's that the volatility 593 825 in
 

1807
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,630
How mad's that the volatility 593 825 in
one two 3 minutes we did that rip. So we

1808
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:26,640
one two 3 minutes we did that rip. So we
 

1809
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,630
one two 3 minutes we did that rip. So we
got buyer stuck up here, seller stuck

1810
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:28,640
got buyer stuck up here, seller stuck
 

1811
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,230
got buyer stuck up here, seller stuck
down here and we're just going between

1812
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
down here and we're just going between
 

1813
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,910
down here and we're just going between
the two and they do not know what they

1814
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:31,920
the two and they do not know what they
 

1815
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:40,790
the two and they do not know what they
want to do with it right now.

1816
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800

 

1817
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,950

Okay. Well, don't drink, but I will have

1818
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
Okay. Well, don't drink, but I will have
 

1819
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,470
Okay. Well, don't drink, but I will have
to do it after stream. I can't do it

1820
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
to do it after stream. I can't do it
 

1821
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:52,470
to do it after stream. I can't do it
right now, my friend.

1822
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:52,480

 

1823
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,230

Back over 25. They're going to revisit

1824
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
Back over 25. They're going to revisit
 

1825
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,710
Back over 25. They're going to revisit
the 80s now. Do they sell 80s now is the

1826
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
the 80s now. Do they sell 80s now is the
 

1827
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,750
the 80s now. Do they sell 80s now is the
question. It's very hard to do anything

1828
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
question. It's very hard to do anything
 

1829
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,069
question. It's very hard to do anything
here.

1830
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
here.
 

1831
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,829
here.
So, back to the 80s. This is where all

1832
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:03,839
So, back to the 80s. This is where all
 

1833
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,430
So, back to the 80s. This is where all
the sellers came in, right? So, if

1834
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,440
the sellers came in, right? So, if
 

1835
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,950
the sellers came in, right? So, if
sellers want to defend this, they're

1836
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
sellers want to defend this, they're
 

1837
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,309
sellers want to defend this, they're
going to try and set a lower high. If

1838
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:08,319
going to try and set a lower high. If
 

1839
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,230
going to try and set a lower high. If
not, then we can see that move back over

1840
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,240
not, then we can see that move back over
 

1841
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,390
not, then we can see that move back over
850 to 900. Remember that buyer is stuck

1842
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:12,400
850 to 900. Remember that buyer is stuck
 

1843
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,710
850 to 900. Remember that buyer is stuck
up there currently. So, we go back to

1844
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,720
up there currently. So, we go back to
 

1845
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,710
up there currently. So, we go back to
these 80s like we talked about. 25 to

1846
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:16,720
these 80s like we talked about. 25 to
 

1847
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,349
these 80s like we talked about. 25 to
80s is the rotation.

1848
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:23,359

 

1849
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,430

And they sold 80s. Surprise, surprise.

1850
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
And they sold 80s. Surprise, surprise.
 

1851
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,109
And they sold 80s. Surprise, surprise.
And we go back down. Right? So, we just

1852
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119
And we go back down. Right? So, we just
 

1853
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,270
And we go back down. Right? So, we just
talked about this, didn't we? 25 to 80s.

1854
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
talked about this, didn't we? 25 to 80s.
 

1855
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,589
talked about this, didn't we? 25 to 80s.
They literally just hit 80 and they come

1856
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:31,599
They literally just hit 80 and they come
 

1857
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,069
They literally just hit 80 and they come
back down to 25s. They don't know what

1858
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
back down to 25s. They don't know what
 

1859
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,349
back down to 25s. They don't know what
they want to do, folks. I can tell you

1860
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359

00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:45,520
time that I need to get a coffee.

We are literally right where we opened.
 

1891
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,270
We are literally right where we opened.
Nothing's changed. If you're wondering

1892
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280
Nothing's changed. If you're wondering
 

1893
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,870
Nothing's changed. If you're wondering
why I'm still right now, we're right

1895
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,550

where we open. Look at this huge node

1896
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:34,560
where we open. Look at this huge node
 

1897
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,430
where we open. Look at this huge node
developing.

1898
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
developing.
 

1899
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:48,870
developing.
We're not moving. We are pinned.

1900
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:48,880

 

1901
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,950

Coming back up to this 70 level. They're

1902
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:50,960
Coming back up to this 70 level. They're
 

1903
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,470
Coming back up to this 70 level. They're
trying to get this buyer out. There's a

1904
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
trying to get this buyer out. There's a
 

1905
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,390
trying to get this buyer out. There's a
new buyer coming in at 70. Got caught.

1906
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:54,400
new buyer coming in at 70. Got caught.
 

1907
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,430
new buyer coming in at 70. Got caught.
And now lifting to the 800s again. Are

1908
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:57,440
And now lifting to the 800s again. Are
 

1909
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,710
And now lifting to the 800s again. Are
they going to squeeze through this and

1910
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:58,720
they going to squeeze through this and
 

1911
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,910
they going to squeeze through this and
let this guy out at the high of day

1912
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:03,920

 

1913
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:15,109

82 here on SPY big level

1914
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119

 

1915
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,390

where you have to be so patient.

1916
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,400

 

1917
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,790

800s.

1918
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:24,800
800s.
 

1919
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,430
800s.
It's by 82. Can't get through 82.

1920
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:29,440
It's by 82. Can't get through 82.
 

1921
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,109
It's by 82. Can't get through 82.
If we look above, that's failed so far

1922
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
If we look above, that's failed so far
 

1923
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:41,430
If we look above, that's failed so far
this morning. 800s again.

1924
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:41,440

 

1925
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,030

Remember, there is a buyer caught up

1926
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
Remember, there is a buyer caught up
 

1927
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,750
Remember, there is a buyer caught up
here at 824.

1928
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:45,760
here at 824.
 

1929
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,710
here at 824.
The other buyer was at 770s. So, if they

1930
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
The other buyer was at 770s. So, if they
 

1931
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,950
The other buyer was at 770s. So, if they
stay above 770s, he's got a shot. This

1932
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:50,960
stay above 770s, he's got a shot. This
 

1933
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,150
stay above 770s, he's got a shot. This
is what we're testing now. They're

1934
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,160
is what we're testing now. They're
 

1935
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,990
is what we're testing now. They're
testing that buyer at 770 saying, "Do

1936
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:54,000
testing that buyer at 770 saying, "Do
 

1937
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:06,309
testing that buyer at 770 saying, "Do
you want more or not?

1938
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319

 

1939
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,510

Trying to see if he's going to come in

1940
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,520
Trying to see if he's going to come in
 

1941
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,150
Trying to see if he's going to come in
or not here. Doesn't look like it. If

1942
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,160
or not here. Doesn't look like it. If
 

1943
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,910
or not here. Doesn't look like it. If
not, we're going 25s again.

1944
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920

 

1945
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,030

50s and 25s again. Oh, there's no market

1946
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,040
50s and 25s again. Oh, there's no market
 

1947
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,710
50s and 25s again. Oh, there's no market
to play here, guys. You can't play this.

1948
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:20,720
to play here, guys. You can't play this.
 

1949
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,349
to play here, guys. You can't play this.
Well, I can't play this. Or I'm not

1950
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
Well, I can't play this. Or I'm not
 

1951
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,790
Well, I can't play this. Or I'm not
willing to play this is a better way of

1952
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:24,800
willing to play this is a better way of
 

1953
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,550
willing to play this is a better way of
putting it, I guess. Back to the 25s

1954
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:26,560
putting it, I guess. Back to the 25s
 

1955
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,630
putting it, I guess. Back to the 25s
again. Are we going to sell all the way

1956
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:28,640
again. Are we going to sell all the way
 

1957
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,270
again. Are we going to sell all the way
down now? [\h__\h] me. How are you supposed

1958
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,280
down now? [\h__\h] me. How are you supposed
 

1959
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,950
down now? [\h__\h] me. How are you supposed
to do anything with this when they don't

1960
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
to do anything with this when they don't
 

1961
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,309
to do anything with this when they don't
know what they want to do?

1962
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,319
know what they want to do?
 

1963
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,750
know what they want to do?
Sell through then. If you're going to do

1964
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
Sell through then. If you're going to do
 

1965
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,430
Sell through then. If you're going to do
it, you might as well sell all the way

1966
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:39,440
it, you might as well sell all the way
 

1967
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,710
it, you might as well sell all the way
through. Are you going to just rip all

1968
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:40,720
through. Are you going to just rip all
 

1969
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,069
through. Are you going to just rip all
the way back up again now because you

1970
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
the way back up again now because you
 

1971
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,349
the way back up again now because you
guys don't know what to do? Yeah,

1972
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
guys don't know what to do? Yeah,
 

1973
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,710
guys don't know what to do? Yeah,
probably. [\h__\h] hell. This is a weird

1974
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:46,720
probably. [\h__\h] hell. This is a weird
 

1975
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,870
probably. [\h__\h] hell. This is a weird
Friday, that's for sure.

1976
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880

 

1977
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,950

So, back to the 25s again. Are they

1978
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:52,960
So, back to the 25s again. Are they
 

1979
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,230
So, back to the 25s again. Are they
going to make a decision now if they're

1980
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,240

2223
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,510

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,750
stuck at 70. Cannot get through that
buyer. Every time we popped up to to

2242
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:43,760
buyer. Every time we popped up to to
 

2243
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,990
buyer. Every time we popped up to to
him, he's sold. And we keep rebidding

down to 87s. If they lose 87s, they're

2250
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,870
Oh, trapping buyers and sellers. Yeah,
well, it's just when aggressive

2292
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:14,880
well, it's just when aggressive
 

2293
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,190
well, it's just when aggressive
participants come in at the extremes.

2294
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:17,200
participants come in at the extremes.
 

2295
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,790
participants come in at the extremes.
All right. So, if you think about this

2296
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:18,800
All right. So, if you think about this
 

2297
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,870
All right. So, if you think about this
morning when we sold off at the low of

2298
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
morning when we sold off at the low of
 

2299
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,030
morning when we sold off at the low of
day here, we had a huge seller come in

2300
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,040
day here, we had a huge seller come in
 

2301
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,710
day here, we had a huge seller come in
and we didn't move lower. So, when we

2302
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
and we didn't move lower. So, when we
 

2303
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,950
and we didn't move lower. So, when we
move above his point, he starts stopping

2304
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:26,960
move above his point, he starts stopping
 

2305
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,549
move above his point, he starts stopping
out causing the squeeze. When we came up

2306
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:28,559
out causing the squeeze. When we came up
 

2307
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,190
out causing the squeeze. When we came up
to the high of day, we had a 292 lot

2308
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200
to the high of day, we had a 292 lot
 

2309
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,829
to the high of day, we had a 292 lot
buyer come in. We don't move higher. He

2310
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
buyer come in. We don't move higher. He
 

2311
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,589
buyer come in. We don't move higher. He
gets caught buying the high of day. So,

2312
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:35,599
gets caught buying the high of day. So,
 

2313
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,349
gets caught buying the high of day. So,
when we start washing, he starts

2314
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
when we start washing, he starts
 

2315
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,870
when we start washing, he starts
stopping out, which means we get sell

2316
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:38,880
stopping out, which means we get sell
 

2317
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,549
stopping out, which means we get sell
pressure. Now, we're just pinned. We're

2318
00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:40,559
pressure. Now, we're just pinned. We're
 

2319
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:49,430
pressure. Now, we're just pinned. We're
absolutely pinned.

2320
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440

 

2321
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,549

Look at that. Byron sending five gift

2322
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
Look at that. Byron sending five gift
 

2323
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,230
Look at that. Byron sending five gift
memberships. That's very kind of you.

2324
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
memberships. That's very kind of you.
 

2325
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,309
memberships. That's very kind of you.
Thank you, Byron. Well done all of those

2326
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:56,319
Thank you, Byron. Well done all of those
 

2327
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,390
Thank you, Byron. Well done all of those
who just got it.

2328
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:58,400
who just got it.
 

2329
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,990
who just got it.
I explain the nodes. It's just an area

2330
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,000
I explain the nodes. It's just an area
 

2331
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,990
I explain the nodes. It's just an area
of high volume. It's just where where

2332
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:02,000
of high volume. It's just where where
 

2333
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,670
of high volume. It's just where where
we're building out a lot of high volume.

2334
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:03,680
we're building out a lot of high volume.
 

2335
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,589
we're building out a lot of high volume.
So this is current value area high on

2336
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:05,599
So this is current value area high on
 

2337
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,750
So this is current value area high on
the day, value area low on the day,

2338
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
the day, value area low on the day,
 

2339
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,670
the day, value area low on the day,
point of control on the day. And this is

2340
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:09,680
point of control on the day. And this is
 

2341
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,069
point of control on the day. And this is
the rotation. You can see we are not

2342
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:12,079
the rotation. You can see we are not
 

2343
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,630
the rotation. You can see we are not
finding acceptance outside of this. We

2344
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:14,640
finding acceptance outside of this. We
 

2345
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,950
finding acceptance outside of this. We
are building liquidity. We will abuse

2346
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:16,960
are building liquidity. We will abuse
 

2347
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,270
are building liquidity. We will abuse
everyone in here later. Whether I'm here

2348
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:19,280
everyone in here later. Whether I'm here
 

2349
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,349
everyone in here later. Whether I'm here
for that or not is another thing, but

2350
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:21,359
for that or not is another thing, but
 

2351
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,790
for that or not is another thing, but
that's what we're doing. We're chopping

2352
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:22,800
that's what we're doing. We're chopping
 

2353
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:37,910
that's what we're doing. We're chopping
in that range.

2354
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920

 

2355
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,670

What's the EMA with the buy cell? It's

2356
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,680
What's the EMA with the buy cell? It's
 

2357
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,230
What's the EMA with the buy cell? It's
the flow zone pro. It's right here. But

2358
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
the flow zone pro. It's right here. But
 

2359
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,750
the flow zone pro. It's right here. But
I ignore those when we're going

2360
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
I ignore those when we're going
 

2361
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,430
I ignore those when we're going
sideways. Look, the flow zones are flat

2362
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
sideways. Look, the flow zones are flat
 

2363
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,390
sideways. Look, the flow zones are flat
right now. So, back to 770 again where

2364
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:50,400
right now. So, back to 770 again where
 

2365
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,069
right now. So, back to 770 again where
this buyer keeps getting caught. If they

2366
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
this buyer keeps getting caught. If they
 

2367
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,829
this buyer keeps getting caught. If they
get acceptance through this, they can

2368
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:53,839
get acceptance through this, they can
 

2369
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,510
get acceptance through this, they can
try and lift to value area high. If they

2370
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
try and lift to value area high. If they
 

2371
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,950
try and lift to value area high. If they
get through value area high, they will

2372
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
get through value area high, they will
 

2373
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,150
get through value area high, they will
lift to 823s. At the moment, they can't

2374
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,160
lift to 823s. At the moment, they can't
 

2375
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,710
lift to 823s. At the moment, they can't
get through the guy at 770. They keep

2376
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
get through the guy at 770. They keep
 

2377
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,789
get through the guy at 770. They keep
trying, but they can't get through it.

2378
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:04,799
trying, but they can't get through it.
 

2379
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,630
trying, but they can't get through it.
If they get through it, then yeah, you

2380
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640
If they get through it, then yeah, you
 

2381
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,190
If they get through it, then yeah, you
can watch maybe 90s.

2382
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
can watch maybe 90s.
 

2383
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,870
can watch maybe 90s.
So 770, we have a buyer stuck. Over that

2384
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:12,880
So 770, we have a buyer stuck. Over that
 

2385
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,789
So 770, we have a buyer stuck. Over that
we go 90s. So they're trying to get over

2386
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:14,799
we go 90s. So they're trying to get over
 

2387
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,870
we go 90s. So they're trying to get over
it now. Still can't get over it, right?

2388
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:16,880
it now. Still can't get over it, right?
 

2389
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:25,990
it now. Still can't get over it, right?
They just wick over instant sell.

2390
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000

 

2391
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,430

Here's the 90s. All right, let's see.

2392
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
Here's the 90s. All right, let's see.
 

2393
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,270
Here's the 90s. All right, let's see.
Are you guys going to do something fun

2394
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
Are you guys going to do something fun
 

2395
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,510
Are you guys going to do something fun
here?

2396
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:33,520
here?
 

2397
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,910
here?
70 to 90. Watching this high now. Now,

2398
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920
70 to 90. Watching this high now. Now,
 

2399
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,710
70 to 90. Watching this high now. Now,
do we start squeezing? Yes, we are.

2400
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
do we start squeezing? Yes, we are.
 

2401
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,829
do we start squeezing? Yes, we are.
Imbalances up here into 800s again. It's

2402
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:41,839
Imbalances up here into 800s again. It's
 

2403
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,549
Imbalances up here into 800s again. It's
a big level, the 800s.

2404
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:44,559
a big level, the 800s.
 

2405
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,109
a big level, the 800s.
So, they've got to now rebid 770. If

2406
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:47,119
So, they've got to now rebid 770. If
 

2407
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,430
So, they've got to now rebid 770. If
they rebid 770,

2408
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
they rebid 770,
 

2409
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,750
they rebid 770,
maybe I'm interested in a lift or in

2410
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,760
maybe I'm interested in a lift or in
 

2411
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,549
maybe I'm interested in a lift or in
front of 770 and then a break of 800 and

2412
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:54,559
front of 770 and then a break of 800 and
 

2413
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,069
front of 770 and then a break of 800 and
then we will have to take some partials

2414
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:56,079
then we will have to take some partials
 

2415
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,349
then we will have to take some partials
in front of 825.

2416
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:01,359

 

2417
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,829

So there's a 770 rebid. You just see it

2418
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:03,839
So there's a 770 rebid. You just see it
 

2419
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,789
So there's a 770 rebid. You just see it
come down and rebid 770. So let's see

2420
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:06,799
come down and rebid 770. So let's see
 

2421
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,230
come down and rebid 770. So let's see
now. Can they get above 800 or not? If

2422
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
now. Can they get above 800 or not? If
 

2423
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,670
now. Can they get above 800 or not? If
you took this, I'd put your stop break

2424
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:11,680
you took this, I'd put your stop break
 

2425
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,910
you took this, I'd put your stop break
even at 770 straight away.

2426
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920

 

2427
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,150

800. Here we go, folks. Right, we need

2428
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
800. Here we go, folks. Right, we need
 

2429
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,870
800. Here we go, folks. Right, we need
to get up into 20s. Right, I will sell

2430
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
to get up into 20s. Right, I will sell
 

2431
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,990
to get up into 20s. Right, I will sell
some here in front of 20s

2432
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000

 

2433
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,109

cuz we know that buyer is stuck at 825.

2434
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
cuz we know that buyer is stuck at 825.
 

2435
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,789
cuz we know that buyer is stuck at 825.
So, we get above 825, we've got to

2436
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:34,799
So, we get above 825, we've got to
 

2437
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,270
So, we get above 825, we've got to
squeeze up to 850s,

2438
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:37,280
squeeze up to 850s,

01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,520
them do all this nonsense. Took the
 

2589
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,910
them do all this nonsense. Took the
entry. Got the partial. And then it

2590
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:11,920
entry. Got the partial. And then it
 

2591
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,309
entry. Got the partial. And then it
wicks me out. And what we're looking for

2592
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:14,319
wicks me out. And what we're looking for
 

2593
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,230
wicks me out. And what we're looking for
now is here 850 and then 900. All right.

2594
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
now is here 850 and then 900. All right.
 

2595
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,069
now is here 850 and then 900. All right.

You're looking for this into here if it

2600
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:24,400
You're looking for this into here if it
 

2601
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,870
You're looking for this into here if it
will go. But you must be aggressive

2602
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
will go. But you must be aggressive
 

2603
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,190
will go. But you must be aggressive
taking profit today. This is not a day

2604
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:29,200
taking profit today. This is not a day
 

2605
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,430
taking profit today. This is not a day
to just hold on.

2606
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:33,440

 

2607
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,069

I don't do it based on points, folks.

2608
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:36,079
I don't do it based on points, folks.
 

2609
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,910
I don't do it based on points, folks.
Okay? I don't do my stop loss based on

2610
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:37,920
Okay? I don't do my stop loss based on
 

2611
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,589
Okay? I don't do my stop loss based on
points. I do it based on where I think

2612
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
points. I do it based on where I think
 

2613
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,349
points. I do it based on where I think
the trade is no longer valid. For me,

2614
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:41,359
the trade is no longer valid. For me,
 

2615
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,309
the trade is no longer valid. For me,
the trade was no longer valid if we got

2616
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:44,319
the trade was no longer valid if we got
 

2617
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,549
the trade was no longer valid if we got
under 70, which we did. It just stopped

2618
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:46,559
under 70, which we did. It just stopped
 

2619
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,109
under 70, which we did. It just stopped
me out by five points.

2620
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:49,119
me out by five points.
 

2621
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,630
me out by five points.
What are you going to do? It's volatile

2622
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:50,640
What are you going to do? It's volatile
 

2623
01:01:50,640 --> 01:02:02,390
What are you going to do? It's volatile
market.

2624
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400

 

2625
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,710

Vo shifted up here. Now, you really want

2626
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:04,720
Vo shifted up here. Now, you really want
 

2627
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,309
Vo shifted up here. Now, you really want
to see them hold the bid of 800 and

2628
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:06,319
to see them hold the bid of 800 and
 

2629
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:07,510
to see them hold the bid of 800 and
around there. Otherwise, you're going to

2630
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:07,520
around there. Otherwise, you're going to
 

2631
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,349
around there. Otherwise, you're going to
get a slide back down to 70 again, and

2632
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
get a slide back down to 70 again, and
 

2633
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,390
get a slide back down to 70 again, and
we're just going to be in a range

2634
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:10,400
we're just going to be in a range
 

2635
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:19,109
we're just going to be in a range
rotation market.

2636
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:19,119

 

2637
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,190

So maybe that down to 70 here. There you

2638
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:21,200
So maybe that down to 70 here. There you
 

2639
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,670
So maybe that down to 70 here. There you
go. Coming back down 70. Obviously I'm

2640
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:23,680
go. Coming back down 70. Obviously I'm
 

2641
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,109
go. Coming back down 70. Obviously I'm
already out of this. If they lose this,

2642
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:25,119
already out of this. If they lose this,
 

2643
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,390
already out of this. If they lose this,
you do not want to hold it. If they

2644
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,400
you do not want to hold it. If they
 

2645
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,470
you do not want to hold it. If they
start losing this, do not want to hold

2646
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
start losing this, do not want to hold
 

2647
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,589
start losing this, do not want to hold
it. If they start losing this, it would

2648
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:29,599
it. If they start losing this, it would
 

2649
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,789
it. If they start losing this, it would
be another fail breakout. There you go.

2650
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:30,799
be another fail breakout. There you go.
 

2651
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:34,470
be another fail breakout. There you go.
They've lost it. Back down to VWAP. Very

2652
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
They've lost it. Back down to VWAP. Very
 

2653
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:43,190
They've lost it. Back down to VWAP. Very
volatile.

2654
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200

 

2655
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,349

Do I re recommend passing emails in in

2656
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:45,359
Do I re recommend passing emails in in
 

2657
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,950
Do I re recommend passing emails in in
one day? Uh, probably not because it

2658
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:46,960
one day? Uh, probably not because it
 

2659
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,589
one day? Uh, probably not because it
means you're oversized. Only if you're I

2660
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
means you're oversized. Only if you're I
 

2661
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,349
means you're oversized. Only if you're I
do it like that. I try and do it in one

2662
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:51,359
do it like that. I try and do it in one
 

2663
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,990
do it like that. I try and do it in one
or two days, but you have to be very

2664
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:54,000
or two days, but you have to be very
 

2665
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,710
or two days, but you have to be very
accurate.

2666
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
accurate.
 

2667
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,990
accurate.
Be very accurate. This is horrible.

2668
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
Be very accurate. This is horrible.
 

2669
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,270
Be very accurate. This is horrible.
Yeah, we're just ranging around, right?

2670
01:02:59,270 --> 01:02:59,280
Yeah, we're just ranging around, right?
 

2671
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,109
Yeah, we're just ranging around, right?
So, we came, remember, we we were taking

2672
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:01,119
So, we came, remember, we we were taking
 

2673
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,589
So, we came, remember, we we were taking
profit. I said if you take this 770s,

2674
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:03,599
profit. I said if you take this 770s,
 

2675
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,589
profit. I said if you take this 770s,
we're taking profit 800 and 825. So, you

2676
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:07,599
we're taking profit 800 and 825. So, you
 

2677
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,069
we're taking profit 800 and 825. So, you
still got what's that? Uh 55 points,

2678
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
still got what's that? Uh 55 points,
 

2679
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,390
still got what's that? Uh 55 points,
right? We didn't hit the 850 and 900

2680
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:14,400
right? We didn't hit the 850 and 900
 

2681
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,750
right? We didn't hit the 850 and 900
which would have given us the 100

2682
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:15,760
which would have given us the 100
 

2683
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,470
which would have given us the 100
pointer. We're still holding here or

2684
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:18,480
pointer. We're still holding here or
 

2685
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,470
pointer. We're still holding here or
hereabouts, but it's looking not very

2686
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
hereabouts, but it's looking not very
 

2687
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,349
hereabouts, but it's looking not very
nice. Now,

2688
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:23,359
nice. Now,
 

2689
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,430
nice. Now,
look at spy. Still can't get a close and

2690
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
look at spy. Still can't get a close and
 

2691
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,309
look at spy. Still can't get a close and
hold above 82s, right? Big big level for

2692
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:28,319
hold above 82s, right? Big big level for
 

2693
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,309
hold above 82s, right? Big big level for
spy.

2694
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:32,319

 

2695
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:33,829

Would I be looking at another entry for

2696
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
Would I be looking at another entry for
 

2697
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,670
Would I be looking at another entry for
sure? Yeah, I'd like to trade some more.

2698
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
sure? Yeah, I'd like to trade some more.
 

2699
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,630
sure? Yeah, I'd like to trade some more.
I'm willing to play both ways.

2700
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:38,640
I'm willing to play both ways.
 

2701
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,829
I'm willing to play both ways.
One of the worst days of the year

2702
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
One of the worst days of the year
 

2703
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,309
One of the worst days of the year
probably

2704
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
probably
 

2705
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,990
probably
probably at the moment. But I mean look

2706
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,000
probably at the moment. But I mean look
 

2707
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,990
probably at the moment. But I mean look
look at the sales we've had uh the last

2708
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:46,000
look at the sales we've had uh the last
 

2709
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,630
look at the sales we've had uh the last
few days. That's why

2710
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:48,640
few days. That's why
 

2711
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,470
few days. That's why
and understand like where we are higher

2712
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
and understand like where we are higher
 

2713
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,069
and understand like where we are higher
time frame folks, right? What's this

2714
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
time frame folks, right? What's this
 

2715
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,910
time frame folks, right? What's this
gray box

2716
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:53,920
gray box
 

2717
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,109
gray box
here? Right.

2718
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,119
here? Right.
 

2719
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,829
here? Right.
We're stuck on the previous week level.

2720
01:03:59,829 --> 01:03:59,839
We're stuck on the previous week level.
 

2721
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,270
We're stuck on the previous week level.
Right. We know we've got some

2722
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,280
Right. We know we've got some
 

2723
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,950
Right. We know we've got some
compression here. We know that they've

2724
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
compression here. We know that they've
 

2725
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,789
compression here. We know that they've
got stops to hunt. know we probably want

2726
01:04:04,789 --> 01:04:04,799
got stops to hunt. know we probably want
 

2727
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,470
got stops to hunt. know we probably want
to move lower, but we probably need to

2728
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
to move lower, but we probably need to
 

2729
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,910
to move lower, but we probably need to
try and get up to move lower, but they

2730
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
try and get up to move lower, but they
 

2731
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,349
try and get up to move lower, but they
are just not letting it do it on a

01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:09,359
are just not letting it do it on a
 

2733
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,589
are just not letting it do it on a
Friday.

2734
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:11,599
Friday.
 

2735
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,750
Friday.
We are pinned. We are pinned in here. We

We are pinned. We are pinned in here. We

We are pinned. We are pinned in here. We
are not seeing relief

2738

are not seeing relief
 

2739
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,109
are not seeing relief
for that move there, which I'd love. And

more of this, right? And we know when we
 

2745
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,349
more of this, right? And we know when we
do this, we build out liquidity. We

2746
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:25,359
do this, we build out liquidity. We
 

2747
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,510
do this, we build out liquidity. We
don't really love trading in that. Try

2748
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:27,520
don't really love trading in that. Try
 

2749
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,990
don't really love trading in that. Try
and avoid that where possible.

2825
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,589

I don't think the support zone is down

2826
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:11,599
I don't think the support zone is down
 

2827
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,990
I don't think the support zone is down
to around 24620. And if it breaks that,

2828
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:14,000
to around 24620. And if it breaks that,
 

2829
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,750
to around 24620. And if it breaks that,
you should go short. 24620

2830
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:19,760

 

2831
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,950

2833
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,309
4 oh 2 4 620 or basically the low of day
I mean you'd be shorting low of day if

2834
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
I mean you'd be shorting low of day if
 

2835

3077
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,189

01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:12,000
Okay, while this plays out, we're going
 

3177
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,709
Okay, while this plays out, we're going

3178
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719

3179
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,390
to look I'm going to look for TPS at 850
and then 900. Okay. Uh, make sure. Yeah,

So, 850. This spike here, right? We're
going to take some in 25, some at 850,

3186
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:26,560
going to take some in 25, some at 850,
 

3187
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,550

We might get one here. If we get 900s,

3192
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:33,360
We might get one here. If we get 900s,
 

3193
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,229
We might get one here. If we get 900s,
it will be 100 pointer. All right.

3194
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:36,239
it will be 100 pointer. All right.

3198
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:38,960
don't understand. It was just this
 

3199
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,950
don't understand. It was just this
seller. I saw him get stuck at that key

3200
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:40,960
seller. I saw him get stuck at that key
 

3201
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,390
seller. I saw him get stuck at that key
level and I'm using his pain to go

3202
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:42,400
level and I'm using his pain to go
 

3203
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,830
level and I'm using his pain to go
higher. That's all it is. All right.

3204
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:43,840
higher. That's all it is. All right.
 

3205
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,149
higher. That's all it is. All right.
Here's the move towards 50s. Right. Let

3206
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:46,159
Here's the move towards 50s. Right. Let
 

3207
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,590
Here's the move towards 50s. Right. Let
me go and brew a coffee while this

3208
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:47,600
me go and brew a coffee while this
 

3209
01:15:47,600 --> 01:16:52,950
me go and brew a coffee while this
happens.

3210
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960

 

3211
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,270

Right. Coffee is brewing. Yeah. Almost

3212
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:55,280
Right. Coffee is brewing. Yeah. Almost
 

3213
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,950
Right. Coffee is brewing. Yeah. Almost
there, folks. All right. Only 900's

3214
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:56,960
there, folks. All right. Only 900's
 

3215
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,510
there, folks. All right. Only 900's
left. So 850's hit. Almost there, folks.

3216
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,520
left. So 850's hit. Almost there, folks.
 

3217
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,709
left. So 850's hit. Almost there, folks.
Almost there, folks.

3218
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
Almost there, folks.
 

3219
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,390
Almost there, folks.
We might get 100 pointer here. If we get

3220
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:06,400
We might get 100 pointer here. If we get
 

3221
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,189
We might get 100 pointer here. If we get
lucky, we're lifting to 955. So I don't

3222
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:09,199
lucky, we're lifting to 955. So I don't
 

3223
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,470
lucky, we're lifting to 955. So I don't
necessarily think we're going to do that

3224
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:10,480
necessarily think we're going to do that
 

3225
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,229
necessarily think we're going to do that
today.

3226
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
today.
 

3227
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,189
today.
Um, so we took this guy's pain and we're

3228
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:15,199
Um, so we took this guy's pain and we're
 

3229
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,350
Um, so we took this guy's pain and we're
trying to get up into here now if

3230
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:17,360
trying to get up into here now if
 

3231
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,270
trying to get up into here now if
possible.

3232
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,280
possible.
 

3233
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,910
possible.
Uh, you want this to protect 825 830.

3234
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
Uh, you want this to protect 825 830.
 

3235
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,590
Uh, you want this to protect 825 830.
All right, where the big buyers just

3236
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:23,600
All right, where the big buyers just
 

3237
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,229
All right, where the big buyers just
came in. All right, these big buyers who

3238
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:26,239
came in. All right, these big buyers who
 

3239
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:27,669
came in. All right, these big buyers who
just squeeze us up. We want these guys

3240
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:27,679
just squeeze us up. We want these guys
 

3241
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,830
just squeeze us up. We want these guys
to stay in the money. All right, 825

3242
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
to stay in the money. All right, 825
 

3243
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,390
to stay in the money. All right, 825
830. So we're almost at the level we

3244
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,400
830. So we're almost at the level we
 

3245
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,030
830. So we're almost at the level we
want. We want 900. We want to squeeze up

3246
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
want. We want 900. We want to squeeze up
 

3247
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,030
want. We want 900. We want to squeeze up
into here. All right, so we're using

3248
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:37,040
into here. All right, so we're using
 

3249
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,950
into here. All right, so we're using
this guy's pain. All right. Once this

3250
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:38,960
this guy's pain. All right. Once this
 

3251
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,110
this guy's pain. All right. Once this
guy piled in at this 800 after we' done

3252
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,120
guy piled in at this 800 after we' done
 

3253
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,550
guy piled in at this 800 after we' done
it a million times, I was like, "Yep,

3254
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:42,560
it a million times, I was like, "Yep,
 

3255
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,910
it a million times, I was like, "Yep,
I'm going to have you." Thank you very

3256
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:43,920
I'm going to have you." Thank you very
 

3257
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,550
I'm going to have you." Thank you very
much. And we're looking for 900. Now,

3258
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
much. And we're looking for 900. Now,
 

3259
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,229
much. And we're looking for 900. Now,
and that would be 100 pointer if we get

3260
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:50,239
and that would be 100 pointer if we get
 

3261
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,030
and that would be 100 pointer if we get
it.

3262
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:53,040
it.
 

3263
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,030
it.
Now, if we lift through 900, let's have

3264
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,040
Now, if we lift through 900, let's have
 

3265
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,870
Now, if we lift through 900, let's have
a think about what we can do. If we lift

3266
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
a think about what we can do. If we lift
 

3267
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,790
a think about what we can do. If we lift
through this,

3268
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
through this,
 

3269
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,790
through this,
if we lift through 900, there is an

3270
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
if we lift through 900, there is an
 

3271
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:07,510
if we lift through 900, there is an
argument for 956 and 25,5.

3272
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,520

 

3273
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,790

All right. So, if we lift through this,

3274
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
All right. So, if we lift through this,
 

3275
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,229
All right. So, if we lift through this,
there's an argument for this level here

3276
01:18:10,229 --> 01:18:10,239
there's an argument for this level here
 

3277
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,149
there's an argument for this level here
or 944s.

3278
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:12,159
or 944s.
 

3279
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:15,750
or 944s.
Here we go, folks. Here we go, folks.

3288
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:26,960

 

3289
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,630

Here we go. So, we're looking for this.

3290
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,640
Here we go. So, we're looking for this.
 

3291
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,149

This is your next TP. And then we're

3292
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:30,159
This is your next TP. And then we're
 

3293
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:31,590
This is your next TP. And then we're
going to hold runners. And I tell you

3294
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
going to hold runners. And I tell you
 

3295
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,590
going to hold runners. And I tell you
what, if they turn the turbo on today,

3296
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:33,600
what, if they turn the turbo on today,
 

3297
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,149
what, if they turn the turbo on today,
it could be fun. So over this we're

3298
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:36,159
it could be fun. So over this we're
 

3299
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,229
it could be fun. So over this we're
looking for over 900 we're going to look

3300
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:38,239
looking for over 900 we're going to look
 

3301
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,990
looking for over 900 we're going to look
for the blue line above. All right. Over

3302
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:40,000
for the blue line above. All right. Over
 

3303
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,229
for the blue line above. All right. Over
900 we're going to look for this. And

3304
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
900 we're going to look for this. And
 

3305
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,310
900 we're going to look for this. And
over that we're going to look for this.

3306
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
over that we're going to look for this.
 

3307
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,149
over that we're going to look for this.
All right. So there might be 200 points

3308
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:46,159
All right. So there might be 200 points
 

3309
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,830
All right. So there might be 200 points
here if we get lucky. But this is a big

3310
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:47,840
here if we get lucky. But this is a big
 

3311
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,510
here if we get lucky. But this is a big
level. Sell some into this level. Please

3312
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:49,520
level. Sell some into this level. Please
 

3313
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,590
level. Sell some into this level. Please
look. We've missed it by a tick. Don't

3314
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:51,600
look. We've missed it by a tick. Don't
 

3315
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,669
look. We've missed it by a tick. Don't
be a dick for a tick like we always talk

3316
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:53,679
be a dick for a tick like we always talk
 

3317
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,310
be a dick for a tick like we always talk
about. I would move your stop up now.

3318
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:56,320
about. I would move your stop up now.
 

3319
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,990
about. I would move your stop up now.
All righters. We can come all the way

3320
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,000
All righters. We can come all the way
 

3321
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,390
All righters. We can come all the way
down to 25s. Don't not let it do that.

3322
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
down to 25s. Don't not let it do that.
 

3323
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,750
down to 25s. Don't not let it do that.
All right. You'd want to see an

3324
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:01,760
All right. You'd want to see an
 

3325
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,070
All right. You'd want to see an
imbalance hold here around 65s. Don't

3326
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,080
imbalance hold here around 65s. Don't
 

3327
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,910
imbalance hold here around 65s. Don't
let it come under that. I would say I'm

3328
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:05,920
let it come under that. I would say I'm
 

3329
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,270
let it come under that. I would say I'm
going to go and pour my coffee out and

3330
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
going to go and pour my coffee out and
 

3331
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:46,149
going to go and pour my coffee out and
come back.

3332
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:46,159

 

3333
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,870

Okay. What's the time? IB now set,

3334
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
Okay. What's the time? IB now set,
 

3335
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,229
Okay. What's the time? IB now set,
folks, as well. So, be careful of the

3336
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
folks, as well. So, be careful of the
 

3337
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:51,990
folks, as well. So, be careful of the
failed breakout. So, we pretty much hit

3338
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,000
failed breakout. So, we pretty much hit
 

3339
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,990
failed breakout. So, we pretty much hit
it. We missed it by a tick. You really

3340
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:54,000
it. We missed it by a tick. You really
 

3341
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,229
it. We missed it by a tick. You really
want this IB to hold. I don't really

3342
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
want this IB to hold. I don't really
 

3343
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,390
want this IB to hold. I don't really
want to offer it to redip all the way

3344
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,400
want to offer it to redip all the way
 

3345
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,709
want to offer it to redip all the way
down to 50s. All right. So, we really

3346
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
down to 50s. All right. So, we really
 

3347
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,390
down to 50s. All right. So, we really
want this to hold for the expansion.

3348
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,400
want this to hold for the expansion.
 

3349
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,709
want this to hold for the expansion.
Now, they're adding at 950 above, which

3350
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:04,719
Now, they're adding at 950 above, which
 

3351
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,270
Now, they're adding at 950 above, which
is good. We look good.

3352
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,280
is good. We look good.
 

3353
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,189
is good. We look good.
Holds of 850s look good. Everything

3354
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:09,199
Holds of 850s look good. Everything
 

3355
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,189
Holds of 850s look good. Everything
holding 850 looks good, but I don't

3356
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:11,199
holding 850 looks good, but I don't
 

3357
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,630
holding 850 looks good, but I don't
really want it to come down and retest

3358
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:12,640
really want it to come down and retest
 

3359
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,310
really want it to come down and retest
there. That'll be given 50 points back

3360
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,320
there. That'll be given 50 points back
 

3361
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:17,590
there. That'll be given 50 points back
from the from the peak, won't it?

3362
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:17,600
from the from the peak, won't it?
 

3363
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,229
from the from the peak, won't it?
So, maybe I'll cut an off and read there

3364
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:20,239
So, maybe I'll cut an off and read there
 

3365
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,870
So, maybe I'll cut an off and read there
if I really want to. Come on, market.

3366
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:22,880
if I really want to. Come on, market.
 

3367
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,910
if I really want to. Come on, market.
Let's get squeezing. Let's go. Let'sing

3371
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:41,110
go, market. Let's just [\h__\h] turn it
on, please.

3372
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:41,120

 

3373
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,669

Where was the seller court? 800. Here we

3374
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679
Where was the seller court? 800. Here we
 

3375
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,630
Where was the seller court? 800. Here we
go. Let's go. Here's the squeeze. What

3376
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:46,640
go. Let's go. Here's the squeeze. What
 

3377
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,830
go. Let's go. Here's the squeeze. What
are we saying here? Someone's going to

3378
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:47,840
are we saying here? Someone's going to
 

3379
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,070
are we saying here? Someone's going to
get [\h__\h] soon. We can't sit there

3380
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,080
get [\h__\h] soon. We can't sit there
 

3381
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,510
get [\h__\h] soon. We can't sit there
forever. All right. Here we go, folks.

3382
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:51,520
forever. All right. Here we go, folks.
 

3383
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,189
forever. All right. Here we go, folks.
So, almost at blue line. This is your

3384
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:53,199
So, almost at blue line. This is your
 

3385
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:56,470
So, almost at blue line. This is your
next TP. Uh, right here. Right. That

3386
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:56,480
next TP. Uh, right here. Right. That
 

3387
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,709
next TP. Uh, right here. Right. That
would be 150 points. And if we're lucky,

3388
01:20:58,709 --> 01:20:58,719
would be 150 points. And if we're lucky,
 

3389
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,630
would be 150 points. And if we're lucky,
we're going to get all the way up into

3390
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:00,640
we're going to get all the way up into
 

3391
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,910
we're going to get all the way up into
this 25,027. We will respect 25,000

3392
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:03,920
this 25,027. We will respect 25,000
 

3393
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,149
this 25,027. We will respect 25,000
being a whole number. But let's look for

3394
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:06,159
being a whole number. But let's look for
 

3395
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,070
being a whole number. But let's look for
25,046es.

3396
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
25,046es.
 

3397
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,709
25,046es.
Did we just run those stops? Did we just

3398
01:21:10,709 --> 01:21:10,719
Did we just run those stops? Did we just
 

3399
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,630
Did we just run those stops? Did we just
run those stops? Not quite. Okay, this

3400
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:12,640
run those stops? Not quite. Okay, this
 

3401
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,270
run those stops? Not quite. Okay, this
is the level right into here. 45s if we

3402
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
is the level right into here. 45s if we
 

3403
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,110
is the level right into here. 45s if we
can go. Seller coming in at higher day

3404
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,120
can go. Seller coming in at higher day
 

3405
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,550
can go. Seller coming in at higher day
here, which is what I want to see. Let's

3406
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:18,560
here, which is what I want to see. Let's
 

3407
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,550
here, which is what I want to see. Let's
try and print above 20s. That's where

3408
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:20,560
try and print above 20s. That's where
 

3409
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,550
try and print above 20s. That's where
the big sellers just come in. We'd love

3410
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
the big sellers just come in. We'd love
 

3411
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,470
the big sellers just come in. We'd love
to print above 20s now. Don't want him

3412
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:24,480
to print above 20s now. Don't want him
 

3413
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,590
to print above 20s now. Don't want him
to be comfortable. We've got an

3414
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:25,600
to be comfortable. We've got an
 

3415
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,229
to be comfortable. We've got an
imbalance down to 900. Maybe we can move

3416
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:28,239
imbalance down to 900. Maybe we can move
 

3417
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:32,149
imbalance down to 900. Maybe we can move
our stop just under 900 here. And let's

3418
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:32,159
our stop just under 900 here. And let's
 

3419
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,229
our stop just under 900 here. And let's
see if we can print out here. Higher the

3420
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:34,239
see if we can print out here. Higher the
 

3421
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,990
see if we can print out here. Higher the
better. Here we go, folks. Here we go,

3422
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,000
better. Here we go, folks. Here we go,
 

3423
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,550
better. Here we go, folks. Here we go,
folks.

3424
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:38,560
folks.
 

3425
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,470
folks.
So, you are now coming into here. This

3426
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:40,480
So, you are now coming into here. This
 

3427
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,790
So, you are now coming into here. This
would be 150 odd pointer. All right,

3428
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
would be 150 odd pointer. All right,
 

3429
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,229
would be 150 odd pointer. All right,
let's see if we can get all the way up

3430
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:44,239
let's see if we can get all the way up
 

3431
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:45,990
let's see if we can get all the way up
into here. Do not add up here. I'm

3432
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,000
into here. Do not add up here. I'm
 

3433
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,669
into here. Do not add up here. I'm
telling you now, do not be adding up

3434
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:47,679
telling you now, do not be adding up
 

3435
01:21:47,679 --> 01:22:05,189
telling you now, do not be adding up
here. You will get absolutely slapped.

3436
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:05,199

 

3437
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,350

900's got to hold here for me or I'm

3438
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:07,360
900's got to hold here for me or I'm
 

3439
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,430
900's got to hold here for me or I'm
out.

3440
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:09,440
out.
 

3441
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,030
out.
It can afford to come much much deeper.

3442
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,040
It can afford to come much much deeper.
 

3443
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,550
It can afford to come much much deeper.
So, I'm just not willing to give too

3444
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:12,560
So, I'm just not willing to give too
 

3445
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,390
So, I'm just not willing to give too
many profits back here. So, 900 for me

3446
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:14,400
many profits back here. So, 900 for me
 

3447
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,510
many profits back here. So, 900 for me
has to hold here. We have a little

3448
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:15,520
has to hold here. We have a little
 

3449
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,229
has to hold here. We have a little
imbalance at 900. So, Where's that

3450
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
imbalance at 900. So, Where's that
 

3451
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,870
imbalance at 900. So, Where's that
previous day control? 890s holding so

3452
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:20,880
previous day control? 890s holding so
 

3453
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,790
previous day control? 890s holding so
far here. Sellers trying to pile in.

3454
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,800
far here. Sellers trying to pile in.
 

3455
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,149
far here. Sellers trying to pile in.
Would like to see some absorption here

3456
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:24,159
Would like to see some absorption here
 

3457
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:30,470
Would like to see some absorption here
into 900 or I will be out.

3458
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:30,480

 

3459
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,830

There's 900.

3460
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:33,840

3477
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,310
or I'm out here because we got big
sellers stuck here at 9005 and 9003. I

01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,320
sellers stuck here at 9005 and 9003. I
 

3479
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,990
sellers stuck here at 9005 and 9003. I
want to stay above those sellers. Get

want to stay above those sellers. Get
 

3481
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,550
want to stay above those sellers. Get
above back above 909 would be really

01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:58,560
above back above 909 would be really
 

3483
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,149
above back above 909 would be really
good.

3484

good.
 

3485
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:03,270
good.
No. No. I'm out. I'm out. Now, I know I

3511
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:39,270

Oh, NQ, you're so harsh this week, man.

3512

Oh, NQ, you're so harsh this week, man.

Oh, why don't I get back in? I'm not

Oh, why don't I get back in? I'm not

Oh, why don't I get back in? I'm not

Not buying up here in a rotation. No

3527
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,310

All right. Building out some liquidity

3528
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:04,320
All right. Building out some liquidity
 

3529
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,550
All right. Building out some liquidity
up here now. All right. So, you just

3530
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
up here now. All right. So, you just
 

3531
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,870
up here now. All right. So, you just
missed this TP here by what? A couple

3532
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:08,880
missed this TP here by what? A couple
 

3533
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,070
missed this TP here by what? A couple
ticks. Hopefully, it does it for you.

3534
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:10,080
ticks. Hopefully, it does it for you.
 

3535
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,510
ticks. Hopefully, it does it for you.
It's trying to hold previous day point

3536
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:11,520
It's trying to hold previous day point
 

3537
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,510
It's trying to hold previous day point
control. They rinsed me by five points.

3538
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:13,520
control. They rinsed me by five points.
 

3539
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,830
control. They rinsed me by five points.
That's twice today. They've rinsed me by

3540
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:15,840
That's twice today. They've rinsed me by
 

3541
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,910
That's twice today. They've rinsed me by
five. All right. Hopefully, you get this

3542
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
five. All right. Hopefully, you get this
 

3543
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,669
five. All right. Hopefully, you get this
and then this. That would be the

3544
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
and then this. That would be the
 

3545
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:20,950
and then this. That would be the
ultimate target for you. But definitely

3546
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:20,960
ultimate target for you. But definitely
 

3547
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:28,550
ultimate target for you. But definitely
this blue line must be some.

3548
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:28,560

 

3549
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,830

I stopped IB high. Um probably did, but

3550
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:31,840
I stopped IB high. Um probably did, but
 

3551
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,390
I stopped IB high. Um probably did, but
uh my stop was not based on IBH high. I

3552
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:34,400
uh my stop was not based on IBH high. I
 

3553
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,030
uh my stop was not based on IBH high. I
stopped at 900. No, I I behigh down here

3554
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,040
stopped at 900. No, I I behigh down here
 

3555
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,790
stopped at 900. No, I I behigh down here
at 870.

3556
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:38,800
at 870.
 

3557
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,470
at 870.
I was trying to use uh their pain,

3558
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
I was trying to use uh their pain,
 

3559
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,149
I was trying to use uh their pain,
right? So, we had a a lot of sellers

3560
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:44,159
right? So, we had a a lot of sellers
 

3561
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,390
right? So, we had a a lot of sellers
piling in, right? And I was trying to

3562
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
piling in, right? And I was trying to
 

3563
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,990
piling in, right? And I was trying to
make sure we stayed above this seller

3564
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:48,000
make sure we stayed above this seller
 

3565
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,709
make sure we stayed above this seller
here. You see him here piling in, right?

3566
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:50,719
here. You see him here piling in, right?
 

3567
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,629
here. You see him here piling in, right?
I wanted to stay above this seller. I

3568
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:52,639
I wanted to stay above this seller. I
 

3569
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:53,910
I wanted to stay above this seller. I
didn't want it to drop under this

3570
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
didn't want it to drop under this
 

3571
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,750
didn't want it to drop under this
imbalance, right? We dropped under the

3572
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:55,760
imbalance, right? We dropped under the
 

3573
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,830
imbalance, right? We dropped under the
imbalance, of course, and then ripped

3574
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:57,840
imbalance, of course, and then ripped
 

3575
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,189
imbalance, of course, and then ripped
back up and got above this seller. So,

3576
01:24:59,189 --> 01:24:59,199
back up and got above this seller. So,
 

3577
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,470
back up and got above this seller. So,
these are the sellers which are piling

3578
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:00,480
these are the sellers which are piling
 

3579
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,790
these are the sellers which are piling
in. So if you get above 920 now there's

3580
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:02,800
in. So if you get above 920 now there's
 

3581
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:13,030
in. So if you get above 920 now there's
chance for a resque squeeze out

3582
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:13,040

 

3583
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,709

inverse repeat of yesterday pretty much

3584
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:14,719
inverse repeat of yesterday pretty much
 

3585
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,310
inverse repeat of yesterday pretty much
isn't it pretty pretty similar of

01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320

3595
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,830

Why not add five to 10 points for the

3596
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
Why not add five to 10 points for the
 

3597
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,110
Why not add five to 10 points for the
next couple of weeks? It's tempting,

3598
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:39,120
next couple of weeks? It's tempting,
 

3599
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,189
next couple of weeks? It's tempting,
isn't it? But I'm not going to trade I'm

3600
01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:41,199
isn't it? But I'm not going to trade I'm
 

3601
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,030

my trading for a couple of sessions
 

3605
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,709
my trading for a couple of sessions
where the volatility's been up because

3606
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:48,719
where the volatility's been up because

01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,950
where the volatility's been up because
you know I try m like arguably I could

01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:50,960
you know I try m like arguably I could
 

3609
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,030
you know I try m like arguably I could
have risked a little bit more but you

3610
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:53,040
have risked a little bit more but you
 

3611
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,229
have risked a little bit more but you
know what it's a 100 point plus trade

3612
01:25:56,229 --> 01:25:56,239
know what it's a 100 point plus trade
 

3613
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:57,590
know what it's a 100 point plus trade
see and I don't want to get caught in

3614
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:57,600
see and I don't want to get caught in
 

3615
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,310

that that there because now the sellers

3616
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:00,320
that that there because now the sellers
 

3617
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,629
that that there because now the sellers
are in control well not totally in

3618
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:02,639
are in control well not totally in
 

3619
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,310
are in control well not totally in
control but of this here. So sellers

3620
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:04,320
control but of this here. So sellers
 

3621
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,070
control but of this here. So sellers
have piled in in this volume node up

3622
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:06,080
have piled in in this volume node up
 

3623
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,590
have piled in in this volume node up
here. See, this is what I did not want

3624
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:07,600
here. See, this is what I did not want
 

3625
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,950
here. See, this is what I did not want
to get caught in. This is when my stop

3626
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:08,960
to get caught in. This is when my stop
 

3627
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,110
to get caught in. This is when my stop
went to 9005. So, look at what happened

3628
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
went to 9005. So, look at what happened
 

3629
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,350
went to 9005. So, look at what happened
up here. Once these sellers got the

3630
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:13,360
up here. Once these sellers got the
 

3631
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,030
up here. Once these sellers got the
break under their level, we are washing

3632
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:15,040
break under their level, we are washing
 

3633
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,629
break under their level, we are washing
right back down. Here are the

3634
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:16,639
right back down. Here are the
 

3635
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,390
right back down. Here are the
imbalances. 53s. Where can they revisit

3636
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:20,400
imbalances. 53s. Where can they revisit
 

3637
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,870
imbalances. 53s. Where can they revisit
820s where we broke out from? Remember,

3638
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
820s where we broke out from? Remember,
 

3639
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,950
820s where we broke out from? Remember,
we got long on this buyer's pain at 800.

3640
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:26,960
we got long on this buyer's pain at 800.
 

3641
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,950
we got long on this buyer's pain at 800.
All right. Buyer came in, pushed us all

3642
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:28,960

If we lose that, we come right back down

3654
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:41,840
If we lose that, we come right back down
 

3655
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,790
If we lose that, we come right back down
to VPO where we got back in. Right. So,

3656
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
to VPO where we got back in. Right. So,
 

3657
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,629
to VPO where we got back in. Right. So,
not going to force my way in.

01:26:48,629 --> 01:26:48,639
not going to force my way in.

peak above and fail. Yeah, absolutely.

3670
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:07,360
peak above and fail. Yeah, absolutely.
 

3671
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,669
peak above and fail. Yeah, absolutely.
That's what we've done. Um into previous

3672
01:27:09,669 --> 01:27:09,679
That's what we've done. Um into previous
 

3673
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:11,270
That's what we've done. Um into previous
days value area high would have been

3674
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:11,280
days value area high would have been
 

3675
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,830
days value area high would have been
more ideal though. Did we take out this

3676
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:13,840
more ideal though. Did we take out this
 

3677
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,590
more ideal though. Did we take out this
stop? We didn't actually peak above it

3678
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:15,600
stop? We didn't actually peak above it
 

3679
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,229
stop? We didn't actually peak above it
all. So, this is one of the things I was

3680
01:27:18,229 --> 01:27:18,239
all. So, this is one of the things I was
 

3681
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,590
all. So, this is one of the things I was
looking at. This is where the blue line.

3682
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:21,600
looking at. This is where the blue line.
 

3683
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,669
looking at. This is where the blue line.
All right. The peak above technically to

3684
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:23,679
All right. The peak above technically to
 

3685
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,430
All right. The peak above technically to
run all the stops would been 944s.

3686
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,440
run all the stops would been 944s.
 

3687
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,669
run all the stops would been 944s.
Right. This blue line current week

3688
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:27,679
Right. This blue line current week
 

3689
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:29,990
Right. This blue line current week
developing value area low. It's exactly

3690
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
developing value area low. It's exactly
 

3691
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,430
developing value area low. It's exactly
what I would have looked for, which is

3692
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:31,440
what I would have looked for, which is
 

3693
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,790
what I would have looked for, which is
what you've just said, right? I would

3694
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:32,800
what you've just said, right? I would
 

3695
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,470
what you've just said, right? I would
have looked to take profit in here and

3696
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:34,480
have looked to take profit in here and
 

3697
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,910
have looked to take profit in here and
here and then I would have been thinking

3698
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:35,920
here and then I would have been thinking
 

3699
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,990
here and then I would have been thinking
about that short back down. All right.

3700
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,000
about that short back down. All right.
 

3701
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,590
about that short back down. All right.
Definitely. We didn't actually run all

3702
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,600
Definitely. We didn't actually run all
 

3703
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,590
Definitely. We didn't actually run all
the stops. I would have liked a little

3704
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:41,600
the stops. I would have liked a little
 

3705
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:45,030
the stops. I would have liked a little
bit more. But that has been the story of

3706
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:45,040
bit more. But that has been the story of
 

3707
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,510
bit more. But that has been the story of
NQ this week. Right. ENQ this week.

3708
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520

3725
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,629

here and then follow through underneath.
 

3727
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,149

week. So heavy it's not popping those

3736
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:17,760
week. So heavy it's not popping those
 

3737
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:24,790
week. So heavy it's not popping those
stops.

3738
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:24,800

 

3739
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,270

Okay. and all the way back down to where

3740
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:27,280
Okay. and all the way back down to where
 

3741
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,110
Okay. and all the way back down to where
we got long. Right, this is where we got

3742
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:29,120
we got long. Right, this is where we got
 

3743
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,310
we got long. Right, this is where we got
long. So, obvious obviously, in case

3744
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:32,320
long. So, obvious obviously, in case
 

3745
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,830
long. So, obvious obviously, in case
it's not obvious, I stopped out right

3746
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:35,840
it's not obvious, I stopped out right
 

3747
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,149
it's not obvious, I stopped out right
under or right at 900 or wherever it

3748
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:38,159
under or right at 900 or wherever it
 

3749
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,070
under or right at 900 or wherever it
was. All right, so we're well well out

3750
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,080
was. All right, so we're well well out
 

3751
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:48,790
was. All right, so we're well well out
of this now.

3752
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:48,800

 

3753
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,790

Can I see the original seller trapped on

3754
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:50,800
Can I see the original seller trapped on
 

3755
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,110
Can I see the original seller trapped on
TV footprint? Uh, you probably could.

3756
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:53,120
TV footprint? Uh, you probably could.
 

3757
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:57,189
TV footprint? Uh, you probably could.
Where was that? Right.

3758

3759
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,790

could probably could on the delta here.

3760
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:00,800
could probably could on the delta here.
 

3761
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,830
could probably could on the delta here.
Uh

3762
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:03,840

 

3763
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,790

what level did I have it at? 95. Let's

3764
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:06,800
what level did I have it at? 95. Let's
 

3765
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,629
what level did I have it at? 95. Let's
see if there's somewhere at 95. It's

3766
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:08,639
see if there's somewhere at 95. It's
 

3767
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,629
see if there's somewhere at 95. It's
going to be this guy. Yeah, these guys

3768
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:10,639
going to be this guy. Yeah, these guys
 

3769
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,669
going to be this guy. Yeah, these guys
here, right? So, we had it here and

3770
01:29:13,669 --> 01:29:13,679
here, right? So, we had it here and
 

3771
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:16,229
here, right? So, we had it here and
here. Same seller. And once we got above

3772
01:29:16,229 --> 01:29:16,239
here. Same seller. And once we got above
 

3773
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:19,910
here. Same seller. And once we got above
him, he had to stop out. Yeah, same guy.

3774
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:19,920
him, he had to stop out. Yeah, same guy.
 

3775
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,189
him, he had to stop out. Yeah, same guy.
Look at the delta in those. Same guy.

3776
01:29:23,189 --> 01:29:23,199
Look at the delta in those. Same guy.
 

3777
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:24,870
Look at the delta in those. Same guy.
Definitely

3778
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:24,880
Definitely
 

3779
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,629
Definitely
uh the highs. You're going to see the

3780
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:26,639
uh the highs. You're going to see the
 

3781
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,950
uh the highs. You're going to see the
shift at the highs as well. Right.

3782

shift at the highs as well. Right.
 

3783
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,110
shift at the highs as well. Right.
Buyers at the top, sellers kept coming

time, right? So, right back down to the
 

3795
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,310
time, right? So, right back down to the
area where those buyers rebid where we

3796
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:46,320
area where those buyers rebid where we
 

3797
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,390
area where those buyers rebid where we
first got in pretty much. Right. So now

3798
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:48,400
first got in pretty much. Right. So now
 

3799
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,950
first got in pretty much. Right. So now
you'd be watching

3800
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:50,960
you'd be watching
 

3801
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,310
you'd be watching
are they going to squeeze or do you see

3802
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:52,320
are they going to squeeze or do you see
 

3803
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,149
are they going to squeeze or do you see
a failed follow through here? So I'd say

3804
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:54,159
a failed follow through here? So I'd say
 

3805
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,870
a failed follow through here? So I'd say
you can sort of watch 850s

3806
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:56,880
you can sort of watch 850s
 

3807
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,149
you can sort of watch 850s
somewhere in here

3808
01:30:00,149 --> 01:30:00,159
somewhere in here
 

3809
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,510
somewhere in here
right if they do a failed follow

3810
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:01,520
right if they do a failed follow
 

3811
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,709
right if they do a failed follow
through. I'm not sure. I love the

3812
01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:02,719
through. I'm not sure. I love the
 

3813
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:05,910
through. I'm not sure. I love the
auction at the high but maybe in here

3814
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:05,920
auction at the high but maybe in here
 

3815
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,629
auction at the high but maybe in here
there is some failed follow through. If

3816
01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:08,639
there is some failed follow through. If
 

3817
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,270
there is some failed follow through. If
they fail to reclaim this

3818
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:11,280
they fail to reclaim this
 

3819
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,030
they fail to reclaim this
back down into here again and under here

3820
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:13,040
back down into here again and under here
 

3821
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,470
back down into here again and under here
we're back into the slop and the

3822
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:14,480
we're back into the slop and the
 

3823
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,910
we're back into the slop and the
rotation. All right. So this is the

3824
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:15,920
rotation. All right. So this is the
 

3825
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,510
rotation. All right. So this is the
edge. They're protecting the edge.

3826
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:17,520
edge. They're protecting the edge.
 

3827
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,030
edge. They're protecting the edge.
Buyers will try and take this up. If

3828
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,040
Buyers will try and take this up. If
 

3829
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,390
Buyers will try and take this up. If
they fail to follow through, we come

3830
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:20,400
they fail to follow through, we come
 

3831
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,070
they fail to follow through, we come
back down. If we lose that, we come back

3832
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:22,080
back down. If we lose that, we come back
 

3833
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,629
back down. If we lose that, we come back
down to the other side, right? If buyers

3834
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:24,639
down to the other side, right? If buyers
 

3835
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,790
down to the other side, right? If buyers
reclaim this, they can try and finish

3836
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:26,800
reclaim this, they can try and finish
 

3837
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:32,470
reclaim this, they can try and finish
the uh rotation.

3838
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:32,480

 

3839
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,709

So, very, very weak. Failing to follow

3840
01:30:34,709 --> 01:30:34,719
So, very, very weak. Failing to follow
 

3841
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,629
So, very, very weak. Failing to follow
through. Didn't even offer a pop to

3842
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:36,639
through. Didn't even offer a pop to
 

3843
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:41,030
through. Didn't even offer a pop to
sell. Very, very, very weak is how I

3844
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:41,040
sell. Very, very, very weak is how I
 

3845
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,709
sell. Very, very, very weak is how I
would interpret it. Interpret what's

3846
01:30:42,709 --> 01:30:42,719
would interpret it. Interpret what's
 

3847
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:47,830
would interpret it. Interpret what's
just happened there.

3848
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:47,840

 

3849
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,910

Thanks FC. That's nice of you. Hey

3850
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:49,920
Thanks FC. That's nice of you. Hey
 

3851
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,629
Thanks FC. That's nice of you. Hey
Stephen, thanks for joining

3852
01:30:54,629 --> 01:30:54,639

 

3853
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,390

buyers now caught. So all those buyers

3854
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:56,400
buyers now caught. So all those buyers
 

3855
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:00,709
buyers now caught. So all those buyers
we talked about at 824 and 830s.

3856
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:00,719
we talked about at 824 and 830s.
 

3857
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,470
we talked about at 824 and 830s.
All right, they didn't sell the highs,

3858
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:02,480
All right, they didn't sell the highs,
 

3859
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:09,750
All right, they didn't sell the highs,
they're now caught.

3860
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760

 

3861
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,270

I would have been willing to resell this

3862
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:11,280
I would have been willing to resell this
 

3863
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,110
I would have been willing to resell this
on a popup here.

3864
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:15,120

 

3865
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,310

messy now. Now we wait again. We have to

3866
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:18,320
messy now. Now we wait again. We have to
 

3867
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,750
messy now. Now we wait again. We have to
let it develop again. If it just keeps

3868
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:19,760
let it develop again. If it just keeps
 

3869
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,669
let it develop again. If it just keeps
sliding, there's not a lot I can do with

3870
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:21,679
sliding, there's not a lot I can do with
 

3871
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:24,709
sliding, there's not a lot I can do with
it if it just keeps sliding. Do I trade

3872
01:31:24,709 --> 01:31:24,719
it if it just keeps sliding. Do I trade
 

3873
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,430
it if it just keeps sliding. Do I trade
on NQ MT5 funding pips? If I buy

3874
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:27,440
on NQ MT5 funding pips? If I buy
 

3875
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,950
on NQ MT5 funding pips? If I buy
account,

3876
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:28,960
account,
 

3877
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,830
account,
uh I don't trade on funding pips

3878
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:31,840
uh I don't trade on funding pips
 

3879
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,910
uh I don't trade on funding pips
and I if you're trading on funding pips,

3880
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:33,920
and I if you're trading on funding pips,
 

3881
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,270
and I if you're trading on funding pips,
you won't be able to trade ENQ. You'd

3882
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:35,280
you won't be able to trade ENQ. You'd
 

3883
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,830
you won't be able to trade ENQ. You'd
have to trade uh NAS 100, I would

3884
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:37,840
have to trade uh NAS 100, I would
 

3885
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:44,310
have to trade uh NAS 100, I would
assume, because it would be CFD.

3886
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:44,320

 

3887
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,629

Can I adopt you?

3888
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:46,639
Can I adopt you?
 

3889
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:49,830
Can I adopt you?
You don't want to be adopted by me.

3890
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:49,840
You don't want to be adopted by me.
 

3891
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,910
You don't want to be adopted by me.
If 880 is denied, can we sell? Yes,

3892
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:51,920
If 880 is denied, can we sell? Yes,
 

3893
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,390
If 880 is denied, can we sell? Yes,
definitely. Definitely. 850 to 880. If

3894
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:54,400
definitely. Definitely. 850 to 880. If
 

3895
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,750
definitely. Definitely. 850 to 880. If
it's denied, I think it's a sell

3896
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:55,760
it's denied, I think it's a sell
 

3897
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,270
it's denied, I think it's a sell
potentially. Yeah. At the moment, we're

3898
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:57,280
potentially. Yeah. At the moment, we're
 

3899
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:05,590
potentially. Yeah. At the moment, we're
not even popping up there.

3900
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:05,600

 

3901
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,310

It assumes you seem all the huge orders

3902
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:08,320
It assumes you seem all the huge orders
 

3903
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,310
It assumes you seem all the huge orders
are day trading.

3904
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:12,320

 

3905
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,629

um seems flawed to me, but as I

3906
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:14,639
um seems flawed to me, but as I
 

3907
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,310
um seems flawed to me, but as I
understand institutions, it it doesn't

3908
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
understand institutions, it it doesn't
 

3909
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,830
understand institutions, it it doesn't
matter if they're day trading or swing

3910
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:17,840
matter if they're day trading or swing
 

3911
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,629
matter if they're day trading or swing
trading. Um it's where their pain point

3912
01:32:20,629 --> 01:32:20,639
trading. Um it's where their pain point
 

3913
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:22,950
trading. Um it's where their pain point
is. It's how the end of an auction

3914
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:22,960
is. It's how the end of an auction
 

3915
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,229
is. It's how the end of an auction
happens. Um maybe maybe all the buyers

3916
01:32:26,229 --> 01:32:26,239
happens. Um maybe maybe all the buyers
 

3917
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:27,910
happens. Um maybe maybe all the buyers
happened here, right, are just

3918
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:27,920
happened here, right, are just
 

3919
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,830
happened here, right, are just
absolutely accumulating. It's it's

3920
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:29,840
absolutely accumulating. It's it's
 

3921
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,510
absolutely accumulating. It's it's
possible and we're forced higher. It's

3922
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:31,520
possible and we're forced higher. It's
 

3923
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,669
possible and we're forced higher. It's
possible, but I'm going to trade where I

3924
01:32:33,669 --> 01:32:33,679
possible, but I'm going to trade where I
 

3925
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:35,910
possible, but I'm going to trade where I
think their pain point is. And most

3926
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:35,920
think their pain point is. And most
 

3927
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,229
think their pain point is. And most
people, you will find are getting late.

3928
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:38,239
people, you will find are getting late.
 

3929
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,629
people, you will find are getting late.
All right, back to P uh DC here. So, we

3930
01:32:40,629 --> 01:32:40,639
All right, back to P uh DC here. So, we
 

3931
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,550
All right, back to P uh DC here. So, we
just clo back to the close of yesterday

3932
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:42,560
just clo back to the close of yesterday
 

3933
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,790
just clo back to the close of yesterday
again. No trade opportunity here. So,

3934
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:44,800
again. No trade opportunity here. So,
 

3935
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,189
again. No trade opportunity here. So,
let's straight up straight back down. I

3936
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:47,199
let's straight up straight back down. I
 

3937
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,030
let's straight up straight back down. I
would have loved a fade, right? Once

3938
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,040
would have loved a fade, right? Once
 

3939
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,550
would have loved a fade, right? Once
we've done this move, I would have loved

3940
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,560
we've done this move, I would have loved
 

3941
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,510
we've done this move, I would have loved
a short back here for a TP1 and maybe in

3942
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:53,520
a short back here for a TP1 and maybe in
 

3943
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,110
a short back here for a TP1 and maybe in
the middle and then here, but it's not

3944
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,120
the middle and then here, but it's not
 

3945
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,110
the middle and then here, but it's not
offering it now. So, there's no trade up

3946
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
offering it now. So, there's no trade up
 

3947
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,950
offering it now. So, there's no trade up
here, folks. There's nothing I can do

3948
01:32:58,950 --> 01:32:58,960
here, folks. There's nothing I can do
 

3949
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,950
here, folks. There's nothing I can do
with this. It's not a great auction at

3950
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:00,960
with this. It's not a great auction at
 

3951
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,669
with this. It's not a great auction at
the high either.

3952
01:33:03,669 --> 01:33:03,679
the high either.
 

3953
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:14,629
the high either.
Flat top high. It's not perfect, really.

3954
01:33:14,629 --> 01:33:14,639

 

3955
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:17,350

Why was 900 a TP? Did you say uh because

3956
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:17,360
Why was 900 a TP? Did you say uh because
 

3957
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,470
Why was 900 a TP? Did you say uh because
it was previous day point of control,

3958
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:20,480
it was previous day point of control,
 

3959
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,990
it was previous day point of control,
right? So right here, this was fair

3960
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
right? So right here, this was fair
 

3961
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,430
right? So right here, this was fair
value from yesterday. All right, we came

3962
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:27,440
value from yesterday. All right, we came
 

3963
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,350
value from yesterday. All right, we came
we were in discount. Look, this is

3964
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:29,360
we were in discount. Look, this is
 

3965
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,110
we were in discount. Look, this is
previous day value area low. Let's think

3966
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:31,120
previous day value area low. Let's think
 

3967
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,350
previous day value area low. Let's think
what what's happened today. We drifted

3968
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
what what's happened today. We drifted
 

3969
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,270
what what's happened today. We drifted
way under value area low. We reclaimed

3970
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:35,280
way under value area low. We reclaimed
 

3971
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,750
way under value area low. We reclaimed
it. Okay, no acceptance lower. We chop,

3972
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:37,760
it. Okay, no acceptance lower. We chop,
 

3973
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,189
it. Okay, no acceptance lower. We chop,
we chop, we chop, we chop, we chop. And

3974
01:33:39,189 --> 01:33:39,199
we chop, we chop, we chop, we chop. And
 

3975
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:40,790
we chop, we chop, we chop, we chop. And
we go, hey, let's just see if

3976
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:40,800
we go, hey, let's just see if
 

3977
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,110
we go, hey, let's just see if
yesterday's fair value is still a good

3978
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:43,120
yesterday's fair value is still a good
 

3979
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,669
yesterday's fair value is still a good
value. We come up and they go, no, this

3980
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:45,679
value. We come up and they go, no, this
 

3981
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,750
value. We come up and they go, no, this
is actually too expensive today. Okay,

3982
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:47,760
is actually too expensive today. Okay,
 

3983
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,149
is actually too expensive today. Okay,
we're coming back down to today's fair

3984
01:33:50,149 --> 01:33:50,159
we're coming back down to today's fair
 

3985
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,270
we're coming back down to today's fair
value. P of the day, right? This is pre

3986
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
value. P of the day, right? This is pre
 

3987
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,030
value. P of the day, right? This is pre
previous week fair value as well. Right,

3988
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,040
previous week fair value as well. Right,
 

3989
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,189
previous week fair value as well. Right,
so this is why it's so choppy in here.

3990
01:33:57,189 --> 01:33:57,199
so this is why it's so choppy in here.
 

3991
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,950
so this is why it's so choppy in here.
If we lose this, we're going to come and

3992
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:58,960
If we lose this, we're going to come and
 

3993
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,430
If we lose this, we're going to come and
breeze visit previous days value low. If

3994
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:01,440
breeze visit previous days value low. If
 

3995
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,189
breeze visit previous days value low. If
they deem that too expensive, then we're

3996
01:34:03,189 --> 01:34:03,199
they deem that too expensive, then we're
 

3997
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,189
they deem that too expensive, then we're
going to revisit previous week's value

3998
01:34:05,189 --> 01:34:05,199
going to revisit previous week's value
 

3999
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,270
going to revisit previous week's value
low. If they deem that too cheap, then

4000
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:07,280
low. If they deem that too cheap, then
 

4001
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,870
low. If they deem that too cheap, then
we're going to bid back up off it. This

4002
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:08,880
we're going to bid back up off it. This
 

4003
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,350
we're going to bid back up off it. This
is just how an auction works. So the

4004
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
is just how an auction works. So the
 

4005
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,229
is just how an auction works. So the
reason 900 was a TP, yes, 900 whole

4006
01:34:14,229 --> 01:34:14,239
reason 900 was a TP, yes, 900 whole
 

4007
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:15,669
reason 900 was a TP, yes, 900 whole
number is important, but it was more

4008
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:15,679
number is important, but it was more
 

4009
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,910
number is important, but it was more
that this is here, right? That's why.

4010
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:17,920
that this is here, right? That's why.
 

4011
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,750
that this is here, right? That's why.
And this blue line was also important to

4012
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:19,760
And this blue line was also important to
 

4013
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,149
And this blue line was also important to
me. It's developing. It was a bit higher

4014
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:22,159
me. It's developing. It was a bit higher
 

4015
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,590
me. It's developing. It was a bit higher
at the time. It's the developing

4016
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:23,600
at the time. It's the developing
 

4017
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,629
at the time. It's the developing
profile. And what I really wanted to do

4018
01:34:26,629 --> 01:34:26,639
profile. And what I really wanted to do
 

4019
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,950
profile. And what I really wanted to do
was run

4020
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:28,960
was run
 

4021
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,430
was run
these stops. All right, this is where I

4022
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:31,440
these stops. All right, this is where I
 

4023
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,590
these stops. All right, this is where I
would have liked to have got a TP. All

4024
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:33,600
would have liked to have got a TP. All
 

4025
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,750
would have liked to have got a TP. All
right, when I was saying like 940, 950,

4026
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:35,760
right, when I was saying like 940, 950,
 

4027
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,110
right, when I was saying like 940, 950,
I would have loved to have just popped

4028
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,120
I would have loved to have just popped
 

4029
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,990
I would have loved to have just popped
up and run those stops out up here. All

4030
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,000
up and run those stops out up here. All
 

4031
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,910
up and run those stops out up here. All
right, look at this. Very, very, very

4032
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:41,920
right, look at this. Very, very, very
 

4033
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,910
right, look at this. Very, very, very
weak now. There's not a lot I can do

4034
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:43,920
weak now. There's not a lot I can do
 

4035
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,669
weak now. There's not a lot I can do
with this. There's not offering me a pot

4036
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:45,679
with this. There's not offering me a pot
 

4037
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:55,990
with this. There's not offering me a pot
to sell into here, unfortunately.

4038
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:56,000

 

4039
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,070

I draw everything myself, Enzo. Yeah.

4040
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,080
I draw everything myself, Enzo. Yeah.
 

4041
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,550
I draw everything myself, Enzo. Yeah.
All those all those are things I draw on

4042
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:00,560
All those all those are things I draw on
 

4043
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,870
All those all those are things I draw on
myself.

4044
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:02,880
myself.
 

4045
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:10,310
myself.
Yes. Yes.

4046
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:10,320

 

4047
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,990

So, right down to the New York open and

4048
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:12,000
So, right down to the New York open and
 

4049
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,669
So, right down to the New York open and
previous day low and previous day value

4050
01:35:13,669 --> 01:35:13,679
previous day low and previous day value
 

4051
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:15,510
previous day low and previous day value
are low again now. So, do we find

4052
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
are low again now. So, do we find
 

4053
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,270
are low again now. So, do we find
acceptance below this and come and fill

4054
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:17,280
acceptance below this and come and fill
 

4055
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,950
acceptance below this and come and fill
Why have we got gaps in here? Come on,

4056
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:18,960
Why have we got gaps in here? Come on,
 

4057
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:27,590
Why have we got gaps in here? Come on,
CME. Sort it out.

4058
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:27,600

 

4059
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:38,950

Trying to be patient here, folks.

4060
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:38,960

 

4061
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:48,790

Let's have a look. Some adjusted levels

4062
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800

 

4063
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:53,270

15 25

4064
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:53,280

 

4065
01:35:53,280 --> 01:36:00,629

Was

4066
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:00,639

 

4067
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:04,390

that a Tyson trade to VW up? Um, I mean,

4068
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:04,400
that a Tyson trade to VW up? Um, I mean,
 

4069
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,870
that a Tyson trade to VW up? Um, I mean,
how are you getting that though?

4070
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:06,880
how are you getting that though?
 

4071
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,390
how are you getting that though?
Tyson was probably looking for the same

4072
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:08,400
Tyson was probably looking for the same
 

4073
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,310
Tyson was probably looking for the same
as me once we failed under was probably

4074
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:10,320
as me once we failed under was probably
 

4075
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,030
as me once we failed under was probably
looking for this to sell back down,

4076
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:13,040
looking for this to sell back down,
 

4077
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,870
looking for this to sell back down,
right? It was the trade, but it didn't

4078
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
right? It was the trade, but it didn't
 

4079
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,310
right? It was the trade, but it didn't
give him the setup. The same thing we

4080
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,320
give him the setup. The same thing we
 

4081
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,709
give him the setup. The same thing we
were talking about pop up towards 50.

4082
01:36:18,709 --> 01:36:18,719
were talking about pop up towards 50.
 

4083
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,110
were talking about pop up towards 50.
Anything up towards 50 and and somewhere

4084
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:21,120
Anything up towards 50 and and somewhere
 

4085
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,350
Anything up towards 50 and and somewhere
up here to resell down would have been

4086
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:23,360
up here to resell down would have been
 

4087
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,629
up here to resell down would have been
Tyson's trade. Look above IB fail, but

4088
01:36:26,629 --> 01:36:26,639
Tyson's trade. Look above IB fail, but
 

4089
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:27,990
Tyson's trade. Look above IB fail, but
there's no there's no failed follow

4090
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:28,000
there's no there's no failed follow
 

4091
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,189
there's no there's no failed follow
through. Remember when we were here, I

4092
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:29,199
through. Remember when we were here, I
 

4093
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:30,709
through. Remember when we were here, I
said if we get a failed follow through

4094
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:30,719
said if we get a failed follow through
 

4095
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,310
said if we get a failed follow through
now, we will play short. If we get a

4096
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:32,320
now, we will play short. If we get a
 

4097
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,550
now, we will play short. If we get a
failed follow through, we play short. It

4098
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
failed follow through, we play short. It
 

4099
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,149
failed follow through, we play short. It
never gave us the opportunity. This is

4100
01:36:36,149 --> 01:36:36,159
never gave us the opportunity. This is
 

4101
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:38,229
never gave us the opportunity. This is
the thing today. Market's moving very

4107
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,109

What was the key level in the middle of

What was the key level in the middle of
 

4153
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:45,669
What was the key level in the middle of
the long candle? You said if it retested

4154
01:37:45,669 --> 01:37:45,679
the long candle? You said if it retested
 

4155
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,910
the long candle? You said if it retested
that you would have gotten short. Oh,

4156
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:47,920
that you would have gotten short. Oh,
 

4157
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,709

this this is initial balance.
 

4159
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:52,790
this this is initial balance.
This is the initial balance. All right.

4160
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:52,800
This is the initial balance. All right.
 

4161
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,870
This is the initial balance. All right.
And it's also a pivot like think about

4162
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
And it's also a pivot like think about
 

4163
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,950
And it's also a pivot like think about
structure, right? Think about messy

4164
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:56,960
structure, right? Think about messy
 

4165

4169
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:05,590

Right? We would have loved this,

4170
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:05,600
Right? We would have loved this,
 

4171
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,229
Right? We would have loved this,
wouldn't we? That's perfect. Back down

4172
01:38:08,229 --> 01:38:08,239
wouldn't we? That's perfect. Back down
 

4173
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:11,910
wouldn't we? That's perfect. Back down
to VWAP. TP1 would be here. TP2 would be

4174
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:11,920
to VWAP. TP1 would be here. TP2 would be
 

4175
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:15,510
to VWAP. TP1 would be here. TP2 would be
here. TP3 would be here. TP4 would be IB

low break and low. It' be an IB reversal

4178
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:18,320
low break and low. It' be an IB reversal
 

4179
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,790
low break and low. It' be an IB reversal
from IB high to IB low. If they reject

4180
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
from IB high to IB low. If they reject

B1,

4182
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:22,320
B1,
 

4183
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,830
B1,
if we had positioning, we could have

4184
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
if we had positioning, we could have
 

4185
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:28,950
if we had positioning, we could have
done that.

4186
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:28,960

 

4187
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,750

But we don't

4188
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:31,760
But we don't
 

4189
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,910
But we don't
cuz they've made our life very, very

4190
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:33,920
cuz they've made our life very, very
 

4191
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:57,830
cuz they've made our life very, very
hard.

4192
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:57,840

 

4193
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,790

Okay, here's the pop back up.

4194
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:02,800

 

4195
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:09,030

Can they make their mind up?

4196
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:09,040

 

4197
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,109

All right, back to pre previous week's

4198
01:39:11,109 --> 01:39:11,119
All right, back to pre previous week's
 

4199
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:14,870
All right, back to pre previous week's
point of control. What are we doing?

4200
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:14,880
point of control. What are we doing?
 

4201
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,709
point of control. What are we doing?
Can we decide what we're doing, please?

4202
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:18,719
Can we decide what we're doing, please?
 

4203
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:19,910
Can we decide what we're doing, please?
All right. So, where were those buyers

4204
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:19,920
All right. So, where were those buyers
 

4205
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,750
All right. So, where were those buyers
stuck? 25s, 29s over that gets a little

4206
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:23,760
stuck? 25s, 29s over that gets a little
 

4207
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,350
stuck? 25s, 29s over that gets a little
bit thin.

4208
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:27,360

 

4209
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:31,189

Back in this chop zone. Then we go 800s

4210
01:39:31,189 --> 01:39:31,199
Back in this chop zone. Then we go 800s
 

4211
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,030
Back in this chop zone. Then we go 800s
again. So, they do they come to 25s and

4212
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:33,040
again. So, they do they come to 25s and
 

4213
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,590
again. So, they do they come to 25s and
29s. And do they lift right back to IB?

4214
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:35,600
29s. And do they lift right back to IB?
 

4215
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,470
29s. And do they lift right back to IB?
And it's very, very thin above the 25s

4216
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:38,480
And it's very, very thin above the 25s
 

4217
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,790
And it's very, very thin above the 25s
and 29s from before. So, let's see if

4218
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:40,800
and 29s from before. So, let's see if
 

4219
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,350
and 29s from before. So, let's see if
they push and fail here or if they lift.

4220
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:43,360
they push and fail here or if they lift.
 

4221
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:47,109
they push and fail here or if they lift.
The S looks pretty strong here.

4222
01:39:47,109 --> 01:39:47,119
The S looks pretty strong here.
 

4223
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:48,550
The S looks pretty strong here.
It's where the buyers were caught.

4224
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:48,560
It's where the buyers were caught.
 

4225
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,629
It's where the buyers were caught.
Remember, we can think about a short up

4226
01:39:50,629 --> 01:39:50,639
Remember, we can think about a short up
 

4227
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,030
Remember, we can think about a short up
here if we start rejecting. We have got

4228
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:53,040
here if we start rejecting. We have got
 

4229
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,750
here if we start rejecting. We have got
point of control here at 800s again

4230
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:57,760
point of control here at 800s again
 

4231
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,470
point of control here at 800s again
under the 800s. Oh, it's very tempting

4232
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:00,480
under the 800s. Oh, it's very tempting
 

4233
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,870
under the 800s. Oh, it's very tempting
here to take a short honestly. Looking

4234
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:02,880
here to take a short honestly. Looking
 

4235
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,950
here to take a short honestly. Looking
at these guys here, I'm hoping we lift

4236
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:04,960
at these guys here, I'm hoping we lift
 

4237
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,709
at these guys here, I'm hoping we lift
up into these and then see them get

4238
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:06,719
up into these and then see them get
 

4239
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,390
up into these and then see them get
stuck again is what I'm trying. But

4240
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,400
stuck again is what I'm trying. But
 

4241
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,310
stuck again is what I'm trying. But
market's so weak, it won't lift up into

4242
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:10,320
market's so weak, it won't lift up into
 

4243
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:26,790
market's so weak, it won't lift up into
it.

4244
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:26,800

 

4245
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,790

I think I've just found my mentor for

4246
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:28,800
I think I've just found my mentor for
 

4247
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,870
I think I've just found my mentor for
life. Been wasting money on courses and

4248
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:30,880
life. Been wasting money on courses and
 

4249
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,950
life. Been wasting money on courses and
other people trying to learn what I

4250
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:32,960
other people trying to learn what I
 

4251
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,310
other people trying to learn what I
later would have learned from YouTube.

4252
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:34,320
later would have learned from YouTube.
 

4253
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,149
later would have learned from YouTube.
Looking forward looking forward to

01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,270

How long did it take me to master

4260
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:45,280
How long did it take me to master
 

4261
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,709
How long did it take me to master
orderflow? Um, it's a good question. I I

4262
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:48,719
orderflow? Um, it's a good question. I I
 

4263
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:49,910
orderflow? Um, it's a good question. I I
don't know. I couldn't put time on it.

4264
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:49,920
don't know. I couldn't put time on it.
 

4265
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,350
don't know. I couldn't put time on it.
Not too long.

4266
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:53,360

 

4267
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,070

Not too long. I've been trading a long

4268
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:56,080
Not too long. I've been trading a long
 

4269
01:40:56,080 --> 01:41:00,149
Not too long. I've been trading a long
time, though.

4270
01:41:00,149 --> 01:41:00,159

 

4271
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:01,510

What do I think the market is opening

4272
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:01,520
What do I think the market is opening
 

4273
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,030
What do I think the market is opening
24/7? I don't think it'll make a

4274
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,040
24/7? I don't think it'll make a
 

4275
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,550
24/7? I don't think it'll make a
difference, honestly. I think since co

4276
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:06,560
difference, honestly. I think since co
 

4277
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,709
difference, honestly. I think since co
I talked to a friend in chat about this

4278
01:41:08,709 --> 01:41:08,719
I talked to a friend in chat about this
 

4279
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:10,070
I talked to a friend in chat about this
yesterday. Since COVID, I think

4280
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,080
yesterday. Since COVID, I think
 

4281
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,910
yesterday. Since COVID, I think
everything has been skewed to make those

4282
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:11,920
everything has been skewed to make those
 

4283
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,590
everything has been skewed to make those
who understand markets make more money.

4284
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:13,600
who understand markets make more money.
 

4285
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,109
who understand markets make more money.
So, opening 24/7, what does that do? You

4286
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:17,119
So, opening 24/7, what does that do? You
 

4287
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:18,629
So, opening 24/7, what does that do? You
might think it like provides more

4288
01:41:18,629 --> 01:41:18,639
might think it like provides more
 

4289
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:19,990
might think it like provides more
liquidity and all this stuff, which is

4290
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:20,000
liquidity and all this stuff, which is
 

4291
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,830
liquidity and all this stuff, which is
true. Same with zero DTE, which came in

4292
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:21,840
true. Same with zero DTE, which came in
 

4293
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,910
true. Same with zero DTE, which came in
in 2022, right? So, we did STEMI checks

4294
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:23,920
in 2022, right? So, we did STEMI checks
 

4295
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,990
in 2022, right? So, we did STEMI checks
21, zero DTE 2022. Surprised I'm not.

4296
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,000
21, zero DTE 2022. Surprised I'm not.
 

4297
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,830
21, zero DTE 2022. Surprised I'm not.
And now we're going to 24-hour markets.

4298
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:29,840
And now we're going to 24-hour markets.
 

4299
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,470
And now we're going to 24-hour markets.
What does that open? Oh, mister. I just

4300
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,480
What does that open? Oh, mister. I just
 

4301
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,870
What does that open? Oh, mister. I just
got [\h__\h] hammered in a bar. Had an

4302
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:34,880
got [\h__\h] hammered in a bar. Had an
 

4303
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,350
got [\h__\h] hammered in a bar. Had an
argument. going to go and uh start

4304
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:37,360
argument. going to go and uh start
 

4305
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,590
argument. going to go and uh start
placing, you know, positions when I'm

4306
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:39,600
placing, you know, positions when I'm
 

4307
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,470
placing, you know, positions when I'm
absolutely shitfaced. That's what that

4308
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,480
absolutely shitfaced. That's what that
 

4309
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,709
absolutely shitfaced. That's what that
opens up. What does that mean? More

4310
01:41:44,709 --> 01:41:44,719
opens up. What does that mean? More
 

4311
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:46,070
opens up. What does that mean? More
opportunity for those who know what

4312
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,080
opportunity for those who know what
 

4313
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,390
opportunity for those who know what
they're doing. I honest that's not about

4314
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:48,400
they're doing. I honest that's not about
 

4315
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,030
they're doing. I honest that's not about
me saying for me. I think that's that's

4316
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:51,040
me saying for me. I think that's that's
 

4317
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:57,910
me saying for me. I think that's that's
the big game.

4318
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:57,920

 

4319
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,189

Uh I'll take a buzz cap DACA. Thanks.

4320
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:01,199
Uh I'll take a buzz cap DACA. Thanks.
 

4321
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,229
Uh I'll take a buzz cap DACA. Thanks.
All right. We're trying to come into

4322
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:02,239
All right. We're trying to come into
 

4323
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:03,910
All right. We're trying to come into
where these buyers were trapped. Want to

4324
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:03,920
where these buyers were trapped. Want to
 

4325
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,070
where these buyers were trapped. Want to
see how we act here to into 25s and 30s.

4326
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:08,080
see how we act here to into 25s and 30s.
 

4327
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,910
see how we act here to into 25s and 30s.
If they lift, they'll go up to the IB,

4328
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:09,920
If they lift, they'll go up to the IB,
 

4329
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,310
If they lift, they'll go up to the IB,
but I want to see if we do trap more

4330
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:12,320
but I want to see if we do trap more
 

4331
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,070
but I want to see if we do trap more
buyers here and then sell through back

4332
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:14,080
buyers here and then sell through back
 

4333
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,550
buyers here and then sell through back
under the 800s. But they can lift all

4334
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:16,560
under the 800s. But they can lift all
 

4335
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,870
under the 800s. But they can lift all
the way up here. So, we know sort of 25s

4336
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:20,880
the way up here. So, we know sort of 25s
 

4337
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,950
the way up here. So, we know sort of 25s
and 30 is a big level. If they lift

4338
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:22,960
and 30 is a big level. If they lift
 

4339
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,550
and 30 is a big level. If they lift
through that, they can squeeze all the

4340
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:24,560
through that, they can squeeze all the
 

4341
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,030
through that, they can squeeze all the
way back up to 70s.

4342
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:27,040
way back up to 70s.
 

4343
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,390
way back up to 70s.
We we'll just see. We'll just see what

4344
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,400
We we'll just see. We'll just see what
 

4345
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:35,590
We we'll just see. We'll just see what
how we go here.

4346
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:35,600

 

4347
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:40,470

into where these buyers were caught.

4348
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:40,480

 

4349
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,669

This is where the buyers were caught.

4350
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:41,679
This is where the buyers were caught.
 

4351
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:43,109
This is where the buyers were caught.
The question is now, do they fail here

4352
01:42:43,109 --> 01:42:43,119
The question is now, do they fail here
 

4353
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:48,709
The question is now, do they fail here
or do we start squeezing

4354
01:42:48,709 --> 01:42:48,719

 

4355
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,669

tapping that 30s? They squeeze, they can

4356
01:42:51,669 --> 01:42:51,679
tapping that 30s? They squeeze, they can
 

4357
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:55,910
tapping that 30s? They squeeze, they can
run it to 70s, 870s up here

4358
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:55,920
run it to 70s, 870s up here
 

4359
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,350
run it to 70s, 870s up here
above this. Now, can they come all the

4360
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,360
above this. Now, can they come all the
 

4361
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,950
above this. Now, can they come all the
way up here or we going to get stuck

4362
01:42:58,950 --> 01:42:58,960
way up here or we going to get stuck
 

4363
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,709
way up here or we going to get stuck
right into this level 30s? Here comes

4364
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:00,719
right into this level 30s? Here comes
 

4365
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:01,910
right into this level 30s? Here comes
the squeeze. They're trying to squeeze.

4366
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:01,920
the squeeze. They're trying to squeeze.
 

4367
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:02,870
the squeeze. They're trying to squeeze.
I'm not going to play the squeeze. I'm

4368
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:02,880
I'm not going to play the squeeze. I'm
 

4369
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,149
I'm not going to play the squeeze. I'm
going to wait to see if they trap buyers

4370
01:43:04,149 --> 01:43:04,159
going to wait to see if they trap buyers
 

4371
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,990
going to wait to see if they trap buyers
for the short. So, I'm going to wait and

4372
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:06,000
for the short. So, I'm going to wait and
 

4373
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,910
for the short. So, I'm going to wait and
see if it happens.

4374
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:11,920

 

4375
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,550

50s is an interesting level. Somewhere

4376
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:14,560
50s is an interesting level. Somewhere
 

4377
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,790
50s is an interesting level. Somewhere
between 50s and 70s is an interesting

4378
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:16,800
between 50s and 70s is an interesting
 

4379
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:38,950
between 50s and 70s is an interesting
level in my mind.

4380
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:38,960

 

4381
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,470

can repric this whole thing if they

4382
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
can repric this whole thing if they
 

4383
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:45,830
can repric this whole thing if they
really want be gross but they could

4384
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:45,840
really want be gross but they could
 

4385
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,550
really want be gross but they could
right buyers now comfortable over 25s so

4386
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:48,560
right buyers now comfortable over 25s so
 

4387
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:52,310
right buyers now comfortable over 25s so
back under that they'd be uncomfortable

4388
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:52,320
back under that they'd be uncomfortable
 

4389
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,790
back under that they'd be uncomfortable
so is this Look above into this level.

4390
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:54,800
so is this Look above into this level.
 

4391
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,470
so is this Look above into this level.
I'm watching this now. If they start to

4392
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:56,480
I'm watching this now. If they start to
 

4393
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,709
I'm watching this now. If they start to
fail right into these 25s again, right?

4394
01:43:58,709 --> 01:43:58,719
fail right into these 25s again, right?
 

4395
01:43:58,719 --> 01:43:59,830
fail right into these 25s again, right?
Like I said, this is where the buyers

4396
01:43:59,830 --> 01:43:59,840
Like I said, this is where the buyers
 

4397
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,669
Like I said, this is where the buyers
are comfortable in the 25s. If we start

4398
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:01,679
are comfortable in the 25s. If we start
 

4399
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,470
are comfortable in the 25s. If we start
failing this, we will see a wash.

4400
01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:04,480
failing this, we will see a wash.
 

4401
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,950
failing this, we will see a wash.
I'm watching this now very, very, very

4402
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:06,960
I'm watching this now very, very, very
 

4403
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,870
I'm watching this now very, very, very
carefully for the short here. Here we go

4404
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:10,880
carefully for the short here. Here we go
 

4405
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,510
carefully for the short here. Here we go
in now. Looking for expansion. Can we

4406
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:13,520
in now. Looking for expansion. Can we
 

4407
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,270
in now. Looking for expansion. Can we
see expansion back down under value area

4408
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:15,280
see expansion back down under value area
 

4409
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,950
see expansion back down under value area
high?

4410
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:16,960
high?
 

4411
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:22,790
high?
Come on, baby.

4412
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:22,800

 

4413
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:28,790

Nice. Let's get under the 800s now.

4414
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:28,800

 

4415
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,030

Nice. Let's go. Let's go. Get out of my

4416
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:33,040
Nice. Let's go. Let's go. Get out of my
 

4417
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,830
Nice. Let's go. Let's go. Get out of my
[\h__\h] way, baby.

4418
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:35,840
[\h__\h] way, baby.
 

4419
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,830
[\h__\h] way, baby.
Let's go. Let's see expansion lower.

4420
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:37,840
Let's go. Let's see expansion lower.
 

4421
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,109
Let's go. Let's see expansion lower.
Now, this is the failed follow through

4422
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:39,119
Now, this is the failed follow through
 

4423
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:40,709
Now, this is the failed follow through
that I was looking up for. This is what

4424
01:44:40,709 --> 01:44:40,719
that I was looking up for. This is what
 

4425
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:42,470
that I was looking up for. This is what
we just talked about. Right. Covering

4426
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:42,480
we just talked about. Right. Covering
 

4427
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,790
we just talked about. Right. Covering
some 800s. If we get acceptance under

4428
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:44,800
some 800s. If we get acceptance under
 

4429
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,270
some 800s. If we get acceptance under
800s, I'll look down into here. So,

4430
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,280
800s, I'll look down into here. So,
 

4431
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:52,790
800s, I'll look down into here. So,
there's like a quick 5040 pointer there.

4432
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:52,800

 

4433
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,709

We need to stay heavy here at 25 or I'm

4434
01:44:54,709 --> 01:44:54,719
We need to stay heavy here at 25 or I'm
 

4435
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:57,510
We need to stay heavy here at 25 or I'm
out

4436
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:57,520
out
 

4437
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:00,470
out
again. [\h__\h] me. So, at least I got a

4438
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
again. [\h__\h] me. So, at least I got a
 

4439
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,109
again. [\h__\h] me. So, at least I got a
decent lot lot out here. So, like I

4440
01:45:03,109 --> 01:45:03,119
decent lot lot out here. So, like I
 

4441
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,430
decent lot lot out here. So, like I
said, into here was interesting for me.

4442
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:05,440
said, into here was interesting for me.
 

4443
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,350
said, into here was interesting for me.
If we trap more buyers, we did. They got

4444
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:07,360
If we trap more buyers, we did. They got
 

4445
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,109
If we trap more buyers, we did. They got
stuck again. We just washed right back

4446
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:09,119
stuck again. We just washed right back
 

4447
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:10,550
stuck again. We just washed right back
down to previous week point of control.

4448
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:10,560
down to previous week point of control.
 

4449
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,870
down to previous week point of control.
There might still be follow through. Um,

4450
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:12,880
There might still be follow through. Um,
 

4451
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,390
There might still be follow through. Um,
again, I'm just watching the order flow.

4452
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:14,400
again, I'm just watching the order flow.
 

4453
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,990
again, I'm just watching the order flow.
I have to be quick here. You You guys

4454
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:16,000
I have to be quick here. You You guys
 

4455
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,229
I have to be quick here. You You guys
might be like, why why why? I can only

4456
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:18,239
might be like, why why why? I can only
 

4457
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:19,669
might be like, why why why? I can only
react to what I'm seeing on the tape.

4458
01:45:19,669 --> 01:45:19,679
react to what I'm seeing on the tape.
 

4459
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,350
react to what I'm seeing on the tape.
Okay, these were the buyers that were

4460
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:21,360
Okay, these were the buyers that were
 

4461
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,109
Okay, these were the buyers that were
caught. We popped over them. We trapped

4462
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:23,119
caught. We popped over them. We trapped
 

4463
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:25,109
caught. We popped over them. We trapped
more buyers into 44. Sellers came in at

4464
01:45:25,109 --> 01:45:25,119
more buyers into 44. Sellers came in at
 

4465
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:27,430
more buyers into 44. Sellers came in at
36. We sold through. We cover some into

4466
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,440
36. We sold through. We cover some into
 

4467
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,350
36. We sold through. We cover some into
this buyer here who was comfortable at

4468
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:29,360
this buyer here who was comfortable at
 

4469
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,830
this buyer here who was comfortable at
96s. Right under that, I think there's a

4470
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:31,840
96s. Right under that, I think there's a
 

4471
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,870
96s. Right under that, I think there's a
wash back down to 71s.

4472
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
wash back down to 71s.
 

4473
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,709
wash back down to 71s.
Okay. Where this buyer came in this

4474
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:36,719
Okay. Where this buyer came in this
 

4475
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:38,470
Okay. Where this buyer came in this
morning. All right. So, if we get follow

4476
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:38,480
morning. All right. So, if we get follow
 

4477
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,910
morning. All right. So, if we get follow
through again now downside, it'll be

4478
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:39,920
through again now downside, it'll be
 

4479
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,310
through again now downside, it'll be
71s. If they keep bidding up here, they

4480
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:42,320
71s. If they keep bidding up here, they
 

4481
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,470
71s. If they keep bidding up here, they
can go to ibeh high. I'm out of it

4482
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:44,480
can go to ibeh high. I'm out of it
 

4483
01:45:44,480 --> 01:46:00,629
can go to ibeh high. I'm out of it
again. So, I need to wait now.

4484
01:46:00,629 --> 01:46:00,639

 

4485
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:04,950

603 QQQ key level uh on Gex just so you

4486
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:04,960
603 QQQ key level uh on Gex just so you
 

4487
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:09,830
603 QQQ key level uh on Gex just so you
know

4488
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:09,840

 

4489
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,109

850 key level NQ

4490
01:46:13,109 --> 01:46:13,119
850 key level NQ
 

4491
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:19,669
850 key level NQ
on Gex second Cool wall

4492
01:46:19,669 --> 01:46:19,679

 

4493
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:21,910

850 is the call wall right now. Over

4494
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:21,920
850 is the call wall right now. Over
 

4495
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,470
850 is the call wall right now. Over
that they can maybe lift to uh 25,000.

4496
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:26,480
that they can maybe lift to uh 25,000.
 

4497
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,790
that they can maybe lift to uh 25,000.
I wouldn't bet on it.

4498
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:28,800
I wouldn't bet on it.
 

4499
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,390
I wouldn't bet on it.
I'm going to move this now folks because

4500
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:30,400
I'm going to move this now folks because
 

4501
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,189
I'm going to move this now folks because
we put this red line in up here. Right.

4502
01:46:33,189 --> 01:46:33,199
we put this red line in up here. Right.
 

4503
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:38,070
we put this red line in up here. Right.
Clean these charts up a bit.

4504
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:38,080

 

4505
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,430

Right back to the same level that we

4506
01:46:39,430 --> 01:46:39,440
Right back to the same level that we
 

4507
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,629
Right back to the same level that we
talked about before. 25s and 30s.

4508
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:42,639
talked about before. 25s and 30s.
 

4509
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,470
talked about before. 25s and 30s.
Getting

4510
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:46,480

 

4511
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,350

stuck here again and just rotating a

4512
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:49,360
stuck here again and just rotating a
 

4513
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,950
stuck here again and just rotating a
little bit here. It's a little bit messy

4514
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:50,960
little bit here. It's a little bit messy
 

4515
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,390
little bit here. It's a little bit messy
here. I'm not going to lie. Back to

4516
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:52,400
here. I'm not going to lie. Back to
 

4517
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:53,910
here. I'm not going to lie. Back to
point of control again, the 800. So,

4518
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:53,920
point of control again, the 800. So,
 

4519
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,990
point of control again, the 800. So,
we're in like a 25 30 point rotation

4520
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:56,000
we're in like a 25 30 point rotation
 

4521
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,510
we're in like a 25 30 point rotation
here for a little bit while they build

4522
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:57,520
here for a little bit while they build
 

4523
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,590
here for a little bit while they build
out some liquidity, make their mind up

4524
01:46:59,590 --> 01:46:59,600
out some liquidity, make their mind up
 

4525
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,310
out some liquidity, make their mind up
what it is they want to do. Do they want

4526
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:02,320
what it is they want to do. Do they want
 

4527
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,709
what it is they want to do. Do they want
to reclaim and squeeze or they going to

4528
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:04,719
to reclaim and squeeze or they going to
 

4529
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:06,950
to reclaim and squeeze or they going to
reject everything over 20s to 50s and

4530
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:06,960
reject everything over 20s to 50s and
 

4531
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,950
reject everything over 20s to 50s and
fold it back down into this range? If we

4532
01:47:08,950 --> 01:47:08,960
fold it back down into this range? If we
 

4533
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,430
fold it back down into this range? If we
get come back into this range, we do the

4534
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:11,440
get come back into this range, we do the
 

4535
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,030
get come back into this range, we do the
same move that we did here. But maybe

4536
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:13,040
same move that we did here. But maybe
 

4537
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,790
same move that we did here. But maybe
there's an argument to to lift a bit and

4538
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:14,800
there's an argument to to lift a bit and
 

4539
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:26,390
there's an argument to to lift a bit and
trap. We'll see.

4540
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:26,400

 

4541
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,830

There's the eights.

4542
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:29,840
There's the eights.
 

4543
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:43,109
There's the eights.
They left against 25s.

4544
01:47:43,109 --> 01:47:43,119

 

4545
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:45,510

We go back to 25s.

4546
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:45,520
We go back to 25s.
 

4547
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,030
We go back to 25s.
Buyers getting caught again in that last

4548
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:47,040
Buyers getting caught again in that last
 

4549
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,590
Buyers getting caught again in that last
candle on the 25s.

4550
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:49,600
candle on the 25s.
 

4551
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,350
candle on the 25s.
They keep stepping in there above 20s.

4552
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:51,360
They keep stepping in there above 20s.
 

4553
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,189
They keep stepping in there above 20s.
They're not finding acceptance above 20s

4554
01:47:53,189 --> 01:47:53,199
They're not finding acceptance above 20s
 

4555
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:55,270
They're not finding acceptance above 20s
yet. I'd be very, very careful though.

4556
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:55,280
yet. I'd be very, very careful though.
 

4557
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,709
yet. I'd be very, very careful though.
All they need to do is one big candle

4558
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:56,719
All they need to do is one big candle
 

4559
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:04,390
All they need to do is one big candle
and it will wreck a lot of people.

4560
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:04,400

this is the initial balance low. It's
 

4591
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:53,590
this is the initial balance low. It's
the high and low of the first hour of

01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:42,320
trying to force a little squeeze out to
 

4613
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:45,350
trying to force a little squeeze out to
50s and 70s here. We're pretty thin

4614
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:45,360
50s and 70s here. We're pretty thin
 

4615
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:47,669
50s and 70s here. We're pretty thin
above this, honestly. All the way up to

4616
01:49:47,669 --> 01:49:47,679
above this, honestly. All the way up to
 

4617
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:51,030
above this, honestly. All the way up to

905s. We get kind of thin.
There's the attempt to get back to 50s

4620
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:52,800
There's the attempt to get back to 50s
 

4621
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,310
There's the attempt to get back to 50s
again.

4622
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:54,320
again.
 

4623
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:56,790
again.
ES just hit IB high there, folks. So, we

4624
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:56,800
ES just hit IB high there, folks. So, we
 

4625
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,870
ES just hit IB high there, folks. So, we
just attempted to get 50s. ES hit IB

4626
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:58,880
just attempted to get 50s. ES hit IB
 

4627
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,870
just attempted to get 50s. ES hit IB
high. We're now trying to base over

4628
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
high. We're now trying to base over
 

4629
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,950
high. We're now trying to base over
value area high now. So, they're going

4630
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:02,960
value area high now. So, they're going
 

4631
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,550
value area high now. So, they're going
to try and force this up by the looks of

4632
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:04,560
to try and force this up by the looks of
 

4633
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,790
to try and force this up by the looks of
it.

4634
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:06,800
it.
 

4635
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,550
it.
Do they trap into 50s? And do we get

4636
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:08,560
Do they trap into 50s? And do we get
 

4637
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,470
Do they trap into 50s? And do we get
another short opportunity? Back to value

4638
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:10,480
another short opportunity? Back to value
 

4639
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,070
another short opportunity? Back to value
area high again. Can we get a short

4640
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:12,080
area high again. Can we get a short
 

4641
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:25,830
area high again. Can we get a short
opportunity here

4642
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:25,840

 

4643
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,430

again? I really don't know what they

4644
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:27,440
again? I really don't know what they
 

4645
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,629
again? I really don't know what they
want to do with this. I want to see this

4646
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:28,639
want to do with this. I want to see this
 

4647
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:30,550
want to do with this. I want to see this
dump. Honestly, we just tagged 50s. It's

4648
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:30,560

4649
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,310

just like I'd like one more trap, but we

4650
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,320
just like I'd like one more trap, but we
 

4651
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,629
just like I'd like one more trap, but we
just caught more buyers up there again.

4652
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:34,639
just caught more buyers up there again.
 

4653
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:37,030
just caught more buyers up there again.
Here it comes. Are they going to go 800s

4654
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,040
Here it comes. Are they going to go 800s
 

4655
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,550
Here it comes. Are they going to go 800s

4656
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:38,560
now?
 

4657
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,350
now?
808 is where that buyer is. So, we got

4658
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:41,360
808 is where that buyer is. So, we got
 

4659
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,990
808 is where that buyer is. So, we got
buyers caught now. 825, 8:30, 808. Oh,

sweep up there, you dirty dog. NQ. You
dirty dog. I want it somewhere up here,

4672
01:50:59,910 --> 01:50:59,920
dirty dog. I want it somewhere up here,
 

4673
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,990
dirty dog. I want it somewhere up here,
guys. I really want to see bulls be

4674
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:02,000
guys. I really want to see bulls be
 

4675
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,669
guys. I really want to see bulls be
trapped up here. So, what I'm looking

4676
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:03,679
trapped up here. So, what I'm looking
 

4677
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:05,510
trapped up here. So, what I'm looking
for is a bull trap up here. I want to

4678
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:05,520
for is a bull trap up here. I want to
 

4679
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,070
for is a bull trap up here. I want to
see buy delta heavy heavy heavy 50 to

4680
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:08,080
see buy delta heavy heavy heavy 50 to
 

4681
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,990
see buy delta heavy heavy heavy 50 to
here. And if they get trapped and we

4682
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:10,000
here. And if they get trapped and we
 

4683
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,149
here. And if they get trapped and we
move CBD down, then I will look for that

4684
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:12,159
move CBD down, then I will look for that
 

4685
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:14,470
move CBD down, then I will look for that
rotation for TP1. I don't One thing we

4686
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:14,480
rotation for TP1. I don't One thing we
 

4687
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,709
rotation for TP1. I don't One thing we
need to be careful of is value is moving

4688
01:51:16,709 --> 01:51:16,719
need to be careful of is value is moving
 

4689
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,070
need to be careful of is value is moving
up. So, it's going to be a support

4690
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:18,080
up. So, it's going to be a support
 

4691
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,590
up. So, it's going to be a support
mechanism more and more and more. We

4692
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:19,600
mechanism more and more and more. We
 

4693
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:22,149
mechanism more and more and more. We
need to be careful of that. Very careful

4694
01:51:22,149 --> 01:51:22,159
need to be careful of that. Very careful
 

4695
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:26,629
need to be careful of that. Very careful
of that.

4696
01:51:26,629 --> 01:51:26,639

 

4697
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:27,830

you shorted this level five times.

4698
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:27,840
you shorted this level five times.
 

4699
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,030
you shorted this level five times.
That's what I mean. If you're a range

4700
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:29,040
That's what I mean. If you're a range
 

4701
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,950
That's what I mean. If you're a range
trader, if you're willing to scalp like

01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:28,400
coming in here at IB. 100 lot coming in
 

4859
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,550
coming in here at IB. 100 lot coming in
here at IB. And if they get over him,

4860
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,560
here at IB. And if they get over him,
 

4861
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:31,669
here at IB. And if they get over him,
they're going to look for a squeeze all

4862
01:54:31,669 --> 01:54:31,679
they're going to look for a squeeze all
 

4863
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,350
they're going to look for a squeeze all
the way back up to 900. So they might

4864
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:33,360
the way back up to 900. So they might
 

4865
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:34,790
the way back up to 900. So they might
reverse this whole thing because sellers

4866
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:34,800
reverse this whole thing because sellers
 

4867
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,430
reverse this whole thing because sellers
have got too aggressive too early. So my

4868
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:37,440
have got too aggressive too early. So my
 

4869
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,669
have got too aggressive too early. So my
short thesis at the moment not giving me

4870
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:39,679
short thesis at the moment not giving me
 

4871
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:41,510
short thesis at the moment not giving me
an opportunity to entry because of what

4872
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:41,520
an opportunity to entry because of what
 

4873
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,870
an opportunity to entry because of what
I'm seeing on the tape. All right, this

4874
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:42,880
I'm seeing on the tape. All right, this
 

4875
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,390
I'm seeing on the tape. All right, this
is why I'm not going to just short a

4876
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,400
is why I'm not going to just short a
 

4877
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:47,189
is why I'm not going to just short a
level. So I now know a seller is caught

4878
01:54:47,189 --> 01:54:47,199
level. So I now know a seller is caught
 

4879
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:50,470
level. So I now know a seller is caught
at 854 and another one at 868. All

4880
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:50,480
at 854 and another one at 868. All
 

4881
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:51,910
at 854 and another one at 868. All
right. So, we need to get under those

4882
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:51,920
right. So, we need to get under those
 

4883
01:54:51,920 --> 01:55:08,229
right. So, we need to get under those
levels for them to be comfortable.

4884
01:55:08,229 --> 01:55:08,239

 

4885
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:09,750

Still protecting these guys at the

4886
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:09,760
Still protecting these guys at the
 

4887
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,350
Still protecting these guys at the
moment.

4888
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:11,360
moment.
 

4889
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,629
moment.
So, maybe they're going to come for the

4890
01:55:12,629 --> 01:55:12,639
So, maybe they're going to come for the
 

4891
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:23,270
So, maybe they're going to come for the
900s and the imbalances above now.

4892
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:23,280

 

4893
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,709

That's where that seller just came in.

4894
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:24,719
That's where that seller just came in.
 

4895
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:27,030
That's where that seller just came in.
That exact level 54s. This is where that

4896
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:27,040
That exact level 54s. This is where that
 

4897
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,189
That exact level 54s. This is where that
big seller came in. They need to get

4898
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:29,199
big seller came in. They need to get
 

4899
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:32,229
big seller came in. They need to get
under this for him to be comfortable. If

4900
01:55:32,229 --> 01:55:32,239
under this for him to be comfortable. If
 

4901
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:35,830
under this for him to be comfortable. If
they hold this, he is caught.

4902
01:55:35,830 --> 01:55:35,840
they hold this, he is caught.
 

4903
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:48,629
they hold this, he is caught.
So far, they're holding it.

4904
01:55:48,629 --> 01:55:48,639

 

4905
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:50,310

What platform do I use for Dom and

4906
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:50,320
What platform do I use for Dom and
 

4907
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:51,910
What platform do I use for Dom and
footprints? Ninja. Yeah, Ninja and

4908
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:51,920
footprints? Ninja. Yeah, Ninja and
 

4909
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,510
footprints? Ninja. Yeah, Ninja and
Bookmat. I have it on Trading View as

4910
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:53,520
Bookmat. I have it on Trading View as
 

4911
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,030
Bookmat. I have it on Trading View as
well, but I'd watch it on Ninja and

4912
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:55,040
well, but I'd watch it on Ninja and
 

4913
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,669
well, but I'd watch it on Ninja and
Bookmat.

4914
01:55:57,669 --> 01:55:57,679
Bookmat.
 

4915
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:58,950
Bookmat.
Looking for the squeeze back up. So,

4916
01:55:58,950 --> 01:55:58,960
Looking for the squeeze back up. So,
 

4917
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,790
Looking for the squeeze back up. So,
that seller is absolutely caught there

4918
01:56:00,790 --> 01:56:00,800
that seller is absolutely caught there
 

4919
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,589
that seller is absolutely caught there
into 54s. Right. So, they re they he

4920
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:03,599
into 54s. Right. So, they re they he
 

4921
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:05,830
into 54s. Right. So, they re they he
came in here, they retapped him. He's

4922
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:05,840
came in here, they retapped him. He's
 

4923
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:07,990
came in here, they retapped him. He's
stuck. If he remains stuck, especially

4924
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:08,000
stuck. If he remains stuck, especially
 

4925
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,070
stuck. If he remains stuck, especially
because he added at 69, then there is a

4926
01:56:10,070 --> 01:56:10,080
because he added at 69, then there is a
 

4927
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,270
because he added at 69, then there is a
squeeze out to previous day point

4928
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
squeeze out to previous day point
 

4929
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,669
squeeze out to previous day point
control 900s. If they break through the

4930
01:56:13,669 --> 01:56:13,679
control 900s. If they break through the
 

4931
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:16,229
control 900s. If they break through the
900s, all right, then again, it's the

4932
01:56:16,229 --> 01:56:16,239
900s, all right, then again, it's the
 

4933
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:17,750
900s, all right, then again, it's the
same trade we were looking for earlier.

4934
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:17,760
same trade we were looking for earlier.
 

4935
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:21,109
same trade we were looking for earlier.
It's possible to get up to 25,000. So 25

4936
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:21,119
It's possible to get up to 25,000. So 25
 

4937
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:25,830
It's possible to get up to 25,000. So 25
uh 24 950 or 24 946 then 25,000. This

4938
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:25,840
uh 24 950 or 24 946 then 25,000. This
 

4939
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,910
uh 24 950 or 24 946 then 25,000. This
same thing we were looking for earlier.

4940
01:56:27,910 --> 01:56:27,920
same thing we were looking for earlier.
 

4941
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,229
same thing we were looking for earlier.
They might do it now off a similar area,

4942
01:56:30,229 --> 01:56:30,239
They might do it now off a similar area,
 

4943
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:33,270
They might do it now off a similar area,
which would be annoying.

4944
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:33,280
which would be annoying.
 

4945
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,790
which would be annoying.
We were we were positioned for this

4946
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:34,800
We were we were positioned for this
 

4947
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,709
We were we were positioned for this
move. So, they will be looking for this

4948
01:56:36,709 --> 01:56:36,719
move. So, they will be looking for this
 

4949
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:38,470
move. So, they will be looking for this
red line here. And if they get through

4950
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:38,480
red line here. And if they get through
 

4951
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:43,270
red line here. And if they get through
it all the way up here, right 25,000.

4952
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:43,280

 

4953
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,790

I'm not going to play this long at this

4954
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:44,800
I'm not going to play this long at this
 

4955
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,149
I'm not going to play this long at this
point. I'm going to have to wait for

4956
01:56:46,149 --> 01:56:46,159
point. I'm going to have to wait for
 

4957
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:49,589
point. I'm going to have to wait for
failures.

4958
01:56:49,589 --> 01:56:49,599

 

4959
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:51,669

CVD diverging. Not for me. Not on a

4960
01:56:51,669 --> 01:56:51,679
CVD diverging. Not for me. Not on a
 

4961
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:53,589
CVD diverging. Not for me. Not on a
fivem minute. Looks okay. Uh, have we

4962
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:53,599
fivem minute. Looks okay. Uh, have we
 

4963
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:55,510
fivem minute. Looks okay. Uh, have we
made a new high yet? No, it's it's in

4964
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:55,520
made a new high yet? No, it's it's in
 

4965
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:56,950
made a new high yet? No, it's it's in
line for me. Or at least on a five

4966
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:56,960
line for me. Or at least on a five
 

4967
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,149
line for me. Or at least on a five
minute. I don't watch it on a one

4968
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
minute. I don't watch it on a one
 

4969
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:09,350
minute. I don't watch it on a one
minute.

4970
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:09,360

 

4971
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:10,790

market trying to find a bit of a bid

4972
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:10,800
market trying to find a bit of a bid
 

4973
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,310
market trying to find a bit of a bid
here by the looks of it. Right, coming

4974
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:12,320
here by the looks of it. Right, coming
 

4975
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,870
here by the looks of it. Right, coming
back under IB. Remember that player got

4976
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:14,880
back under IB. Remember that player got
 

4977
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,870
back under IB. Remember that player got
stuck at 68 and the other player is at

4978
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:16,880
stuck at 68 and the other player is at
 

4979
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,390
stuck at 68 and the other player is at
54s. So 68 currently sort of holding on

4980
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:20,400
54s. So 68 currently sort of holding on
 

4981
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:32,070
54s. So 68 currently sort of holding on
by dear life.

4982
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:32,080

 

4983
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,589

bit different to what we've had this

4984
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:33,599
bit different to what we've had this
 

4985
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:35,030
bit different to what we've had this
week, folks. I know I'm having to call

4986
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:35,040
week, folks. I know I'm having to call
 

4987
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,550
week, folks. I know I'm having to call
levels out quite a lot, but it's we're

4988
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:36,560
levels out quite a lot, but it's we're
 

4989
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,310
levels out quite a lot, but it's we're
in a rotational market where we've been

4990
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:38,320
in a rotational market where we've been
 

4991
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:41,189
in a rotational market where we've been
sideways now for about 24 hours.

4992
01:57:41,189 --> 01:57:41,199
sideways now for about 24 hours.
 

4993
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:43,030
sideways now for about 24 hours.
Basically, we've been sideways since

4994
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:43,040
Basically, we've been sideways since
 

4995
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,629
Basically, we've been sideways since
10:00 a.m. yesterday. We're in the same

4996
01:57:44,629 --> 01:57:44,639
10:00 a.m. yesterday. We're in the same
 

4997
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:47,830
10:00 a.m. yesterday. We're in the same
level.

4998
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:47,840

 

4999
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,430

Okay, back down to where this player was

5000
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:49,440
Okay, back down to where this player was
 

5001
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,790
Okay, back down to where this player was
at 54s. Remember, remember 54s and 68 is

5002
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:52,800
at 54s. Remember, remember 54s and 68 is
 

5003
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,510
at 54s. Remember, remember 54s and 68 is
where the seller got stuck. 54s and 68.

5004
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:55,520
where the seller got stuck. 54s and 68.
 

5005
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:56,950
where the seller got stuck. 54s and 68.
So, we're under 68. We're coming.

5006
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:56,960
So, we're under 68. We're coming.
 

5007
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,910
So, we're under 68. We're coming.
Testing 54s. Still not under his level.

I'm so annoyed. I don't think I can

5130
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:55,040
I'm so annoyed. I don't think I can
 

5131
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,310
I'm so annoyed. I don't think I can
trade the rest of the day, folks. That

5132
02:00:56,310 --> 02:00:56,320
trade the rest of the day, folks. That
 

5133
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,950
trade the rest of the day, folks. That
that's me done. I will stay here and and

5134
02:00:58,950 --> 02:00:58,960
that's me done. I will stay here and and
 

5135
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,430
that's me done. I will stay here and and
call everything for you. But I can now

5136
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:01,440
call everything for you. But I can now
 

5137
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,550
call everything for you. But I can now
feel the anger is now in me. So, I have

5138
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:04,560
feel the anger is now in me. So, I have
 

5139
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,270
feel the anger is now in me. So, I have
to just completely remove myself from

5140
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,280
to just completely remove myself from
 

5141
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,270
to just completely remove myself from
clicking buttons. All right? because

5142
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:09,280
clicking buttons. All right? because
 

5143
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:12,390
clicking buttons. All right? because
that for me if this now fails and we let

5144
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:12,400
that for me if this now fails and we let
 

5145
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,629
that for me if this now fails and we let
go of previous week point control this

5146
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
go of previous week point control this
 

5147
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:16,550
go of previous week point control this
would be a 100 pointer if we do it. So,

5148
02:01:16,550 --> 02:01:16,560
would be a 100 pointer if we do it. So,
 

5149
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:20,229
would be a 100 pointer if we do it. So,
what did I say? TP1, TP2, somewhere in

5150
02:01:20,229 --> 02:01:20,239
what did I say? TP1, TP2, somewhere in
 

5151
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:23,109
what did I say? TP1, TP2, somewhere in
here. TP2, TP3. If this collapses the

02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:23,119
here. TP2, TP3. If this collapses the
 

5153
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:25,030
here. TP2, TP3. If this collapses the
whole thing, TP4, this would be a giant

5154
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:25,040
whole thing, TP4, this would be a giant
 

5155
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:29,270
whole thing, TP4, this would be a giant
trade if it does it. Um, I can

5156
02:01:29,270 --> 02:01:29,280
trade if it does it. Um, I can
 

5157
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,430
trade if it does it. Um, I can
not now chase or do anything. I'm just

5158
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:31,440

On the [\h__\h] dot. He's still stuck up

5310
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:34,000
On the [\h__\h] dot. He's still stuck up
 

5311
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:40,390
On the [\h__\h] dot. He's still stuck up
there.

5312
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:40,400

 

5313
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,709

Can you ex please explain why every time

5314
02:04:42,709 --> 02:04:42,719
Can you ex please explain why every time
 

5315
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:44,790
Can you ex please explain why every time
you mention there is a big seller you

5316
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:44,800
you mention there is a big seller you
 

5317
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,790
you mention there is a big seller you
expect price to go higher from there

5318
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:46,800
expect price to go higher from there
 

5319
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,390
expect price to go higher from there
instead of in the same direction as the

5320
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:48,400
instead of in the same direction as the
 

5321
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:50,709
instead of in the same direction as the
big trade. Oh okay. Yeah it's not that I

5322
02:04:50,709 --> 02:04:50,719
big trade. Oh okay. Yeah it's not that I
 

5323
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:53,430
big trade. Oh okay. Yeah it's not that I
expect price to go higher or lower. It

5324
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:53,440
expect price to go higher or lower. It
 

5325
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:56,149
expect price to go higher or lower. It
depends where price is. Okay. So for

5326
02:04:56,149 --> 02:04:56,159
depends where price is. Okay. So for
 

5327
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:59,270
depends where price is. Okay. So for
example,

5328
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280

 

5329
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:02,870

we have a big seller at 54s here, right?

5330
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:02,880
we have a big seller at 54s here, right?
 

5331
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,870
we have a big seller at 54s here, right?
And he came in here, right? So he needs

5332
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:06,880
And he came in here, right? So he needs
 

5333
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,870
And he came in here, right? So he needs
to stay comfortable, doesn't he? If he's

5334
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:08,880
to stay comfortable, doesn't he? If he's
 

5335
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:10,870
to stay comfortable, doesn't he? If he's
comfortable, price can go lower. But

5336
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:10,880
comfortable, price can go lower. But
 

5337
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:13,030
comfortable, price can go lower. But
what happens if we get above him? He's

5338
02:05:13,030 --> 02:05:13,040
what happens if we get above him? He's
 

5339
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:14,550
what happens if we get above him? He's
uncomfortable, right? He's

5340
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:14,560
uncomfortable, right? He's
 

5341
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,790
uncomfortable, right? He's
uncomfortable. So he might start

5342
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:16,800
uncomfortable. So he might start
 

5343
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:19,350
uncomfortable. So he might start
stopping out some here. I would imagine

5344
02:05:19,350 --> 02:05:19,360
stopping out some here. I would imagine
 

5345
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:22,070
stopping out some here. I would imagine
his stops here. So if he's uncomfortable

5346
02:05:22,070 --> 02:05:22,080
his stops here. So if he's uncomfortable
 

5347
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:24,950
his stops here. So if he's uncomfortable
and we come up here and we have

5348
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:24,960
and we come up here and we have
 

5349
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,350
and we come up here and we have
thousands of lots being sold here, guess

5350
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:27,360
thousands of lots being sold here, guess
 

5351
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:29,589
thousands of lots being sold here, guess
what happens above here? [\h__\h] you candle

5352
02:05:29,589 --> 02:05:29,599
what happens above here? [\h__\h] you candle
 

5353
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:31,350
what happens above here? [\h__\h] you candle
happens. That's what happens. So this is

5354
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:31,360
happens. That's what happens. So this is
 

5355
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:32,870
happens. That's what happens. So this is
why we don't risk above that. So there

5356
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:32,880
why we don't risk above that. So there
 

5357
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,550
why we don't risk above that. So there
you go. We just cleared that him out

5358
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:34,560
you go. We just cleared that him out
 

5359
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,030
you go. We just cleared that him out
probably. Uh the next level where we

5360
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:37,040
probably. Uh the next level where we
 

5361
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,709
probably. Uh the next level where we
have sellers is 68, which is where we

5362
02:05:38,709 --> 02:05:38,719
have sellers is 68, which is where we
 

5363
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:41,030
have sellers is 68, which is where we
just tagged into, which is the IB,

5364
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:41,040
just tagged into, which is the IB,
 

5365
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,950
just tagged into, which is the IB,
right? So their stops are probably here

5366
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:42,960
right? So their stops are probably here
 

5367
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:45,350
right? So their stops are probably here
and here right now. They must defend it.

5368
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:45,360
and here right now. They must defend it.
 

5369
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:47,030
and here right now. They must defend it.
The buyers have started stepping in at

5370
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:47,040
The buyers have started stepping in at
 

5371
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:50,149
The buyers have started stepping in at
25 and 29. So, we haven't got much room,

5372
02:05:50,149 --> 02:05:50,159
25 and 29. So, we haven't got much room,
 

5373
02:05:50,159 --> 02:05:52,629
25 and 29. So, we haven't got much room,
right? So, it's like, think about this.

5374
02:05:52,629 --> 02:05:52,639
right? So, it's like, think about this.
 

5375
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:54,629
right? So, it's like, think about this.
If there's a big buyer here, which there

5376
02:05:54,629 --> 02:05:54,639
If there's a big buyer here, which there
 

5377
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:57,830
If there's a big buyer here, which there
is, right? If we come under that level,

5378
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:57,840
is, right? If we come under that level,
 

5379
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:00,870
is, right? If we come under that level,
what happens? Stops out. Sells. If we

5380
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:00,880
what happens? Stops out. Sells. If we
 

5381
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:03,030
what happens? Stops out. Sells. If we
retest it and he didn't stop out here,

5382
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,040
retest it and he didn't stop out here,
 

5383
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,950
retest it and he didn't stop out here,
what happens? Gets out, break even,

5384
02:06:04,950 --> 02:06:04,960
what happens? Gets out, break even,
 

5385
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,030
what happens? Gets out, break even,
sells. Right? So, while we look for big

5386
02:06:07,030 --> 02:06:07,040
sells. Right? So, while we look for big
 

5387
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:08,950
sells. Right? So, while we look for big
play, I'm not looking at this for small

5388
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:08,960
play, I'm not looking at this for small
 

5389
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,189
play, I'm not looking at this for small
players. I'm looking for the big

5390
02:06:11,189 --> 02:06:11,199
players. I'm looking for the big
 

5391
02:06:11,199 --> 02:06:13,030
players. I'm looking for the big
players. I'm looking to see what the

5392
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:13,040
players. I'm looking to see what the
 

5393
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:14,790
players. I'm looking to see what the
market makers, what the institutions are

5394
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:14,800
market makers, what the institutions are
 

5395
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,390
market makers, what the institutions are
doing, what the order flow is doing,

5396
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:16,400
doing, what the order flow is doing,
 

5397
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:17,830
doing, what the order flow is doing,
where are they trying to move this

5398
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:17,840
where are they trying to move this
 

5399
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:23,350
where are they trying to move this
market?

5400
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:23,360

 

5401
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:25,669

Do I use bookmap, heat map, tape only to

5402
02:06:25,669 --> 02:06:25,679
Do I use bookmap, heat map, tape only to
 

5403
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:27,270
Do I use bookmap, heat map, tape only to
see the big sellers? Sometimes you show

5404
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:27,280
see the big sellers? Sometimes you show
 

5405
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:28,790
see the big sellers? Sometimes you show
something in bookmap when you're talking

5406
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:28,800
something in bookmap when you're talking
 

5407
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,390
something in bookmap when you're talking
about it. Yeah, I use bitmap which is

5408
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:30,400
about it. Yeah, I use bitmap which is
 

5409
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:33,750
about it. Yeah, I use bitmap which is
above me and I use uh like a footprint

5410
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:33,760
above me and I use uh like a footprint
 

5411
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,510
above me and I use uh like a footprint
chart with delta on Ninja Trader as

5412
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:35,520
chart with delta on Ninja Trader as
 

5413
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,990
chart with delta on Ninja Trader as
well. I use I use I use numerous tools

5414
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:38,000
well. I use I use I use numerous tools
 

5415
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,830
well. I use I use I use numerous tools
and I use the level two so I can see

5416
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:39,840
and I use the level two so I can see
 

5417
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:42,390
and I use the level two so I can see
them. Right? So even if you were just

5418
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:42,400
them. Right? So even if you were just
 

5419
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,709
them. Right? So even if you were just
using tape if your if the tape you have

5420
02:06:44,709 --> 02:06:44,719
using tape if your if the tape you have
 

5421
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:46,950
using tape if your if the tape you have
has this volume profile delta you can

5422
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:46,960
has this volume profile delta you can
 

5423
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,390
has this volume profile delta you can
see right here look at this big seller

5424
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:48,400
see right here look at this big seller
 

5425
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:51,350
see right here look at this big seller
at 37s right 281 lot. So all the time

5426
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:51,360
at 37s right 281 lot. So all the time
 

5427
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,189
at 37s right 281 lot. So all the time
we're under him he's comfortable.

5428
02:06:53,189 --> 02:06:53,199
we're under him he's comfortable.
 

5429
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:55,270
we're under him he's comfortable.
Where's the big buyer from before right?

5430
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:55,280
Where's the big buyer from before right?
 

5431
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:57,350
Where's the big buyer from before right?
Well there's a big buyer right here at

5432
02:06:57,350 --> 02:06:57,360
Well there's a big buyer right here at
 

5433
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:59,350
Well there's a big buyer right here at
29. All right. And there's another big

5434
02:06:59,350 --> 02:06:59,360
29. All right. And there's another big
 

5435
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:01,589
29. All right. And there's another big
buyer at 25. So if we go under that

5436
02:07:01,589 --> 02:07:01,599
buyer at 25. So if we go under that
 

5437
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:02,790
buyer at 25. So if we go under that
those buyers start becoming

5438
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:02,800
those buyers start becoming
 

5439
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,629
those buyers start becoming
uncomfortable. Right? It's it's

5440
02:07:04,629 --> 02:07:04,639
uncomfortable. Right? It's it's
 

5441
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:07,350
uncomfortable. Right? It's it's
psychology. Think about when you trade.

5442
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:07,360
psychology. Think about when you trade.
 

5443
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:09,990
psychology. Think about when you trade.
Think about when you trade.

5444
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:10,000
Think about when you trade.
 

5445
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,069
Think about when you trade.
If you and you guys are retail, so

5446
02:07:12,069 --> 02:07:12,079
If you and you guys are retail, so
 

5447
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:14,390
If you and you guys are retail, so
you're not trading big size, right? Same

5448
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:14,400
you're not trading big size, right? Same
 

5449
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:15,750
you're not trading big size, right? Same
as me. But we're talking about like

5450
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:15,760
as me. But we're talking about like
 

5451
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:18,550
as me. But we're talking about like
hundreds and thousands of lots, right?

5452
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:18,560
hundreds and thousands of lots, right?
 

5453
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,790
hundreds and thousands of lots, right?
Hundreds and thousands of lots. We want

5454
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:20,800
Hundreds and thousands of lots. We want
 

5455
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:26,229
Hundreds and thousands of lots. We want
to get in the slipstream of that.

5456
02:07:26,229 --> 02:07:26,239

 

5457
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:27,669

Why do I think he's a short seller?

5458
02:07:27,669 --> 02:07:27,679
Why do I think he's a short seller?
 

5459
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:30,950
Why do I think he's a short seller?
Well, I know he's a seller.

5460
02:07:30,950 --> 02:07:30,960
Well, I know he's a seller.
 

5461
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,470
Well, I know he's a seller.
It doesn't matter if he's a short

5462
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:32,480
It doesn't matter if he's a short
 

5463
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,550
It doesn't matter if he's a short
seller. or he's just selling his

5464
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:34,560
seller. or he's just selling his
 

5465
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:39,030
seller. or he's just selling his
position. It's the delta.

5466
02:07:39,030 --> 02:07:39,040

 

5467
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:42,310

Okay, so we're now under those buyers

5468
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:42,320
Okay, so we're now under those buyers
 

5469
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,950
Okay, so we're now under those buyers
at uh 25 and 28. Like I said, this is

5470
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:44,960
at uh 25 and 28. Like I said, this is
 

5471
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,870
at uh 25 and 28. Like I said, this is
probably going to go for you now.

5472
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:46,880
probably going to go for you now.
 

5473
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:49,750
probably going to go for you now.
Especially if you get start to lose 95s,

5474
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:49,760
Especially if you get start to lose 95s,
 

5475
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:52,390
Especially if you get start to lose 95s,
right? If you start to lose 7 95s, so

5476
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:52,400
right? If you start to lose 7 95s, so
 

5477
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,109
right? If you start to lose 7 95s, so
you'd ideally you'd want 25s and 30s

5478
02:07:55,109 --> 02:07:55,119
you'd ideally you'd want 25s and 30s
 

5479
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:56,470
you'd ideally you'd want 25s and 30s
protected here by sellers. You'd want

5480
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:56,480
protected here by sellers. You'd want
 

5481
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:57,990
protected here by sellers. You'd want
these buyers to become trapped and

5482
02:07:57,990 --> 02:07:58,000
these buyers to become trapped and
 

5483
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,990
these buyers to become trapped and
become sellers. You don't really want a

5484
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,000
become sellers. You don't really want a
 

5485
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,229
become sellers. You don't really want a
lift lift of 38 and 50s again. So you

5486
02:08:02,229 --> 02:08:02,239
lift lift of 38 and 50s again. So you
 

5487
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:04,229
lift lift of 38 and 50s again. So you
want sort of 30s to be protected here.

5488
02:08:04,229 --> 02:08:04,239
want sort of 30s to be protected here.
 

5489
02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:06,709
want sort of 30s to be protected here.
If they sell 30s, you want a close

5490
02:08:06,709 --> 02:08:06,719
If they sell 30s, you want a close
 

5491
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:09,109
If they sell 30s, you want a close
underneath 96s. Underneath that, you're

5492
02:08:09,109 --> 02:08:09,119
underneath 96s. Underneath that, you're
 

5493
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:11,350
underneath 96s. Underneath that, you're
looking for 72s. All right? So

5494
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:11,360
looking for 72s. All right? So
 

5495
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:13,510
looking for 72s. All right? So
underneath 96s, you're looking for 72s

5496
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:13,520
underneath 96s, you're looking for 72s
 

5497
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,430
underneath 96s, you're looking for 72s
as a cover. It's going to work out for

5498
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:15,440
as a cover. It's going to work out for
 

5499
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:16,950
as a cover. It's going to work out for
you. I'm telling you, it's just like I

5500
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:16,960
you. I'm telling you, it's just like I
 

5501
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,310
you. I'm telling you, it's just like I
can't. My psychology now I'm I'm spent.

5502
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:20,320
can't. My psychology now I'm I'm spent.
 

5503
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,950
can't. My psychology now I'm I'm spent.
Missing that move so quickly hurt. Even

5504
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:22,960
Missing that move so quickly hurt. Even
 

5505
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,870
Missing that move so quickly hurt. Even
though it offered me a re chance

5506
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:24,880
though it offered me a re chance
 

5507
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,790
though it offered me a re chance
mentally, I'm out of the pocket at the

5508
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:26,800
mentally, I'm out of the pocket at the
 

5509
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:29,189
mentally, I'm out of the pocket at the
moment. Here you go. So underneath this

5510
02:08:29,189 --> 02:08:29,199
moment. Here you go. So underneath this
 

5511
02:08:29,199 --> 02:08:31,350
moment. Here you go. So underneath this
level now this is Vpo and under here

5512
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:31,360
level now this is Vpo and under here
 

5513
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:33,830
level now this is Vpo and under here
you're looking for 770s same level as

5514
02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:33,840
you're looking for 770s same level as
 

5515
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:36,229
you're looking for 770s same level as
earlier right and then under 770s you

5516
02:08:36,229 --> 02:08:36,239
earlier right and then under 770s you
 

5517
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:38,870
earlier right and then under 770s you
can look for the edge of this. So it's

5518
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:38,880
can look for the edge of this. So it's
 

5519
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:42,069
can look for the edge of this. So it's
770s 730s 700 and then lower of day

5520
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:42,079
770s 730s 700 and then lower of day
 

5521
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:46,310
770s 730s 700 and then lower of day
honestly they do the full reversion.

5522
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:46,320
honestly they do the full reversion.
 

5523
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:48,069
honestly they do the full reversion.
So there you go folks. Hopefully this is

5524
02:08:48,069 --> 02:08:48,079
So there you go folks. Hopefully this is
 

5525
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:49,910
So there you go folks. Hopefully this is
going to be a huge winner for you lot

5526

right? It's huge winner. 50's failed

5530
02:09:00,310 --> 02:09:00,320

 

5531
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:03,030

5535
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:10,229
Tyson trade coming out into VWAP here.
Um but I think 770s is a massive level

5536
02:09:10,229 --> 02:09:10,239
Um but I think 770s is a massive level
 

5537
02:09:10,239 --> 02:09:13,109
Um but I think 770s is a massive level
and under that I would be watching for

5538
02:09:13,109 --> 02:09:13,119
and under that I would be watching for
 

5539
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:16,790
and under that I would be watching for
here 730s and under that honestly you

5540
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:16,800
here 730s and under that honestly you
 

5541
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,229
here 730s and under that honestly you
can probably watch for this. All right

5542
02:09:20,229 --> 02:09:20,239
can probably watch for this. All right
 

5543
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:22,870
can probably watch for this. All right
if you get start closing under 700s so

5544
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:22,880
if you get start closing under 700s so
 

5545
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:29,510
if you get start closing under 700s so
770s 730s 700 low of day.

5546
02:09:29,510 --> 02:09:29,520

 

5547

one on it actually. But most of that is
 

5575
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:09,669
one on it actually. But most of that is
in the um the course. But there is I

5580
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:18,320

 

5581
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,830

Trading view.

5582
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:21,840

 

5583
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:23,430

Try and find a few mate. Give me a

5584
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:23,440
Try and find a few mate. Give me a
 

5585

Try and find a few mate. Give me a
second.

5586
02:10:31,350 --> 02:10:31,360

 

5587
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:36,950

Sharable link.

5588
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:36,960

 

5589
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:40,550

This one might help.

5590
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:40,560
This one might help.
 

5591
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:42,069
This one might help.
All right, almost there, folks. So,

5592
02:10:42,069 --> 02:10:42,079
All right, almost there, folks. So,
 

5593
02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:43,750
All right, almost there, folks. So,
you're looking for uh 70s, remember?

5594
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:43,760
you're looking for uh 70s, remember?
 

5595
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:47,750
you're looking for uh 70s, remember?
770s or V1 anywhere around here.

5596
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:47,760
770s or V1 anywhere around here.
 

5597
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,790
770s or V1 anywhere around here.
Um, watch I would watch SPY 682. If it

5598
02:10:50,790 --> 02:10:50,800
Um, watch I would watch SPY 682. If it
 

5599
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,870
Um, watch I would watch SPY 682. If it
loses 682, it probably goes back to 680.

5600
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:52,880
loses 682, it probably goes back to 680.
 

5601
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:55,990
loses 682, it probably goes back to 680.
So, they might pin it above 682 and you

5602
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:56,000
So, they might pin it above 682 and you
 

5603
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,109
So, they might pin it above 682 and you
can watch QQQ600s.

5604
02:10:59,109 --> 02:10:59,119
can watch QQQ600s.
 

5605
02:10:59,119 --> 02:11:01,510
can watch QQQ600s.
But again, for those who are wondering,

5606
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:01,520
But again, for those who are wondering,
 

5607
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,189
But again, for those who are wondering,
all right, you need to cover some into

5608
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:03,199
all right, you need to cover some into
 

5609

I drew it out. By the time I got back to

5760
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:19,760
I drew it out. By the time I got back to
 

5761
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:22,470
I drew it out. By the time I got back to
screens, 50 point lower emotion spike.

5762
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:22,480
screens, 50 point lower emotion spike.
 

5763
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:24,069
screens, 50 point lower emotion spike.
Don't trade. It's just like, don't

5764
02:14:24,069 --> 02:14:24,079
Don't trade. It's just like, don't
 

5765
02:14:24,079 --> 02:14:26,229
Don't trade. It's just like, don't
trade. How have I learned that? Too many

5766
02:14:26,229 --> 02:14:26,239
trade. How have I learned that? Too many
 

5767
02:14:26,239 --> 02:14:29,109
trade. How have I learned that? Too many
years of doing it. Way too many years of

5768
02:14:29,109 --> 02:14:29,119
years of doing it. Way too many years of
 

5769
02:14:29,119 --> 02:14:31,350
years of doing it. Way too many years of
doing that. Getting absolutely cooked.

5770
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:31,360
doing that. Getting absolutely cooked.
 

5771
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:32,229
doing that. Getting absolutely cooked.
All right. So, they're coming back for

5772
02:14:32,229 --> 02:14:32,239
All right. So, they're coming back for
 

5773
02:14:32,239 --> 02:14:34,229
All right. So, they're coming back for
these 25s and 30s now. And you want to

5774
02:14:34,229 --> 02:14:34,239
these 25s and 30s now. And you want to
 

5775
02:14:34,239 --> 02:14:35,589
these 25s and 30s now. And you want to
be very careful. If they start getting

5776
02:14:35,589 --> 02:14:35,599
be very careful. If they start getting
 

5777
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:37,430
be very careful. If they start getting
through these, they're going to revisit

5778
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:37,440
through these, they're going to revisit
 

5779
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,430
through these, they're going to revisit
50s and turn it on. And guess what? Spy

5780
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:39,440
50s and turn it on. And guess what? Spy
 

5781
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:41,350
50s and turn it on. And guess what? Spy
held the 82s. Remember I said watch for

5782
02:14:41,350 --> 02:14:41,360
held the 82s. Remember I said watch for
 

5783
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:44,790
held the 82s. Remember I said watch for
Spy to hold 82s. If it holds 82s, there

5784
02:14:44,790 --> 02:14:44,800
Spy to hold 82s. If it holds 82s, there
 

5785
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,470
Spy to hold 82s. If it holds 82s, there
is an argument for a squeeze today on

02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:46,480
is an argument for a squeeze today on
 

5787
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:49,030
is an argument for a squeeze today on
SPY back to 85 and 86es if it keeps

02:14:49,030 --> 02:14:49,040
SPY back to 85 and 86es if it keeps
 

5789
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:53,270
SPY back to 85 and 86es if it keeps
holding 82s.

5790

5791
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:56,790

5795
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,149

Which one is Bella? Bella was in chat

5796
02:15:02,149 --> 02:15:02,159
Which one is Bella? Bella was in chat
 

5797
02:15:02,159 --> 02:15:04,629
Which one is Bella? Bella was in chat
earlier. She came in and said Bella Kim

5798
02:15:04,629 --> 02:15:04,639
earlier. She came in and said Bella Kim
 

5799
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:10,390
earlier. She came in and said Bella Kim
4608. That's Bella.

5800
02:15:10,390 --> 02:15:10,400

 

5801
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,310

A lot of people asking about whether a

5802
02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:12,320
A lot of people asking about whether a
 

5803
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,790
A lot of people asking about whether a
seller is in pain or a takerit. Either

5804
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:14,800
seller is in pain or a takerit. Either
 

5805
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,470
seller is in pain or a takerit. Either
way, trades require buyers and sellers.

5806
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:16,480
way, trades require buyers and sellers.
 

5807
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,910
way, trades require buyers and sellers.
So, liquidity is liquidity. Correct.

5808
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:17,920
So, liquidity is liquidity. Correct.
 

5809
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:20,229
So, liquidity is liquidity. Correct.

02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,669
So, all you got was uh the 770s.
Still not bad. What did you get out of

5832
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
Still not bad. What did you get out of
 

5833
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:49,830
Still not bad. What did you get out of
that? 80 plus points. Not bad. Not bad.

5834
02:15:49,830 --> 02:15:49,840
that? 80 plus points. Not bad. Not bad.
 

5835
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:52,149
that? 80 plus points. Not bad. Not bad.
And we are now back in the range. So,

5836
02:15:52,149 --> 02:15:52,159
And we are now back in the range. So,
 

5837
02:15:52,159 --> 02:15:53,109
And we are now back in the range. So,
now they're going to have to try and

5838
02:15:53,109 --> 02:15:53,119
now they're going to have to try and
 

5839
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:55,270
now they're going to have to try and
find a bid over 30s really or over those

5840
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:55,280
find a bid over 30s really or over those
 

5841
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,510
find a bid over 30s really or over those
25s again. If bulls find a bid, I will

5842
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:57,520
25s again. If bulls find a bid, I will
 

5843
02:15:57,520 --> 02:15:59,750
25s again. If bulls find a bid, I will
not be taking this. But if bulls find a

5844
02:15:59,750 --> 02:15:59,760
not be taking this. But if bulls find a
 

5845
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:01,750
not be taking this. But if bulls find a
bid here, they will try and clean out

5846
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:01,760
bid here, they will try and clean out
 

5847
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:05,109
bid here, they will try and clean out
all this liquidity here. We are 50s is a

5848
02:16:05,109 --> 02:16:05,119
all this liquidity here. We are 50s is a
 

5849
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:06,790
all this liquidity here. We are 50s is a
massive massive wall on the options

5850
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:06,800
massive massive wall on the options
 

5851
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:08,470
massive massive wall on the options
chain. All right. So, if they can hold

5852
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:08,480
chain. All right. So, if they can hold
 

5853
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:11,270
chain. All right. So, if they can hold
over 50s, there is an argument for this

5854
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:11,280
over 50s, there is an argument for this
 

5855
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,750
over 50s, there is an argument for this
lift higher to clean this out. I won't,

5856
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:13,760
lift higher to clean this out. I won't,
 

5857
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:15,350
lift higher to clean this out. I won't,
like I said, I'm probably done for the

5858
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:15,360
like I said, I'm probably done for the
 

5859
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,950
like I said, I'm probably done for the
day. That really pissed me off that last

5860
02:16:16,950 --> 02:16:16,960
day. That really pissed me off that last
 

5861
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:19,830
day. That really pissed me off that last
one. You've got it's not also one thing

5862
02:16:19,830 --> 02:16:19,840
one. You've got it's not also one thing
 

5863
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:22,229
one. You've got it's not also one thing
I should say with trading. Maybe some of

5864
02:16:22,229 --> 02:16:22,239
I should say with trading. Maybe some of
 

5865
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:25,030
I should say with trading. Maybe some of
you guys have experience in this. I call

5866
02:16:25,030 --> 02:16:25,040
you guys have experience in this. I call
 

5867
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:28,470
you guys have experience in this. I call
it like tilt delta. All right. So,

5868
02:16:28,470 --> 02:16:28,480
it like tilt delta. All right. So,
 

5869
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:30,790
it like tilt delta. All right. So,
yesterday Alex gets stopped out to the

5870
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:30,800
yesterday Alex gets stopped out to the
 

5871
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:33,429
yesterday Alex gets stopped out to the
tick. He gets like 150 points and he

5872
02:16:33,429 --> 02:16:33,439
tick. He gets like 150 points and he
 

5873
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:35,509
tick. He gets like 150 points and he
misses the 400 point trade. And don't

5874
02:16:35,509 --> 02:16:35,519
misses the 400 point trade. And don't
 

5875
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:37,110
misses the 400 point trade. And don't
think, oh, he wouldn't have got the 400

5876
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:37,120
think, oh, he wouldn't have got the 400
 

5877
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:39,589
think, oh, he wouldn't have got the 400
point. Oh, he would have. He would have

5878
02:16:39,589 --> 02:16:39,599
point. Oh, he would have. He would have
 

5879
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:41,349
point. Oh, he would have. He would have
got the 400 point. He was ready for that

5880
02:16:41,349 --> 02:16:41,359
got the 400 point. He was ready for that
 

5881
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:44,230
got the 400 point. He was ready for that
400 point trade all bloody week. Right?

5882
02:16:44,230 --> 02:16:44,240
400 point trade all bloody week. Right?
 

5883
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:46,309
400 point trade all bloody week. Right?
I think the day before I got stopped out

5884
02:16:46,309 --> 02:16:46,319
I think the day before I got stopped out
 

5885
02:16:46,319 --> 02:16:48,389
I think the day before I got stopped out
to the tick or by three points. Today I

5886
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:48,399
to the tick or by three points. Today I
 

5887
02:16:48,399 --> 02:16:51,349
to the tick or by three points. Today I
got stopped out by five points twice and

5888
02:16:51,349 --> 02:16:51,359
got stopped out by five points twice and
 

5889
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:53,830
got stopped out by five points twice and
then I missed one. So the delta, right?

5890
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:53,840
then I missed one. So the delta, right?
 

5891
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:56,230
then I missed one. So the delta, right?
If we think about my journal will tell

5892
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:56,240
If we think about my journal will tell
 

5893
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:58,629
If we think about my journal will tell
you what is Alex's tilt, where does

5894

you what is Alex's tilt, where does
 

5895
02:16:58,639 --> 02:17:00,709
you what is Alex's tilt, where does
Alex's tilt come from? His tilts come

5896

5905
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:09,589
a trade, and there it goes without me.
That has happened every bloody day this

5906
02:17:09,589 --> 02:17:09,599

delta. It will build through a week or a

5920
02:17:24,549 --> 02:17:24,559
delta. It will build through a week or a
 

5921
02:17:24,559 --> 02:17:26,709
delta. It will build through a week or a
month, right? If you have, let's say you

5922
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:26,719
month, right? If you have, let's say you
 

5923
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:29,110
month, right? If you have, let's say you
have a flat day and a flat day and a

5924
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:29,120
have a flat day and a flat day and a
 

5925
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:32,150
have a flat day and a flat day and a
flat week and a flat week and man, you

5926
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:32,160
flat week and a flat week and man, you
 

5927
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,950
flat week and a flat week and man, you
are just very close to having a big blow

5928
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:34,960
are just very close to having a big blow
 

5929
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:37,030
are just very close to having a big blow
up if you keep doing that. And this

5930
02:17:37,030 --> 02:17:37,040
up if you keep doing that. And this
 

5931
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,389
up if you keep doing that. And this
unless you got your emotions under

5932
02:17:38,389 --> 02:17:38,399
unless you got your emotions under
 

5933
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:39,750
unless you got your emotions under
control because at some point you'll be

5934
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:39,760
control because at some point you'll be
 

5935
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:41,190
control because at some point you'll be
like, "This is [\h__\h] and you're going

5936
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:41,200
like, "This is [\h__\h] and you're going
 

5937
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,349
like, "This is [\h__\h] and you're going
to oversize or do something stupid." So,

5938
02:17:43,349 --> 02:17:43,359
to oversize or do something stupid." So,
 

5939
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:48,709
to oversize or do something stupid." So,
it's what I call tilt delta.

5940
02:17:48,709 --> 02:17:48,719

 

5941
02:17:48,719 --> 02:17:50,870

Where do I place my stops? I place my

5942
02:17:50,870 --> 02:17:50,880
Where do I place my stops? I place my
 

5943
02:17:50,880 --> 02:17:53,030
Where do I place my stops? I place my
stops where the trade is no longer

5944
02:17:53,030 --> 02:17:53,040
stops where the trade is no longer
 

5945
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,190
stops where the trade is no longer
valid. Normally, it's on a shelf, like

5946
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,200
valid. Normally, it's on a shelf, like
 

5947
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:59,270
valid. Normally, it's on a shelf, like
under a shelf. So, for example, if I was

5948
02:17:59,270 --> 02:17:59,280
under a shelf. So, for example, if I was
 

5949
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:02,629
under a shelf. So, for example, if I was
going to buy here, all right, then I

5950
02:18:02,629 --> 02:18:02,639
going to buy here, all right, then I
 

5951
02:18:02,639 --> 02:18:04,070
going to buy here, all right, then I
would be trying to risk the other side

5952
02:18:04,070 --> 02:18:04,080
would be trying to risk the other side
 

5953
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:06,150
would be trying to risk the other side
of this shelf where possible, right? But

5954
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:06,160
of this shelf where possible, right? But
 

5955
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,990
of this shelf where possible, right? But
like I said, they are trying to bid 25s

5956
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:08,000
like I said, they are trying to bid 25s
 

5957
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,389
like I said, they are trying to bid 25s
and 30s right now.

5958
02:18:10,389 --> 02:18:10,399
and 30s right now.
 

5959
02:18:10,399 --> 02:18:12,549
and 30s right now.
Why are they trying to bid 25s and 30s?

5960
02:18:12,549 --> 02:18:12,559
Why are they trying to bid 25s and 30s?
 

5961
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:15,589
Why are they trying to bid 25s and 30s?
Because where they've been bidding all

5962
02:18:15,589 --> 02:18:15,599
Because where they've been bidding all
 

5963
02:18:15,599 --> 02:18:18,230
Because where they've been bidding all
day, right? 25s and 30s. They're trying

5964
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:18,240
day, right? 25s and 30s. They're trying
 

5965
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:21,110
day, right? 25s and 30s. They're trying
to bid 25s and 30s and take out these

5966
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:21,120
to bid 25s and 30s and take out these
 

5967
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,830
to bid 25s and 30s and take out these
sellers and lift it up here, right? And

5968
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:23,840
sellers and lift it up here, right? And
 

5969
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,509
sellers and lift it up here, right? And
we can see the bid at the low was

5970
02:18:25,509 --> 02:18:25,519
we can see the bid at the low was
 

5971
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:27,589
we can see the bid at the low was
filling an old imbalance into VWAP. But

5972
02:18:27,589 --> 02:18:27,599
filling an old imbalance into VWAP. But
 

5973
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,910
filling an old imbalance into VWAP. But
this was the level, right? 770s. We've

5974
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:29,920
this was the level, right? 770s. We've
 

5975
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:32,230
this was the level, right? 770s. We've
talked about it the whole time. 770s.

5976
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:32,240
talked about it the whole time. 770s.
 

5977
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,870
talked about it the whole time. 770s.
Reclaim Vo, reclaim the bid action at

5978
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:34,880
Reclaim Vo, reclaim the bid action at
 

5979
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:37,990
Reclaim Vo, reclaim the bid action at
25s, back to the 50s, right? So 50s to

5980
02:18:37,990 --> 02:18:38,000
25s, back to the 50s, right? So 50s to
 

5981
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,990
25s, back to the 50s, right? So 50s to
25s can be a rotation while they build

5982
02:18:39,990 --> 02:18:40,000
25s can be a rotation while they build
 

5983
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,830
25s can be a rotation while they build
and try and force a squeeze out higher

5984
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:41,840
and try and force a squeeze out higher
 

5985
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:44,950
and try and force a squeeze out higher
if they really want to. But 50s is a big

5986
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:44,960
if they really want to. But 50s is a big
 

5987
02:18:44,960 --> 02:19:00,230
if they really want to. But 50s is a big
big big GEX level, right?

5988
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:00,240

02:30:26,319 --> 02:30:27,510
at the moment, but he's probably not
going to keep him if I'm honest. Sorry

All right. This is where you're pinned

6662
02:35:45,590 --> 02:35:45,600
All right. This is where you're pinned
 

6663
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:47,590
All right. This is where you're pinned
in right now. If they're lucky, remember

6664
02:35:47,590 --> 02:35:47,600
in right now. If they're lucky, remember
 

6665
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:49,750
in right now. If they're lucky, remember
we were looking for this move earlier

6666
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:49,760
we were looking for this move earlier
 

6667
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:52,230
we were looking for this move earlier
from a good trap. If they're lucky, they

6668
02:35:52,230 --> 02:35:52,240
from a good trap. If they're lucky, they
 

6669
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:54,230
from a good trap. If they're lucky, they
get up into here. But I would say

6670
02:35:54,230 --> 02:35:54,240
get up into here. But I would say
 

6671
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:58,230
get up into here. But I would say
anywhere in here will be a failure.

6672
02:35:58,230 --> 02:35:58,240
anywhere in here will be a failure.
 

6673
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:04,309
anywhere in here will be a failure.
And that's why

you're just failing the same level
 

6677
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:08,710
you're just failing the same level
again. Right? This is fair value from

02:36:08,710 --> 02:36:08,720
again. Right? This is fair value from
 

6679
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:10,469

6681
02:36:10,479 --> 02:36:12,309

brick wall sometimes explaining, but I
do my best.

6688
02:36:21,429 --> 02:36:21,439

 

6689
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:23,429

This market is as trendy as my outfit.

This market is as trendy as my outfit.
 

6691
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:26,469
This market is as trendy as my outfit.

6692
02:36:26,469 --> 02:36:26,479
That is a wicked comment. I love that.
 

6693
02:36:26,479 --> 02:36:29,110
That is a wicked comment. I love that.
According

6694
02:36:29,110 --> 02:36:29,120
According
 

6695
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:30,950
According
to statistics by Edgeville, the initial

6696
02:36:30,950 --> 02:36:30,960
to statistics by Edgeville, the initial
 

6697
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:33,990
to statistics by Edgeville, the initial
balance candle closes 7 green 76% of the

6698
02:36:33,990 --> 02:36:34,000
balance candle closes 7 green 76% of the
 

6699
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,309
balance candle closes 7 green 76% of the
time the session sees continuation and

6700
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:36,319
time the session sees continuation and
 

6701
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:38,630
time the session sees continuation and
closes green data collected from the

6702
02:36:38,630 --> 02:36:38,640
closes green data collected from the
 

6703
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,070
closes green data collected from the
past. What do you mean the initial

6704
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:40,080
past. What do you mean the initial
 

6705
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:43,190
past. What do you mean the initial
balance candle closes green?

6706
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:43,200
balance candle closes green?
 

6707
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:45,590
balance candle closes green?
You mean that that when we when we

6708
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:45,600
You mean that that when we when we
 

6709
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:47,670
You mean that that when we when we
complete an IB so the first hour you're

6710
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:47,680
complete an IB so the first hour you're
 

6711
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:51,349
complete an IB so the first hour you're
saying 76 time 76

6712
02:36:51,349 --> 02:36:51,359
saying 76 time 76
 

6713
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:54,389
saying 76 time 76
can't talk. Are you saying that 76% of

6714
02:36:54,389 --> 02:36:54,399
can't talk. Are you saying that 76% of
 

6715
02:36:54,399 --> 02:36:56,950
can't talk. Are you saying that 76% of
the time in the stock market over the

6716
02:36:56,950 --> 02:36:56,960
the time in the stock market over the
 

6717
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:59,429
the time in the stock market over the
last six months the first hour is green?

6718
02:36:59,429 --> 02:36:59,439
last six months the first hour is green?
 

6719
02:36:59,439 --> 02:37:00,950
last six months the first hour is green?
That's all I can see from that stat

6720
02:37:00,950 --> 02:37:00,960
That's all I can see from that stat
 

6721
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:03,429
That's all I can see from that stat
you're giving.

6722
02:37:03,429 --> 02:37:03,439
you're giving.
 

6723
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:05,750
you're giving.
Or are you saying if the IB is green

6724
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:05,760
Or are you saying if the IB is green
 

6725
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:09,670
Or are you saying if the IB is green
706% of the time we see continuation? Is

6726
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:09,680
706% of the time we see continuation? Is
 

6727
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:10,870
706% of the time we see continuation? Is
that what you're saying for the rest of

6728
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:10,880
that what you're saying for the rest of
 

6729
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:12,950
that what you're saying for the rest of
the day? So you does that mean you

6730
02:37:12,950 --> 02:37:12,960
the day? So you does that mean you
 

6731
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:14,550
the day? So you does that mean you
what's that based on? Does that mean we

6732
02:37:14,550 --> 02:37:14,560
what's that based on? Does that mean we
 

6733
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:23,349
what's that based on? Does that mean we
close green outside the IB?

6734
02:37:23,349 --> 02:37:23,359

 

6735
02:37:23,359 --> 02:37:24,790

I don't think we have a bullish session

6736
02:37:24,790 --> 02:37:24,800
I don't think we have a bullish session
 

6737
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:27,510
I don't think we have a bullish session
of New York though. Like I mean if you

6738
02:37:27,510 --> 02:37:27,520
of New York though. Like I mean if you
 

6739
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:29,750
of New York though. Like I mean if you
judge bullish by like okay we're above

6740
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:29,760
judge bullish by like okay we're above
 

6741
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:34,790
judge bullish by like okay we're above
this but like

6742
02:37:34,790 --> 02:37:34,800

 

6743
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,870

I don't know man.

6744
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:36,880
I don't know man.
 

6745
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:40,230
I don't know man.
I like I guess you can argue look we're

6746
02:37:40,230 --> 02:37:40,240
I like I guess you can argue look we're
 

6747
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:42,150
I like I guess you can argue look we're
we're pinning high but like what happens

6748
02:37:42,150 --> 02:37:42,160
we're pinning high but like what happens
 

6749
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:56,630
we're pinning high but like what happens
if you do that and we close down here

6750
02:37:56,630 --> 02:37:56,640

 

6751
02:37:56,640 --> 02:37:58,309

can't see orderflow with all these lines

6752
02:37:58,309 --> 02:37:58,319
can't see orderflow with all these lines
 

6753
02:37:58,319 --> 02:38:00,389
can't see orderflow with all these lines
going on. Uh there's no orderflow on

6754
02:38:00,389 --> 02:38:00,399
going on. Uh there's no orderflow on
 

6755
02:38:00,399 --> 02:38:06,870
going on. Uh there's no orderflow on
here.

6756
02:38:06,870 --> 02:38:06,880

 

6757
02:38:06,880 --> 02:38:08,710

It's a lot going on. Yeah, unfortunately

6758
02:38:08,710 --> 02:38:08,720
It's a lot going on. Yeah, unfortunately
 

6759
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:10,070
It's a lot going on. Yeah, unfortunately
there's an awful lot going on at the

6760
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:10,080
there's an awful lot going on at the
 

6761
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:11,030
there's an awful lot going on at the
moment, but it's because we've been

6762
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,040
moment, but it's because we've been
 

6763
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:13,670
moment, but it's because we've been
pinned in. So, everything's stacked. It

6764
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:13,680
pinned in. So, everything's stacked. It
 

6765

doesn't normally look like this, but you

possible because we have trapped volume
 

6845
02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:53,349

What's my opinion on EMA cloud stats? I
 

6993
02:43:38,080 --> 02:43:40,309
What's my opinion on EMA cloud stats? I
think they're actually really good, but

6994
02:43:40,309 --> 02:43:40,319
think they're actually really good, but
 

6995
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:41,910
think they're actually really good, but
they work better in trending markets.

6996
02:43:41,910 --> 02:43:41,920
they work better in trending markets.

understanding market conditions before
 

7003
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:48,230
understanding market conditions before
you come to the market. If you're a

7029
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:20,389

So, here we go. We're going to lift now.

02:44:20,389 --> 02:44:20,399
So, here we go. We're going to lift now.

950. I'd be watching SPY into 686 here.
And if we lift aggressively here, you

7042
02:44:35,590 --> 02:44:35,600
And if we lift aggressively here, you
 

7043
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:45,910
And if we lift aggressively here, you
are looking for 25,025.

7044

02:44:52,160 --> 02:45:05,670
pulled out. So, please don't spam chat.
Okay.

7052
02:45:05,670 --> 02:45:05,680

 

7053
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:10,150

Spy trying to get to that 686.

7054
02:45:10,150 --> 02:45:10,160

 

7055
02:45:10,160 --> 02:45:12,070

VIX coming down into that key pivot as

7056
02:45:12,070 --> 02:45:12,080
VIX coming down into that key pivot as
 

7057
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:14,309
VIX coming down into that key pivot as
well. The high from Monday the 9th of

7058
02:45:14,309 --> 02:45:14,319
well. The high from Monday the 9th of
 

7059
02:45:14,319 --> 02:45:17,190
well. The high from Monday the 9th of
Feb. VIX coming right down into it. I

7060
02:45:17,190 --> 02:45:17,200
Feb. VIX coming right down into it. I
 

7061
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:19,030
Feb. VIX coming right down into it. I
think once we clear some of this out,

7062
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:19,040
think once we clear some of this out,
 

7063
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:20,630
think once we clear some of this out,
there's probably a bit of a squeeze and

7064
02:45:20,630 --> 02:45:20,640
there's probably a bit of a squeeze and
 

7065
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:23,110
there's probably a bit of a squeeze and
then a failure. We're very, very, very

7066
02:45:23,110 --> 02:45:23,120
then a failure. We're very, very, very
 

7067
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:25,910
then a failure. We're very, very, very
thin as we get above 25,50. There's

7068
02:45:25,910 --> 02:45:25,920
thin as we get above 25,50. There's
 

7069
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:34,710
thin as we get above 25,50. There's
probably a failure up here somewhere.

7070
02:45:34,710 --> 02:45:34,720

 

7071
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:37,750

Do we think we go to 25,000 today? Uh

7096
02:46:15,110 --> 02:46:15,120
Do we think we go to 25,000 today? Uh
 

7097
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:18,070
Do we think we go to 25,000 today? Uh
it's possible. Um yes, it's very very

7098
02:46:18,070 --> 02:46:18,080
it's possible. Um yes, it's very very
 

7099
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:20,389
it's possible. Um yes, it's very very
possible. We can set a trap anywhere in

7100
02:46:20,389 --> 02:46:20,399
possible. We can set a trap anywhere in
 

7101
02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:22,309
possible. We can set a trap anywhere in
here, folks. Right. So this will be a

7102
02:46:22,309 --> 02:46:22,319
here, folks. Right. So this will be a
 

7103
02:46:22,319 --> 02:46:24,309
here, folks. Right. So this will be a
clear out of highs anywhere in here. If

7104
02:46:24,309 --> 02:46:24,319
clear out of highs anywhere in here. If
 

7105
02:46:24,319 --> 02:46:25,750
clear out of highs anywhere in here. If
you look at an hourly, if you look at

7106
02:46:25,750 --> 02:46:25,760
you look at an hourly, if you look at
 

7107
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:28,070
you look at an hourly, if you look at
the volume,

7108
02:46:28,070 --> 02:46:28,080
the volume,
 

7109
02:46:28,080 --> 02:46:29,990
the volume,
I'd be very conscious about a trap being

7110
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:30,000
I'd be very conscious about a trap being
 

7111
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:31,670
I'd be very conscious about a trap being
set anywhere in here. Right? If we think

7112
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:31,680
set anywhere in here. Right? If we think
 

7113
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:33,190
set anywhere in here. Right? If we think
about the volume we just talked about,

7114
02:46:33,190 --> 02:46:33,200
about the volume we just talked about,
 

7115
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:35,030
about the volume we just talked about,
if we thought think about how thin we

7116
02:46:35,030 --> 02:46:35,040
if we thought think about how thin we
 

7117
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:37,110
if we thought think about how thin we
are, if we think about taking these

7118
02:46:37,110 --> 02:46:37,120
are, if we think about taking these
 

7119
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:39,670
are, if we think about taking these
stops out, anywhere in here can be a

7120
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:39,680
stops out, anywhere in here can be a
 

7121
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:42,070
stops out, anywhere in here can be a
trap. If they set a giant squeeze, I

7122
02:46:42,070 --> 02:46:42,080
trap. If they set a giant squeeze, I
 

7123
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:44,309
trap. If they set a giant squeeze, I
mean, we can't rule this out. I find it

7124
02:46:44,309 --> 02:46:44,319
mean, we can't rule this out. I find it
 

7125
02:46:44,319 --> 02:46:46,550
mean, we can't rule this out. I find it
somewhat unlikely. I think somewhere up

7126
02:46:46,550 --> 02:46:46,560
somewhat unlikely. I think somewhere up
 

7127
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:54,389
somewhat unlikely. I think somewhere up
here, you will see buyers get caught.

7128
02:46:54,389 --> 02:46:54,399

 

7129
02:46:54,399 --> 02:47:00,870

That's what I would say.

7130
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:00,880

 

7131
02:47:00,880 --> 02:47:02,710

Oh my gosh. It would be really nice if

7132
02:47:02,710 --> 02:47:02,720
Oh my gosh. It would be really nice if
 

7133
02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:04,150
Oh my gosh. It would be really nice if
they just came and clear out the levels.

7134
02:47:04,150 --> 02:47:04,160
they just came and clear out the levels.
 

7135
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:06,630
they just came and clear out the levels.
Maybe we get a trade this afternoon.

7136
02:47:06,630 --> 02:47:06,640
Maybe we get a trade this afternoon.
 

7137
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:08,150
Maybe we get a trade this afternoon.
Wouldn't that be lovely if they can come

7138
02:47:08,150 --> 02:47:08,160
Wouldn't that be lovely if they can come
 

7139
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:11,269
Wouldn't that be lovely if they can come
and clear out some of these?

7140
02:47:11,269 --> 02:47:11,279
and clear out some of these?
 

7141
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:13,110
and clear out some of these?
Any questions, folks, before I get off?

02:47:28,070 --> 02:47:28,080

 

7153
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:29,830

What do I think BTC is going to do next

7154
02:47:29,830 --> 02:47:29,840
What do I think BTC is going to do next
 

7155
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:43,349
What do I think BTC is going to do next
week? Let's have a look.

7156
02:47:43,349 --> 02:47:43,359

 

7157
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:45,510

I think it's done 50% of the potential

7158
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:45,520
I think it's done 50% of the potential
 

7159
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:48,150
I think it's done 50% of the potential
move so far.

7160
02:47:48,150 --> 02:47:48,160
move so far.
 

7161
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:49,830
move so far.
this right at the 50% where it's finding

7162
02:47:49,830 --> 02:47:49,840
this right at the 50% where it's finding
 

7163
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:52,389
this right at the 50% where it's finding
a bid, right? So, let's just have a look

7164
02:47:52,389 --> 02:47:52,399
a bid, right? So, let's just have a look
 

7165
02:47:52,399 --> 02:47:57,510
a bid, right? So, let's just have a look
at some volume here.

7166
02:47:57,510 --> 02:47:57,520

 

7167
02:47:57,520 --> 02:48:02,230

Might be too far.

7168
02:48:02,230 --> 02:48:02,240

 

7169
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:03,990

All right,

7170
02:48:03,990 --> 02:48:04,000
All right,
 

7171
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,590
All right,
look at that. It came right into this

7172
02:48:05,590 --> 02:48:05,600
look at that. It came right into this
 

7173
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:09,750
look at that. It came right into this
node.

7174
02:48:09,750 --> 02:48:09,760

 

7175
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:14,389

Right into this node.

7176
02:48:14,389 --> 02:48:14,399

 

7177
02:48:14,399 --> 02:48:18,630

This is key.

7178
02:48:18,630 --> 02:48:18,640

 

7179
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:20,950

Right. You lose that, you're going to

7180
02:48:20,950 --> 02:48:20,960
Right. You lose that, you're going to
 

7181
02:48:20,960 --> 02:48:23,429
Right. You lose that, you're going to
come down to equilibrium of the whole of

7182
02:48:23,429 --> 02:48:23,439
come down to equilibrium of the whole of
 

7183
02:48:23,439 --> 02:48:27,349
come down to equilibrium of the whole of
the bull run from last year.

7184
02:48:27,349 --> 02:48:27,359
the bull run from last year.
 

7185
02:48:27,359 --> 02:48:30,150
the bull run from last year.
Well, last year from yeah, 2024, two

7186
02:48:30,150 --> 02:48:30,160
Well, last year from yeah, 2024, two
 

7187
02:48:30,160 --> 02:48:33,910
Well, last year from yeah, 2024, two
years ago, right? So, right here,

7188
02:48:33,910 --> 02:48:33,920
years ago, right? So, right here,
 

7189
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:37,590
years ago, right? So, right here,
if you lose this low that you put in,

7190
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:37,600
if you lose this low that you put in,
 

7191
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:39,670
if you lose this low that you put in,
right? Then there is a very, very good

7192
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:39,680
right? Then there is a very, very good
 

7193
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:42,389
right? Then there is a very, very good
chance that you come down into here. Now

7194
02:48:42,389 --> 02:48:42,399
chance that you come down into here. Now
 

7195
02:48:42,399 --> 02:48:44,550
chance that you come down into here. Now
anywhere from here possibly all the way

7196
02:48:44,550 --> 02:48:44,560
anywhere from here possibly all the way
 

7197
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:46,950
anywhere from here possibly all the way
down to 30,000 like we've talked about

7198
02:48:46,950 --> 02:48:46,960
down to 30,000 like we've talked about
 

7199
02:48:46,960 --> 02:48:48,630
down to 30,000 like we've talked about
is where I think the best buying

7200
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:48,640
is where I think the best buying
 

7201
02:48:48,640 --> 02:48:50,230
is where I think the best buying
opportunity is. Can they hold it here?

7202
02:48:50,230 --> 02:48:50,240
opportunity is. Can they hold it here?
 

7203
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:51,990
opportunity is. Can they hold it here?
They can. But you know this is only two

7204
02:48:51,990 --> 02:48:52,000
They can. But you know this is only two
 

7205
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,750
They can. But you know this is only two
legs. There is an undercut. They would

7206
02:48:53,750 --> 02:48:53,760
legs. There is an undercut. They would
 

7207
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,830
legs. There is an undercut. They would
have to reclaim this undercut for any

7208
02:48:55,830 --> 02:48:55,840
have to reclaim this undercut for any
 

7209
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:57,429
have to reclaim this undercut for any
bullish momentum to come back in this

7210
02:48:57,429 --> 02:48:57,439
bullish momentum to come back in this
 

7211
02:48:57,439 --> 02:48:59,269
bullish momentum to come back in this
stock. Has selling slowed down?

7212
02:48:59,269 --> 02:48:59,279
stock. Has selling slowed down?
 

7213
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:01,349
stock. Has selling slowed down?
Absolutely. But they will probably be

7214
02:49:01,349 --> 02:49:01,359
Absolutely. But they will probably be
 

7215
02:49:01,359 --> 02:49:03,110
Absolutely. But they will probably be
waiting for a retest of somewhere up

7216
02:49:03,110 --> 02:49:03,120
waiting for a retest of somewhere up
 

7217
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:05,750
waiting for a retest of somewhere up
here 75s. And if they sell 75s and they

7218
02:49:05,750 --> 02:49:05,760
here 75s. And if they sell 75s and they
 

7219
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:08,309
here 75s. And if they sell 75s and they
get a crack under 60,000 I'd be looking

7220
02:49:08,309 --> 02:49:08,319
get a crack under 60,000 I'd be looking
 

7221
02:49:08,319 --> 02:49:10,950
get a crack under 60,000 I'd be looking
for this move here.

7222
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:10,960
for this move here.
 

7223
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:13,190
for this move here.
Right. And just remember we can do 70 to

7224
02:49:13,190 --> 02:49:13,200
Right. And just remember we can do 70 to
 

7225
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:15,910
Right. And just remember we can do 70 to
80% pullbacks. We can if we do this move

7226
02:49:15,910 --> 02:49:15,920
80% pullbacks. We can if we do this move
 

7227
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:20,150
80% pullbacks. We can if we do this move
here it'll be almost 70%. So ideally

7228
02:49:20,150 --> 02:49:20,160
here it'll be almost 70%. So ideally
 

7229
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:22,870
here it'll be almost 70%. So ideally
accumulation ideally would happen around

7230
02:49:22,870 --> 02:49:22,880
accumulation ideally would happen around
 

7231
02:49:22,880 --> 02:49:26,630
accumulation ideally would happen around
here at 40,000 and maybe even down into

7232
02:49:26,630 --> 02:49:26,640
here at 40,000 and maybe even down into
 

7233
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:28,630
here at 40,000 and maybe even down into
30,000. It's possible that they hold the

7234
02:49:28,630 --> 02:49:28,640
30,000. It's possible that they hold the
 

7235
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:30,469
30,000. It's possible that they hold the
level we're at now. But historic

7236
02:49:30,469 --> 02:49:30,479
level we're at now. But historic
 

7237
02:49:30,479 --> 02:49:32,950
level we're at now. But historic
historically based on historically what

7238
02:49:32,950 --> 02:49:32,960
historically based on historically what
 

7239
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:35,670
historically based on historically what
we do when we leave bull cycles, we have

7240
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:35,680
we do when we leave bull cycles, we have
 

7241
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:38,710
we do when we leave bull cycles, we have
the chance to come down into these

7242
02:49:38,710 --> 02:49:38,720
the chance to come down into these
 

7243
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:40,710
the chance to come down into these
levels. It will be very upsetting for

7244
02:49:40,710 --> 02:49:40,720
levels. It will be very upsetting for
 

7245
02:49:40,720 --> 02:49:42,710
levels. It will be very upsetting for
you guys who are very bullish on it. But

7246
02:49:42,710 --> 02:49:42,720
you guys who are very bullish on it. But
 

7247
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:44,550
you guys who are very bullish on it. But
uh I'm not it's not that I want it to do

7248
02:49:44,550 --> 02:49:44,560
uh I'm not it's not that I want it to do
 

7249
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:47,030
uh I'm not it's not that I want it to do
these things. It's that's that is what

7250
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,040
these things. It's that's that is what
 

7251
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:49,510
these things. It's that's that is what
it does. But if we look also look

7252
02:49:49,510 --> 02:49:49,520
it does. But if we look also look
 

7253
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:52,230
it does. But if we look also look
historically 50% retracement out of the

7254
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:52,240
historically 50% retracement out of the
 

7255
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:55,190
historically 50% retracement out of the
bull cycle.

7256
02:49:55,190 --> 02:49:55,200
bull cycle.
 

7257
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:57,030
bull cycle.
Almost 50% retracement out the bull

7258
02:49:57,030 --> 02:49:57,040
Almost 50% retracement out the bull
 

7259
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:59,750
Almost 50% retracement out the bull
cycle. So maybe we have done a 50%

7260
02:49:59,750 --> 02:49:59,760
cycle. So maybe we have done a 50%
 

7261
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:01,349
cycle. So maybe we have done a 50%
retracement out of this bull cycle.

7262
02:50:01,349 --> 02:50:01,359
retracement out of this bull cycle.
 

7263
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:02,950
retracement out of this bull cycle.
There's your thousand plus day bull

7264
02:50:02,950 --> 02:50:02,960
There's your thousand plus day bull
 

7265
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:05,590
There's your thousand plus day bull
cycle. Maybe. But this bare cycle will

7266
02:50:05,590 --> 02:50:05,600
cycle. Maybe. But this bare cycle will
 

7267
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:10,309
cycle. Maybe. But this bare cycle will
not be over. Not by a long shot.

7268
02:50:10,309 --> 02:50:10,319

 

7269
02:50:10,319 --> 02:50:13,030

It's got a long way to go and we've got

7270
02:50:13,030 --> 02:50:13,040
It's got a long way to go and we've got
 

7271
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:15,349
It's got a long way to go and we've got
a lot of volatility uh in all markets

7272
02:50:15,349 --> 02:50:15,359
a lot of volatility uh in all markets
