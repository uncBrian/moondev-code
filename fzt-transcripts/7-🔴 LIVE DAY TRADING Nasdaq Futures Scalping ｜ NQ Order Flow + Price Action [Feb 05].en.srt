00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,990
great day yesterday. Offered some
amazing short opportunities on stream.

10
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
amazing short opportunities on stream.
 

11
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,749
amazing short opportunities on stream.
And if any of you hung around until the

12
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
And if any of you hung around until the
 

13
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,749
And if any of you hung around until the
end of day, you got that short rally

14
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
end of day, you got that short rally
 

15
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,189
end of day, you got that short rally
rally cover as uh everyone covered their

16
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
rally cover as uh everyone covered their
 

17
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,550
rally cover as uh everyone covered their
shorts for that move back up. All right.

18
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
shorts for that move back up. All right.
 

19
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,550
shorts for that move back up. All right.
So this morning we can talk about what

20
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
So this morning we can talk about what
 

21
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,029
So this morning we can talk about what
we're looking at. Uh finally, finally,

22
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
we're looking at. Uh finally, finally,
 

23
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,469
we're looking at. Uh finally, finally,
finally, finally, we'd have to zoom in,

24
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
finally, finally, we'd have to zoom in,
 

25
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,830
finally, finally, we'd have to zoom in,
but finally, you can see the Ballinger

26
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
but finally, you can see the Ballinger
 

27
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,990
but finally, you can see the Ballinger
bands are starting to expand, right?

28
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
bands are starting to expand, right?
 

29
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,749
bands are starting to expand, right?
We've been in contracting Ballinger

30
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
We've been in contracting Ballinger
 

31
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,909
We've been in contracting Ballinger
bands for a long time since mid

32
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
bands for a long time since mid
 

33
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,230
bands for a long time since mid
November, and now we've got expanding

34
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
November, and now we've got expanding
 

35
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,830
November, and now we've got expanding
Ballinger bands, which gives us more

36
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
Ballinger bands, which gives us more
 

37
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,749
Ballinger bands, which gives us more
range to play with. The 5day, you can

38
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
range to play with. The 5day, you can
 

39
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,950
range to play with. The 5day, you can
see this is what we've talked about all

40
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
see this is what we've talked about all
 

41
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,029
see this is what we've talked about all
week. 5-day, 20-day, 50-day, finally

42
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
week. 5-day, 20-day, 50-day, finally
 

43
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,270
week. 5-day, 20-day, 50-day, finally
with a cross. And we will probably start

44
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
with a cross. And we will probably start
 

45
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,790
with a cross. And we will probably start
doing a move like this. Now it doesn't

46
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
doing a move like this. Now it doesn't
 

47
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,390
doing a move like this. Now it doesn't
mean there can't be a mean reversion

48
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
mean there can't be a mean reversion
 

49
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,550
mean there can't be a mean reversion
first but this will be the target not

50
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
first but this will be the target not
 

51
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,230
first but this will be the target not
necessarily today guys over the next

52
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
necessarily today guys over the next
 

53
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,710
necessarily today guys over the next
week or two maybe even longer but we are

54
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
week or two maybe even longer but we are
 

55
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,469
week or two maybe even longer but we are
starting to leave this range now if we

56
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
starting to leave this range now if we
 

57
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,990
starting to leave this range now if we
look at this is the range built out

58
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
look at this is the range built out
 

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,629
look at this is the range built out
since the high all right we are starting

60
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
since the high all right we are starting
 

61
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,550
since the high all right we are starting
to leave this range you can see even

62
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
to leave this range you can see even
 

63
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,150
to leave this range you can see even
actually overnight they've come and back

64
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
actually overnight they've come and back
 

65
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,469
actually overnight they've come and back
tested that Ballinger band and rejected

66
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
tested that Ballinger band and rejected
 

67
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,029
tested that Ballinger band and rejected
it and back tested the value from this

68
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
it and back tested the value from this
 

69
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,189
it and back tested the value from this
pivot high value area low and rejected

70
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
pivot high value area low and rejected
 

71
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,430
pivot high value area low and rejected
it and we've cleaned out lots of stops

72
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
it and we've cleaned out lots of stops
 

73
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,110
it and we've cleaned out lots of stops
there anything really left to look for

74
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
there anything really left to look for
 

75
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,110
there anything really left to look for
we have an old gap fill down here. All

76
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
we have an old gap fill down here. All
 

77
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,469
we have an old gap fill down here. All
right, we have an old gap right in here.

78
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
right, we have an old gap right in here.
 

79
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,990
right, we have an old gap right in here.
Oh, market's going to be a pain today

80
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, market's going to be a pain today
 

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,830
Oh, market's going to be a pain today
and not draw it out. There we go. So,

82
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
and not draw it out. There we go. So,
 

83
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,430
and not draw it out. There we go. So,
I'd be watching if we get downside 24700

84
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
I'd be watching if we get downside 24700
 

85
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,589
I'd be watching if we get downside 24700
to 24575

86
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
to 24575
 

87
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,189
to 24575
if if there's continued downside

88
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
if if there's continued downside
 

89
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,029
if if there's continued downside
pressure. All right, it's one of the

90
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
pressure. All right, it's one of the
 

91
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,230
pressure. All right, it's one of the
things we're looking at. If we look at

92
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
things we're looking at. If we look at
 

93
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,629
things we're looking at. If we look at
this profile here, we can see we're into

94
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
this profile here, we can see we're into
 

95
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,950
this profile here, we can see we're into
a node right here. All right, this is

96
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
a node right here. All right, this is
 

97
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,029
a node right here. All right, this is
from the last year. This is 12 months

98
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
from the last year. This is 12 months
 

99
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,350
from the last year. This is 12 months
worth of trading. So, we know that from

100
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
worth of trading. So, we know that from
 

101
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,350
worth of trading. So, we know that from
the last 12 months, we have a node right

102
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
the last 12 months, we have a node right
 

103
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,950
the last 12 months, we have a node right
here where we're at right here, right

104
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
here where we're at right here, right
 

105
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,950
here where we're at right here, right
now. If we start getting heavy

106
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
now. If we start getting heavy
 

107
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,589
now. If we start getting heavy
underneath uh let's call it 750, 745. If

108
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
underneath uh let's call it 750, 745. If
 

109
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,830
underneath uh let's call it 750, 745. If
we start staying heavy underneath that

110
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
we start staying heavy underneath that
 

111
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,670
we start staying heavy underneath that
and they don't set a trap, we need to be

112
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
and they don't set a trap, we need to be
 

113
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,350
and they don't set a trap, we need to be
very careful about traps today for fail

114
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
very careful about traps today for fail
 

115
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,189
very careful about traps today for fail
breakouts and they don't set a trap.

116
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
breakouts and they don't set a trap.
 

117
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,430
breakouts and they don't set a trap.
There is a move down to 535 which will

118
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
There is a move down to 535 which will
 

119
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,670
There is a move down to 535 which will
fill this gap. So basically in this

120
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:03,680
fill this gap. So basically in this
 

121
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,749
fill this gap. So basically in this
little gap fill area 750 700 let go and

122
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
little gap fill area 750 700 let go and
 

123
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,710
little gap fill area 750 700 let go and
we can be looking at 550s. All right 700

124
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
we can be looking at 550s. All right 700
 

125
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,670
we can be looking at 550s. All right 700
750 let go we can be looking at 7 uh

126
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
750 let go we can be looking at 7 uh
 

127
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,070
750 let go we can be looking at 7 uh
550s but we want to be very very very

128
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
550s but we want to be very very very
 

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,790
550s but we want to be very very very
very careful about failed breakdowns.

130
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
very careful about failed breakdowns.
 

131
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,309
very careful about failed breakdowns.
All right the moves we've had this week

132
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
All right the moves we've had this week
 

133
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,150
All right the moves we've had this week
have been absolutely wonderful. We've

134
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
have been absolutely wonderful. We've
 

135
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,589
have been absolutely wonderful. We've
captured a lot of it especially

136
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
captured a lot of it especially
 

137
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,830
captured a lot of it especially
yesterday. We don't really want to be

138
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
yesterday. We don't really want to be
 

139
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,909
yesterday. We don't really want to be
shorting the lows without structure. So

140
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
shorting the lows without structure. So
 

141
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,070
shorting the lows without structure. So
the reason for that being is we can do a

142
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
the reason for that being is we can do a
 

143
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,350
the reason for that being is we can do a
little look below and fail. All right.

144
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
little look below and fail. All right.
 

145
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,029
little look below and fail. All right.
It would be very easy for them to come

146
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
It would be very easy for them to come
 

147
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,190
It would be very easy for them to come
into this low volume node, have shorts

148
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
into this low volume node, have shorts
 

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,949
into this low volume node, have shorts
pile in, and then go, "No, we're not

150
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
pile in, and then go, "No, we're not
 

151
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,709
pile in, and then go, "No, we're not
ready yet. Thanks very much." And back

152
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
ready yet. Thanks very much." And back
 

153
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,909
ready yet. Thanks very much." And back
up into here. All right, we would sort

154
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
up into here. All right, we would sort
 

155
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,750
up into here. All right, we would sort
of expect that at some point, if not

156
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
of expect that at some point, if not
 

157
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,350
of expect that at some point, if not
today, at some point soon, unless we go

158
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
today, at some point soon, unless we go
 

159
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,910
today, at some point soon, unless we go
full risk off. Look, lower high, puke

160
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
full risk off. Look, lower high, puke
 

161
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,670
full risk off. Look, lower high, puke
down. We're expecting a pullback. All

162
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
down. We're expecting a pullback. All
 

163
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,269
down. We're expecting a pullback. All
right, so it might happen here. They

164
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
right, so it might happen here. They
 

165
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,550
right, so it might happen here. They
might drift it all the way down and do

166
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
might drift it all the way down and do
 

167
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,110
might drift it all the way down and do
it, but at some point they are going to

168
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
it, but at some point they are going to
 

169
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,790
it, but at some point they are going to
do it. So be very careful about thinking

170
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
do it. So be very careful about thinking
 

171
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,150
do it. So be very careful about thinking
about to short the low outside the

172
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
about to short the low outside the
 

173
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,670
about to short the low outside the
Ballinger band. All right, think about

174
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
Ballinger band. All right, think about
 

175
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,829
Ballinger band. All right, think about
the structure of the move. we don't move

176
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
the structure of the move. we don't move
 

177
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,230
the structure of the move. we don't move
in one direction. Right, going over to

178
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
in one direction. Right, going over to
 

179
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,030
in one direction. Right, going over to
the hourlys. Right, here is our

180
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
the hourlys. Right, here is our
 

181
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,110
the hourlys. Right, here is our
developing week.

182
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
developing week.
 

183
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,150
developing week.
Uh, let's delete this. Make sure. Okay.

184
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
Uh, let's delete this. Make sure. Okay.
 

185
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,990
Uh, let's delete this. Make sure. Okay.
Yes, there we go. Right, this is our

186
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes, there we go. Right, this is our
 

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,509
Yes, there we go. Right, this is our
developing week profile here. You can

188
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
developing week profile here. You can
 

189
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,110
developing week profile here. You can
see we've left most of the volume up

190
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
see we've left most of the volume up
 

191
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,670
see we've left most of the volume up
here. So, all the time we're under this

192
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
here. So, all the time we're under this
 

193
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,310
here. So, all the time we're under this
uh 2500. Technically, we're in a sell.

194
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
uh 2500. Technically, we're in a sell.
 

195
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,670
uh 2500. Technically, we're in a sell.
All right. Technically, we're in a cell.

196
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
All right. Technically, we're in a cell.
 

197
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,430
All right. Technically, we're in a cell.
You can see breakdown, bare flag,

198
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
You can see breakdown, bare flag,
 

199
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,829
You can see breakdown, bare flag,
breakdown, bare flag, breakdown. It

200
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
breakdown, bare flag, breakdown. It
 

201
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,269
breakdown, bare flag, breakdown. It
might need to build liquidity again

202
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
might need to build liquidity again
 

203
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,790
might need to build liquidity again
before it moves lower. It might need to

204
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
before it moves lower. It might need to
 

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,070
before it moves lower. It might need to
come and do a little trap before it

206
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
come and do a little trap before it
 

207
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,070
come and do a little trap before it
moves lower. We will have to see. All

208
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
moves lower. We will have to see. All
 

209
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,509
moves lower. We will have to see. All
right, so we're going to use this

210
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
right, so we're going to use this
 

211
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,870
right, so we're going to use this
liquidity here. We know there's a

212
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
liquidity here. We know there's a
 

213
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,350
liquidity here. We know there's a
massive node here, 25,045,

214
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
massive node here, 25,045,
 

215
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,430
massive node here, 25,045,
the previous day point of control. We

216
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
the previous day point of control. We
 

217
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,790
the previous day point of control. We
had a big wash here at sort of 7 a.m.

218
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
had a big wash here at sort of 7 a.m.
 

219
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,550
had a big wash here at sort of 7 a.m.
and we're very thin on that wash. All

220
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
and we're very thin on that wash. All
 

221
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,310
and we're very thin on that wash. All
right, we weren't thin here. We have it

222
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
right, we weren't thin here. We have it
 

223
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,990
right, we weren't thin here. We have it
built in structure- wise, but if they

224
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
built in structure- wise, but if they
 

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,150
built in structure- wise, but if they
want to repric that 7 a.m. wash, they

226
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
want to repric that 7 a.m. wash, they
 

227
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,630
want to repric that 7 a.m. wash, they
can. So, I am aware of that move. Right,

228
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
can. So, I am aware of that move. Right,
 

229
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,070
can. So, I am aware of that move. Right,
we have targets below like I talked

230
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
we have targets below like I talked
 

231
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,190
we have targets below like I talked
about this guy right here into this node

232
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
about this guy right here into this node
 

233
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,230
about this guy right here into this node
619 and then all the way down here into

234
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
619 and then all the way down here into
 

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,389
619 and then all the way down here into
these uh four and 500s like we've talked

236
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
these uh four and 500s like we've talked
 

237
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,350
these uh four and 500s like we've talked
about. So there is a move into 550 today

238
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
about. So there is a move into 550 today
 

239
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,350
about. So there is a move into 550 today
if they want to do it. But again, I

240
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
if they want to do it. But again, I
 

241
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,470
if they want to do it. But again, I
would be very very very careful about

242
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
would be very very very careful about
 

243
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,310
would be very very very careful about
getting caught shorting these lows.

244
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
getting caught shorting these lows.
 

245
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,949
getting caught shorting these lows.
Anything like this can rip faces, come

246
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
Anything like this can rip faces, come
 

247
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,790
Anything like this can rip faces, come
and retest here, here, here, and even

248
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
and retest here, here, here, and even
 

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,870
and retest here, here, here, and even
here. And then they might want to set a

250
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
here. And then they might want to set a
 

251
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,949
here. And then they might want to set a
little bull trap over this and then pop

252
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
little bull trap over this and then pop
 

253
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,350
little bull trap over this and then pop
it back down. So, we need to be aware of

254
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
it back down. So, we need to be aware of
 

255
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,990
it back down. So, we need to be aware of
that. Um, what I'm basically saying is

256
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
that. Um, what I'm basically saying is
 

257
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,829
that. Um, what I'm basically saying is
an inside day. We need to be aware of an

258
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
an inside day. We need to be aware of an
 

259
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,430
an inside day. We need to be aware of an
inside day building. We're outside at

260
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
inside day building. We're outside at
 

261
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,190
inside day building. We're outside at
the moment, but if it's a failed break,

262
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
the moment, but if it's a failed break,
 

263
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,910
the moment, but if it's a failed break,
we come back inside yesterday's, we can

264
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
we come back inside yesterday's, we can
 

265
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,230
we come back inside yesterday's, we can
build lots of range here for them to use

266
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
build lots of range here for them to use
 

267
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,230
build lots of range here for them to use
later on either today or tomorrow. All

268
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
later on either today or tomorrow. All
 

269
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,670
later on either today or tomorrow. All
right? So, just be aware of that.

270
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
right? So, just be aware of that.
 

271
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,190
right? So, just be aware of that.
Remember, like not every day is going to

272
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
Remember, like not every day is going to
 

273
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,269
Remember, like not every day is going to
be that A+ trade. All right? If we look

274
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
be that A+ trade. All right? If we look
 

275
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,430
be that A+ trade. All right? If we look
at overnight, we just have a look at

276
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
at overnight, we just have a look at
 

277
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,030
at overnight, we just have a look at
what we did overnight. We traded pretty

278
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
what we did overnight. We traded pretty
 

279
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,949
what we did overnight. We traded pretty
much inside

280
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
much inside
 

281
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,110
much inside
yesterday's val, right? yesterday came

282
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
yesterday's val, right? yesterday came
 

283
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,310
yesterday's val, right? yesterday came
under Val drive up. Uh I was looking for

284
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
under Val drive up. Uh I was looking for
 

285
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,069
under Val drive up. Uh I was looking for
a short here. Anyone in Discord will

286
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
a short here. Anyone in Discord will
 

287
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,110
a short here. Anyone in Discord will
know I was looking for the short there.

288
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
know I was looking for the short there.
 

289
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,550
know I was looking for the short there.
They did it right on the bell. Right on

290
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
They did it right on the bell. Right on
 

291
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,230
They did it right on the bell. Right on
MC. I wasn't here for it. I'd left by

292
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
MC. I wasn't here for it. I'd left by
 

293
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,230
MC. I wasn't here for it. I'd left by
then. I'd had two attempts at it. Right.

294
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
then. I'd had two attempts at it. Right.
 

295
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,710
then. I'd had two attempts at it. Right.
We came up, hit the IB high, trap some

296
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
We came up, hit the IB high, trap some
 

297
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,949
We came up, hit the IB high, trap some
buyers up there. There's the short back

298
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
buyers up there. There's the short back
 

299
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,430
buyers up there. There's the short back
down. There's the hold and base. There's

300
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
down. There's the hold and base. There's
 

301
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,110
down. There's the hold and base. There's
the second leg up. There's the failure

302
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
the second leg up. There's the failure
 

303
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,790
the second leg up. There's the failure
to break out the second leg. There's the

304
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
to break out the second leg. There's the
 

305
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,949
to break out the second leg. There's the
rotation back down to the pivot. We

306
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
rotation back down to the pivot. We
 

307
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,949
rotation back down to the pivot. We
build liquidity out in here and then

308
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
build liquidity out in here and then
 

309
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,310
build liquidity out in here and then
they puke it. All right. So, we're

310
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
they puke it. All right. So, we're
 

311
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,790
they puke it. All right. So, we're
watching to see any retest in here. Is

312
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
watching to see any retest in here. Is
 

313
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,630
watching to see any retest in here. Is
there an opportunity to get long for

314
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
there an opportunity to get long for
 

315
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,389
there an opportunity to get long for
that move there and then short back

316
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
that move there and then short back
 

317
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,870
that move there and then short back
down? Long into here, then short back

318
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
down? Long into here, then short back
 

319
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,470
down? Long into here, then short back
down. I don't really want to be short

320
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
down. I don't really want to be short
 

321
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,750
down. I don't really want to be short
down here. We'd have to build out

322
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
down here. We'd have to build out
 

323
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,670
down here. We'd have to build out
sufficient liquidity for me to feel

324
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
sufficient liquidity for me to feel
 

325
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,190
sufficient liquidity for me to feel
comfortable doing that today. Swing

326
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
comfortable doing that today. Swing
 

327
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,310
comfortable doing that today. Swing
shorts. Sure, you guys are having a

328
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
shorts. Sure, you guys are having a
 

329
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,150
shorts. Sure, you guys are having a
great time right now, right? A great

330
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
great time right now, right? A great
 

331
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,269
great time right now, right? A great
time right now. Okay, so

332
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
time right now. Okay, so
 

333
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,790
time right now. Okay, so
we're watching these same levels, right?

334
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
we're watching these same levels, right?
 

335
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,230
we're watching these same levels, right?
This is the lower time frame, but if you

336
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
This is the lower time frame, but if you
 

337
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,910
This is the lower time frame, but if you
want to mark mark out any of these de

338
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
want to mark mark out any of these de
 

339
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,430
want to mark mark out any of these de
levels, now's your chance to do it

340
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
levels, now's your chance to do it
 

341
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,829
levels, now's your chance to do it
before I move to ES. But certainly going

342
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
before I move to ES. But certainly going
 

343
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,230
before I move to ES. But certainly going
to be watching uh previous day value

344
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
to be watching uh previous day value
 

345
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,670
to be watching uh previous day value
area low and 25,000 that gap fill up to

346
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
area low and 25,000 that gap fill up to
 

347
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,230
area low and 25,000 that gap fill up to
25,000. Do we do sort of fail breakout,

348
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
25,000. Do we do sort of fail breakout,
 

349
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,230
25,000. Do we do sort of fail breakout,
squeeze up, gap fill, and then sell back

350
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
squeeze up, gap fill, and then sell back
 

351
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,069
squeeze up, gap fill, and then sell back
down? That's one of the big questions.

352
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
down? That's one of the big questions.
 

353
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,829
down? That's one of the big questions.
Uh if we start basing above, I'll tell

354
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
Uh if we start basing above, I'll tell
 

355
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,590
Uh if we start basing above, I'll tell
you the only time I'd really be bullish.

356
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
you the only time I'd really be bullish.
 

357
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,110
you the only time I'd really be bullish.
All right, I'd be willing to play a

358
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
All right, I'd be willing to play a
 

359
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,350
All right, I'd be willing to play a
counter trend up into sort of here and

360
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
counter trend up into sort of here and
 

361
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,910
counter trend up into sort of here and
here and I'd be risk off into those. The

362
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
here and I'd be risk off into those. The
 

363
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,949
here and I'd be risk off into those. The
only time I'd really be thinking about

364
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
only time I'd really be thinking about
 

365
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,350
only time I'd really be thinking about
bullish is if they based above this for

366
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
bullish is if they based above this for
 

367
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,949
bullish is if they based above this for
that move there. But this is likely to

368
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
that move there. But this is likely to
 

369
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,949
that move there. But this is likely to
be a failed breakout for buyers. I see

370
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
be a failed breakout for buyers. I see
 

371
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,710
be a failed breakout for buyers. I see
this as a big range being developed.

372
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
this as a big range being developed.
 

373
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,310
this as a big range being developed.
Want to be careful about fail breakout

374
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
Want to be careful about fail breakout
 

375
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,230
Want to be careful about fail breakout
rotation. Want to be careful about fail

376
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
rotation. Want to be careful about fail
 

377
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,910
rotation. Want to be careful about fail
breakout rotation. But if they based

378
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
breakout rotation. But if they based
 

379
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,230
breakout rotation. But if they based
above here, that is possible. Won't I

380
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
above here, that is possible. Won't I
 

381
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,829
above here, that is possible. Won't I
won't rule it out. It's highly unlikely,

382
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:31,839
won't rule it out. It's highly unlikely,
 

383
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,190
won't rule it out. It's highly unlikely,
but it's possible. So, we're going to

384
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
but it's possible. So, we're going to
 

385
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,629
but it's possible. So, we're going to
talk about it. All right. ES

386
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
talk about it. All right. ES
 

387
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,670
talk about it. All right. ES
and we'll go uh through everything else.

388
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
and we'll go uh through everything else.
 

389
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,509
and we'll go uh through everything else.
All right. So, ES currently at the

390
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
All right. So, ES currently at the
 

391
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,110
All right. So, ES currently at the
previous week low. Remember ENQ well

392
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
previous week low. Remember ENQ well
 

393
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,389
previous week low. Remember ENQ well
below that. If we just have a little

394
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
below that. If we just have a little
 

395
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,069
below that. If we just have a little
zoom out on the dailies, you'll see the

396
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
zoom out on the dailies, you'll see the
 

397
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,750
zoom out on the dailies, you'll see the
relative strength. All right, ES is

398
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
relative strength. All right, ES is
 

399
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,670
relative strength. All right, ES is
still technically in its range. It's

400
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
still technically in its range. It's
 

401
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,389
still technically in its range. It's
starting to leave its range right around

402
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
starting to leave its range right around
 

403
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,190
starting to leave its range right around
here, the 97s. Okay, but technically

404
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
here, the 97s. Okay, but technically
 

405
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,230
here, the 97s. Okay, but technically
speaking, right, ES if even if we wanted

406
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
speaking, right, ES if even if we wanted
 

407
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,710
speaking, right, ES if even if we wanted
to do just these pivots, all right, it's

408
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
to do just these pivots, all right, it's
 

409
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,829
to do just these pivots, all right, it's
still holding. Remember, we're down

410
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
still holding. Remember, we're down
 

411
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,509
still holding. Remember, we're down
here. We've we've cooked these on the

412
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
here. We've we've cooked these on the
 

413
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,110
here. We've we've cooked these on the
Q's already, right? We we're thinking

414
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
Q's already, right? We we're thinking
 

415
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,949
Q's already, right? We we're thinking
about attacking down here now. So,

416
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
about attacking down here now. So,
 

417
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,150
about attacking down here now. So,
relative strength because of the

418
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
relative strength because of the
 

419
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,990
relative strength because of the
rotation, we went over it yesterday. So,

420
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
rotation, we went over it yesterday. So,
 

421
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,590
rotation, we went over it yesterday. So,
want to be careful. ES can still hold

422
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
want to be careful. ES can still hold
 

423
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,670
want to be careful. ES can still hold
and pivot. It might steal some liquidity

424
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
and pivot. It might steal some liquidity
 

425
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,750
and pivot. It might steal some liquidity
and go. So, we want to be aware of that.

426
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
and go. So, we want to be aware of that.
 

427
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,110
and go. So, we want to be aware of that.
If we have a look at the spiders, you're

428
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
If we have a look at the spiders, you're
 

429
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,509
If we have a look at the spiders, you're
going to see the same thing,

430
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
going to see the same thing,
 

431
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,110
going to see the same thing,
right? Still holding a pivot, but

432
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
right? Still holding a pivot, but
 

433
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,829
right? Still holding a pivot, but
actually undercutting some of it. This

434
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
actually undercutting some of it. This
 

435
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,069
actually undercutting some of it. This
is a key key level now on the spiders.

436
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
is a key key level now on the spiders.
 

437
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,829
is a key key level now on the spiders.
Uh 76ers and I would say there's

438
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
Uh 76ers and I would say there's
 

439
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,430
Uh 76ers and I would say there's
probably gamma knowing what they do at

440
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
probably gamma knowing what they do at
 

441
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,710
probably gamma knowing what they do at
75. So, I'd be watching that into 75 if

442
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
75. So, I'd be watching that into 75 if
 

443
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,190
75. So, I'd be watching that into 75 if
they get continued weakness. Uh if we

444
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
they get continued weakness. Uh if we
 

445
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,150
they get continued weakness. Uh if we
zoom this in for a moment

446
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
zoom this in for a moment
 

447
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,910
zoom this in for a moment
underneath previous day low right now.

448
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
underneath previous day low right now.
 

449
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,670
underneath previous day low right now.
So if we reject previous day low,

450
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
So if we reject previous day low,
 

451
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,590
So if we reject previous day low,
if we reject previous day low, there's a

452
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
if we reject previous day low, there's a
 

453
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,509
if we reject previous day low, there's a
drift lower.

454
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
drift lower.
 

455
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,269
drift lower.
All right, if we reclaim that, that's

456
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
All right, if we reclaim that, that's
 

457
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,949
All right, if we reclaim that, that's
where you can potentially get a squeeze

458
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
where you can potentially get a squeeze
 

459
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,629
where you can potentially get a squeeze
up into this pivot, this pre-market

460
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
up into this pivot, this pre-market
 

461
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,829
up into this pivot, this pre-market
pivot, uh 683s and then gap fill if they

462
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
pivot, uh 683s and then gap fill if they
 

463
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,430
pivot, uh 683s and then gap fill if they
really want to get going. Q's is going

464
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
really want to get going. Q's is going
 

465
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,110
really want to get going. Q's is going
to be sort of similar, uh, but with

466
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
to be sort of similar, uh, but with
 

467
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,189
to be sort of similar, uh, but with
relative weakness, right? Sort of

468
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
relative weakness, right? Sort of
 

469
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,629
relative weakness, right? Sort of
similar. So into this key level on the

470
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
similar. So into this key level on the
 

471
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,230
similar. So into this key level on the
cues, I can zoom this out, show you that

472
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
cues, I can zoom this out, show you that
 

473
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,670
cues, I can zoom this out, show you that
key level. We've been looking at this

474
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
key level. We've been looking at this
 

475
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,150
key level. We've been looking at this
green box, right? Big big level here

476
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
green box, right? Big big level here
 

477
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,670
green box, right? Big big level here
under here. Then we come into this huge

478
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
under here. Then we come into this huge
 

479
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,750
under here. Then we come into this huge
node where we found this bid in early

480
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
node where we found this bid in early
 

481
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,829
node where we found this bid in early
November. So in the immediate future, if

482
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
November. So in the immediate future, if
 

483
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,230
November. So in the immediate future, if
you're trading options or the cues, I'd

484
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
you're trading options or the cues, I'd
 

485
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,230
you're trading options or the cues, I'd
be watching this previous day low right

486
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
be watching this previous day low right
 

487
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,990
be watching this previous day low right
here. Might as well call it 650 over 650

488
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
here. Might as well call it 650 over 650
 

489
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,710
here. Might as well call it 650 over 650
up to 60265. If they really want to

490
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
up to 60265. If they really want to
 

491
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,470
up to 60265. If they really want to
squeeze, that is a big big pivot from

492
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
squeeze, that is a big big pivot from
 

493
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,790
squeeze, that is a big big pivot from
after hours and pre-market right here.

494
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
after hours and pre-market right here.
 

495
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,949
after hours and pre-market right here.
Right. Bull traps can live here. So I'd

496
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
Right. Bull traps can live here. So I'd
 

497
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,310
Right. Bull traps can live here. So I'd
be very aware of that. But if they

498
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
be very aware of that. But if they
 

499
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,750
be very aware of that. But if they
really want to squeeze, they have a gap

500
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
really want to squeeze, they have a gap
 

501
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,910
really want to squeeze, they have a gap
fill up here. If they want to do it, we

502
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
fill up here. If they want to do it, we
 

503
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,750
fill up here. If they want to do it, we
will see. We will see. Remember, we have

504
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
will see. We will see. Remember, we have
 

505
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,030
will see. We will see. Remember, we have
jolts at 10:00 today, folks, as well.

506
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
jolts at 10:00 today, folks, as well.
 

507
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,949
jolts at 10:00 today, folks, as well.
Okay, Dixie, uh, still trying to find

508
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
Okay, Dixie, uh, still trying to find
 

509
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,110
Okay, Dixie, uh, still trying to find
this bid off the lows, you can see, but

510
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
this bid off the lows, you can see, but
 

511
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,470
this bid off the lows, you can see, but
it's coming back into range. It's

512
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
it's coming back into range. It's
 

513
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,910
it's coming back into range. It's
probably coming back to the midpoint

514
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
probably coming back to the midpoint
 

515
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,590
probably coming back to the midpoint
since here right now. So, I wouldn't be

516
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
since here right now. So, I wouldn't be
 

517
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,430
since here right now. So, I wouldn't be
surprised. There you go, 61. If it finds

518
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
surprised. There you go, 61. If it finds
 

519
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,110
surprised. There you go, 61. If it finds
a sell soon, it might struggle a little

520
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
a sell soon, it might struggle a little
 

521
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,670
a sell soon, it might struggle a little
bit in the immediate future. Uh, let's

522
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
bit in the immediate future. Uh, let's
 

523
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,750
bit in the immediate future. Uh, let's
have a look at the VIX.

524
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
have a look at the VIX.
 

525
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,430
have a look at the VIX.
Still pumping. You can see breaking out

526
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
Still pumping. You can see breaking out
 

527
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,629
Still pumping. You can see breaking out
of this. We talked about these higher

528
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
of this. We talked about these higher
 

529
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,389
of this. We talked about these higher
lows being built. And then there's the

530
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
lows being built. And then there's the
 

531
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,470
lows being built. And then there's the
breakout. So really any hold over sort

532
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
breakout. So really any hold over sort
 

533
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,269
breakout. So really any hold over sort
of 20 21s today, you know, if they want

534
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
of 20 21s today, you know, if they want
 

535
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,710
of 20 21s today, you know, if they want
to get really aggressive, they're going

536
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
to get really aggressive, they're going
 

537
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,949
to get really aggressive, they're going
for that push upside. Normally speaking,

538
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
for that push upside. Normally speaking,
 

539
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,550
for that push upside. Normally speaking,
we would expect the VIX to pull back

540
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
we would expect the VIX to pull back
 

541
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,230
we would expect the VIX to pull back
today. We'd expect a fail breakout and

542
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
today. We'd expect a fail breakout and
 

543
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,829
today. We'd expect a fail breakout and
pull back, but we are not in a normal

544
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
pull back, but we are not in a normal
 

545
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,150
pull back, but we are not in a normal
market right now. Uh Bitcoin, I want to

546
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
market right now. Uh Bitcoin, I want to
 

547
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,350
market right now. Uh Bitcoin, I want to
talk about some of these markets we went

548
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
talk about some of these markets we went
 

549
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,509
talk about some of these markets we went
over yesterday. Like I said, we finished

550
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
over yesterday. Like I said, we finished
 

551
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,590
over yesterday. Like I said, we finished
that thousand day cycle. This might

552
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
that thousand day cycle. This might
 

553
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,509
that thousand day cycle. This might
really get nasty. You're starting to see

554
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
really get nasty. You're starting to see
 

555
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,509
really get nasty. You're starting to see
it. It's very possible it does an 80%

556
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
it. It's very possible it does an 80%
 

557
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,189
it. It's very possible it does an 80%
sale. That doesn't mean it goes straight

558
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
sale. That doesn't mean it goes straight
 

559
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,030
sale. That doesn't mean it goes straight
down in one go, but like like I said to

560
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
down in one go, but like like I said to
 

561
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,550
down in one go, but like like I said to
you guys, be very careful about buying

562
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
you guys, be very careful about buying
 

563
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,189
you guys, be very careful about buying
Bitcoin when we can actually consider a

564
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
Bitcoin when we can actually consider a
 

565
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,790
Bitcoin when we can actually consider a
move all the way down here somewhere. I

566
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
move all the way down here somewhere. I
 

567
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,389
move all the way down here somewhere. I
know sounds ridiculous, but it's

568
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
know sounds ridiculous, but it's
 

569
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,350
know sounds ridiculous, but it's
possible. We are coming into an area of

570
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
possible. We are coming into an area of
 

571
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,750
possible. We are coming into an area of
potential support here. So maybe there

572
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:45,760
potential support here. So maybe there
 

573
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,509
potential support here. So maybe there
is a buy from 73 down to sort of 50s.

574
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
is a buy from 73 down to sort of 50s.
 

575
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,590
is a buy from 73 down to sort of 50s.
Um, but it would be speculatory because

576
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
Um, but it would be speculatory because
 

577
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,269
Um, but it would be speculatory because
we are now starting to break down. So

578
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
we are now starting to break down. So
 

579
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,150
we are now starting to break down. So
you'd want to see a dip, hold, a turn uh

580
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
you'd want to see a dip, hold, a turn uh
 

581
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,430
you'd want to see a dip, hold, a turn uh
for that push back up. And I'd be

582
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
for that push back up. And I'd be
 

583
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,870
for that push back up. And I'd be
selling into that push back up if you're

584
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
selling into that push back up if you're
 

585
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,069
selling into that push back up if you're
going to do it. But we are starting to

586
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
going to do it. But we are starting to
 

587
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,069
going to do it. But we are starting to
see a riskoff environment. Right, let's

588
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
see a riskoff environment. Right, let's
 

589
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,829
see a riskoff environment. Right, let's
go through the mag. Relative strength,

590
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
go through the mag. Relative strength,
 

591
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,910
go through the mag. Relative strength,
Mr. Apple. Absolutely love it. Still

592
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
Mr. Apple. Absolutely love it. Still
 

593
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,990
Mr. Apple. Absolutely love it. Still
long Apple from 208, remember? So, still

594
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
long Apple from 208, remember? So, still
 

595
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,550
long Apple from 208, remember? So, still
comfortably up in this uh holding that

596
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
comfortably up in this uh holding that
 

597
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,790
comfortably up in this uh holding that
drive up yesterday. This was probably

598
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
drive up yesterday. This was probably
 

599
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,269
drive up yesterday. This was probably
mainly off Nancy Pelosi. All right, if

600
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
mainly off Nancy Pelosi. All right, if
 

601
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,590
mainly off Nancy Pelosi. All right, if
you uh had watched, she they started to

602
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
you uh had watched, she they started to
 

603
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,590
you uh had watched, she they started to
reveal her latest investments and yes,

604
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
reveal her latest investments and yes,
 

605
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,430
reveal her latest investments and yes,
she was long Apple. So, it's being seen

606
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
she was long Apple. So, it's being seen
 

607
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,350
she was long Apple. So, it's being seen
as bit more of a safe haven than the

608
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
as bit more of a safe haven than the
 

609
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,629
as bit more of a safe haven than the
other mags. Why? Because it doesn't have

610
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
other mags. Why? Because it doesn't have
 

611
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,550
other mags. Why? Because it doesn't have

the same exposure into AI that

earnings tonight, remember? So, we're

616
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
earnings tonight, remember? So, we're
 

617
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,949
earnings tonight, remember? So, we're
still getting uh washed down on Amazon,

618
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
still getting uh washed down on Amazon,
 

619
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,470
still getting uh washed down on Amazon,
but it's still actually just in quite a

620
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
but it's still actually just in quite a
 

621
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,629
but it's still actually just in quite a
big chunky bit of range here. Nothing

622
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
big chunky bit of range here. Nothing
 

623
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,230
big chunky bit of range here. Nothing
really too scared to let go of, but we

624
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
really too scared to let go of, but we
 

625
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,910
really too scared to let go of, but we
have had a failed breakout. But in the

626
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
have had a failed breakout. But in the
 

627
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,230
have had a failed breakout. But in the
immediate future, yes, we are uh

628
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
immediate future, yes, we are uh
 

629
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,590
immediate future, yes, we are uh
starting to get a little heavy here.

630
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
starting to get a little heavy here.
 

631
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,949
starting to get a little heavy here.
Google uh earnings last night, earnings

632
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
Google uh earnings last night, earnings
 

633
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,470
Google uh earnings last night, earnings
were pretty good, but already pulling

634
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
were pretty good, but already pulling
 

635
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,069
were pretty good, but already pulling
back down to this low point. So, they're

636
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
back down to this low point. So, they're
 

637
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,350
back down to this low point. So, they're
selling everything right now. Even

638
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
selling everything right now. Even
 

639
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,550
selling everything right now. Even
everything that where they're even

640
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
everything that where they're even
 

641
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,990
everything that where they're even
offering good guidance, they're actually

642
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
offering good guidance, they're actually
 

643
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,990
offering good guidance, they're actually
selling everything right now. That is a

644
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
selling everything right now. That is a
 

645
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,829
selling everything right now. That is a
uh key sign of a rotation out of tech

646
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
uh key sign of a rotation out of tech
 

647
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,509
uh key sign of a rotation out of tech
like we've talked about. Meta continues

648
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
like we've talked about. Meta continues
 

649
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,990
like we've talked about. Meta continues
to get weak. So coming back down into

650
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
to get weak. So coming back down into
 

651
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,870
to get weak. So coming back down into
these uh some of these pivots

652
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
these uh some of these pivots
 

653
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,470
these uh some of these pivots
right down into here. So big gap up.

654
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
right down into here. So big gap up.
 

655
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,230
right down into here. So big gap up.
Fill that gap right down into this pivot

656
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
Fill that gap right down into this pivot
 

657
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,309
Fill that gap right down into this pivot
at 68. Remember I'm still long from down

658
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
at 68. Remember I'm still long from down
 

659
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,750
at 68. Remember I'm still long from down
here at the moment. So we're waiting to

660
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
here at the moment. So we're waiting to
 

661
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,069
here at the moment. So we're waiting to
see what happens. Uh if it's able to

662
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
see what happens. Uh if it's able to
 

663
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,590
see what happens. Uh if it's able to
hold gains or not, but if we're going to

664
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
hold gains or not, but if we're going to
 

665
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,669
hold gains or not, but if we're going to
go rotation off, then unlikely it will

666
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
go rotation off, then unlikely it will
 

667
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,990
go rotation off, then unlikely it will
be able to hold gains. Microsoft's

668
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
be able to hold gains. Microsoft's
 

669
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,789
be able to hold gains. Microsoft's
trying to find a bit of a bid. Uh did I

670
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
trying to find a bit of a bid. Uh did I
 

671
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,710
trying to find a bit of a bid. Uh did I
start a long on Microsoft yesterday? Was

672
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
start a long on Microsoft yesterday? Was
 

673
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,949
start a long on Microsoft yesterday? Was
that what I started a a feeler on on the

674
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
that what I started a a feeler on on the
 

675
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,630
that what I started a a feeler on on the
swings? Have a look at the swing

676
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
swings? Have a look at the swing
 

677
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,669
swings? Have a look at the swing
channel. I'm trying to remember. I think

678
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
channel. I'm trying to remember. I think
 

679
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,270
channel. I'm trying to remember. I think
it might have been. It was. So, I

680
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
it might have been. It was. So, I
 

681
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,870
it might have been. It was. So, I
started a feeler yesterday because we're

682
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
started a feeler yesterday because we're
 

683
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,990
started a feeler yesterday because we're
into a 61 fib from that tariff low. All

684
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
into a 61 fib from that tariff low. All
 

685
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,830
into a 61 fib from that tariff low. All
right. So, I've got a feeler on very

686
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
right. So, I've got a feeler on very
 

687
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,470
right. So, I've got a feeler on very
very very tiny position just so mainly I

688
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
very very tiny position just so mainly I
 

689
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,150
very very tiny position just so mainly I
can keep watching of it in the next few

690
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
can keep watching of it in the next few
 

691
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,510
can keep watching of it in the next few
days, but it is weak. Nvidia uh still

692
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
days, but it is weak. Nvidia uh still
 

693
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,590
days, but it is weak. Nvidia uh still
the same kind of story, but we actually

694
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
the same kind of story, but we actually
 

695
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,270
the same kind of story, but we actually
are starting to break down under here.

696
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
are starting to break down under here.
 

697
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,310
are starting to break down under here.
So failure to reclaim 77s opens up this

698
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
So failure to reclaim 77s opens up this
 

699
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,789
So failure to reclaim 77s opens up this
move lower and we can come and clear out

700
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
move lower and we can come and clear out
 

701
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,310
move lower and we can come and clear out
some of these stops like we're doing on

702
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
some of these stops like we're doing on
 

703
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,549
some of these stops like we're doing on
the Q. So we can talk about that like we

704
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
the Q. So we can talk about that like we
 

705
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,870
the Q. So we can talk about that like we
did yesterday, right? Failing to reclaim

706
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
did yesterday, right? Failing to reclaim
 

707
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,710
did yesterday, right? Failing to reclaim
this will lead to that weakness. Same

708
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
this will lead to that weakness. Same
 

709
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,750
this will lead to that weakness. Same
story we talked about yesterday. Uh

710
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
story we talked about yesterday. Uh
 

711
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,270
story we talked about yesterday. Uh
Tesla

712
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
Tesla
 

713
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,669
Tesla
weak. That is weak. We're moving out of

714
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
weak. That is weak. We're moving out of
 

715
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,270
weak. That is weak. We're moving out of
that choppy range. Yeah, there's your

716
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
that choppy range. Yeah, there's your
 

717
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,310
that choppy range. Yeah, there's your
choppy range, right? Failed breakout.

718
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
choppy range, right? Failed breakout.
 

719
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,950
choppy range, right? Failed breakout.
I'd say any failure into 420s. Anytime

720
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
I'd say any failure into 420s. Anytime
 

721
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,870
I'd say any failure into 420s. Anytime
we're under 420s, this is looking for a

722
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
we're under 420s, this is looking for a
 

723
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,710
we're under 420s, this is looking for a
drive down to clean out these stops and

724
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
drive down to clean out these stops and
 

725
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,870
drive down to clean out these stops and
we had gap fill potential all the way

726
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
we had gap fill potential all the way
 

727
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,630
we had gap fill potential all the way
back here. And if we measured that from

728
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
back here. And if we measured that from
 

729
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,710
back here. And if we measured that from
a fib and if we did a measured move

730
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
a fib and if we did a measured move
 

731
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,549
a fib and if we did a measured move
under here, it would probably be down to

732
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
under here, it would probably be down to
 

733
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,110
under here, it would probably be down to
that. So maybe at some point that starts

734
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
that. So maybe at some point that starts
 

735
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,510
that. So maybe at some point that starts
to play out. Um, weaker names right now.

736
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
to play out. Um, weaker names right now.
 

737
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,750
to play out. Um, weaker names right now.
Uh, they're moving out of anything uh

738
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
Uh, they're moving out of anything uh
 

739
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,350
Uh, they're moving out of anything uh
softwarebased. So if you have a look at

740
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
softwarebased. So if you have a look at
 

741
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,190
softwarebased. So if you have a look at
like Oracle continues to puke um if you

742
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
like Oracle continues to puke um if you
 

743
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,110
like Oracle continues to puke um if you
have a look at uh like Adobe or anything

744
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
have a look at uh like Adobe or anything
 

745
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,390
have a look at uh like Adobe or anything
like that they're actually they're

746
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
like that they're actually they're
 

747
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,150
like that they're actually they're
completely moving out of anything where

748
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
completely moving out of anything where
 

749
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,669
completely moving out of anything where
AI software wise can have an impact. And

750
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
AI software wise can have an impact. And
 

751
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,070
AI software wise can have an impact. And
that's pretty much it folks. Um I guess

752
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
that's pretty much it folks. Um I guess
 

753
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,070
that's pretty much it folks. Um I guess
we should have a quick look at AMD. They

754
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
we should have a quick look at AMD. They
 

755
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,830
we should have a quick look at AMD. They
got absolutely murdered yesterday. But

756
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
got absolutely murdered yesterday. But
 

757
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,270
got absolutely murdered yesterday. But
remember that had relative strength

758
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
remember that had relative strength
 

759
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,029
remember that had relative strength
versus Nvidia for a while. All we're

760
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
versus Nvidia for a while. All we're
 

761
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,549
versus Nvidia for a while. All we're
doing is coming back into gap fill

762
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
doing is coming back into gap fill
 

763
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,029
doing is coming back into gap fill
potential on AMD back down into 72s. All

764
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
potential on AMD back down into 72s. All
 

765
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,190
potential on AMD back down into 72s. All
right. So it did really well as the gap

766
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
right. So it did really well as the gap
 

767
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,270
right. So it did really well as the gap
up. It held. It has potential to come

768
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
up. It held. It has potential to come
 

769
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,909
up. It held. It has potential to come
back down into here if it wants. And

770
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
back down into here if it wants. And
 

771
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:21,909
back down into here if it wants. And
that's pretty much that.

772
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919

 

773
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,070

Zoom this in. All right. So, we have

774
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
Zoom this in. All right. So, we have
 

775
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,909
Zoom this in. All right. So, we have
this gray block below, blue block below

776
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
this gray block below, blue block below
 

777
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,870
this gray block below, blue block below
that. Um, I will not be looking to get

778
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
that. Um, I will not be looking to get
 

779
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,390
that. Um, I will not be looking to get
too aggressive at the open. I would be

780
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
too aggressive at the open. I would be
 

781
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,029
too aggressive at the open. I would be
very, very concerned about failed

782
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
very, very concerned about failed
 

783
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,710
very, very concerned about failed
breakouts and breakouts either side of

784
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
breakouts and breakouts either side of
 

785
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,070
breakouts and breakouts either side of
this. And this might look small, but

786
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
this. And this might look small, but
 

787
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,150
this. And this might look small, but
this is over 100 points what they've

788
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
this is over 100 points what they've
 

789
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,909
this is over 100 points what they've
done here. If they want to repric this

790
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
done here. If they want to repric this
 

791
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,190
done here. If they want to repric this
in here, they will. If they want a

792
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
in here, they will. If they want a
 

793
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,549
in here, they will. If they want a
failed look and come back down, they

794
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
failed look and come back down, they
 

795
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,070
failed look and come back down, they
will. If they want a failed look and

796
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
will. If they want a failed look and
 

797
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,510
will. If they want a failed look and
come back in, they will. And if they

798
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
come back in, they will. And if they
 

799
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,270
come back in, they will. And if they
want to stay heavy, then it's going to

800
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
want to stay heavy, then it's going to
 

801
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,870
want to stay heavy, then it's going to
be hard to join. I'll be honest. If they

802
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
be hard to join. I'll be honest. If they
 

803
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,150
be hard to join. I'll be honest. If they
want to stay heavy at the lows, we're

804
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
want to stay heavy at the lows, we're
 

805
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,350
want to stay heavy at the lows, we're
going to need a lot of liquidity built

806
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
going to need a lot of liquidity built
 

807
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,789
going to need a lot of liquidity built
out. Right, I'm coming straight back. I

808
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
out. Right, I'm coming straight back. I
 

809
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,549

00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559

811
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:09,190
just got to turn my air con off cuz this
is freezing cold right now.

812
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200

 

813
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,029

All right. Looks trappy. Yeah, it does

814
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
All right. Looks trappy. Yeah, it does
 

815
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,870
All right. Looks trappy. Yeah, it does
look trappy.

816
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
look trappy.
 

817
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,430
look trappy.
It does look trappy. Uh, what I would

818
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
It does look trappy. Uh, what I would
 

819
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,110
It does look trappy. Uh, what I would
ask if you can all smash that like

820
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
ask if you can all smash that like
 

821
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,710
ask if you can all smash that like
button nice and early for me, then I

822
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
button nice and early for me, then I
 

823
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,830
button nice and early for me, then I
don't we don't have to talk about it

824
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
don't we don't have to talk about it
 

825
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,789
don't we don't have to talk about it
anymore. Um, and we should have a good

826
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
anymore. Um, and we should have a good
 

827
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,870
anymore. Um, and we should have a good
stream here together. Again, we had a

828
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
stream here together. Again, we had a
 

829
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,710
stream here together. Again, we had a
monstrous day yesterday. Remember when

830
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
monstrous day yesterday. Remember when
 

831
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,549
monstrous day yesterday. Remember when
you've gone like, you know, last week

832
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
you've gone like, you know, last week
 

833
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,230
you've gone like, you know, last week
was a huge week. Yesterday was a really

834
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
was a huge week. Yesterday was a really
 

835
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
was a huge week. Yesterday was a really
good day. The day before was okay. I

836
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
good day. The day before was okay. I
 

837
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,669
good day. The day before was okay. I
missed a lot of the shorts. We don't

838
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
missed a lot of the shorts. We don't
 

839
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,070
missed a lot of the shorts. We don't
expect like, you know, huge moves every

840
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
expect like, you know, huge moves every
 

841
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,990
expect like, you know, huge moves every
day. So, just remember that. Have that

842
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
day. So, just remember that. Have that
 

843
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,270
day. So, just remember that. Have that
in the back of your head. Like, it's

844
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
in the back of your head. Like, it's
 

845
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,789
in the back of your head. Like, it's
very possible that this market needs to

846
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
very possible that this market needs to
 

847
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:47,510
very possible that this market needs to
slow down at some point.

848
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520

 

849
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,950

Silver crashed hard. Yeah. Well, it did

850
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
Silver crashed hard. Yeah. Well, it did
 

851
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,470
Silver crashed hard. Yeah. Well, it did
the failed followrough. We went over all

852
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
the failed followrough. We went over all
 

853
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,789
the failed followrough. We went over all
those moves yesterday, right? We can go

854
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
those moves yesterday, right? We can go
 

855
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,230
those moves yesterday, right? We can go
over it again. It did the failed follow

856
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
over it again. It did the failed follow
 

857
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,350
over it again. It did the failed follow
through. That's what I was saying. What

858
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
through. That's what I was saying. What
 

859
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,909
through. That's what I was saying. What
I'd be looking at on the silver after a

860
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
I'd be looking at on the silver after a
 

861
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,149
I'd be looking at on the silver after a
big You know, you look at it's basically

862
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
big You know, you look at it's basically
 

863
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,630
big You know, you look at it's basically
the creation of a bare flag. There's the

864
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
the creation of a bare flag. There's the
 

865
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,789
the creation of a bare flag. There's the
sell, there's your first bounce, there's

866
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
sell, there's your first bounce, there's
 

867
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,950
sell, there's your first bounce, there's
the liquidity we talked about and down.

868
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
the liquidity we talked about and down.
 

869
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,990
the liquidity we talked about and down.
Same story on gold, right? First bounce

870
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
Same story on gold, right? First bounce
 

871
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,590
Same story on gold, right? First bounce
into the key level, they will try and

872
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
into the key level, they will try and
 

873
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,070
into the key level, they will try and
sell this back downside. Now, it's uh

874
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
sell this back downside. Now, it's uh
 

875
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,190
sell this back downside. Now, it's uh
it's fairly normal move. It's like about

876
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
it's fairly normal move. It's like about
 

877
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,510
it's fairly normal move. It's like about
as obvious as you ever get in the

878
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
as obvious as you ever get in the
 

879
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,909
as obvious as you ever get in the
market. Um honestly, once you see those

880
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
market. Um honestly, once you see those
 

881
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,390
market. Um honestly, once you see those
big sell, we expect a bounce and then we

882
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
big sell, we expect a bounce and then we
 

883
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,549
big sell, we expect a bounce and then we
look to sell that bounce, right? That's

884
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
look to sell that bounce, right? That's
 

885
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,710
look to sell that bounce, right? That's
probably the easiest move you can get.

886
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
probably the easiest move you can get.
 

887
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,110
probably the easiest move you can get.
Okay, here we go, folks. So, here's the

Hilarious.

908
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039

 

909
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,029

Showing me 500 points higher than price.
 

911
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,870
Showing me 500 points higher than price.
Are you joking? There we go. Right into

912
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
Are you joking? There we go. Right into
 

913
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,029
Are you joking? There we go. Right into
into this gray box potentially or a

914
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
into this gray box potentially or a
 

915
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,390
into this gray box potentially or a
failed breakout underneath this

916
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
failed breakout underneath this
 

917
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,470
failed breakout underneath this
overnight low right here, which is what

918
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
overnight low right here, which is what
 

919
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,669
overnight low right here, which is what
we were saying. We got to be very

920
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
we were saying. We got to be very
 

921
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,830
we were saying. We got to be very
careful about failed breakouts under

922
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
careful about failed breakouts under
 

923
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,669
careful about failed breakouts under
here right now. We have this gray box

924
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
here right now. We have this gray box
 

925
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,190
here right now. We have this gray box
below. I'd be very, very careful about

926
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
below. I'd be very, very careful about
 

927
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,110
below. I'd be very, very careful about
them trapping underneath that right now.

928
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
them trapping underneath that right now.
 

929
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,590
them trapping underneath that right now.
I think that's highly highly highly

930
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
I think that's highly highly highly
 

931
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,510
I think that's highly highly highly
probable and likely.

932
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520

 

933
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,909

You want to be careful.

934
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919

 

935
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,070

Gray box is there as uh some structural

936
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
Gray box is there as uh some structural
 

937
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,230
Gray box is there as uh some structural
support though.

938
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240

 

939
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,390

Right here is the start of this move. So

940
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
Right here is the start of this move. So
 

941
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,630
Right here is the start of this move. So
it's done a first look below and fail.

942
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
it's done a first look below and fail.
 

943
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,070
it's done a first look below and fail.
Most of the liquidity up at 45s. Now,

944
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
Most of the liquidity up at 45s. Now,
 

945
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,029
Most of the liquidity up at 45s. Now,
let's get a New Yorker

946
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
let's get a New Yorker
 

947
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,270
let's get a New Yorker
one of these on. Bit more patience today

948
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,280
one of these on. Bit more patience today
 

949
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,390
one of these on. Bit more patience today
than we've had recently as we haven't

950
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
than we've had recently as we haven't
 

951
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,149
than we've had recently as we haven't
got the same setup.

952
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159

 

953
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,270

Okay, like we said, there's the

954
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
Okay, like we said, there's the
 

955
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,909
Okay, like we said, there's the
liquidity up into 45s.

956
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:03,919
liquidity up into 45s.
 

957
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,750
liquidity up into 45s.
So, here comes the sell through

958
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:07,760
So, here comes the sell through
 

959
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,510
So, here comes the sell through
down into this gray box potentially.

960
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
down into this gray box potentially.
 

961
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,510
down into this gray box potentially.
Remember, we have got gap fill potential

962
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
Remember, we have got gap fill potential
 

963
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,190
Remember, we have got gap fill potential
that we talked about all the way down to

964
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
that we talked about all the way down to
 

965
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,990
that we talked about all the way down to
where is it? 700 to 550. So, we want to

966
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
where is it? 700 to 550. So, we want to
 

967
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,830
where is it? 700 to 550. So, we want to
think about that. 700 to 550. We're

968
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
think about that. 700 to 550. We're
 

969
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,750
think about that. 700 to 550. We're
already in that kind of area right now.

970
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
already in that kind of area right now.
 

971
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,669
already in that kind of area right now.
We can talk about the MAG. Tesla opening

972
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
We can talk about the MAG. Tesla opening
 

973
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,789
We can talk about the MAG. Tesla opening
up 2.93% down. Getting very washy here

983
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,230
7.64% down. Amazon 4.85% down. And Apple
slightly up on the day. Right. Just be

984
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
slightly up on the day. Right. Just be
 

985
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,669
slightly up on the day. Right. Just be
careful down here into this support

986
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
careful down here into this support
 

987
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,590
careful down here into this support
system. All right. be very very careful.

988
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
system. All right. be very very careful.

system. All right. be very very careful.
I won't be getting short down here. I

990
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120
I won't be getting short down here. I
 

991
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,029
I won't be getting short down here. I
think we will probably to see a trap

992
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
think we will probably to see a trap
 

993
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,549
think we will probably to see a trap
being set down here, which is what we're

994
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
being set down here, which is what we're
 

995
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,710
being set down here, which is what we're
starting to see. So, looking potentially

996
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:52,720
starting to see. So, looking potentially
 

997
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,789
starting to see. So, looking potentially
for an explosion back upside now at this

998
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
for an explosion back upside now at this
 

999
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,909
for an explosion back upside now at this
point. Here we go. And let's see if we

1000
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:57,919
point. Here we go. And let's see if we
 

1001
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,990
point. Here we go. And let's see if we
can get through this next node and start

1002
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
can get through this next node and start
 

1003
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,669
can get through this next node and start
ripping some faces. This was the trap

1004
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
ripping some faces. This was the trap
 

1005
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,630
ripping some faces. This was the trap
that we talked about, folks. Here we go.

1006
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
that we talked about, folks. Here we go.
 

1007
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,750
that we talked about, folks. Here we go.
So, taking some profit into there.

1008
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
So, taking some profit into there.
 

1009
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,430
So, taking some profit into there.
Moment I saw them start to lift that,

1010
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
Moment I saw them start to lift that,
 

1011
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,710
Moment I saw them start to lift that,
that was join time. Watching New York

1012
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
that was join time. Watching New York
 

1013
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,390
that was join time. Watching New York
open. See if we get above New York open

1014
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
open. See if we get above New York open
 

1015
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,470
open. See if we get above New York open
now for the runners. And if we do and we

1016
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:16,480
now for the runners. And if we do and we
 

1017
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,470
now for the runners. And if we do and we
rebase, I will start to add above that

1018
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
rebase, I will start to add above that
 

1019
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,430
rebase, I will start to add above that
New York open if we can do that. Right.

1020
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
New York open if we can do that. Right.
 

1021
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,950
New York open if we can do that. Right.
So there's the trap into the gray box

1022
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960
So there's the trap into the gray box
 

1023
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,909
So there's the trap into the gray box
back into range. We build out liquidity

1024
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919
back into range. We build out liquidity
 

1025
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,870
back into range. We build out liquidity
now. And I'll probably move my stop up a

1026
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:28,880
now. And I'll probably move my stop up a
 

1027
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,390
now. And I'll probably move my stop up a
little bit here. Try and protect this

1028
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400
little bit here. Try and protect this
 

1029
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,630
little bit here. Try and protect this
node at 88.

1030
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
node at 88.
 

1031
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,230
node at 88.
If we wash me out, that's fine on the

1032
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,240
If we wash me out, that's fine on the
 

1033
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,310
If we wash me out, that's fine on the
runner.

1034
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320

 

1035
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,470

67 big level. Nice protection of 88.

1036
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
67 big level. Nice protection of 88.
 

1037
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,789
67 big level. Nice protection of 88.
Here we go. Right back into value area

1038
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
Here we go. Right back into value area
 

1039
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,909
Here we go. Right back into value area
high again. Let's see if we can get

1040
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919
high again. Let's see if we can get
 

1041
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,750
high again. Let's see if we can get
through. Really nerd. Really good. Let's

1042
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
through. Really nerd. Really good. Let's
 

1043
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,630
through. Really nerd. Really good. Let's
go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Get

1044

go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Get
 

1045
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,870
go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Get
through the New York open. Let's turn

1046
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
through the New York open. Let's turn
 

1047
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,590
through the New York open. Let's turn
this squeeze on.

1048
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
this squeeze on.
 

1049
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,950
this squeeze on.
Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby. Nice

1050
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby. Nice
 

1051
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,110
Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby. Nice
start. Not going to catch me getting

1052
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,120
start. Not going to catch me getting
 

1053
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,590
start. Not going to catch me getting
trapped down there. Tell you that much.

1054
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600

 

1055
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,190

Come on, bookmap. Second day in a row

1056
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
Come on, bookmap. Second day in a row
 

1057
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,510
Come on, bookmap. Second day in a row
that you are pausing on me. Really can't

1058
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
that you are pausing on me. Really can't
 

1059
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,870
that you are pausing on me. Really can't
be having that.

1060
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880

 

1061
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,230

I'm going to have to close this book

1062
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm going to have to close this book
 

1063
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,390
I'm going to have to close this book
down and start again. [\h__\h] hell,

1064
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
down and start again. [\h__\h] hell,
 

1065
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,510

1067
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:30,470

Give me a second on but guys. Sorry.

1068

1069
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,789

What a pain. What a pain. Still in this

1070
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
What a pain. What a pain. Still in this
 

1071
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,710
What a pain. What a pain. Still in this
guys. We're still protecting that node.

1072

guys. We're still protecting that node.
 

1073
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,990
guys. We're still protecting that node.
I still think we can get above this New

1074
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
I still think we can get above this New
 

1075
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,029
I still think we can get above this New
York open and start to push.

1076
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
York open and start to push.
 

1077
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,789
York open and start to push.
Here we go. So watching this now

1078
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799
Here we go. So watching this now
 

1079
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,029
Here we go. So watching this now
previous day low reclaim of 83s we can

1080
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
previous day low reclaim of 83s we can
 

1081
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,750
previous day low reclaim of 83s we can
see a squeeze here. So watching this New

1082
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
see a squeeze here. So watching this New
 

1083
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,430
see a squeeze here. So watching this New
York open. Here we go is New York open.

1084
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
York open. Here we go is New York open.
 

1085
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,789
York open. Here we go is New York open.
So first TP here. Let's see if we can

1086
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:48,799
So first TP here. Let's see if we can
 

1087
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,230
So first TP here. Let's see if we can
get through these 80s now and start

1088
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
get through these 80s now and start
 

1089
00:25:50,240 --> 00:26:04,390
get through these 80s now and start
exploding.

1090
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400

 

1091
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,470

Sorry guys, but look at this on match.

1092
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,480
Sorry guys, but look at this on match.
 

1093
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,990
Sorry guys, but look at this on match.
It's just a joke what I'm dealing with

1094
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,000
It's just a joke what I'm dealing with
 

1095
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,470
It's just a joke what I'm dealing with
here today. Right, here we go. Really

1096
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
here today. Right, here we go. Really
 

1097
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,470
here today. Right, here we go. Really
nice through the 80s. All right, so we

1098
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,480
nice through the 80s. All right, so we
 

1099
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,110
nice through the 80s. All right, so we
will now look to see if we can trade up

1100
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
will now look to see if we can trade up
 

1101
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,029
will now look to see if we can trade up
into here to 70. There can be a trap

1102
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:17,039
into here to 70. There can be a trap
 

1103
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,789
into here to 70. There can be a trap
above 70. So I'll be trimming some

1104
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:18,799
above 70. So I'll be trimming some
 

1105
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,870
above 70. So I'll be trimming some
probably at 40 and 70 and then holding

1106
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
probably at 40 and 70 and then holding
 

1107
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,710
probably at 40 and 70 and then holding
to see if we come up to 964 and 989. And

1108
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
to see if we come up to 964 and 989. And
 

1109
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,630
to see if we come up to 964 and 989. And
this will be an absolute huge winner to

1110
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
this will be an absolute huge winner to
 

1111
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,470
this will be an absolute huge winner to
start the day if we get this. And we

1112
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
start the day if we get this. And we
 

1113
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,430
start the day if we get this. And we
said trap was set down here. TP here and

1114
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
said trap was set down here. TP here and
 

1115
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,590
said trap was set down here. TP here and
then all the way up here, folks.

1116
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600

 

1117
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,390

Here we go.

1118
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
Here we go.
 

1119
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,950
Here we go.
Who got short at the lows? Some idiot

1120
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960
Who got short at the lows? Some idiot
 

1121
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,909
Who got short at the lows? Some idiot
did. Some idiot did and we are playing

1122
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
did. Some idiot did and we are playing
 

1123
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,830
did. Some idiot did and we are playing
against him. So, this is already

1124
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
against him. So, this is already
 

1125
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,510
against him. So, this is already
comfortably into approaching the 100

1126
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,520
comfortably into approaching the 100
 

1127
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,950
comfortably into approaching the 100
point mark. Yeah, already 100 points. We

1128
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
point mark. Yeah, already 100 points. We
 

1129
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,630
point mark. Yeah, already 100 points. We
want to trim a lot up here, folks. We

1130
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
want to trim a lot up here, folks. We
 

1131
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,590
want to trim a lot up here, folks. We
don't know if we can get through that,

1132
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
don't know if we can get through that,
 

1133
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,909
don't know if we can get through that,
but if we can, that's where we're going.

1134
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
but if we can, that's where we're going.
 

1135
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,470
but if we can, that's where we're going.
So, top side of this range is the fail

1136
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
So, top side of this range is the fail
 

1137
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,750
So, top side of this range is the fail
breakout. This is what we talked about

1138
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,760
breakout. This is what we talked about
 

1139
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,590
breakout. This is what we talked about
pre-market. Be very careful about a look

1140
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
pre-market. Be very careful about a look
 

1141
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,990
pre-market. Be very careful about a look
below and a hold of here and this move

1142
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
below and a hold of here and this move
 

1143
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,510
below and a hold of here and this move
here. We trim some here and we wait and

1144
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
here. We trim some here and we wait and
 

1145
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,950
here. We trim some here and we wait and
see if we can get all the way up into

1146
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
see if we can get all the way up into
 

1147
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,870
see if we can get all the way up into
that now. But, we are locking in profits

1148
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
that now. But, we are locking in profits
 

1149
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,430
that now. But, we are locking in profits
no matter what. There's 100 pointer.

1150
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
no matter what. There's 100 pointer.
 

1151

that carefully. It's struggling right
now. If ES can get going, that will

1198
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
now. If ES can get going, that will
 

1199
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,269
now. If ES can get going, that will
help.

1200
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
help.
 

1201
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,269
help.
Um we're actually equally weighted right

1202
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
Um we're actually equally weighted right
 

1203
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,630
Um we're actually equally weighted right
now.

1204

see this hold uh hold into 50s otherwise

1208
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
see this hold uh hold into 50s otherwise
 

1209
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,230
see this hold uh hold into 50s otherwise
I will cut this. I can always think

1210
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240
I will cut this. I can always think
 

1211
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,710
I will cut this. I can always think
about a re-entry.

1212
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
about a re-entry.
 

1213
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,430
about a re-entry.
Still holding well. Yes, trying to hold

TP right right now is uh we'll be
 

1257
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,029
TP right right now is uh we'll be
looking for GlobeEx and up here now.

1258

looking for GlobeEx and up here now.
 

1259
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,630
looking for GlobeEx and up here now.
Really nice. But we expect there might

1260
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
Really nice. But we expect there might
 

1261
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,310
Really nice. But we expect there might
be we might start to get stuck here.

1262
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
be we might start to get stuck here.
 

1263
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,950
be we might start to get stuck here.
Okay. If we look uh left yesterday,

1264
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:46,960
Okay. If we look uh left yesterday,
 

1265
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,950
Okay. If we look uh left yesterday,
right, we we might get start to get

1266
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960
right, we we might get start to get
 

1267
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,389
right, we we might get start to get
stuck in this kind of range if we keep

1268
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
stuck in this kind of range if we keep
 

1269
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,990
stuck in this kind of range if we keep
lifting. Great. But we positioned

1270
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
lifting. Great. But we positioned
 

1271
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,870
lifting. Great. But we positioned
perfectly for this. That was a big uh TP

1272
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:54,880
perfectly for this. That was a big uh TP
 

1273
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,630
perfectly for this. That was a big uh TP
here. So, you're now 150 points up.

1274
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
here. So, you're now 150 points up.
 

1275
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,310
here. So, you're now 150 points up.
GlobeEx and VW up coming up, which would

1276
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
GlobeEx and VW up coming up, which would
 

1277
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,950
GlobeEx and VW up coming up, which would
be 190 points. And then all the way up

1278
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960
be 190 points. And then all the way up
 

1279
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,750
be 190 points. And then all the way up
here, which would be uh 237 points into

1280
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
here, which would be uh 237 points into
 

1281
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,470
here, which would be uh 237 points into
value area low from yesterday, and 270

1282
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
value area low from yesterday, and 270
 

1283
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,230
value area low from yesterday, and 270
points into previous day close, which

1284
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
points into previous day close, which
 

1285
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,630
points into previous day close, which
would be the efficient market. Thank you

1286
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
would be the efficient market. Thank you
 

1287
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,789
would be the efficient market. Thank you
for playing.

1288

1291
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,950

What a beauty. All right, building out a

1292
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
What a beauty. All right, building out a
 

1293
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,710
What a beauty. All right, building out a
node here. Do not let this collapse all

1294
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:26,720
node here. Do not let this collapse all
 

1295
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,710
node here. Do not let this collapse all
the way down on you to 800. All right,

1296
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
the way down on you to 800. All right,
 

1297
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,549
the way down on you to 800. All right,
so move your stop up to start protecting

1298
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:30,559
so move your stop up to start protecting
 

1299
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,789
so move your stop up to start protecting
these profits very aggressively. You do

1300
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
these profits very aggressively. You do
 

1301
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,789
these profits very aggressively. You do
not want if we start breaking 77, there

1302
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:34,799
not want if we start breaking 77, there
 

1303
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,269
not want if we start breaking 77, there
is a flush all the way down to 800s

1304
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,279
is a flush all the way down to 800s
 

1305
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,990
is a flush all the way down to 800s
here. I will uh going to move this the

1306
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
here. I will uh going to move this the
 

1307
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,510
here. I will uh going to move this the
other side of this so you can see price

1308
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
other side of this so you can see price
 

1309
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,510
other side of this so you can see price
action a bit better. All right, so we

1310
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,520
action a bit better. All right, so we
 

1311
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,590
action a bit better. All right, so we
want to watch this node here. We do not

1312
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:45,600
want to watch this node here. We do not
 

1313
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,549
want to watch this node here. We do not
want to get flushy under this. We will

1314
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:48,559
want to get flushy under this. We will
 

1315
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,870
want to get flushy under this. We will
cut it or any flush under this. Okay? We

1316
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:50,880
cut it or any flush under this. Okay? We
 

1317
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,909
cut it or any flush under this. Okay? We
do not want to see this be lost. So far,

1318
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
do not want to see this be lost. So far,
 

1319
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,590
do not want to see this be lost. So far,
we're holding well. So, I'd move my stop

1320
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,600
we're holding well. So, I'd move my stop
 

1321
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,870
we're holding well. So, I'd move my stop
right up to protect that if I was you.

1322
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
right up to protect that if I was you.
 

1323
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,630
right up to protect that if I was you.
And then we just see how far we can

1324
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,640
And then we just see how far we can
 

1325
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,789
And then we just see how far we can
squeeze here.

1326
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799

 

1327
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,549

Hopefully, we can keep lifting. But I

1332
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
Hopefully, we can keep lifting. But I
 

1333
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,909
Hopefully, we can keep lifting. But I
would I would have paid yourself 70 80%

1334

of your move right now at least.
 

1337
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:29,590
of your move right now at least.
Let's see what else it's got left.

1338
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,600

 

1339
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,909

1355
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,909

Can we get through this speed up? Keep

1356
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919
Can we get through this speed up? Keep
 

1357
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,830
Can we get through this speed up? Keep
getting stuck up here. See this shelf

1358
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
getting stuck up here. See this shelf
 

1359
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,190
getting stuck up here. See this shelf
being very, very important. If we lose

1360
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
being very, very important. If we lose
 

1361
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,549
being very, very important. If we lose
this shelf, do not hold on. Okay, do not

hold on if we lose this shelf. If we're
 

1365
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,430
hold on if we lose this shelf. If we're
very lucky, they set a little trap. But

1366
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
very lucky, they set a little trap. But
 

1367
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,870
very lucky, they set a little trap. But
if we lose this shelf, do not hold them.

1368

We're very thin. All the way back down

1370
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
We're very thin. All the way back down
 

1371
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,870
We're very thin. All the way back down
to 800. You will not be happy if you

1372
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
to 800. You will not be happy if you
 

1373
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,950
to 800. You will not be happy if you
give 100 points back in one go. All

1374
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
give 100 points back in one go. All
 

1375
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,029
give 100 points back in one go. All
right. You need them to complete this or

1376
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:19,039
right. You need them to complete this or
 

1377
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,789
right. You need them to complete this or
just cut the whole thing. Here we go.

1378
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799
just cut the whole thing. Here we go.
 

1379

come all the way back down to here. So,
 

1417
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,149
come all the way back down to here. So,
I'm not going to sit through that. They

1418
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:20,159
I'm not going to sit through that. They
 

1419
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,149
I'm not going to sit through that. They
set a little low volume, no trap. Uh

1420
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:22,159
set a little low volume, no trap. Uh
 

1421
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,269
set a little low volume, no trap. Uh
would be fun, but that's it.

1422
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
would be fun, but that's it.
 

1423
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,350
would be fun, but that's it.
Where did I enter this trade? Uh right

1424
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
Where did I enter this trade? Uh right
 

1425
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,549
Where did I enter this trade? Uh right
on the reclaim down here. So if we look

1426
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
on the reclaim down here. So if we look
 

1427
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,149
on the reclaim down here. So if we look
at this,

1428
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159

 

1429
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,230

guess what happened on the undercut of

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,240
guess what happened on the undercut of
 

1431
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,149
guess what happened on the undercut of
the lows?

1432
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:40,159
the lows?
 

1433
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,190
the lows?
Look what happened on the undercut. Who

1434
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
Look what happened on the undercut. Who
 

1435
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,070
Look what happened on the undercut. Who
entered shorts? Where did I like to

1436
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,080
entered shorts? Where did I like to
 

1437
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,669
entered shorts? Where did I like to
start getting long once we started

1438
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:47,679
start getting long once we started
 

1439
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,909
start getting long once we started
reclaiming? Right, there's the undercut

1440
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919
reclaiming? Right, there's the undercut
 

1441
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,430
reclaiming? Right, there's the undercut
and we held. Goodbye shorts. Right, look

1442
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
and we held. Goodbye shorts. Right, look
 

1443
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,669
and we held. Goodbye shorts. Right, look
at the delta flip. Sell, sell, sell,

1444
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
at the delta flip. Sell, sell, sell,
 

1445
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,669
at the delta flip. Sell, sell, sell,
sell. Bye.

1446
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679

 

1447
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,950

They're trying to do that little trap

1448
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:00,960
They're trying to do that little trap
 

1449
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,070
They're trying to do that little trap
down here. I'm not going to play it.

1450
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,080
down here. I'm not going to play it.
 

1451
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,669
down here. I'm not going to play it.
This is what I talked about that it's

1452
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:03,679
This is what I talked about that it's
 

1453
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,750
This is what I talked about that it's
possible they set a trap in a low volume

1454
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
possible they set a trap in a low volume
 

1455
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,350
possible they set a trap in a low volume
node if they want to do this move. I'm

1456
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,360
node if they want to do this move. I'm
 

1457
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,629
node if they want to do this move. I'm
not going to play that. It's too risky

1458
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
not going to play that. It's too risky
 

1459
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,349
not going to play that. It's too risky
for me. Low hanging fruit's gone. So, we

1460
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,359
for me. Low hanging fruit's gone. So, we
 

1461
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,470
for me. Low hanging fruit's gone. So, we
got up to VWAP. That was my best cover

1462
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,480
got up to VWAP. That was my best cover
 

1463
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,349
got up to VWAP. That was my best cover
was into there. And I'm out of it now.

1464
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:17,359
was into there. And I'm out of it now.
 

1465
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,030
was into there. And I'm out of it now.
And I'll just wait to see how we now.

1466
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,040
And I'll just wait to see how we now.
 

1467
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,710
And I'll just wait to see how we now.
Remember, we've done the damage. We can

1468
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:20,720
Remember, we've done the damage. We can
 

1469
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,430
Remember, we've done the damage. We can
have a failed breakout above here like

1470
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
have a failed breakout above here like
 

1471
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,270
have a failed breakout above here like
we talked about. Each side of it can

1472
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
we talked about. Each side of it can
 

1473
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,109
we talked about. Each side of it can
have a failed breakout. If we're lucky,

1474
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
have a failed breakout. If we're lucky,
 

1475
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,310
have a failed breakout. If we're lucky,
they're going to keep lifting, but I'm

1476
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
they're going to keep lifting, but I'm
 

1477
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,389
they're going to keep lifting, but I'm
out of it now anyway.

1478
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:34,399

 

1479
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,990

We went over silver already. I'm not

1480
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,000
We went over silver already. I'm not
 

1481
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,270
We went over silver already. I'm not
going to keep going over the metals,

1482
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,280
going to keep going over the metals,
 

1483
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,710
going to keep going over the metals,
guys. You need to be here early in the

1484
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:38,720
guys. You need to be here early in the
 

1485
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,829
guys. You need to be here early in the
morning. I'm not going to keep going

1486
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:39,839
morning. I'm not going to keep going
 

1487
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,349
morning. I'm not going to keep going
over it, especially we're in a trading

1488
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:41,359
over it, especially we're in a trading
 

1489
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:50,550
over it, especially we're in a trading
day,

1490
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:50,560

 

1491
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,149

right? They held they filled some

1492
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:52,159
right? They held they filled some
 

1493
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,589
right? They held they filled some
imbalance and held. They set that little

1494
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:53,599
imbalance and held. They set that little
 

1495
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,470
imbalance and held. They set that little
low volume low trap. ES might want it to

1496
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,480
low volume low trap. ES might want it to
 

1497
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,670
low volume low trap. ES might want it to
be up. So ES is trying to do the

1498
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:57,680
be up. So ES is trying to do the
 

1499
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,430
be up. So ES is trying to do the
catch-up trade. Look at VIX failed

1500
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
catch-up trade. Look at VIX failed
 

1501
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,510
catch-up trade. Look at VIX failed
breakout coming right back down into the

1502
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
breakout coming right back down into the
 

1503
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:13,829
breakout coming right back down into the
low 20s.

1504
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:13,839

 

1505
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,750

Note starting to build up here.

1506
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,760
Note starting to build up here.
 

1507
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,270
Note starting to build up here.
This is your overunder for current

1508
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,280
This is your overunder for current
 

1509
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,550
This is your overunder for current
sentiment.

1511
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,230

So if we think where we might go,

1512
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
So if we think where we might go,
 

1513
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,310
So if we think where we might go,

sorry, previous day point of control.
Somewhere in here, I'd imagine we fail

1520
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
Somewhere in here, I'd imagine we fail
 

1521
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,069
Somewhere in here, I'd imagine we fail
one of these blocks. We will probably

1522
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
one of these blocks. We will probably
 

1523
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,230
one of these blocks. We will probably
fail at least for a back test.

1524
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
fail at least for a back test.
 

1525
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,750
fail at least for a back test.
Maybe it does this to one of these, but

1526
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:43,760
Maybe it does this to one of these, but
 

1527
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,030
Maybe it does this to one of these, but
I don't know which. But I'm out now

1528
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
I don't know which. But I'm out now
 

1529
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,150
I don't know which. But I'm out now
anyway. 200 points. That was enough.

1530
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
anyway. 200 points. That was enough.
 

1531
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,109
anyway. 200 points. That was enough.
Got my money, right? Got my money.

1532
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:53,119

gray box. Big big level. There's no
 

1693
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,349

00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,040
And you want to be very careful being
 

1697
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,630
And you want to be very careful being

this gray box. All the time we're above
 

1701
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,990
this gray box. All the time we're above
this. This is a long trying to extend

1702
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
this. This is a long trying to extend
 

1703
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,589
this. This is a long trying to extend
up. They're trying to extend up to hit

1704
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
up. They're trying to extend up to hit
 

1705
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,750
up. They're trying to extend up to hit
their targets right now. There's no

1706
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:29,760
their targets right now. There's no
 

1707
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,349
their targets right now. There's no
short until you leave this gray box. Any

00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:31,359
short until you leave this gray box. Any
 

1709
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,710
short until you leave this gray box. Any
of you that are thinking about short,

1710
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
of you that are thinking about short,
 

1711
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,230
of you that are thinking about short,
not until you leave volume. We talk

1712
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
not until you leave volume. We talk
 

1713
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,349
not until you leave volume. We talk
about it all the time. You would be

1714
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
about it all the time. You would be
 

1715
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,510
about it all the time. You would be
front side on this move.

1716

front side on this move.
 

1717
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,109
front side on this move.
You don't know how high up this can go.

1718
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
You don't know how high up this can go.
 

1719
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,790
You don't know how high up this can go.
Maybe it stops here and leaves. Maybe

1720
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:40,800
Maybe it stops here and leaves. Maybe
 

1721
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,870
Maybe it stops here and leaves. Maybe
they base here and do a big big squeeze.

1722
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:42,880
they base here and do a big big squeeze.
 

1723
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,510
they base here and do a big big squeeze.
We don't know. So, we respect the

00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520
We don't know. So, we respect the
 

1725
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:56,150
We don't know. So, we respect the
structure in front of us.

1726
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,160

 

1727
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,589

Buyers definitely caught the moment at

1728
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
Buyers definitely caught the moment at
 

1729
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,190
Buyers definitely caught the moment at
930s.

1730
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200

 

1731
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,670

Just hanging around this bot.

1732
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:03,680
Just hanging around this bot.
 

1733
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,470
Just hanging around this bot.
Yes, stuck right now between it 24-hour

Watch your ATR. It's still pretty high.

1740
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440
Watch your ATR. It's still pretty high.
 

1741
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,950
Watch your ATR. It's still pretty high.
All right, ATR is still pretty high.

All right, ATR is still pretty high.
We're still holding this gray box. There

1744
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
We're still holding this gray box. There
 

1745
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,990
We're still holding this gray box. There
is still no change here until that

1746
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,000
is still no change here until that
 

1747
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,990
is still no change here until that
changes. We start to change that and

1748
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,000
changes. We start to change that and
 

1749
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,829
changes. We start to change that and
it'll be a drive lower.

1750
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:23,839

 

1751
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,430

Holding the edge of gray box again. Back

1752
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
Holding the edge of gray box again. Back
 

1753
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,310
Holding the edge of gray box again. Back
upside we go. No change. The only short

1754
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:28,320
upside we go. No change. The only short
 

1755
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,829
upside we go. No change. The only short
here and it'd be very very tough to take

1756
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:29,839
here and it'd be very very tough to take
 

1757
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,990
here and it'd be very very tough to take
today would be something like this down

1758
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,000
today would be something like this down
 

1759
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,430
today would be something like this down
to here. Right.

1760
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:35,440
to here. Right.
 

1761
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,670
to here. Right.
Otherwise, we have low hanging fruit

1762
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:37,680
Otherwise, we have low hanging fruit
 

1763
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,430
Otherwise, we have low hanging fruit
above for them to aim for.

1764
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440

 

1765
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,750

Yeah, the gray boxes. You see, we can

1766
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:47,760
Yeah, the gray boxes. You see, we can
 

1767
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,510
Yeah, the gray boxes. You see, we can
actually extend this gray box now. But

1768
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520
actually extend this gray box now. But
 

1769
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,190
actually extend this gray box now. But
you can see this volume here.

1770
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
you can see this volume here.
 

1771
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,510
you can see this volume here.
If we looked inside of that,

1772
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
If we looked inside of that,
 

1773
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,910
If we looked inside of that,
right? You can see

1774
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
right? You can see
 

1775
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,069
right? You can see
at the lows we have sellers keep get

1776
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
at the lows we have sellers keep get
 

1777
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,510
at the lows we have sellers keep get
getting stuck.

1778
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520

 

1779
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,349

At the highs, we have buyers stuck. So,

1780
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
At the highs, we have buyers stuck. So,
 

1781
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,510
At the highs, we have buyers stuck. So,
we're boxed in in here. The breakout

1782
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
we're boxed in in here. The breakout
 

1783
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,829
we're boxed in in here. The breakout
will get this continuation or that move

1784
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:11,839
will get this continuation or that move
 

1785
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,190
will get this continuation or that move
up there. You want to be very careful

1786
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,200
up there. You want to be very careful
 

1787
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,470
up there. You want to be very careful
about a fail breakout. That's why I'm

1788
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,480
about a fail breakout. That's why I'm
 

1789
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,829
about a fail breakout. That's why I'm
not adding up here because I know that

1790
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:15,839
not adding up here because I know that
 

1791
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,309
not adding up here because I know that
we've had a decent move. We've had a

1792
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
we've had a decent move. We've had a
 

1793
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,589
we've had a decent move. We've had a
decent run already. They're going to try

1794
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
decent run already. They're going to try
 

1795
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,829
decent run already. They're going to try
and get into this value area low and

1796
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:21,839
and get into this value area low and
 

1797
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,270
and get into this value area low and
previous day close. They want to close

1798
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
previous day close. They want to close
 

1799
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,030
previous day close. They want to close
this gap. Remember, this is where Oh,

1800
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
this gap. Remember, this is where Oh,
 

1801
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,069
this gap. Remember, this is where Oh,
don't move that. This is where we held

1802
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
don't move that. This is where we held
 

1803
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,069
don't move that. This is where we held
overnight. So, this is where all buyers

1804
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:30,079
overnight. So, this is where all buyers
 

1805
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,430
overnight. So, this is where all buyers
are currently stuck. Right. The reason

1806
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
are currently stuck. Right. The reason
 

1807
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,190
are currently stuck. Right. The reason
I'm not too interested about the next

1808
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
I'm not too interested about the next
 

1809
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,470
I'm not too interested about the next
long from here to here is because

1810
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,480
long from here to here is because
 

1811
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,630
long from here to here is because
there's not too much room. If they'd let

1812
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:36,640
there's not too much room. If they'd let
 

1813
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,710
there's not too much room. If they'd let
me hold my runners, I would have been

1814
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:38,720
me hold my runners, I would have been
 

1815
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,390
me hold my runners, I would have been
willing to hold all the way up. It looks

1816
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,400
willing to hold all the way up. It looks
 

1817
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,270
willing to hold all the way up. It looks
like they're going to do it. Here you

1818
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,280
like they're going to do it. Here you
 

1819
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,710
like they're going to do it. Here you
go. So, we know buyers are stuck up

1820
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:42,720
go. So, we know buyers are stuck up
 

1821
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,910
go. So, we know buyers are stuck up
here. So, we want to be very careful.

1822
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:43,920
here. So, we want to be very careful.
 

1823
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,270
here. So, we want to be very careful.
There is a shelf up here that they're

1824
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
There is a shelf up here that they're
 

1825
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,510
There is a shelf up here that they're
trying to repric into. Reclaim that and

1826
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,520
trying to repric into. Reclaim that and
 

1827
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,069
trying to repric into. Reclaim that and
we get very, very bullish. Okay. So,

1828
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:50,079
we get very, very bullish. Okay. So,
 

1829
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,910
we get very, very bullish. Okay. So,
here's value.

1830
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:51,920
here's value.
 

1831
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,750
here's value.
So tagged now. Previous day value area

1832
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
So tagged now. Previous day value area
 

1833
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,990
So tagged now. Previous day value area
low now tagged.

1834
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,000
low now tagged.
 

1835
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,750
low now tagged.
It's actually

1836
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:57,760
It's actually
 

1837
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,670
It's actually
here. Just moved that accidentally with

1838
00:41:59,670 --> 00:41:59,680
here. Just moved that accidentally with
 

1839
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,309
here. Just moved that accidentally with
my mouse. Okay. So previous day value

1840
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:02,319
my mouse. Okay. So previous day value
 

1841
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,829
my mouse. Okay. So previous day value
area low tagged. The only thing left now

1842
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:03,839
area low tagged. The only thing left now
 

1843

Do I want to take the trade before 7
 

2001
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,190
Do I want to take the trade before 7
before the news? Probably not.

2002
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,200

 

2003
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,109

ES back down to that VWAP again. If ES
 

2005
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,270
ES back down to that VWAP again. If ES
starts getting heavy here, we might get

2006
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:17,280
starts getting heavy here, we might get
 

2007
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,710
starts getting heavy here, we might get
that flush, but uh do they want to do

2008

that flush, but uh do they want to do
 

2009
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,109
that flush, but uh do they want to do
it? They just tap to the top side of it.

2010
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:23,119
it? They just tap to the top side of it.
 

2011

Here we go. All right. Trying a little
piece now. Watching these imbalances to

Here we go. And then can we get VW up
here? Peeling some off there. Don't like

We've got a little imbalance at 75. So

2054
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:32,560
We've got a little imbalance at 75. So
 

2055
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:39,670
We've got a little imbalance at 75. So
79's I'll tap back out.

2056
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:39,680

 

2057
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,190

2061
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,870

00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
move. Need a breakdown here underneath
 

2063
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,430

47s. Here we go. Let's [\h__\h] go.

2064
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:51,440

 

2065
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,230

Covering a lot into this. And the next

2068
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:56,640
Covering a lot into this. And the next
 

2069
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,309
Covering a lot into this. And the next
node I'll be looking for is down here.

2070
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:58,319
node I'll be looking for is down here.
 

2071
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,990
node I'll be looking for is down here.
And I won't be expecting price to come

2072
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,000
And I won't be expecting price to come
 

2073
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,349
And I won't be expecting price to come
below this really to be honest. So, I'll

2074
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:03,359
below this really to be honest. So, I'll
 

2075
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,950
below this really to be honest. So, I'll
be taking most my position off here.

2076
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
be taking most my position off here.
 

2077
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,550
be taking most my position off here.
Covering most into here. Oh, we're

2078
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:06,560
Covering most into here. Oh, we're
 

2079
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,069
Covering most into here. Oh, we're
taking most off here. So, versus this

2080
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
taking most off here. So, versus this
 

2081
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,069
taking most off here. So, versus this
flush, leaving this shelf back down into

2082
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:12,079
flush, leaving this shelf back down into
 

2083
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,829
flush, leaving this shelf back down into
here. If we get this, great.

2084
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:15,839
here. If we get this, great.
 

2085
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,550
here. If we get this, great.
Repricing some of these imbalances now.

2086
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,560
Repricing some of these imbalances now.
 

2087
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,150
Repricing some of these imbalances now.
Right. So, maybe I can show them to you

2088
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:20,160
Right. So, maybe I can show them to you
 

2089
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,790
Right. So, maybe I can show them to you
on here. See these imbalances where we

2090
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
on here. See these imbalances where we
 

2091
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,309
on here. See these imbalances where we
ripped back up. We're starting to repric

2092
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:24,319
ripped back up. We're starting to repric
 

2093
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,829
ripped back up. We're starting to repric
some of these. It's why we're peeling

2094
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
some of these. It's why we're peeling
 

2095
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,870
some of these. It's why we're peeling
some off into this. Let's [\h__\h] go.

2096
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:30,880

 

2097
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,910

Here we go. Give me that TP. Give me
 

2101
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,950
Here we go. Give me that TP. Give me
that TP. Watching 800s. It's value area

2102

that TP. Watching 800s. It's value area
 

2103
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,230
that TP. Watching 800s. It's value area
low as well. They might rebid this

2104
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240
low as well. They might rebid this
 

2105
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,069
low as well. They might rebid this
moving stop tighter here on a runner.

2106
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
moving stop tighter here on a runner.
 

2107

There we go. Out here. It's fine. Almost
 

2109
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,230
There we go. Out here. It's fine. Almost
got that. I don't want to be a dip for a

got that. I don't want to be a dip for a
 

2111
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,309
got that. I don't want to be a dip for a

2112
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:52,319

 

2113
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,990

What's the bet now? They do this cuz I

2117
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,190

Probably.

00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200
Probably.
 

2119
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:10,790

2145
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,150
for me to trade. It's my favorite man
when we've got people stuck. Just the

00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:48,160
when we've got people stuck. Just the
 

2147
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,710
when we've got people stuck. Just the

momentum so much better. Okay. Into that
 

2149
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,309

node and finding a bid. So, like I said,

2150
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:52,319
node and finding a bid. So, like I said,
 

2151
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,990
node and finding a bid. So, like I said,
I don't actually expect it to come below

2152
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:54,000
I don't actually expect it to come below
 

2153
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,309
I don't actually expect it to come below
here, but I was saying knowing my luck,

2154
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
here, but I was saying knowing my luck,
 

2155
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,910
here, but I was saying knowing my luck,
they're going to do this with it, but

2156
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
they're going to do this with it, but
 

2157
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,230
they're going to do this with it, but
it's very possible that for the rest of

2158
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:00,240
it's very possible that for the rest of
 

2159
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,990
it's very possible that for the rest of
the day, we might just chop in here,

2160
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,000
the day, we might just chop in here,
 

2161
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,190
the day, we might just chop in here,
folks. All right, so we did a fail

2162
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,200
folks. All right, so we did a fail
 

2163
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,030
folks. All right, so we did a fail
breakdown,

2164
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:05,040
breakdown,
 

2165
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,150
breakdown,
fail breakout back into the mid. All

2166
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160
fail breakout back into the mid. All
 

2167
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,589
fail breakout back into the mid. All
right, we don't know what it wants to

2168
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:09,599
right, we don't know what it wants to
 

2169
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,309
right, we don't know what it wants to
do. Maybe they do the continuation, but

2170
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:12,319
do. Maybe they do the continuation, but
 

2171
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,589
do. Maybe they do the continuation, but
I think it's very likely we need to

2172
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:15,599
I think it's very likely we need to
 

2173
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,430
I think it's very likely we need to
build out liquidity. All right. If we

2174
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,440
build out liquidity. All right. If we
 

2175
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,030
build out liquidity. All right. If we
think about on like on a daily right

2176
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,040
think about on like on a daily right
 

2177
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,349
think about on like on a daily right
now, right, it's very very likely we

2178
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:23,359
now, right, it's very very likely we
 

2179
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,349
now, right, it's very very likely we
need to just have a slower day and build

2180
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
need to just have a slower day and build
 

2181
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,829
need to just have a slower day and build
something out here and then maybe offer

2182
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839
something out here and then maybe offer
 

2183
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,990
something out here and then maybe offer
this and then this in the next week,

2184
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:30,000
this and then this in the next week,
 

2185
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,230
this and then this in the next week,
right? So, but you know, it doesn't

2186
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,240
right? So, but you know, it doesn't
 

2187
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,430
right? So, but you know, it doesn't
matter what I think. If they're going to

2188
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:33,440
matter what I think. If they're going to
 

2189
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,270
matter what I think. If they're going to
go risk off, they will just [\h__\h] dump

2190
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
go risk off, they will just [\h__\h] dump
 

2191
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,549
go risk off, they will just [\h__\h] dump
this stuff like they did for the last

2192
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:36,559
this stuff like they did for the last
 

2193
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,030
this stuff like they did for the last
few days.

2194
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
few days.
 

2195
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,950
few days.
Where was my entry? It was right here.

2196
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:40,960
Where was my entry? It was right here.
 

2197
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,630
Where was my entry? It was right here.
It was right around here. 90s. All

2198
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:42,640
It was right around here. 90s. All
 

2199
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,870
It was right around here. 90s. All
right. So once I saw, do you remember I

2200
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
right. So once I saw, do you remember I
 

2201
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,190
right. So once I saw, do you remember I
said if we leave it, if we leave this

2202
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
said if we leave it, if we leave this
 

2203
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,950
said if we leave it, if we leave this
gray box, I will be looking for the

2204
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:48,960
gray box, I will be looking for the
 

2205
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,349
gray box, I will be looking for the
short. We left and I said I want them

2206
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:51,359
short. We left and I said I want them
 

2207
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,230
short. We left and I said I want them
now to reject 905s. I think I said this

2208
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
now to reject 905s. I think I said this
 

2209
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,150
now to reject 905s. I think I said this
low volume node for the trade under.

2210
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
low volume node for the trade under.
 

2211
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,309
low volume node for the trade under.
They did this move and then the bids

2212
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
They did this move and then the bids
 

2213
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,750
They did this move and then the bids
started stacking and walking up. So I

2214
00:49:59,750 --> 00:49:59,760
started stacking and walking up. So I
 

2215
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,589
started stacking and walking up. So I
was like, I'm not touching that. They're

2216
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:01,599
was like, I'm not touching that. They're
 

2217
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,430
was like, I'm not touching that. They're
walking it up. They had one more push.

2218
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,440
walking it up. They had one more push.
 

2219
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,589
walking it up. They had one more push.
This push here trapped all the buyers.

2220
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:05,599
This push here trapped all the buyers.
 

2221
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,150
This push here trapped all the buyers.
So once we failed back under this shelf,

2222
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,160
So once we failed back under this shelf,
 

2223
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,069
So once we failed back under this shelf,
that was my short and I was covering

2224
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:10,079
that was my short and I was covering
 

2225
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,430
that was my short and I was covering
into here and I think into here. I

2226
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:13,440
into here and I think into here. I
 

2227
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,030
into here and I think into here. I
didn't even get my final target. I

2228
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
didn't even get my final target. I
 

2229
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,870
didn't even get my final target. I
missed it by like two points. And if

2230
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:16,880
missed it by like two points. And if
 

2231
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,390
missed it by like two points. And if
they start letting go of New York open,

2232
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:18,400
they start letting go of New York open,
 

2233
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,790
they start letting go of New York open,
it means that all the buyers

2234
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:20,800
it means that all the buyers
 

2235
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,549
it means that all the buyers
will be out of position and we will

2236
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:22,559
will be out of position and we will
 

2237
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,069
will be out of position and we will
rotate. Oh, they're going to do the

2238
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:24,079
rotate. Oh, they're going to do the
 

2239
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,750
rotate. Oh, they're going to do the
whole [\h__\h] move. I mean, that is just

2240
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760
whole [\h__\h] move. I mean, that is just
 

2241
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,190
whole [\h__\h] move. I mean, that is just
terrible for me. I'm going to be honest.

2242
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,200
terrible for me. I'm going to be honest.
 

2243
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,349
terrible for me. I'm going to be honest.
This is terrible for me. We might have

2244
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:29,359
This is terrible for me. We might have
 

2245
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,109
This is terrible for me. We might have
had the best trade of the day there.

2246
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:31,119
had the best trade of the day there.
 

2247
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,630
had the best trade of the day there.
That might be perfect position if

2248
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:32,640
That might be perfect position if
 

2249
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,910
That might be perfect position if
they're going to go really risk off.

2250
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
they're going to go really risk off.
 

2251
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,549
they're going to go really risk off.
Right, you've got news coming in uh

2252

00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:39,680
sellers coming in at these lows. Be
 

2257
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,390
sellers coming in at these lows. Be
very, very careful. They're being very

2258
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:42,400

00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,000
careful because if they get caught, we
 

2263
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,670
careful because if they get caught, we
will rip back up. That's a straight move

2264
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:47,680
will rip back up. That's a straight move
 

2265
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,589
will rip back up. That's a straight move
down.

2266
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:53,599

 

2267
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,470

they can do a rip ripe a cup if they

2290
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
they can do a rip ripe a cup if they
 

2291
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,109
they can do a rip ripe a cup if they
want to come and retest this. Right.

There we go. Into this node down to

2302
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:47,599
There we go. Into this node down to
 

2303
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,950
There we go. Into this node down to
here.

2304
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960

 

2305
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,990

Oh, Alex. Oh, this is going to [\h__\h]

2306
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,000
Oh, Alex. Oh, this is going to [\h__\h]
 

2307
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,990
Oh, Alex. Oh, this is going to [\h__\h]
hurt, man. This is gonna hurt if they if

2308
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
hurt, man. This is gonna hurt if they if
 

2309
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,589
hurt, man. This is gonna hurt if they if
they want to do a new leg down and I

2310
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
they want to do a new leg down and I
 

2311
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,589
they want to do a new leg down and I
have the best position on the day. This

2312
00:51:59,589 --> 00:51:59,599
have the best position on the day. This
 

2313
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,430
have the best position on the day. This
is gonna hurt. This is going to hurt my

2314
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:01,440
is gonna hurt. This is going to hurt my
 

2315
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,710
is gonna hurt. This is going to hurt my
ego. This is how I get tilty. This is

2316
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:04,720
ego. This is how I get tilty. This is
 

2317
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,309
ego. This is how I get tilty. This is
how I get tilty. Even with big wins,

2318
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:06,319
how I get tilty. Even with big wins,
 

2319
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,750
how I get tilty. Even with big wins,
this is how I get tilty. If they start

2320
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:07,760
this is how I get tilty. If they start
 

2321
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,589
this is how I get tilty. If they start
puking this and I know that I've stopped

2322
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
puking this and I know that I've stopped
 

2323
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,030
puking this and I know that I've stopped
out when I shouldn't have stopped out, I

2324
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,040
out when I shouldn't have stopped out, I
 

2325
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:18,870
out when I shouldn't have stopped out, I
will get very upset at myself.

2326
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:18,880

 

2327
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,030

Oh my god.

2328
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:21,040
Oh my god.
 

2329
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,549
Oh my god.
Is anyone still in this? You should be

2330
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:22,559
Is anyone still in this? You should be
 

2331
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:33,750
Is anyone still in this? You should be
still in this. If it wasn't for news,

2332
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:33,760

 

2333
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:44,870

Alex. Alex. Alex. Yes, please.

2334
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:44,880

 

2335
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,790

You're still in. Nice. Jolts. This was

2336
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
You're still in. Nice. Jolts. This was
 

2337
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,069
You're still in. Nice. Jolts. This was
Jolts. We had 10 a.m. news. Jolts.

2338
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:50,079
Jolts. We had 10 a.m. news. Jolts.
 

2339
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,750
Jolts. We had 10 a.m. news. Jolts.
Jolts. I just didn't want to hold

2340
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:51,760
Jolts. I just didn't want to hold
 

2341
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,510
Jolts. I just didn't want to hold
through Jolts.

2342
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
through Jolts.
 

2343
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,109
through Jolts.
because you had this huge candle, right?

2344
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
because you had this huge candle, right?
 

2345
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,430
because you had this huge candle, right?
We moved from 96 to it's almost 100

2346
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,440
We moved from 96 to it's almost 100
 

2347
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,790
We moved from 96 to it's almost 100
point candle. I didn't want to sit in

2348
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:58,800
point candle. I didn't want to sit in
 

2349
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,750
point candle. I didn't want to sit in
this and get ripped all the way back up.

2350
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
this and get ripped all the way back up.
 

2351
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,510
this and get ripped all the way back up.
The market is bleeding. All right, we're

2352
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
The market is bleeding. All right, we're
 

2353
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,309
The market is bleeding. All right, we're
back into a key level. The 700s was the

2354
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:06,319
back into a key level. The 700s was the
 

2355
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,990
back into a key level. The 700s was the
turnaround point earlier. This same key

2356
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:08,000
turnaround point earlier. This same key
 

2357
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,150
turnaround point earlier. This same key
level. So, be careful here. Right, if

2358
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
level. So, be careful here. Right, if
 

2359
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,670
level. So, be careful here. Right, if
you are still in this short, I would be

2360
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
you are still in this short, I would be
 

2361
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,510
you are still in this short, I would be
covering some here. And then we can

2362
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:13,520
covering some here. And then we can
 

2363
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,190
covering some here. And then we can
think about if you're going to get

2364
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,200
think about if you're going to get
 

2365
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,390
think about if you're going to get
expansion. Remember, we talked about 700

2366
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:18,400
expansion. Remember, we talked about 700
 

2367
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,230
expansion. Remember, we talked about 700
to five. I want to make sure I'm

2368
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
to five. I want to make sure I'm
 

2369
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,870
to five. I want to make sure I'm
accurate here. 700 to 561 is potential

2370
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:22,880
accurate here. 700 to 561 is potential
 

2371
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,750
accurate here. 700 to 561 is potential
gap fill. Um, I'm going to just draw

2372
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:25,760
gap fill. Um, I'm going to just draw
 

2373
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,230
gap fill. Um, I'm going to just draw
this out on here so I don't lose sight

2374
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
this out on here so I don't lose sight
 

2375
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:35,030
this out on here so I don't lose sight
of it.

2376
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040

 

2377
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,670

We do that as what should we do it as?

2378
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:37,680
We do that as what should we do it as?
 

2379
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,549
We do that as what should we do it as?
Light yellow.

2380
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559

 

2381
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,390

Okay, we're into that gap, folks. All

2382
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:44,400
Okay, we're into that gap, folks. All
 

2383
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,390
Okay, we're into that gap, folks. All
right,

2384
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:48,400

 

2385
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,470

we've been straight down. If they get a

2386
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
we've been straight down. If they get a
 

2387
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,069
we've been straight down. If they get a
reaction, they can go straight up. So,

2388
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079
reaction, they can go straight up. So,
 

2389
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,150
reaction, they can go straight up. So,
just I would just trail your stop on

2390
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,160
just I would just trail your stop on
 

2391
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,829
just I would just trail your stop on
stuff like this. 700 is where the big

2392
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:55,839
stuff like this. 700 is where the big
 

2393
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,349
stuff like this. 700 is where the big
sellers came in this morning, got stuck.

2394
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:57,359
sellers came in this morning, got stuck.
 

2395
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,750
sellers came in this morning, got stuck.
This white line is where the sellers

2396
00:53:59,750 --> 00:53:59,760
This white line is where the sellers
 

2397
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,109
This white line is where the sellers
came in this morning, got stuck. That's

2398
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:01,119
came in this morning, got stuck. That's
 

2399
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,109
came in this morning, got stuck. That's
where we went under, over squeeze. So,

2400
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
where we went under, over squeeze. So,
 

2401
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,109
where we went under, over squeeze. So,
just be careful. I'll be watching these

2402
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
just be careful. I'll be watching these
 

2403
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,549
just be careful. I'll be watching these
nodes back up here. Now, I'm going to

2404
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:06,559
nodes back up here. Now, I'm going to
 

2405
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,150
nodes back up here. Now, I'm going to
remove this.

2406
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:10,160

 

2407
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,670

You would want them to protect that on

2408
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
You would want them to protect that on
 

2409
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,309
You would want them to protect that on
the way back up. All right. I think we

2410
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:14,319
the way back up. All right. I think we
 

2411
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:22,470
the way back up. All right. I think we
will develop a range here now today.

2412
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,480

 

2413
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,470

No, I don't speak Italian. Not enough of

2414
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:24,480
No, I don't speak Italian. Not enough of
 

2415
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,190
No, I don't speak Italian. Not enough of
it. Just enough to swear.

2416
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200

 

2417
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,270

Nice work, everyone. Nice work.

2418
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,280
Nice work, everyone. Nice work.
 

2419
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,069
Nice work, everyone. Nice work.
Only bonds. Well, also Netflix, those of

2420
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
Only bonds. Well, also Netflix, those of
 

2421
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,750
Only bonds. Well, also Netflix, those of
you who started that swing position with

2422
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:39,760
you who started that swing position with
 

2423
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,069
you who started that swing position with
me, Netflix relative strength again, two

2424
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:42,079
me, Netflix relative strength again, two
 

2425
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,190
me, Netflix relative strength again, two
and a half% up. Love to see it. Love to

2426
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
and a half% up. Love to see it. Love to
 

2427
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,790
and a half% up. Love to see it. Love to
see it. That one's starting to look

2428
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:46,800
see it. That one's starting to look
 

2429
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,549
see it. That one's starting to look
good.

2430
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:48,559
good.
 

2431
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,309
good.
So, I actually want Netflix to come a

2432
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
So, I actually want Netflix to come a
 

2433
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,910
So, I actually want Netflix to come a
little bit lower. We started that swing

2434
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:51,920
little bit lower. We started that swing
 

2435
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,950
little bit lower. We started that swing
position.

2436
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:54,960

 

2437
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,109

I'd love it into the 70s, but that's a

2438
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
I'd love it into the 70s, but that's a
 

2439
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,349
I'd love it into the 70s, but that's a
nice drive today. You can see we're

2440
00:54:59,349 --> 00:54:59,359
nice drive today. You can see we're
 

2441
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,430
nice drive today. You can see we're
starting to base out here. I would have

2442
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:01,440
starting to base out here. I would have
 

2443
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,109
starting to base out here. I would have
loved it a little bit deeper into this

2444
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:03,119
loved it a little bit deeper into this
 

2445
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,670
loved it a little bit deeper into this
gap. We might still get it. It might be

2446
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:05,680
gap. We might still get it. It might be
 

2447
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,910
gap. We might still get it. It might be
a drive which rejects and comes down,

2448
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:07,920
a drive which rejects and comes down,
 

2449
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,230
a drive which rejects and comes down,
but we are now what, like 40% down off

2450
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
but we are now what, like 40% down off
 

2451
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,270
but we are now what, like 40% down off
the highs, maybe more.

2452
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:13,280
the highs, maybe more.
 

2453
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,589
the highs, maybe more.
Yeah, 40% off the highs. I'd love it

2467
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,069

you can always play leaps the lower we

you can always play leaps the lower we

go the better in my mind for Netflix.

2470
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:37,839
go the better in my mind for Netflix.
 

2471
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,750
go the better in my mind for Netflix.
Okay,

2472
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:41,760

 

2473
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,270

what do I think about Hood? Um,

2474
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,280

 

2475
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,270

I imagine they're absolutely dumping it.

2476
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
I imagine they're absolutely dumping it.
 

2477
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,789
I imagine they're absolutely dumping it.
Yeah,

2478
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:50,799
Yeah,
 

2479
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,950
Yeah,
it's been priced up so hard. It's been

2480
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:52,960
it's been priced up so hard. It's been
 

2481
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,750
it's been priced up so hard. It's been
stupid the amount of uh price up. You

2482
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:55,760
stupid the amount of uh price up. You
 

2483
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,109
stupid the amount of uh price up. You
can see where I talked about come back

2484
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:57,119
can see where I talked about come back
 

2485
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,390
can see where I talked about come back
to this is uh Yeah, I mean anyone buying

00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:00,400
to this is uh Yeah, I mean anyone buying
 

2487
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,470
to this is uh Yeah, I mean anyone buying
it up there is frankly is I mean I hope

2488
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:02,480
it up there is frankly is I mean I hope
 

2489
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,829
it up there is frankly is I mean I hope
I'm not offending you is frankly a

2490
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
I'm not offending you is frankly a
 

2491
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,549
I'm not offending you is frankly a
[\h__\h] idiot. Like this whole thought

2492
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:06,559
[\h__\h] idiot. Like this whole thought
 

2493
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,630
[\h__\h] idiot. Like this whole thought
that this is going to keep going just

2494
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:08,640
that this is going to keep going just
 

2495
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,309
that this is going to keep going just
ridiculous. They've got exposure to

2496
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:10,319
ridiculous. They've got exposure to
 

2497
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,670
ridiculous. They've got exposure to
crypto which has finished its

2498
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:11,680
crypto which has finished its
 

2499
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,150
crypto which has finished its
thousand-day rally like we talked about.

2500
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,160
thousand-day rally like we talked about.
 

2501
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,630
thousand-day rally like we talked about.
We go swing to swing,

2502
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
We go swing to swing,
 

2503
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,470
We go swing to swing,
right? You're into an interesting area

2504
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:18,480
right? You're into an interesting area
 

2505
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,150
right? You're into an interesting area
right now, but you're very very weak.

2506
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,160
right now, but you're very very weak.
 

2507
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,549
right now, but you're very very weak.
So, I think into here would be

2508
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:22,559
So, I think into here would be
 

2509
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,430
So, I think into here would be
interesting to scoop some up, right? If

2510
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:25,440
interesting to scoop some up, right? If
 

2511
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,789
interesting to scoop some up, right? If
you're really if you're really bullish

2512
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:26,799
you're really if you're really bullish
 

2513
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,069
you're really if you're really bullish
on it, I think there'd be a reaction

2514
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
on it, I think there'd be a reaction
 

2515
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,670
on it, I think there'd be a reaction
somewhere around here for at least a

2516
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:29,680
somewhere around here for at least a
 

2517
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,510
somewhere around here for at least a
back test. So, there's probably if you

2518
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,520
back test. So, there's probably if you
 

2519
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,990
back test. So, there's probably if you
can get 70s, there's probably like a 30

2520
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
can get 70s, there's probably like a 30
 

2521
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,950
can get 70s, there's probably like a 30
point a 30 uh dollar move. And if it

2522
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:36,960
point a 30 uh dollar move. And if it
 

2523
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,309
point a 30 uh dollar move. And if it
reclaims, great. if we're going to go

2524
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:38,319
reclaims, great. if we're going to go
 

2525
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,430
reclaims, great. if we're going to go
bullish on the rest of the year. If we

2526
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
bullish on the rest of the year. If we
 

2527
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,630
bullish on the rest of the year. If we
start losing this though, you want to be

2528
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
start losing this though, you want to be
 

2529
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,470
start losing this though, you want to be
real careful. We actually have an old

2530
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:42,480
real careful. We actually have an old
 

2531
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,630
real careful. We actually have an old
gap down there still. So, it really

2532
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:44,640
gap down there still. So, it really
 

2533
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,470
gap down there still. So, it really
depends on sentiment of the market.

2534
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
depends on sentiment of the market.
 

2535
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,829
depends on sentiment of the market.
Really depends on sentiment of the

2536
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:47,839
Really depends on sentiment of the
 

2537
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,270
Really depends on sentiment of the
market. Like, if I'm going to scoop up

2538
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
market. Like, if I'm going to scoop up
 

2539
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,670
market. Like, if I'm going to scoop up
individual names, they either need to

2540
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:51,680
individual names, they either need to
 

2541
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,950
individual names, they either need to
have been sold off way way way way too

2542
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
have been sold off way way way way too
 

2543
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,349
have been sold off way way way way too
much and be a very very good name. Um,

2544
00:56:59,349 --> 00:56:59,359
much and be a very very good name. Um,
 

2545
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,750
much and be a very very good name. Um,
or if it's like a speculatory buy for

2549
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,589
me, it's where I think there's like some
news coming or something like that. But

2550
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:05,599
news coming or something like that. But
 

2551
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,069
news coming or something like that. But
normally it's just

2552
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:08,079
normally it's just
 

2553
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,069
normally it's just
looking for uh mag seven kind of names

2554
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:12,079
looking for uh mag seven kind of names
 

2555
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,069
looking for uh mag seven kind of names
deep in discount.

2556
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079

2557
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,710
deep in discount.
Oh god, this is going to hurt guys. This

2558
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
Oh god, this is going to hurt guys. This
 

2559
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,950
Oh god, this is going to hurt guys. This
is going to really hurt me.

2560
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:20,960

 

2561
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,309

I'd be very careful about the fail

2562
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:22,319
I'd be very careful about the fail
 

2563
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,589
I'd be very careful about the fail
breakout again down here. If you're

2564
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
breakout again down here. If you're
 

2565
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,270
breakout again down here. If you're
still short, just as long as you paid

2566
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
still short, just as long as you paid
 

2567
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,230
still short, just as long as you paid
yourself some um

2568
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:28,240
yourself some um
 

2569
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,109
yourself some um
we can think about the extension that

2570
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,119
we can think about the extension that
 

2571
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:37,030
we can think about the extension that
you could potentially do.

2572
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,040

 

2573
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,230

Yeah, we might you might get 500 today

2574
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,240
Yeah, we might you might get 500 today
 

2575
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,789
Yeah, we might you might get 500 today
if you get really lucky. Remember, we're

2576
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:42,799
if you get really lucky. Remember, we're
 

2577
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,750
if you get really lucky. Remember, we're
into a gap. This sort of greeny or

2578
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:45,760
into a gap. This sort of greeny or
 

2579
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,549
into a gap. This sort of greeny or
orangey yellowy box is a gap. Why is

2580
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:48,559
orangey yellowy box is a gap. Why is
 

2581
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:59,030
orangey yellowy box is a gap. Why is
that on that color? We want you gray.

2582
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,040

 

2583
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,230

My method's complicated. Um, I don't

2584
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:02,240
My method's complicated. Um, I don't
 

2585
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,589
My method's complicated. Um, I don't
think so. I think it's really simple.

2586
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:05,599
think so. I think it's really simple.
 

2587
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,630
think so. I think it's really simple.
Um, it might seem complicated. All we're

2588
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
Um, it might seem complicated. All we're
 

2589
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,349
Um, it might seem complicated. All we're
doing is looking for players on multiple

2590
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:11,359
doing is looking for players on multiple
 

2591
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,950
doing is looking for players on multiple
time frames who are trapped. All right.

2592
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:12,960
time frames who are trapped. All right.
 

2593
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,470
time frames who are trapped. All right.
So, where did bulls enter today who are

2594
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:16,480
So, where did bulls enter today who are
 

2595
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,230
So, where did bulls enter today who are
not very smart? They enter on a

2596
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
not very smart? They enter on a
 

2597
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,150
not very smart? They enter on a
breakout. All right. They bought here.

2598
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
breakout. All right. They bought here.
 

2599
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,990
breakout. All right. They bought here.
We see them trapped here. We see them

2600
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:22,000
We see them trapped here. We see them
 

2601
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,710
We see them trapped here. We see them
trapped here. We use their pain to trade

2602
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
trapped here. We use their pain to trade
 

2603
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,630
trapped here. We use their pain to trade
lower. Where did shorts enter today?

2604
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:26,640
lower. Where did shorts enter today?
 

2605
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,750
lower. Where did shorts enter today?
Underneath this low down here. Uh, we've

2606
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:29,760
Underneath this low down here. Uh, we've
 

2607
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,069
Underneath this low down here. Uh, we've
already puked out lots. We don't expect

2608
00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:32,079
already puked out lots. We don't expect
 

2609
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,990
already puked out lots. We don't expect
this to just keep going down. When we

2610
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,000
this to just keep going down. When we
 

2611
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,990
this to just keep going down. When we
zoom right out and we think about where

2612
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
zoom right out and we think about where
 

2613
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,990
zoom right out and we think about where
this move started yesterday and the day

2614
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,000
this move started yesterday and the day
 

2615
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,150
this move started yesterday and the day
before, you know, even higher. We can't

2616
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,160
before, you know, even higher. We can't
 

2617
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,190
before, you know, even higher. We can't
just keep nailing down without providing

2618
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:43,200
just keep nailing down without providing
 

2619
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,030
just keep nailing down without providing
liquidity for market makers to get

2620
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:45,040
liquidity for market makers to get
 

2621
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,430
liquidity for market makers to get
involved in. So, you know, were market

2622
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:47,440
involved in. So, you know, were market
 

2623
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,510
involved in. So, you know, were market
makers likely to short lower dayto-day?

2624
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:49,520
makers likely to short lower dayto-day?
 

2625
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,069
makers likely to short lower dayto-day?
No. Was retail? Yes. So, they get

2626
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:52,079
No. Was retail? Yes. So, they get
 

2627
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,390
No. Was retail? Yes. So, they get
trapped, we use their pain, we trade up.

2628
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:54,400
trapped, we use their pain, we trade up.
 

2629
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,390
trapped, we use their pain, we trade up.
They get trapped. Buying the top, we use

2630
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:56,400
They get trapped. Buying the top, we use
 

2631
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,150
They get trapped. Buying the top, we use
their pain, we trade down. Right? That's

2632
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
their pain, we trade down. Right? That's
 

2633
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,670
their pain, we trade down. Right? That's
all it is. And it's the same thing on

2634
00:58:59,670 --> 00:58:59,680
all it is. And it's the same thing on
 

2635
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,430
all it is. And it's the same thing on
multiple time frames. That's where the

2636
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:01,440
multiple time frames. That's where the
 

2637
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,430
multiple time frames. That's where the
edge comes from. And you're using flow

2638
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:03,440
edge comes from. And you're using flow
 

2639
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,349
edge comes from. And you're using flow
zones or everything else for confluence

2640
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:05,359
zones or everything else for confluence
 

2641
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:16,470
zones or everything else for confluence
and key levels.

2642
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:16,480

 

2643
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,230

What indicator am I using? This is

2644
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:18,240
What indicator am I using? This is
 

2645
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,309
What indicator am I using? This is
anchored volume profile and this are the

2646
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:20,319
anchored volume profile and this are the
 

2647
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,030
anchored volume profile and this are the
flow zone pros. Uh someone just asked

2648
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,040
flow zone pros. Uh someone just asked
 

2649
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,950
flow zone pros. Uh someone just asked
where how do you get discord? You do the

2650
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:24,960
where how do you get discord? You do the
 

2651
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,710
where how do you get discord? You do the
20our course, the beginner to advanced

2652
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:26,720
20our course, the beginner to advanced
 

2653
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,230
20our course, the beginner to advanced
course. You get discord for free with

2654
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:28,240
course. You get discord for free with
 

2655
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,390
course. You get discord for free with
that. Look at bookmap. It's really

2656
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:30,400
that. Look at bookmap. It's really
 

2657
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,150
that. Look at bookmap. It's really
starting to annoy me, guys. Is there a

2658
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,160
starting to annoy me, guys. Is there a
 

2659
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,390
starting to annoy me, guys. Is there a
shortcut where I can get this to stay

2660
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:34,400
shortcut where I can get this to stay
 

2661
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,190
shortcut where I can get this to stay
pinned? Cuz it keeps not staying pinned.

2662
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:37,200
pinned? Cuz it keeps not staying pinned.
 

2663
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,670
pinned? Cuz it keeps not staying pinned.
It's starting to be frustrating.

2664
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:41,680

 

2665
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,190

If they trap shorts here, it's a good

2666
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,200
If they trap shorts here, it's a good
 

2667
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,549
If they trap shorts here, it's a good
long. Yeah, I mean, I'd want a lower day

2668
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:46,559
long. Yeah, I mean, I'd want a lower day
 

2669
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,430
long. Yeah, I mean, I'd want a lower day
break at this point. Uh ES has already

2670
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:49,440
break at this point. Uh ES has already
 

2671
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,109
break at this point. Uh ES has already
done it. You just got to remember we're

2672
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:51,119
done it. You just got to remember we're
 

2673
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,390
done it. You just got to remember we're
in a bearish market leaving uh and VIX

2674
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:54,400
in a bearish market leaving uh and VIX
 

2675
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,710
in a bearish market leaving uh and VIX
has just found a pivot. Thank you. VIX

2676
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:56,720
has just found a pivot. Thank you. VIX
 

2677
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,109
has just found a pivot. Thank you. VIX
has just found a bid and it's breaking

2678
00:59:59,109 --> 00:59:59,119
has just found a bid and it's breaking
 

2679
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,109
has just found a bid and it's breaking
out. So, you know, you'd you'd need the

2680
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:01,119
out. So, you know, you'd you'd need the
 

2681
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,950
out. So, you know, you'd you'd need the
VIX to start going the other way. You'd

2682
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
VIX to start going the other way. You'd
 

2683
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,710
VIX to start going the other way. You'd
probably want us to finish filling that

2684
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:04,720
probably want us to finish filling that
 

2685
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,630
probably want us to finish filling that
gap. Right? So, look at VIX. It's just

2686
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
gap. Right? So, look at VIX. It's just
 

2687
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,309
gap. Right? So, look at VIX. It's just
found a bid on this old resistance

2688
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:08,319
found a bid on this old resistance
 

2689
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,589
found a bid on this old resistance
level. All right. Here's the old

2690
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:09,599
level. All right. Here's the old
 

2691
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,910
level. All right. Here's the old
resistance level. Here's the pin low.

2692
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
resistance level. Here's the pin low.
 

2693
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,430
resistance level. Here's the pin low.
Look at VIX. Did the same thing that we

2694
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
Look at VIX. Did the same thing that we
 

2695
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,430
Look at VIX. Did the same thing that we
did for the longs. All right. Undercut,

2696
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440
did for the longs. All right. Undercut,
 

2697
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,589
did for the longs. All right. Undercut,
turn around, gone. All right. V-shaped

2698
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:17,599
turn around, gone. All right. V-shaped
 

2699
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,549
turn around, gone. All right. V-shaped
recovery into key level gone. All right.

2700
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:20,559
recovery into key level gone. All right.
 

2701
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,710
recovery into key level gone. All right.
So, if VIX blows through this and comes

2702
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:22,720
So, if VIX blows through this and comes
 

2703
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,789
So, if VIX blows through this and comes
back down, maybe you get that kind of

2704
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:24,799
back down, maybe you get that kind of
 

2705
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,270
back down, maybe you get that kind of
move down here, but you want to be very

2706
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,280
move down here, but you want to be very
 

2707
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,789
move down here, but you want to be very
careful. All right. This is a high

2708
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
careful. All right. This is a high
 

2709
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,390
careful. All right. This is a high
volume node. This gray box here is a

2710
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,400
volume node. This gray box here is a
 

2711
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,910
volume node. This gray box here is a
high volume node that we're trading into

2712
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:31,920
high volume node that we're trading into
 

2713
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,309
high volume node that we're trading into
based on a daily and a weekly. Um, but

2714
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
based on a daily and a weekly. Um, but
 

2715
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,829
based on a daily and a weekly. Um, but
we can come all the way down to 550.

2716
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:35,839
we can come all the way down to 550.
 

2717
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,950
we can come all the way down to 550.
Like I said, gap fill would be 550.

2718
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
Like I said, gap fill would be 550.
 

2719
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,630
Like I said, gap fill would be 550.
Would be 550. So, we want to be very

2720
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
Would be 550. So, we want to be very
 

2721
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,710
Would be 550. So, we want to be very
careful.

2722
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:42,720
careful.
 

2723
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,069
careful.
I wouldn't be short down here, that's

2724
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,079
I wouldn't be short down here, that's
 

2725
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,349
I wouldn't be short down here, that's
for sure. We had the best short of the

2726
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:45,359
for sure. We had the best short of the
 

2727
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,470
for sure. We had the best short of the
day. I am an absolute idiot. Uh, that

2728
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,480
day. I am an absolute idiot. Uh, that
 

2729
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,549
day. I am an absolute idiot. Uh, that
was another 220 points back down to low

2730
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
was another 220 points back down to low
 

2731
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,510
was another 220 points back down to low
there if I just held that.

2732
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
there if I just held that.
 

2733
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,990
there if I just held that.
Sorry, folks.

2734
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:56,000
Sorry, folks.
 

2735
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,069
Sorry, folks.
All right.

2736
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
All right.
 

2737
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,270
All right.
Zoom in and watch this a little bit.

2738
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,280
Zoom in and watch this a little bit.
 

2739
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,309
Zoom in and watch this a little bit.
Now, I think we're going to go in a

2740
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:00,319
Now, I think we're going to go in a
 

2741
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,710
Now, I think we're going to go in a
range today. Honestly, my gut feeling is

2742
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:02,720
range today. Honestly, my gut feeling is
 

2743
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,069
range today. Honestly, my gut feeling is
we shouldn't trade gut feeling, but we

2744
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:04,079
we shouldn't trade gut feeling, but we
 

2745
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,670
we shouldn't trade gut feeling, but we
just trapped shorts at the lows again.

2746
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
just trapped shorts at the lows again.
 

2747
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,710
just trapped shorts at the lows again.
650s, right? If we look again at the

2748
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:08,720
650s, right? If we look again at the
 

2749
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,190
650s, right? If we look again at the
lows, all the lows. And there you go.

2750
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:11,200
lows, all the lows. And there you go.
 

2751
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,510
lows, all the lows. And there you go.
650s. The undercut. Guess what happened?

2752
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:13,520
650s. The undercut. Guess what happened?
 

2753
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,829
650s. The undercut. Guess what happened?
Breakout shorts came in underneath the

2754
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:15,839
Breakout shorts came in underneath the
 

2755
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,549
Breakout shorts came in underneath the
previous or the current daily low. And

2756
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:18,559
previous or the current daily low. And
 

2757
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,230
previous or the current daily low. And
they now just got themselves caught

2758
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:20,240
they now just got themselves caught
 

2759
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,430
they now just got themselves caught
again. All right. So, if we don't get a

2760
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:23,440
again. All right. So, if we don't get a
 

2761
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,349
again. All right. So, if we don't get a
break under here, if they tap this and

2762
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
break under here, if they tap this and
 

2763
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,510
break under here, if they tap this and
stay and buy a step back in, we will

2764
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
stay and buy a step back in, we will
 

2765
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,789
stay and buy a step back in, we will
probably get a squeeze back out. I

2766
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:28,799
probably get a squeeze back out. I
 

2767
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,069
probably get a squeeze back out. I
wouldn't be playing the buys down here.

2768
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:30,079
wouldn't be playing the buys down here.
 

2769
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,470
wouldn't be playing the buys down here.
It's very, very risky right now. I'd

2770
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:32,480
It's very, very risky right now. I'd
 

2771
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,910
It's very, very risky right now. I'd
kind of wait for it to start pivoting

2772
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:33,920
kind of wait for it to start pivoting
 

2773
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:46,390
kind of wait for it to start pivoting
and showing me.

2774
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:46,400

 

2775
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,390

How do I set my levels for value high

2776
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:48,400
How do I set my levels for value high
 

2777
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,990
How do I set my levels for value high
and value low? They're based on New

2778
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,000
and value low? They're based on New
 

2779
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,190
and value low? They're based on New
York. They're not based on the whole

2780
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
York. They're not based on the whole
 

2781
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,230
York. They're not based on the whole
day.

2782
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:52,240
day.
 

2783
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,750
day.
All right, I will tell you there's

2784
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:53,760
All right, I will tell you there's
 

2785
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,670
All right, I will tell you there's
definitely some sellers getting caught

2786
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:55,680
definitely some sellers getting caught
 

2787
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,309
definitely some sellers getting caught
at these lows. We are starting to see

2788
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:58,319
at these lows. We are starting to see
 

2789
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,069
at these lows. We are starting to see
them get caught down here. Look at this.

2790
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
them get caught down here. Look at this.
 

2791
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,030
them get caught down here. Look at this.
658 to the low of day. So, if buyers

2792
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:03,040
658 to the low of day. So, if buyers
 

2793
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,870
658 to the low of day. So, if buyers
protect that, it's a big [\h__\h] ask

2794
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:04,880
protect that, it's a big [\h__\h] ask
 

2795
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,230
protect that, it's a big [\h__\h] ask
because you haven't turned around yet.

2796
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
because you haven't turned around yet.
 

2797
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,789
because you haven't turned around yet.
But if they protect this and reclaim up

2798
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:08,799
But if they protect this and reclaim up
 

2799
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,789
But if they protect this and reclaim up
here, they reclaim value. There's

2800
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
here, they reclaim value. There's
 

2801
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,390
here, they reclaim value. There's
probably a move, you know, I'd be more

2802
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:12,400
probably a move, you know, I'd be more
 

2803
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,030
probably a move, you know, I'd be more
interested if they reclaimed 720 for a

2804
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:15,040
interested if they reclaimed 720 for a
 

2805
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,789
interested if they reclaimed 720 for a
move up to 800. Otherwise, I wouldn't

2806
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799
move up to 800. Otherwise, I wouldn't
 

2807
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,270
move up to 800. Otherwise, I wouldn't
really be touching it.

2808
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,280
really be touching it.
 

2809
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,950
really be touching it.
But they're definitely piling in at the

2810
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:20,960
But they're definitely piling in at the
 

2811
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:29,910
But they're definitely piling in at the
lows.

2812
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920

 

2813
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,589

Like

2814
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:31,599
Like
 

2815
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,990
Like
600 and 550 still possible. If you're

2816
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,000
600 and 550 still possible. If you're
 

2817
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,190
600 and 550 still possible. If you're
still holding your shorts, you're still

2818
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:35,200
still holding your shorts, you're still
 

2819
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,109
still holding your shorts, you're still
possible.

2820
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:37,119
possible.
 

2821
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,789
possible.
But let's see if bookmap moves down with

2822
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:38,799
But let's see if bookmap moves down with
 

2823
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,990
But let's see if bookmap moves down with
this thing. I don't think it's going to.

2824
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,000
this thing. I don't think it's going to.
 

2825
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,990
this thing. I don't think it's going to.
Does anyone know of a shortcut? No, it's

2826
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:44,000
Does anyone know of a shortcut? No, it's
 

2827
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,270
Does anyone know of a shortcut? No, it's
not going to again.

2828
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:47,280
not going to again.
 

2829
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,630
not going to again.
Got to be something I've clicked

2830
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:48,640
Got to be something I've clicked
 

2831
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:55,349
Got to be something I've clicked
accidentally. What is this control panel

2832
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:55,359

 

2833
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,789

really annoying

2834
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799

 

2835
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,510

VIX matters over analysis? Uh it's just

2836
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,520
VIX matters over analysis? Uh it's just
 

2837
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,190
VIX matters over analysis? Uh it's just
good confluence, right? It's more like

2838
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,200
good confluence, right? It's more like
 

2839
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,190
good confluence, right? It's more like
if we see divergence for VIX, it's a day

2840
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,200
if we see divergence for VIX, it's a day
 

2841
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,950
if we see divergence for VIX, it's a day
that I don't want to trade, right? And

2842
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:06,960
that I don't want to trade, right? And
 

2843
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,870
that I don't want to trade, right? And
it does occasionally happen, especially

2844
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:08,880
it does occasionally happen, especially
 

2845
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,430
it does occasionally happen, especially
into rollover, right? So if you see like

2846
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:11,440
into rollover, right? So if you see like
 

2847
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,349
into rollover, right? So if you see like
VIX moving higher and the market moving

2848
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:13,359
VIX moving higher and the market moving
 

2849
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,910
VIX moving higher and the market moving
higher that is a nogo for me days like

2850
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:15,920
higher that is a nogo for me days like
 

2851
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:22,470
higher that is a nogo for me days like
that. Right click on the price line

2852
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480

 

2853
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,390

reenter.
What do I want to put? AutoBBO.

2856
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:27,359
What do I want to put? AutoBBO.
 

2857
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:38,950
What do I want to put? AutoBBO.
Nope.

2858
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:38,960

 

2859
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,069

I want it to follow it and it's just not

2860
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079

01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,029

Okay, here we go. So, you might get us

2870
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,039
Okay, here we go. So, you might get us
 

2871
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,910
Okay, here we go. So, you might get us
gapful, folks. Oh my god. We had the

2872

01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
best short of the day. Alex, you are I
 

2875
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,950
best short of the day. Alex, you are I
knew this was going to happen. I might

2876
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:04,960
knew this was going to happen. I might
 

2877
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,069
knew this was going to happen. I might
not be able to trade the rest of the

2878
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:06,079
not be able to trade the rest of the
 

2879
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,510
not be able to trade the rest of the
day. Now, this is going to put me on

2880
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:07,520
day. Now, this is going to put me on
 

2881
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,349
day. Now, this is going to put me on
full tilt. This is going to be a 330

2882
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:09,359
full tilt. This is going to be a 330
 

2883
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:13,190
full tilt. This is going to be a 330
point trade that I've missed.

2884
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200

 

2885
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,789

Oh, that's hard to take. That's really

2886
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:14,799
Oh, that's hard to take. That's really
 

2887
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,109
Oh, that's hard to take. That's really
hard to take. I'm sorry team. Lots of

2888
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:17,119
hard to take. I'm sorry team. Lots of
 

2889
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,230
hard to take. I'm sorry team. Lots of
you are getting it though, which is

2890
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:18,240
you are getting it though, which is
 

2891
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,109
you are getting it though, which is
great. So, I'd be TP into here, the edge

2892
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:21,119
great. So, I'd be TP into here, the edge
 

2893
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,470
great. So, I'd be TP into here, the edge
of this gray, and then I'd be looking

2894
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:22,480
of this gray, and then I'd be looking
 

2895
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,309
of this gray, and then I'd be looking
for 550s. Now, this was what we talked

2896
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:24,319
for 550s. Now, this was what we talked
 

2897
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,349
for 550s. Now, this was what we talked
about earlier. 700 to 550 possible today

2898
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:27,359
about earlier. 700 to 550 possible today
 

2899
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,670
about earlier. 700 to 550 possible today
after a fail break. Oh god, this is

2900
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:29,680
after a fail break. Oh god, this is
 

2901
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,870
after a fail break. Oh god, this is
going to be sting. This is going to

2902
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:30,880
going to be sting. This is going to
 

2903
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,549
going to be sting. This is going to
really sting.

2904
01:04:36,549 --> 01:04:36,559

 

2905
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,710

This is going to sting.

2906
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:38,720
This is going to sting.
 

2907
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:50,470
This is going to sting.
Oh, Alex

2908
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:50,480

 

2909
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,069

turn up my mic volume. Uh, can try.

2910
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:54,079
turn up my mic volume. Uh, can try.
 

2911
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,589
turn up my mic volume. Uh, can try.
It's pretty high up, man. I think it's

2912
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:55,599
It's pretty high up, man. I think it's
 

2913
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,190
It's pretty high up, man. I think it's
just that I'm speaking low. It's uh,

would manage I'd manage this position.
 

2939
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:43,190
would manage I'd manage this position.
You're getting very close to filling

2940
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,200
You're getting very close to filling
 

2941
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,750
You're getting very close to filling
that gap. So, if they want to be

2942
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:45,760
that gap. So, if they want to be
 

2943
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,349
that gap. So, if they want to be
efficient, they will fill this gap and

2944
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
efficient, they will fill this gap and
 

2945
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,190
efficient, they will fill this gap and
then maybe find a bid until the end of

2946
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
then maybe find a bid until the end of
 

2947
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,230
then maybe find a bid until the end of
this if they're going to remain heavy.

2948
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:52,240
this if they're going to remain heavy.
 

2949
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,910
this if they're going to remain heavy.

things for me to look for here. If we're
 

2953
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,029
things for me to look for here. If we're
going to remain heavy,

2954
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
going to remain heavy,
 

2955
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,069
going to remain heavy,
we are now looking at an hourly chart

2956
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:02,079
we are now looking at an hourly chart
 

2957
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,589
we are now looking at an hourly chart
based on November sort of 20th. Uh yeah,

2958
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:05,599
based on November sort of 20th. Uh yeah,
 

2959

November 20th to 21st. So we're looking
maybe 47. There's definitely uh 450 down

2962
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:14,079
maybe 47. There's definitely uh 450 down

off the gap fill here. Did anyone get
 

2995
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,430
off the gap fill here. Did anyone get
the full move? You got it. Oh my god,

you guys got it. Look at that reaction
 

2999
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,430
you guys got it. Look at that reaction
off the gap, Phil.

3000
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,440
off the gap, Phil.
 

3001
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,069
off the gap, Phil.
God, that was accurate.

3002

They can afford to rip this now if they

3008
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:13,119
They can afford to rip this now if they
 

3009
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,630
They can afford to rip this now if they
want to. Uh they can afford 600 and then

01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
want to. Uh they can afford 600 and then
 

3011
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,549
want to. Uh they can afford 600 and then
all the way up to 650. Remember, this is

3012
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:18,559
all the way up to 650. Remember, this is
 

3013
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,789
all the way up to 650. Remember, this is
thin down here, right? So if they just

3014
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:20,799
thin down here, right? So if they just
 

3015
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,510
thin down here, right? So if they just
want to be efficient, if it's a big if,

3016
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
want to be efficient, if it's a big if,
 

3017
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,870
want to be efficient, if it's a big if,
they might come all the way back up for

3018
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,880
they might come all the way back up for
 

3019
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:36,870
they might come all the way back up for
660 and then 700. He go,

3020
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:36,880

 

3021
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,870

01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:38,880
what do I say? All the way up to 650. If
 

3023
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,349
what do I say? All the way up to 650. If
they get through it, it's 700 720.

3024
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:41,359
they get through it, it's 700 720.
 

3025
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,150
they get through it, it's 700 720.
You're welcome.

Markets like to be efficient, folks.

3034
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640
Markets like to be efficient, folks.
 

3035
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,789
Markets like to be efficient, folks.
Honestly, that's why markets really like

3036
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:04,799
Honestly, that's why markets really like
 

3037
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,630
Honestly, that's why markets really like
to be efficient.

3038
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:06,640
to be efficient.
 

3039
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,710
to be efficient.
So, like if I was short in this, you

3040
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:08,720
So, like if I was short in this, you
 

3041
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,349
So, like if I was short in this, you
think everyone's I'm I'm just a

3042
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:11,359
think everyone's I'm I'm just a
 

3043
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,510
think everyone's I'm I'm just a
40year-old, you know, guy wearing

3044
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:13,520
40year-old, you know, guy wearing
 

3045
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,430
40year-old, you know, guy wearing
spectacles living in Los Angeles who

3046
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:15,440
spectacles living in Los Angeles who
 

3047
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,910
spectacles living in Los Angeles who
used to be a DJ. If I've worked out that

3048
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:17,920
used to be a DJ. If I've worked out that
 

3049
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,110
used to be a DJ. If I've worked out that
if we leave volume here, all right, and

3050
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
if we leave volume here, all right, and
 

3051
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,630
if we leave volume here, all right, and
we want to trade lower and that there's

3052
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:22,640
we want to trade lower and that there's
 

3053
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,470
we want to trade lower and that there's
gap fill potential into there, you know

3054
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:24,480
gap fill potential into there, you know
 

3055
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,070
gap fill potential into there, you know
what? Banks have worked that out. So,

3056
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:26,080
what? Banks have worked that out. So,
 

3057
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,189
what? Banks have worked that out. So,
guess what they're going to do? They're

3058
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:27,199
guess what they're going to do? They're
 

3059
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:28,550
guess what they're going to do? They're
at least going to cover some of their

3060
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
at least going to cover some of their
 

3061
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,149
at least going to cover some of their
position into there, which means what?

3062
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:30,159
position into there, which means what?
 

3063
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:31,510
position into there, which means what?
We're probably going to get a reaction

3064
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:31,520
We're probably going to get a reaction
 

3065
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,990
We're probably going to get a reaction
off that to here. And if they get

3066
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
off that to here. And if they get
 

3067
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,990
off that to here. And if they get
through there to here and if they get

3068
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,000
through there to here and if they get
 

3069
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,590
through there to here and if they get
through there, think about how thin we

3070
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:37,600
through there, think about how thin we
 

3071
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,430
through there, think about how thin we
were all the way back up to here. All

3072
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:39,440
were all the way back up to here. All
 

3073
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,829
were all the way back up to here. All
right. So, if I can work that out as a

3074
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
right. So, if I can work that out as a
 

3075
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,550
right. So, if I can work that out as a
complete numpty, then obviously big

3076
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
complete numpty, then obviously big
 

3077
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,990
complete numpty, then obviously big
players can work that out. time big

3078
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,000
players can work that out. time big
 

3079
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,390
players can work that out. time big
players move the market.

3080
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:50,400

 

3081
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,829

All right, so here you go. Here's the

3082
01:08:51,829 --> 01:08:51,839
All right, so here you go. Here's the
 

3083
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,149
All right, so here you go. Here's the
50s. And if you get through that, I'd

3084
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:54,159
50s. And if you get through that, I'd
 

3085
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:55,349
50s. And if you get through that, I'd
watch, if you're long now for any

3086
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:55,359
watch, if you're long now for any
 

3087
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,669
watch, if you're long now for any
reason, I'd watch 90s and then seven

3088
01:08:57,669 --> 01:08:57,679
reason, I'd watch 90s and then seven
 

3089
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:15,110
reason, I'd watch 90s and then seven
sort of 20s. Great work.

3090
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,120

 

3091
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,749

Alex, when should we leave the charts?

3092
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
Alex, when should we leave the charts?
 

3093
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,110
Alex, when should we leave the charts?
Well, if you've if you've hit like a

3094
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:19,120
Well, if you've if you've hit like a
 

3095
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,390
Well, if you've if you've hit like a
daily target, if you've had a really

3096
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:20,400
daily target, if you've had a really
 

3097

to learn, stay. If you are waiting for
 

3107
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,870

Don't overtrade though.

3116
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:46,799

 

3117
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,030

Can I show my anchor view uh anchor

3118
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:49,040
Can I show my anchor view uh anchor
 

3119
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,110
Can I show my anchor view uh anchor
profile settings? Yep. Right here. All

3120
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
profile settings? Yep. Right here. All
 

3121
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,269
profile settings? Yep. Right here. All
right. I use two ticks. I have this set

3122
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:53,279
right. I use two ticks. I have this set
 

3123
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,870
right. I use two ticks. I have this set
to tick, but if you're using rows set to

3124
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:54,880
to tick, but if you're using rows set to
 

3125
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,270
to tick, but if you're using rows set to
a,000, I use two ticks and I just set it

3126
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:57,280
a,000, I use two ticks and I just set it
 

3127
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,030
a,000, I use two ticks and I just set it
to 20% width. That's it. That's all I

3128
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
to 20% width. That's it. That's all I
 

3129
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,030
to 20% width. That's it. That's all I
do. That is all I do.

3130
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,040
do. That is all I do.
 

3131
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,030
do. That is all I do.
How do I mark out those value areas or

3132
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,040
How do I mark out those value areas or
 

3133
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,070
How do I mark out those value areas or
gaps? Uh the gap was literally go to the

3134
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,080
gaps? Uh the gap was literally go to the
 

3135
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,070
gaps? Uh the gap was literally go to the
daily, right? Can you see this on the

3136
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
daily, right? Can you see this on the
 

3137
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,950
daily, right? Can you see this on the
daily? We we were inefficient here. So

3138
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:12,960
daily? We we were inefficient here. So
 

3139
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,950
daily? We we were inefficient here. So
we gapped up this day from no from

3140
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:14,960
we gapped up this day from no from
 

3141
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,630
we gapped up this day from no from
Friday that there was a weekly gap up

3142
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:16,640
Friday that there was a weekly gap up
 

3143
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,950
Friday that there was a weekly gap up
from Friday to Monday. We gapped up. We

3144
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:18,960
from Friday to Monday. We gapped up. We
 

3145
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,390
from Friday to Monday. We gapped up. We
never filled that gap, right? This gap

3146
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
never filled that gap, right? This gap
 

3147
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,149
never filled that gap, right? This gap
was left open. We've now just been

3148
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:22,159
was left open. We've now just been
 

3149
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,830
was left open. We've now just been
efficient and filled it right to the

3150
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:23,840
efficient and filled it right to the
 

3151
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,830
efficient and filled it right to the
tick. We just filled it, right? So it's

3152
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:25,840
tick. We just filled it, right? So it's
 

3153
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,110
tick. We just filled it, right? So it's
just the market being efficient.

3154
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:29,120
just the market being efficient.
 

3155
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,110
just the market being efficient.
So if we think about the the gaps the

3156
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:31,120
So if we think about the the gaps the
 

3157
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,630
So if we think about the the gaps the
same way as any form of imbalance,

3158
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:32,640
same way as any form of imbalance,
 

3159
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,990
same way as any form of imbalance,
right? At some point there want to be.

3160
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,000
right? At some point there want to be.
 

3161
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,270
right? At some point there want to be.
Why have we got a gap there? That

3162
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,280
Why have we got a gap there? That
 

3163
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,270
Why have we got a gap there? That
doesn't exist. That's just in Trading

3164
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:37,280
doesn't exist. That's just in Trading
 

3165
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,229
doesn't exist. That's just in Trading

again
is the anchored volume profile

3170
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:45,440
is the anchored volume profile
 

3171
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,270
is the anchored volume profile
on trading view. Yeah, it's a tool guys.

3172
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:47,280
on trading view. Yeah, it's a tool guys.
 

3173
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,870
on trading view. Yeah, it's a tool guys.
So, it's not an indicator. We go about

3174
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:48,880
So, it's not an indicator. We go about
 

3175
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,350
So, it's not an indicator. We go about
this so many days, right? Forecasting.

01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,669

You should remix a version of should I

3192
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:09,679
You should remix a version of should I
 

3193
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,149
You should remix a version of should I
say or should I go with trading lyrics?

What What should we change the lyrics

3196
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:13,440
What What should we change the lyrics
 

3197
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,149
What What should we change the lyrics
to? JD, we're do Let's do it in AI. What

3198
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:16,159
to? JD, we're do Let's do it in AI. What
 

3199
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,870
to? JD, we're do Let's do it in AI. What
should we change the lyrics to? Should I

3200
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:18,880
should we change the lyrics to? Should I
 

3201
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:25,990
should we change the lyrics to? Should I
long or should I short?

3202
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000

 

3203
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,070

Okay. So, we got imbalances now that

3204
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,080
Okay. So, we got imbalances now that
 

3205
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,750
Okay. So, we got imbalances now that
we've left from from this upside.

3206
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:31,760
we've left from from this upside.
 

3207
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,669
we've left from from this upside.
All right. So, we watch this. If buyers

3208
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:33,679
All right. So, we watch this. If buyers
 

3209
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,070
All right. So, we watch this. If buyers
step back in here, we can form a higher

3210
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:36,080
step back in here, we can form a higher
 

3211
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,229
step back in here, we can form a higher
low. All right, if buyers step back in

3212
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:38,239
low. All right, if buyers step back in
 

3213
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,590
low. All right, if buyers step back in
here, we can form an high low and a

3214
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:39,600
here, we can form an high low and a
 

3215
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,189
here, we can form an high low and a
reclaim of that can be a squeeze. If

3216
01:11:41,189 --> 01:11:41,199
reclaim of that can be a squeeze. If
 

3217
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,149
reclaim of that can be a squeeze. If
they trade straight through this and

3218
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:42,159
they trade straight through this and
 

3219
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:56,310
they trade straight through this and
we're going to get more downside,

3220
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320

 

3221
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,750

you have a course for sale, but do you

3222
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:57,760
you have a course for sale, but do you
 

3223
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,030
you have a course for sale, but do you
have any monthly memberships for

3224
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,040
have any monthly memberships for
 

3225
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,950
have any monthly memberships for
Discord? No, I don't do any monthly

3226
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
Discord? No, I don't do any monthly
 

3227
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,870
Discord? No, I don't do any monthly
fees. Okay, so everything's included in

3228
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
fees. Okay, so everything's included in
 

3229
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,310
fees. Okay, so everything's included in
the course. So if you do the 20our

3230
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:04,320
the course. So if you do the 20our
 

3231
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,709
the course. So if you do the 20our
course, all right, then Discord comes

3232
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
course, all right, then Discord comes
 

3233
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,310
course, all right, then Discord comes
for free with it. If you do the beginner

3234
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:08,320
for free with it. If you do the beginner
 

3235
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,910
for free with it. If you do the beginner
to advanced course, it has Discord in

3236
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:09,920
to advanced course, it has Discord in
 

3237
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,430
to advanced course, it has Discord in
it. There's no monthly fees, guys. It's

3238
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:11,440
it. There's no monthly fees, guys. It's
 

3239
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,229
it. There's no monthly fees, guys. It's
just a straight up you get it as part of

3240
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:14,239
just a straight up you get it as part of
 

3241
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:18,310
just a straight up you get it as part of
it.

3242
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:18,320

 

3243
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:25,990

No, still NQ. Still NQ.

3244
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,000

 

3245
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,750

How do I trade like you on trading on

3246
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:27,760
How do I trade like you on trading on
 

3247
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,030
How do I trade like you on trading on
Robin Hood? Well, Robin Hood shouldn't

3248
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
Robin Hood? Well, Robin Hood shouldn't
 

3249
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,470
Robin Hood? Well, Robin Hood shouldn't
make a difference how you trade. Uh,

3250
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
make a difference how you trade. Uh,
 

3251
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,550
make a difference how you trade. Uh,
I've never traded on Robin Hood. Do they

3252
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
I've never traded on Robin Hood. Do they
 

3253
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,950
I've never traded on Robin Hood. Do they
have like a um sort of professional

3254
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
have like a um sort of professional
 

3255
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,550
have like a um sort of professional
platform? Do you have tools on Robin

3256
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,560
platform? Do you have tools on Robin
 

3257
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,709
platform? Do you have tools on Robin
Hood? I I don't know if you do or can

3258
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:38,719
Hood? I I don't know if you do or can
 

3259
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,550
Hood? I I don't know if you do or can
you link it to Trading View if not?

3260
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,560
you link it to Trading View if not?
 

3261
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,830
you link it to Trading View if not?
Okay, so we're coming down towards these

3262
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
Okay, so we're coming down towards these
 

3263
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,350
Okay, so we're coming down towards these
imbalances. Imbalances are 80, 71, and

3264
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
imbalances. Imbalances are 80, 71, and
 

3265
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,430
imbalances. Imbalances are 80, 71, and
64. Like I said, if they put in a a

3266
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:49,440
64. Like I said, if they put in a a
 

3267
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,430
64. Like I said, if they put in a a
higher low here and start to reclaim

3268
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:51,440
higher low here and start to reclaim
 

3269
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,030
higher low here and start to reclaim
there is a bigger squeeze up for a

3270
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:53,040
there is a bigger squeeze up for a
 

3271
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,550
there is a bigger squeeze up for a
repric. If they just flush through all

3272
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:54,560
repric. If they just flush through all
 

3273
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,390
repric. If they just flush through all
of this, it would be night night. They

3274
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
of this, it would be night night. They
 

3275
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,910
of this, it would be night night. They
are trying to put in a higher low. They

3276
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:57,920
are trying to put in a higher low. They
 

3277
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,189
are trying to put in a higher low. They
haven't actually filled in any of those

3278
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
haven't actually filled in any of those
 

3279
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,189
haven't actually filled in any of those
imbalances yet. They're trying to put in

3280
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
imbalances yet. They're trying to put in
 

3281
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,110
imbalances yet. They're trying to put in
a higher low here for a move back up at

3282
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
a higher low here for a move back up at
 

3283
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,430
a higher low here for a move back up at
the moment

3284
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440

 

3285
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,790

and they're going to look for this. So,

3286
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:08,800
and they're going to look for this. So,
 

3287
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,189
and they're going to look for this. So,
I'm actually very very tempted to

3288
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199
I'm actually very very tempted to
 

3289
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,709
I'm actually very very tempted to
consider this long, but I will actually

3290
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
consider this long, but I will actually
 

3291
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,790
consider this long, but I will actually
want to see us either dip a bit lower or

3292
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
want to see us either dip a bit lower or
 

3293
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,470
want to see us either dip a bit lower or
rip a bit higher in base. I don't really

3294
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:16,480
rip a bit higher in base. I don't really
 

3295
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,990
rip a bit higher in base. I don't really
want to trade around here. The

3296
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,000
want to trade around here. The
 

3297
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,910
want to trade around here. The
imbalances are a little bit lower, so I

3298
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:19,920
imbalances are a little bit lower, so I
 

3299
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,030
imbalances are a little bit lower, so I
just want to see if we're going to fill

3300
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,040
just want to see if we're going to fill
 

3301
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,750
just want to see if we're going to fill
any of these out first.

3302
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:23,760
any of these out first.
 

3303
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,149
any of these out first.
Maybe they come down for it. So, if we

3304
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:26,159
Maybe they come down for it. So, if we
 

3305
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:29,270
Maybe they come down for it. So, if we
trade down to sort of 80s and below and

3306
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:29,280
trade down to sort of 80s and below and
 

3307
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,950
trade down to sort of 80s and below and
hold and then pivot back above 50s or

3308
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:32,960
hold and then pivot back above 50s or
 

3309
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,110
hold and then pivot back above 50s or
definitely 70s, I'll consider the long

3310
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
definitely 70s, I'll consider the long
 

3311
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,950
definitely 70s, I'll consider the long
on a rotation. It's my least favorite

3312
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:36,960
on a rotation. It's my least favorite
 

3313
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,669
on a rotation. It's my least favorite
trade. We all know Alex hates that

3314
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:39,679
trade. We all know Alex hates that
 

3315
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,030
trade. We all know Alex hates that
trade. But if we do something like this,

3316
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
trade. But if we do something like this,
 

3317
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,110
trade. But if we do something like this,
I will consider this play here. Right

3318
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
I will consider this play here. Right
 

3319
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,910
I will consider this play here. Right
from here, if we hold this, they are

3320
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:47,920
from here, if we hold this, they are
 

3321
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,430
from here, if we hold this, they are
starting to base here. They haven't

3322
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:49,440
starting to base here. They haven't
 

3323
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,030
starting to base here. They haven't
filled the imbalances though, which is

3324
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:51,040
filled the imbalances though, which is
 

3325
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,430
filled the imbalances though, which is
annoying me a little bit. But they are

3326
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,440
annoying me a little bit. But they are
 

3327
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,590
annoying me a little bit. But they are
trying to put in the higher low. This

3328
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600
trying to put in the higher low. This
 

3329
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,790
trying to put in the higher low. This
can be possible here. They're starting

3330
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:56,800
can be possible here. They're starting
 

3331
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,790
can be possible here. They're starting
to do it. Oh, you dirty buggers. Trying

3332
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
to do it. Oh, you dirty buggers. Trying
 

3333
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,070
to do it. Oh, you dirty buggers. Trying
to do it without me.

3334
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:02,080
to do it without me.
 

3335
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:08,310
to do it without me.
Trying to do it without me.

3336
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:08,320

 

3337
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,830

So, the gap that just filled is no

3338
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:09,840
So, the gap that just filled is no
 

3339
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,830
So, the gap that just filled is no
longer valid as a key area. I mean, it's

3340
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:11,840
longer valid as a key area. I mean, it's
 

3341
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,669
longer valid as a key area. I mean, it's
still a key area, right? Or we we're

3342
01:14:13,669 --> 01:14:13,679
still a key area, right? Or we we're
 

3343
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,390
still a key area, right? Or we we're
still in it. We are still in it.

3344
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
still in it. We are still in it.
 

3345
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,310
still in it. We are still in it.
um you know we can trade below if they

3346
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
um you know we can trade below if they
 

3347
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,270
um you know we can trade below if they
if they lose the gap. Let me show you.

3348
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:21,280
if they lose the gap. Let me show you.
 

3349
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,550
if they lose the gap. Let me show you.
Let me get you onto an hourly chart

3350
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:22,560
Let me get you onto an hourly chart
 

3351
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,070
Let me get you onto an hourly chart
because it's hard for me to explain all

3352
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
because it's hard for me to explain all
 

3353
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,750
because it's hard for me to explain all
this otherwise. Right, you've got two

3354
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:25,760
this otherwise. Right, you've got two
 

3355
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,590
this otherwise. Right, you've got two
things happening here in this hourly

3356
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
things happening here in this hourly
 

3357
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,229
things happening here in this hourly
chart. If we zoom left,

3358
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:30,239
chart. If we zoom left,
 

3359
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,149
chart. If we zoom left,
remember all the way back to here. All

3360
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:32,159
remember all the way back to here. All
 

3361
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,470
remember all the way back to here. All
right, this was a pivot right here

3362
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
right, this was a pivot right here
 

3363
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,350
right, this was a pivot right here
Monday the 24th. The gap was down into

3364
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:37,360
Monday the 24th. The gap was down into
 

3365
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,030
Monday the 24th. The gap was down into
this low which we just tapped. If we

3366
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
this low which we just tapped. If we
 

3367
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,110
this low which we just tapped. If we
lose that gap, right, we're going to

3368
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:41,120
lose that gap, right, we're going to
 

3369
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,110
lose that gap, right, we're going to
come into this area which was a big

3370
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,120
come into this area which was a big
 

3371
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,950
come into this area which was a big
section that we bid off. Now if we think

3372
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,960
section that we bid off. Now if we think
 

3373
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,550
section that we bid off. Now if we think
about what happened here, why was it so

3374
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
about what happened here, why was it so
 

3375
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,390
about what happened here, why was it so
important? We went into a major sell and

3376
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:50,400
important? We went into a major sell and
 

3377
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,790
important? We went into a major sell and
big big institutional buyers down here

3378
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:52,800
big big institutional buyers down here
 

3379
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,950
big big institutional buyers down here
said no. And this was the start of a

3380
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:54,960
said no. And this was the start of a
 

3381
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,830
said no. And this was the start of a
huge drive up. So we are here. We can

3382
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:57,840
huge drive up. So we are here. We can
 

3383
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,550
huge drive up. So we are here. We can
maybe come into here. We probably don't

3384
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:00,560
maybe come into here. We probably don't
 

3385
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,950
maybe come into here. We probably don't
expect this in one go. Not in one

3386
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:02,960
expect this in one go. Not in one
 

3387
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,790
expect this in one go. Not in one
session. It's possible. Like I said,

3388
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
session. It's possible. Like I said,
 

3389
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,229
session. It's possible. Like I said,
anything is possible if they go full

3390
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:06,239
anything is possible if they go full
 

3391
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,390
anything is possible if they go full
risk off. But we're into a big area.

3392
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:08,400
risk off. But we're into a big area.
 

3393
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,950
risk off. But we're into a big area.
This is also like this contract sort of

3394
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
This is also like this contract sort of
 

3395
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,030
This is also like this contract sort of
started here. We're starting to go

3396
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:13,040
started here. We're starting to go
 

3397
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,709
started here. We're starting to go
beyond this contract, right? We're

3398
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719
beyond this contract, right? We're
 

3399
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,310
beyond this contract, right? We're
starting to go back on the contracts.

3400
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
starting to go back on the contracts.
 

3401
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,070
starting to go back on the contracts.
What's the old contract? We're on an H.

3402
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,080
What's the old contract? We're on an H.
 

3403
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,070
What's the old contract? We're on an H.
Was it an M contract? My brain can't

3404
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:20,080
Was it an M contract? My brain can't
 

3405
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,790
Was it an M contract? My brain can't
think. Right. So, I don't think we're

3406
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:22,800
think. Right. So, I don't think we're
 

3407
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,790
think. Right. So, I don't think we're
going to come below here in one session.

3408
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800
going to come below here in one session.
 

3409
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,310
going to come below here in one session.
I think we will eventually come below

3410
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
I think we will eventually come below
 

3411
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,870
I think we will eventually come below
here. Right. But, we have to be aware of

3412
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
here. Right. But, we have to be aware of
 

3413
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,189
here. Right. But, we have to be aware of
that. We're probably going to see some

3414
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
that. We're probably going to see some
 

3415
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,510
that. We're probably going to see some
reaction down here at some point. Think

3416
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
reaction down here at some point. Think
 

3417
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,030
reaction down here at some point. Think
about how heavy we've got, right? We're

3418
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:37,040
about how heavy we've got, right? We're
 

3419
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,110
about how heavy we've got, right? We're
probably unlikely to see this go

3420
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,120
probably unlikely to see this go
 

3421
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,910
probably unlikely to see this go
straight down, right? And just keep

3422
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:41,920
straight down, right? And just keep
 

3423
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,709
straight down, right? And just keep
puking. What we're more likely to see is

3424
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:44,719
puking. What we're more likely to see is
 

3425
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,510
puking. What we're more likely to see is
probably something like this and then a

3426
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:47,520
probably something like this and then a
 

3427
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,430
probably something like this and then a
pull back in and liquidity being built

3428
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
pull back in and liquidity being built
 

3429
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,750
pull back in and liquidity being built
out here for a session or two, right?

3430
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:51,760
out here for a session or two, right?
 

3431
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,750
out here for a session or two, right?
And maybe one more trap next week and

3432
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:53,760
And maybe one more trap next week and
 

3433
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,669
And maybe one more trap next week and
then that maybe. And then if we get that

3434
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
then that maybe. And then if we get that
 

3435
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:56,870
then that maybe. And then if we get that
move, what are we going to look for?

3436
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:56,880
move, what are we going to look for?
 

3437
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,030
move, what are we going to look for?
Like we've talked about on the dailies

3438
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
Like we've talked about on the dailies
 

3439
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,790
Like we've talked about on the dailies
the last few days, right? If we we're

3440
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:02,800
the last few days, right? If we we're
 

3441
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,550
the last few days, right? If we we're
going to get that catch-up trade. the

3442
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
going to get that catch-up trade. the
 

3443
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,870
going to get that catch-up trade. the
undercut and the 200 day are starting to

3444
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
undercut and the 200 day are starting to
 

3445
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,189
undercut and the 200 day are starting to
match up really really well. This area

3446
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:09,199
match up really really well. This area
 

3447
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,830
match up really really well. This area
will be such a big cover point uh for

3448
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:11,840
will be such a big cover point uh for
 

3449
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,270
will be such a big cover point uh for
anyone that got short. So all the

3450
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:13,280
anyone that got short. So all the
 

3451
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,390
anyone that got short. So all the
institutions who took this gap fill here

3452
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,400
institutions who took this gap fill here
 

3453
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,350
institutions who took this gap fill here
failed break above right this is your if

3454
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:19,360
failed break above right this is your if
 

3455
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,270
failed break above right this is your if
you think about woff there's your spring

3456
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:21,280
you think about woff there's your spring
 

3457
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,870
you think about woff there's your spring
failed breakout there's your sign of

3458
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:22,880
failed breakout there's your sign of
 

3459
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,270
failed breakout there's your sign of
strength there's the continuation this

3460
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:25,280
strength there's the continuation this
 

3461
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,430
strength there's the continuation this
is to the other side this would be a big

3462
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:27,440
is to the other side this would be a big
 

3463
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,990
is to the other side this would be a big
cover point now if they let go of this

3464
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:30,000
cover point now if they let go of this
 

3465
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,990
cover point now if they let go of this
oh my gosh it's going to get dangerous

3466
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:32,000
oh my gosh it's going to get dangerous
 

3467
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,870
oh my gosh it's going to get dangerous
right we have a node down here into 24k

3468
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:34,880
right we have a node down here into 24k
 

3469
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,430
right we have a node down here into 24k
they will not want to lose that too

3470
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,440
they will not want to lose that too
 

3471
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,350
they will not want to lose that too
quickly all right I would expect a bid

3472
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,360
quickly all right I would expect a bid
 

3473
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,510
quickly all right I would expect a bid
to start developing somewhere down here

3474
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
to start developing somewhere down here
 

3475
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,590
to start developing somewhere down here
for a back test up here, right? Think

3476
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:43,600
for a back test up here, right? Think
 

3477
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,750
for a back test up here, right? Think
about we're leaving this. We will expect

3478
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
about we're leaving this. We will expect
 

3479
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,270
about we're leaving this. We will expect
to bid somewhere down here for a back

3480
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:47,280
to bid somewhere down here for a back
 

3481
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,189
to bid somewhere down here for a back
test there. If they reclaim it, uber

3482
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:49,199
test there. If they reclaim it, uber
 

3483
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,470
test there. If they reclaim it, uber
bullish all the way back up. If they

3484
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:50,480
bullish all the way back up. If they
 

3485
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,470
bullish all the way back up. If they
reject this, then we can think about a

3486
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:52,480
reject this, then we can think about a
 

3487
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,550
reject this, then we can think about a
big bare market back down into some of

3488
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:54,560
big bare market back down into some of
 

3489
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,950
big bare market back down into some of
these tariff areas. Can't rule it out,

3490
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:56,960
these tariff areas. Can't rule it out,
 

3491
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,390
these tariff areas. Can't rule it out,
guys. I'm not willing to rule anything

3492
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,400
guys. I'm not willing to rule anything
 

3493
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,630
guys. I'm not willing to rule anything
out. I can only trade what's on the

3494
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:00,640
out. I can only trade what's on the
 

3495
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,830
out. I can only trade what's on the
chart. Both of those things are

3496
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:01,840
chart. Both of those things are
 

3497
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:08,149
chart. Both of those things are
possible,

3498
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159

 

3499
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,510

right? They're trying to do this higher

3500
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:09,520
right? They're trying to do this higher
 

3501
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,350
right? They're trying to do this higher
low right now. talked about they keep

3502
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,360
low right now. talked about they keep
 

3503
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,550
low right now. talked about they keep
getting stuck in this block. You can see

3504
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
getting stuck in this block. You can see
 

3505
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,030
getting stuck in this block. You can see
this gray box that I marked out was very

3506
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:15,040
this gray box that I marked out was very
 

3507
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:20,630
this gray box that I marked out was very
very key

3508
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640

 

3509
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,310

for entering trades. Do I use market or

3510
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:22,320
for entering trades. Do I use market or
 

3511
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,310
for entering trades. Do I use market or
limits? Where possible? I will use limit

3512
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
limits? Where possible? I will use limit
 

3513
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,790
limits? Where possible? I will use limit
orders. But uh you kind of need trend to

3514
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:26,800
orders. But uh you kind of need trend to
 

3515
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,390
orders. But uh you kind of need trend to
be going on your side for a limit order.

3516
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,400
be going on your side for a limit order.
 

3517
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,630
be going on your side for a limit order.
All right. So like if I'm when I was

3518
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,640
All right. So like if I'm when I was
 

3519
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,709
All right. So like if I'm when I was
here, I was able to use a limit order,

3520
01:17:32,709 --> 01:17:32,719
here, I was able to use a limit order,
 

3521
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,030
here, I was able to use a limit order,
right? But actually here today, I didn't

3522
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
right? But actually here today, I didn't
 

3523
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,790
right? But actually here today, I didn't
use limit order. I used a market because

3524
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
use limit order. I used a market because
 

3525
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,070
use limit order. I used a market because
the trap came and I was like, well, I

3526
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:38,080
the trap came and I was like, well, I
 

3527
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,669
the trap came and I was like, well, I
need to get in now before that happens.

3528
01:17:39,669 --> 01:17:39,679
need to get in now before that happens.
 

3529
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,030
need to get in now before that happens.
All right. That's right. It's not a

3530
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
All right. That's right. It's not a
 

3531
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,950
All right. That's right. It's not a
chase for me. It's just like I need to

3532
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:42,960
chase for me. It's just like I need to
 

3533
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,030
chase for me. It's just like I need to
get in now and if I lose a tick or two,

3534
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
get in now and if I lose a tick or two,
 

3535
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,709
get in now and if I lose a tick or two,
I don't care because I'm have that much

3536
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
I don't care because I'm have that much
 

3537
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,270
I don't care because I'm have that much
conviction. What I will not do is if

3538
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:49,280
conviction. What I will not do is if
 

3539
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,510
conviction. What I will not do is if
we're moving away, try and market in

3540
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:51,520
we're moving away, try and market in
 

3541
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,189
we're moving away, try and market in
down here. All right? So, it's limit

3542
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
down here. All right? So, it's limit
 

3543
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,110
down here. All right? So, it's limit
where possible. But if I miss it by a

3544
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:55,120
where possible. But if I miss it by a
 

3545
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,790
where possible. But if I miss it by a
tick or two and it's moving fast, I

3546
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:56,800
tick or two and it's moving fast, I
 

3547
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,709
tick or two and it's moving fast, I
don't mind marketing. As long as I'm

3548
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
don't mind marketing. As long as I'm
 

3549
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:00,870
don't mind marketing. As long as I'm
buying still in discount or I'm selling

3550
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:00,880
buying still in discount or I'm selling
 

3551
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,430
buying still in discount or I'm selling
that market in premium, it's okay. But

3552
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:03,440
that market in premium, it's okay. But
 

3553
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,189
that market in premium, it's okay. But
where possible, I always limit. And I

3554
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:05,199
where possible, I always limit. And I
 

3555
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:06,709
where possible, I always limit. And I
try and cover with my limits. That's why

3556
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:06,719
try and cover with my limits. That's why
 

3557
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,870
try and cover with my limits. That's why
I put limits out for my cover positions

3558
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:08,880
I put limits out for my cover positions
 

3559
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,189
I put limits out for my cover positions
or my partial positions all the time. If

3560
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:11,199
or my partial positions all the time. If
 

3561
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,110
or my partial positions all the time. If
I miss it by a tick, I just drag it down

3562
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:13,120
I miss it by a tick, I just drag it down
 

3563
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,790
I miss it by a tick, I just drag it down
and fill it. All right, now we're into

3564
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:14,800
and fill it. All right, now we're into
 

3565
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,990
and fill it. All right, now we're into
those imbalances. So 77s is one. Then

3566
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000
those imbalances. So 77s is one. Then
 

3567
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,590
those imbalances. So 77s is one. Then
there's one at 61 and there's another

3568
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:19,600
there's one at 61 and there's another
 

3569
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,910
there's one at 61 and there's another
one at 53. They will need to hold this

3570
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:21,920
one at 53. They will need to hold this
 

3571
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,669
one at 53. They will need to hold this
and then pivot back up. Otherwise, we

3572
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:23,679
and then pivot back up. Otherwise, we
 

3573
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,189
and then pivot back up. Otherwise, we
will break down and we go for new lows.

3574
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:25,199
will break down and we go for new lows.
 

3575
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,270
will break down and we go for new lows.
So like I said, we haven't seen they

3576
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:27,280
So like I said, we haven't seen they
 

3577
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,950
So like I said, we haven't seen they
will need to hold this, pivot back above

3578
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:28,960
will need to hold this, pivot back above
 

3579
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,709
will need to hold this, pivot back above
all this for me to be interested in the

3580
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:30,719
all this for me to be interested in the
 

3581
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,110
all this for me to be interested in the
long. Not going to bid down here. I need

3582
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,120
long. Not going to bid down here. I need
 

3583
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,630
long. Not going to bid down here. I need
to see them do something like this for

3584
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:34,640
to see them do something like this for
 

3585
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,910
to see them do something like this for
me to be any interest at all. But we

3586
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:37,920
me to be any interest at all. But we
 

3587
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,750
me to be any interest at all. But we
have just started to fill some of these

3588
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
have just started to fill some of these
 

3589
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,270
have just started to fill some of these
imbalances

3590
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280
imbalances
 

3591
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,110
imbalances
right down into here. We talked about

3592
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:43,120
right down into here. We talked about
 

3593
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,790
right down into here. We talked about
these imbalances all the way down here.

3594
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
these imbalances all the way down here.
 

3595
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,870
these imbalances all the way down here.
They will need to now pivot above all of

3596
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:46,880
They will need to now pivot above all of
 

3597
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,229
They will need to now pivot above all of
this and then maybe I'm interested.

3598
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:50,239
this and then maybe I'm interested.
 

3599
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,990
this and then maybe I'm interested.
Maybe it will be a counter trend trade,

3600
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,000
Maybe it will be a counter trend trade,
 

3601
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,630
Maybe it will be a counter trend trade,
but it will be I'd have to reclaim uh

3602
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:54,640
but it will be I'd have to reclaim uh
 

3603
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,709
but it will be I'd have to reclaim uh
value and think about a rotation. It

3604
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
value and think about a rotation. It
 

3605
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:58,870
value and think about a rotation. It
would need to confirm to me the only way

3606
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:58,880
would need to confirm to me the only way
 

3607
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,390
would need to confirm to me the only way
I'm trading this right is basically if

3608
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
I'm trading this right is basically if
 

3609
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,110
I'm trading this right is basically if
this is a failed breakout and we come

3610
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
this is a failed breakout and we come
 

3611
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,030
this is a failed breakout and we come
back inside value and I think we can

3612
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:05,040
back inside value and I think we can
 

3613
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,790
back inside value and I think we can
trade value for the day if I think we're

3614
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:06,800
trade value for the day if I think we're
 

3615
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,310
trade value for the day if I think we're
going to do a rotation in here for the

3616
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:08,320
going to do a rotation in here for the
 

3617
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,070
going to do a rotation in here for the
day. If we're going to stay aggressive

3618
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:10,080
day. If we're going to stay aggressive
 

3619
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,830
day. If we're going to stay aggressive
obviously I'm not going to bid, right?

3620
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:11,840
obviously I'm not going to bid, right?
 

3621
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,590
obviously I'm not going to bid, right?
I'm not going to bid. I'm also not going

3622
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
I'm not going to bid. I'm also not going
 

3623
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,110
I'm not going to bid. I'm also not going
to sell here. It's very hard for me to

3624
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,120
to sell here. It's very hard for me to
 

3625
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,630
to sell here. It's very hard for me to
sell here now when I have the best sell

3626
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:16,640
sell here now when I have the best sell
 

3627
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,750
sell here now when I have the best sell
position for the day. Very hard. Sulky

Do I trade London? No, I don't. Um, I

3632
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:26,000
Do I trade London? No, I don't. Um, I
 

3633

live in I live in Los Angeles, so I am

3634

live in I live in Los Angeles, so I am
 

3635
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,870
live in I live in Los Angeles, so I am
asleep during London.

3636
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
asleep during London.
 

3637
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,990
asleep during London.
I'm asleep during London.

3638
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,000
I'm asleep during London.
 

3639
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,149
I'm asleep during London.
What volume profile is it? It is I need

3640
01:19:36,149 --> 01:19:36,159
What volume profile is it? It is I need
 

3641
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,550
What volume profile is it? It is I need
to do a sheet for you guys, don't I? It

3642
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
to do a sheet for you guys, don't I? It
 

3643
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,709
to do a sheet for you guys, don't I? It
is an anchored volume profile based on

3644
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:40,719
is an anchored volume profile based on
 

3645
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,149
is an anchored volume profile based on
the New York session. So, anchored to

3646
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
the New York session. So, anchored to
 

3647
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,350
the New York session. So, anchored to
9:30. So, they just filled that

3648
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
9:30. So, they just filled that
 

3649
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,590
9:30. So, they just filled that
imbalance like we talked about and we

3650
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:45,600
imbalance like we talked about and we
 

3651
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,950
imbalance like we talked about and we
are starting to catch a bid. All right,

3652
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:46,960
are starting to catch a bid. All right,
 

3653
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,270
are starting to catch a bid. All right,
if I show you here, right, we just

3654
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:49,280
if I show you here, right, we just
 

3655
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,430
if I show you here, right, we just
filled this imbalance on this long wick.

3656
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:51,440
filled this imbalance on this long wick.
 

3657
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,590
filled this imbalance on this long wick.
We left the one tiny piece left and

3658
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:53,600
We left the one tiny piece left and
 

3659
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,709
We left the one tiny piece left and
they're starting to catch a bid. Now, if

3660
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:54,719
they're starting to catch a bid. Now, if
 

3661
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,270
they're starting to catch a bid. Now, if
they can pivot above, then maybe it's

3662
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,280
they can pivot above, then maybe it's
 

3663
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,590
they can pivot above, then maybe it's
got a shot, right? Maybe it's got a

3664
01:19:59,590 --> 01:19:59,600
got a shot, right? Maybe it's got a
 

3665
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,270
got a shot, right? Maybe it's got a
shot. I will not be long down here. It

3666
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:01,280
shot. I will not be long down here. It
 

3667
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,709
shot. I will not be long down here. It
will need to prove to me with higher

3668
01:20:02,709 --> 01:20:02,719
will need to prove to me with higher
 

3669
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,310
will need to prove to me with higher
lows, right? I'm not going to go fishing

3670
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:04,320
lows, right? I'm not going to go fishing
 

3671
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,990
lows, right? I'm not going to go fishing
today in a bare market. It would need to

3672
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,000
today in a bare market. It would need to
 

3673
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,870
today in a bare market. It would need to
prove to me with higher lows.

3674
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
prove to me with higher lows.
 

3675
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,550
prove to me with higher lows.
What's the cost of the course? Uh, it

3676
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
What's the cost of the course? Uh, it
 

3677
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,630
What's the cost of the course? Uh, it
should be 699. If he hasn't changed it,

3678
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:12,640
should be 699. If he hasn't changed it,
 

3679
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,390
should be 699. If he hasn't changed it,
I'm going to get very upset. I've been

3680
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:14,400
I'm going to get very upset. I've been

Blow Zone Trader, but if not, it's going

3684
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:18,560
Blow Zone Trader, but if not, it's going
 

3685
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,870
Blow Zone Trader, but if not, it's going
to be 649 until I shout at my uh

3686
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:22,880
to be 649 until I shout at my uh
 

3687
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,229
to be 649 until I shout at my uh
web developer. It's still $649.

3688
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:26,239
web developer. It's still $649.
 

3689
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,830
web developer. It's still $649.
God damn it. Okay, it's $649 right now

3690
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:29,840
God damn it. Okay, it's $649 right now
 

3691
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,070
God damn it. Okay, it's $649 right now
for the 20our course and it's $399 for

3692
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,080
for the 20our course and it's $399 for
 

3693
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,910
for the 20our course and it's $399 for
the um orderflow course and if you get a

3694
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:37,920
the um orderflow course and if you get a
 

3695
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,470
the um orderflow course and if you get a
bundle, I think you get $100 off

3696
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:40,480
bundle, I think you get $100 off
 

3697
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:50,149
bundle, I think you get $100 off
together.

3698
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:50,159

 

3699
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,310

Trappy PA, we're just building out now.

3700
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:52,320
Trappy PA, we're just building out now.
 

3701
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,709
Trappy PA, we're just building out now.
We're building out now.

3702
01:20:54,709 --> 01:20:54,719
We're building out now.
 

3703
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,070
We're building out now.
Probably think about spy into uh 800s.

3704
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
Probably think about spy into uh 800s.
 

3705
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,310
Probably think about spy into uh 800s.
And we can probably think about a spy.

3706
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,320
And we can probably think about a spy.
 

3707
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,430
And we can probably think about a spy.
Probably think about spy into 75s.

3708
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:03,440
Probably think about spy into 75s.
 

3709
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,430
Probably think about spy into 75s.
Uh has anyone got gamma up? I would

3710
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:05,440
Uh has anyone got gamma up? I would
 

3711
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,550
Uh has anyone got gamma up? I would
imagine 75 is going to be massive. Uh

3712
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:08,560
imagine 75 is going to be massive. Uh
 

3713
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,550
imagine 75 is going to be massive. Uh
just cuz it's a whole number. They love

3714
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,560
just cuz it's a whole number. They love
 

3715
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,189
just cuz it's a whole number. They love
stuff like that. Um we have an old pivot

3716
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
stuff like that. Um we have an old pivot
 

3717
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,990
stuff like that. Um we have an old pivot
down there right into 75. So if we look

3718
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
down there right into 75. So if we look
 

3719
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,270
down there right into 75. So if we look
at 16th of December and 18th of December

3720
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
at 16th of December and 18th of December
 

3721
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,510
at 16th of December and 18th of December
and if we look at the high of the 25th

3722
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:21,520
and if we look at the high of the 25th
 

3723
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,070
and if we look at the high of the 25th
of November and the 20th of November and

3724
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:24,080
of November and the 20th of November and
 

3725
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,709
of November and the 20th of November and
the 14th of November, I'm going to guess

3726
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:26,719
the 14th of November, I'm going to guess
 

3727
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,430
the 14th of November, I'm going to guess
uh 675 on SPY is a big level. I'm going

3728
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:29,440
uh 675 on SPY is a big level. I'm going
 

3729
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:33,110
uh 675 on SPY is a big level. I'm going
to have a guess. I would imagine it's a

3730
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:33,120
to have a guess. I would imagine it's a
 

3731
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,310
to have a guess. I would imagine it's a
big level. All right, initial balance

3732
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:34,320
big level. All right, initial balance
 

3733
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,630
big level. All right, initial balance
now set. All right, so here's the IB. So

3734
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:36,640
now set. All right, so here's the IB. So
 

3735
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,149
now set. All right, so here's the IB. So
those of you who like the IB trade, we

3736
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
those of you who like the IB trade, we
 

3737
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,750
those of you who like the IB trade, we
can think about the fail breakout of IB

3738
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:39,760
can think about the fail breakout of IB
 

3739
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,550
can think about the fail breakout of IB
or the hold of IB back to VWAP. All

3740
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:42,560
or the hold of IB back to VWAP. All
 

3741
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,750
or the hold of IB back to VWAP. All
right. If we're going to get a trend

3742
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:43,760
right. If we're going to get a trend
 

3743
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,990
right. If we're going to get a trend
day, we're going to need to reject IB.

3744
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,000
day, we're going to need to reject IB.
 

3745
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,910
day, we're going to need to reject IB.
Remember, we are down fairly

3746
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:47,920
Remember, we are down fairly
 

3747
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,229
Remember, we are down fairly
significantly on this session already

3748
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
significantly on this session already
 

3749
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:54,470
significantly on this session already
off the highs,

3750
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480

 

3751
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,189

right? It's a 420 point move. Okay. So,

3752
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:57,199
right? It's a 420 point move. Okay. So,
 

3753
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,870
right? It's a 420 point move. Okay. So,
if we start to bid above here, the move

3754
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
if we start to bid above here, the move
 

3755
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,629
if we start to bid above here, the move
back to VWAP is very probable, isn't it?

3756
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:00,639
back to VWAP is very probable, isn't it?
 

3757
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:01,750
back to VWAP is very probable, isn't it?
This is filling the imbalance. They're

3758
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,760
This is filling the imbalance. They're
 

3759
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,030
This is filling the imbalance. They're
trying to put in the higher low. If we

3760
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,040
trying to put in the higher low. If we
 

3761
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,629
trying to put in the higher low. If we
start to reclaim some of these areas,

3762
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:04,639
start to reclaim some of these areas,
 

3763
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,149
start to reclaim some of these areas,
it's possible that they squeeze back up

3764
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:06,159
it's possible that they squeeze back up
 

3765
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,229
it's possible that they squeeze back up
to the VWOPS. And they're going to have

3766
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:08,239
to the VWOPS. And they're going to have
 

3767
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,070
to the VWOPS. And they're going to have
to reclaim 660s. All right. And then

3768
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,080
to reclaim 660s. All right. And then
 

3769
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,390
to reclaim 660s. All right. And then
maybe I'm interested. Maybe I'm

3770
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,400
maybe I'm interested. Maybe I'm
 

3771
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:19,189
maybe I'm interested. Maybe I'm
interested if they can do that.

3772
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:19,199

 

3773
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,669

Do I see any bids on the 200 day? Uh,

3774
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
Do I see any bids on the 200 day? Uh,
 

3775
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,510
Do I see any bids on the 200 day? Uh,
let me just remind myself where that 200

3776
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:23,520
let me just remind myself where that 200
 

3777
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,229
let me just remind myself where that 200
day is.

3778
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:26,239
day is.
 

3779
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,390
day is.
24200.

3780
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:28,400
24200.
 

3781
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:34,629
24200.
Hang on a second.

3782
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639

 

3783
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,790

No, no one's down there yet. Too far

3784
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:36,800
No, no one's down there yet. Too far
 

3785
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,470
No, no one's down there yet. Too far
down.

3786
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:38,480
down.
 

3787
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:44,310
down.
Here's 24, right? 24200

3788
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:44,320

 

3789
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:49,110

3791
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:53,669
240. Yeah, no one's down there yet.
20 24500 is 132 lot, but uh there's no

3792
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:53,679
20 24500 is 132 lot, but uh there's no
 

3793
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:54,950
20 24500 is 132 lot, but uh there's no
one really under that. No, no one

3794
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960
one really under that. No, no one
 

3795

one really under that. No, no one
notable size yet. Not yet.

3796
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:00,880

 

3797
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,189

Okay. Right. So, I'll tell you now

3798
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
Okay. Right. So, I'll tell you now
 

3799
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,510
Okay. Right. So, I'll tell you now
sellers at 81 is where they keep getting

3800
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
sellers at 81 is where they keep getting
 

3801
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,390
sellers at 81 is where they keep getting
stuck. 81 and under. Um, and definitely

3802
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:08,400
stuck. 81 and under. Um, and definitely
 

3803
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,310
stuck. 81 and under. Um, and definitely
57 is basically that low of day auction.

3804
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:10,320
57 is basically that low of day auction.
 

3805
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,310
57 is basically that low of day auction.
I would like a bit more excess really

3806
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:12,320
I would like a bit more excess really
 

3807
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,110
I would like a bit more excess really
when I look at that. But I'm definitely

3808
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:15,120
when I look at that. But I'm definitely
 

3809
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,590
when I look at that. But I'm definitely
not going to long down here. We'll have

3810
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
not going to long down here. We'll have
 

3811
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,629
not going to long down here. We'll have
to pivot and hold.

3812
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:20,639
to pivot and hold.
 

3813
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:28,070
to pivot and hold.
It will have to pivot and hold.

3814
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080

 

3815
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,270

I was trying to catch up with what you

3816
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280
I was trying to catch up with what you
 

3817
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,390
I was trying to catch up with what you
guys are saying in chat. I've missed

3818
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:30,400
guys are saying in chat. I've missed
 

3819

can't work out how to do it on the live
 

3833
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:50,629
can't work out how to do it on the live

videos. I want to do it for you. Um,
 

3835
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,750

I cannot figure out how to do it when

01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:53,760
I cannot figure out how to do it when
 

3837
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,590
I cannot figure out how to do it when
we're live. I'm going to try and have a

3838
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:55,600
we're live. I'm going to try and have a
 

3839
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,149
we're live. I'm going to try and have a
look now.

3840
01:23:58,149 --> 01:23:58,159
look now.
 

3841
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:01,110
look now.
If anyone knows, let let me know. But I

can do it on videos that I post, but I
can't do it on the live videos at the

Yeah, I can't see a way to do it. I wish

3852
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:16,400
Yeah, I can't see a way to do it. I wish
 

3853
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,550
Yeah, I can't see a way to do it. I wish
I could do it. I would not like nothing

3854
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:18,560
I could do it. I would not like nothing
 

3855
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,990
I could do it. I would not like nothing
more than full inclusion.

3856
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:22,000
more than full inclusion.
 

3857
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,910
more than full inclusion.
I don't think there's a way it can do it

3858
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:23,920
I don't think there's a way it can do it
 

3859
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,629
I don't think there's a way it can do it
live. Probably because it can't um work

3860
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:26,639
live. Probably because it can't um work
 

3861
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:27,990
live. Probably because it can't um work
out what I'm saying. Unless there's like

3862
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:28,000
out what I'm saying. Unless there's like
 

3863
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,669
out what I'm saying. Unless there's like
an AI tool we can do for it.

3864
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679

 

3865
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,990

Yeah, I can't see it. I'm really sorry.

3866
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,000
Yeah, I can't see it. I'm really sorry.
 

3867
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,709
Yeah, I can't see it. I'm really sorry.
I'm really really sorry. It's If I'm

3868
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
I'm really really sorry. It's If I'm
 

3869
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,550
I'm really really sorry. It's If I'm
wrong there, I I will I will do some

3870
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:40,560
wrong there, I I will I will do some
 

3871
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,470
wrong there, I I will I will do some
extensive research when I got get off

3872
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
extensive research when I got get off
 

3873
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:50,390
extensive research when I got get off
stream to try and find it for you.

3874
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,400

 

3875
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,149

I use bit map and ninja, not quant

3876
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
I use bit map and ninja, not quant
 

3877
01:24:52,159 --> 01:25:00,390
I use bit map and ninja, not quant
tower.

3878
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:00,400

 

3879
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,149

Can you please show the footprint chart

3880
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:02,159
Can you please show the footprint chart
 

3881
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,470
Can you please show the footprint chart
on how trapped buyers and sellers are

3882
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:04,480
on how trapped buyers and sellers are
 

3883
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,910
on how trapped buyers and sellers are
looking like? Uh yeah.

3884
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:07,920
looking like? Uh yeah.
 

3885
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,629
looking like? Uh yeah.
So at the moment we have some buyers

3886
01:25:10,629 --> 01:25:10,639
So at the moment we have some buyers
 

3887
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:14,550
So at the moment we have some buyers
caught up here at 649 and above

3888
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
caught up here at 649 and above
 

3889
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,189
caught up here at 649 and above
and we don't have much excess. What I

3890
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:17,199
and we don't have much excess. What I
 

3891
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:18,950
and we don't have much excess. What I
was just saying like I'd like to see if

3892
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:18,960
was just saying like I'd like to see if
 

3893
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,110
was just saying like I'd like to see if
this was like big big red it would feel

3894
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:21,120
this was like big big red it would feel
 

3895
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,709
this was like big big red it would feel
better. If this was like a big red bar

3896
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:24,719
better. If this was like a big red bar
 

3897
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,870
better. If this was like a big red bar
uh here and we were pivoting up, it

3898
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:26,880
uh here and we were pivoting up, it
 

3899
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,229
uh here and we were pivoting up, it
would feel better. But we are starting

3900
01:25:28,229 --> 01:25:28,239
would feel better. But we are starting
 

3901
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,790
would feel better. But we are starting
to hold that ID.

3902
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
to hold that ID.
 

3903
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,709
to hold that ID.
So I don't love the low of day, but it's

3904
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:32,719
So I don't love the low of day, but it's
 

3905
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,030
So I don't love the low of day, but it's
not it's not the best auction at the low

3906
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
not it's not the best auction at the low
 

3907
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,790
not it's not the best auction at the low
on Ninja Trader. How does it look? Does

3908
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:36,800
on Ninja Trader. How does it look? Does
 

3909
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,750
on Ninja Trader. How does it look? Does
it look a bit better? I mean, there is

3910
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:39,760
it look a bit better? I mean, there is
 

3911
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,310
it look a bit better? I mean, there is
on Ninja Trader, I can tell you it's a

3912
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:42,320
on Ninja Trader, I can tell you it's a
 

3913
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,350
on Ninja Trader, I can tell you it's a
little bit better at these lows.

3914
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:45,360
little bit better at these lows.
 

3915
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,430
little bit better at these lows.
All right, based on tick data, you can

3916
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:47,440
All right, based on tick data, you can
 

3917
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,149
All right, based on tick data, you can
see sellers keep coming here.

3918
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:50,159
see sellers keep coming here.
 

3919
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,990
see sellers keep coming here.
like I keep talking about 57s. They keep

3920
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:52,000
like I keep talking about 57s. They keep
 

3921
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,910
like I keep talking about 57s. They keep
piling in. You can see on this candle,

3922
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:53,920
piling in. You can see on this candle,
 

3923
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,470
piling in. You can see on this candle,
this five minute candle uh 1020 they

3924
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:56,480
this five minute candle uh 1020 they
 

3925
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,910
this five minute candle uh 1020 they
piled in. This is the imbalance which

3926
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:57,920
piled in. This is the imbalance which
 

3927
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,430
piled in. This is the imbalance which
has now been filled like we talked

3928
01:25:59,430 --> 01:25:59,440
has now been filled like we talked
 

3929
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,430
has now been filled like we talked
about. They've just piled again in again

3930
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
about. They've just piled again in again
 

3931
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,430
about. They've just piled again in again
and got caught. So like I said 57s would

3932
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:03,440
and got caught. So like I said 57s would
 

3933
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,870
and got caught. So like I said 57s would
be a big level and then uh 71s and then

3934
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:06,880
be a big level and then uh 71s and then
 

3935
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,550
be a big level and then uh 71s and then
we need to pivot above all of that. We

3936
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:08,560
we need to pivot above all of that. We
 

3937
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,790
we need to pivot above all of that. We
need to leave sellers trapped down here

3938
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:10,800
need to leave sellers trapped down here
 

3939
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,470
need to leave sellers trapped down here
and then if we can put in higher lows

3940
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
and then if we can put in higher lows
 

3941
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,390
and then if we can put in higher lows
and pivot up, I'll be interested. Not

3942
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:14,400
and pivot up, I'll be interested. Not
 

3943
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,310
and pivot up, I'll be interested. Not
before then. I'm not going to play and

3944
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:16,320
before then. I'm not going to play and
 

3945
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,550
before then. I'm not going to play and
fish in here in what is a very bearish

3946
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560
fish in here in what is a very bearish
 

3947
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,550
fish in here in what is a very bearish
market overall. It's too risky. If

3948
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:20,560
market overall. It's too risky. If
 

3949
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,950
market overall. It's too risky. If
you're bidding here, right, and then and

3950
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
you're bidding here, right, and then and
 

3951
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,870
you're bidding here, right, and then and
these sellers win and you get wicked

3952
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:24,880
these sellers win and you get wicked
 

3953
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,550
these sellers win and you get wicked
down to here and your stops here, you're

3954
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:26,560
down to here and your stops here, you're
 

3955
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,910
down to here and your stops here, you're
going to get filled down here. So, I'm

3956
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:27,920
going to get filled down here. So, I'm
 

3957
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,430
going to get filled down here. So, I'm
not going to be willing to do that. I

3958
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:29,440
not going to be willing to do that. I
 

3959
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,070
not going to be willing to do that. I
want to see strength, all right, for me

3960
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:32,080
want to see strength, all right, for me
 

3961
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,629
want to see strength, all right, for me
to really come and bid in.

3962
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639

 

3963
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,310

They're doing a decent job so far,

3964
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:38,320
They're doing a decent job so far,
 

3965
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:51,910
They're doing a decent job so far,
though.

3966
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920

 

3967

3969
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,189
is on the right hand side of the screen.
Maybe you can't enable it while live.

3970
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:55,199

You can do it before the stream. Really?
 

4019

Okay, I'll have another look, Abdullah.

4026
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:03,840

 

4027

4030
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
You're welcome. Right, they're still
 

4031
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,870
You're welcome. Right, they're still
trying to bid down here. There's some

4032
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:08,880
trying to bid down here. There's some
 

4033
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,790
trying to bid down here. There's some
bids at 550s. Like I said, there is a

4034
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:10,800
bids at 550s. Like I said, there is a
 

4035
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,149
bids at 550s. Like I said, there is a
bigger lot uh underneath at 500. Yeah,

4036
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
bigger lot uh underneath at 500. Yeah,
 

4037
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:15,910
bigger lot uh underneath at 500. Yeah,
there's a bigger lot still at 500. So,

4038
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:15,920
there's a bigger lot still at 500. So,
 

4039
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,110
there's a bigger lot still at 500. So,
I'm still waiting here. I'm not going to

4040
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:17,120
I'm still waiting here. I'm not going to
 

4041
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,510
I'm still waiting here. I'm not going to
go fishing for the longs. We're not

4042
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:19,520
go fishing for the longs. We're not
 

4043
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,149
go fishing for the longs. We're not
fishing for longs today. We'll wait to

4044
01:28:22,149 --> 01:28:22,159
fishing for longs today. We'll wait to
 

4045
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,149
fishing for longs today. We'll wait to
see uh if they trap sufficient and start

4046
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:24,159
see uh if they trap sufficient and start
 

4047
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,229
see uh if they trap sufficient and start
to hold, but we are seeing some sort

4048
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:26,239
to hold, but we are seeing some sort
 

4049
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:27,910
to hold, but we are seeing some sort
compression down here. So, maybe a

4050
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:27,920
compression down here. So, maybe a
 

4051
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,790
compression down here. So, maybe a
flush, you know, trap even more under

4052
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:30,800
flush, you know, trap even more under
 

4053
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,189
flush, you know, trap even more under
here, leave a nice excess and then do

4054
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:33,199
here, leave a nice excess and then do
 

4055
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,950
here, leave a nice excess and then do
it. I mean, that would be really good if

4056
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:34,960
it. I mean, that would be really good if
 

4057
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,030
it. I mean, that would be really good if
we then did it

4058
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,040
we then did it
 

4059
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,270
we then did it
for that move back up and we would we're

4060
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:39,280
for that move back up and we would we're
 

4061
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,550
for that move back up and we would we're
going to have to respect this guy here

4062
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
going to have to respect this guy here
 

4063
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,350
going to have to respect this guy here
and each little node here. So, if we do

4064
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,360
and each little node here. So, if we do
 

4065
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,510
and each little node here. So, if we do
think about this, we'll be uh trying to

4066
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:45,520
think about this, we'll be uh trying to
 

4067
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,590
think about this, we'll be uh trying to
get into these and if we get through

4068
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:47,600
get into these and if we get through
 

4069
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:57,910
get into these and if we get through
this relief into that.

4070
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:57,920

 

4071
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,669

Do I use an indicator to plot the gaps?

4072
01:28:59,669 --> 01:28:59,679
Do I use an indicator to plot the gaps?
 

4073
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:03,590
Do I use an indicator to plot the gaps?
I do not. I do it everything manually.

4074
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:03,600
I do not. I do it everything manually.
 

4075
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,990
I do not. I do it everything manually.

Does my course also work on options?
 

4083
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,310
Does my course also work on options?
Yeah, it works on everything. Uh, even

Yeah, it works on everything. Uh, even
 

4085

if you don't trade futures, it's all
 

4087
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:24,550
if you don't trade futures, it's all
markets work the same way. Doesn't

4088
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:24,560
markets work the same way. Doesn't
 

4089
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,629
markets work the same way. Doesn't
matter what you trade. Right. Starting

4090
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:26,639
matter what you trade. Right. Starting
 

4091
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,709
matter what you trade. Right. Starting
to see some aggressive buyers trying to

01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719
to see some aggressive buyers trying to
 

4093
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,550
to see some aggressive buyers trying to
step in here. Starting to perk my

4094
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:30,560
step in here. Starting to perk my
 

4095
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,709
step in here. Starting to perk my
interest a little bit. Oh, you mother

4096
01:29:32,709 --> 01:29:32,719
interest a little bit. Oh, you mother
 

4097

Uh 30s is the level here. 30s and then

01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:38,400
Uh 30s is the level here. 30s and then
 

4101
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,070
Uh 30s is the level here. 30s and then
70s. So, they've got to start basing

4102
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,080
70s. So, they've got to start basing
 

4103
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:45,189
70s. So, they've got to start basing
above some of this to per my interest.

4104
01:29:45,189 --> 01:29:45,199

 

4105
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,950

We got this is fair value. Remember, on

4106
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:46,960
We got this is fair value. Remember, on
 

4107
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,149
We got this is fair value. Remember, on
the day, this is where we've had the

4108
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:48,159
the day, this is where we've had the
 

4109
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,470
the day, this is where we've had the
most buyers and sellers operate on the

01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:50,480
most buyers and sellers operate on the
 

4111
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,270
most buyers and sellers operate on the
day. We don't I don't love the excess

4112
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:53,280
day. We don't I don't love the excess
 

4113
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,629
day. We don't I don't love the excess
down here. I really don't love the

4114
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:54,639
down here. I really don't love the
 

4115
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:55,990
down here. I really don't love the
excess down there. It's the only thing

4116
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:56,000
excess down there. It's the only thing
 

4117
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,950
excess down there. It's the only thing
that's making me not love it. But it's

4118
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:58,960
that's making me not love it. But it's
 

4119
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,229
that's making me not love it. But it's
possible they're going to go for one of

4120
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:00,239
possible they're going to go for one of
 

4121
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,110
possible they're going to go for one of
these IB to VWAP. What we call the Tyson

01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:03,120
these IB to VWAP. What we call the Tyson
 

4123
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:10,390
these IB to VWAP. What we call the Tyson
trade. It's possible.

4124
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,400

 

4125
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,470

Here they go. They're moving VPO up.

4126
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:12,480
Here they go. They're moving VPO up.
 

4127
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,390
Here they go. They're moving VPO up.
There we go.

4128
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:14,400
There we go.
 

4129
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,149
There we go.
Dirty, dirty. They're going to make this

4130
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:16,159
Dirty, dirty. They're going to make this
 

4131
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:20,550
Dirty, dirty. They're going to make this
very, very, very hard to get involved.

4132
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:20,560
very, very, very hard to get involved.
 

4133
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,510
very, very, very hard to get involved.
But we held above those 60s or 57s at

4134
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:23,520
But we held above those 60s or 57s at
 

4135
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,510
But we held above those 60s or 57s at
the lows.

4136
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:25,520
the lows.
 

4137
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,910
the lows.
Oh my god, look at this. is there's 100

4138
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:27,920
Oh my god, look at this. is there's 100
 

4139
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:33,189
Oh my god, look at this. is there's 100
points already off that line.

4140
01:30:33,189 --> 01:30:33,199

 

4141
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:34,470

Well, these sellers are about to get

4142
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:34,480
Well, these sellers are about to get
 

4143
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,590
Well, these sellers are about to get
wrecked. All right, so if we start

4144
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:35,600
wrecked. All right, so if we start
 

4145
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,590
wrecked. All right, so if we start
basing here, they were going to get that

4146
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:37,600
basing here, they were going to get that
 

4147
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,189
basing here, they were going to get that
VWOP trade. We're going to have to watch

4148
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,199
VWOP trade. We're going to have to watch
 

4149
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,790
VWOP trade. We're going to have to watch
these nodes here into the top side of

4150
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:40,800
these nodes here into the top side of
 

4151
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:49,510
these nodes here into the top side of
the gap.

4152
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:49,520

 

4153
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,790

In it early nice, Tyson,

4154
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
In it early nice, Tyson,
 

4155
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,149
In it early nice, Tyson,
you're going to get it. You're going to

4156
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:54,159
you're going to get it. You're going to
 

4157
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,070
you're going to get it. You're going to
get it. I would just be be careful into

4158
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,080
get it. I would just be be careful into
 

4159
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,510
get it. I would just be be careful into
this sort of top of this gray box that

4160
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:57,520
this sort of top of this gray box that
 

4161
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,149
this sort of top of this gray box that
we're at now. You want pull back to hold

4162
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:00,159
we're at now. You want pull back to hold
 

4163
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:03,110
we're at now. You want pull back to hold
VPo. Now, if you hold uh point control

4164
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:03,120
VPo. Now, if you hold uh point control
 

4165
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:09,910
VPo. Now, if you hold uh point control
and they base, you got a shot.

4166
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:09,920

 

4167
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:15,750

You got a shot at it.

4168
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:15,760

 

4169
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,070

This is your target. Target one, target

4170
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,080
This is your target. Target one, target
 

4171
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,950
This is your target. Target one, target
two, I'd say.

4172
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:20,960
two, I'd say.
 

4173
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,709
two, I'd say.
And we said I think we get a rotational

4174
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:22,719
And we said I think we get a rotational
 

4175
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,110
And we said I think we get a rotational
date. So you need this to hold here. You

4176
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:25,120
date. So you need this to hold here. You
 

4177
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,950
date. So you need this to hold here. You
do not want it under this now. It must

4178
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960
do not want it under this now. It must
 

4179
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,189
do not want it under this now. It must
hold there or above and then coming to

4180
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:29,199
hold there or above and then coming to
 

4181
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,669
hold there or above and then coming to
this and this. So here we go back

4182
01:31:31,669 --> 01:31:31,679
this and this. So here we go back
 

4183
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:33,510
this and this. So here we go back
towards VPOT coming now. They've got a

4184
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:33,520
towards VPOT coming now. They've got a
 

4185
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,149
towards VPOT coming now. They've got a
hold above this now. Failing to do that

4186
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:36,159
hold above this now. Failing to do that
 

4187
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,950
hold above this now. Failing to do that
will mean uh nothing. No interest. It's

4188
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:38,960
will mean uh nothing. No interest. It's
 

4189
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:44,550
will mean uh nothing. No interest. It's
a good hold into the low volume node.

4190
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:44,560

 

4191
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,830

Watching 20s here.

4192
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:47,840
Watching 20s here.
 

4193
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,030
Watching 20s here.
There's Vpo 20s here to see if they trap

4194
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:51,040
There's Vpo 20s here to see if they trap
 

4195
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,950
There's Vpo 20s here to see if they trap
into 20s. I'm not long yet folks. I'm

4196
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:52,960
into 20s. I'm not long yet folks. I'm
 

4197
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,310

waiting to see if they trap into these

4198
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:54,320
waiting to see if they trap into these
 

4199
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,910
waiting to see if they trap into these
20s

4200
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:55,920
20s
 

4201
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,430
20s
cuz I've got a node there that I'm

4202
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
cuz I've got a node there that I'm
 

4203
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,229
cuz I've got a node there that I'm
looking at.

4204
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:00,239
looking at.
 

4205
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:06,310

01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:08,480
Coming back for it again. Someone's
 

4209
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,629
Coming back for it again. Someone's

01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,669
it. All right. So, there was the hold of
20s and Vpo. We talked about the higher

4276
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
20s and Vpo. We talked about the higher
 

4277
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,030
20s and Vpo. We talked about the higher
low. All right. I didn't want to go

4278
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
low. All right. I didn't want to go
 

4279
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,790
low. All right. I didn't want to go
fishing today. There's the higher low.

4280
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:40,800
fishing today. There's the higher low.
 

4281
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,629
fishing today. There's the higher low.
So, I had a go and then I got shaken out

4282
01:33:42,629 --> 01:33:42,639
So, I had a go and then I got shaken out
 

4283
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,390
So, I had a go and then I got shaken out
not liking what I saw on the tape, but

4284
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:44,400
not liking what I saw on the tape, but
 

4285
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,470
not liking what I saw on the tape, but
uh he came back in and there's the

4286
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:46,480
uh he came back in and there's the
 

4287
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,390
uh he came back in and there's the
ripper and this is your target now. So,

4288
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:48,400
ripper and this is your target now. So,
 

4289
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,229
ripper and this is your target now. So,
you can take some off into this node. Be

4290
01:33:50,229 --> 01:33:50,239
you can take some off into this node. Be
 

4291
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:51,669
you can take some off into this node. Be
very careful. And then you're looking

4292
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:51,679
very careful. And then you're looking
 

4293
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:53,590
very careful. And then you're looking
for VWAP and then you're looking for

4294
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:53,600
for VWAP and then you're looking for
 

4295
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,350
for VWAP and then you're looking for
sort of 96s. Hopefully, this would be

4296
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:55,360
sort of 96s. Hopefully, this would be
 

4297
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,870
sort of 96s. Hopefully, this would be
down here by that point. So, basically

4298
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:56,880
down here by that point. So, basically
 

4299
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,030
down here by that point. So, basically
800s. You've got another 100 points in

4300
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,040
800s. You've got another 100 points in
 

4301
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,390
800s. You've got another 100 points in
this if they start lifting it folks

4302
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:00,400
this if they start lifting it folks
 

4303
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,750
this if they start lifting it folks
because this will be the rotation,

4304
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:01,760
because this will be the rotation,
 

4305
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,110
because this will be the rotation,
right? This will be the rotation we

4306
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:03,120
right? This will be the rotation we
 

4307
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,189
right? This will be the rotation we
talked about.

4308
01:34:05,189 --> 01:34:05,199
talked about.
 

4309
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,830
talked about.
This is huge. if they get through that

4310
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:07,840
This is huge. if they get through that
 

4311
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,229
This is huge. if they get through that
squeezy squeezy. But I would imagine the

4312
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:10,239
squeezy squeezy. But I would imagine the
 

4313
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:16,149
squeezy squeezy. But I would imagine the
rotation will be to about 800.

4314
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:16,159

 

4315
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,790

So definitely some to sort of where we

4316
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:18,800
So definitely some to sort of where we
 

4317
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,270
So definitely some to sort of where we
are now. 7s 715s squeeze through 75s

4318
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:23,280
are now. 7s 715s squeeze through 75s
 

4319
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,510
are now. 7s 715s squeeze through 75s
will lift to 800. Sellers getting

4320
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,520
will lift to 800. Sellers getting
 

4321
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,950
will lift to 800. Sellers getting
trapped to that low like we talked

4322
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:26,960
trapped to that low like we talked
 

4323
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,750
trapped to that low like we talked
about. Wasn't huge excess but we talked

4324
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760
about. Wasn't huge excess but we talked
 

4325
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,790
about. Wasn't huge excess but we talked
about it right here. All right. Remember

4326
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:32,800
about it right here. All right. Remember
 

4327
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,189
about it right here. All right. Remember
this right here? These sellers down here

4328
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:35,199
this right here? These sellers down here
 

4329
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:36,790
this right here? These sellers down here
got trapped twice at the low and then

4330
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:36,800
got trapped twice at the low and then
 

4331
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,470
got trapped twice at the low and then
they pivoted and look at the delta

4332
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:38,480
they pivoted and look at the delta
 

4333
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,229
they pivoted and look at the delta
change. The exchange we went straight

4334
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:40,239
change. The exchange we went straight
 

4335
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:43,030
change. The exchange we went straight
positive delta and we are lifting now.

4336
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:43,040
positive delta and we are lifting now.
 

4337
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,110
positive delta and we are lifting now.
We are attacking this shelf at sevens

4338
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,120
We are attacking this shelf at sevens
 

4339
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,270
We are attacking this shelf at sevens
through sevens. We can potentially lift

4340
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
through sevens. We can potentially lift
 

4341
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,189
through sevens. We can potentially lift
at eights, but I'd be paying yourself

4342
01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:49,199
at eights, but I'd be paying yourself
 

4343
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:53,750
at eights, but I'd be paying yourself
into sevens.

4344
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:53,760

 

4345
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,550

Hopefully that made sense.

4346
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:56,560
Hopefully that made sense.
 

4347
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,030
Hopefully that made sense.
Oh, that's frustrating for me. That's

4348
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
Oh, that's frustrating for me. That's
 

4349
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:03,189
Oh, that's frustrating for me. That's
frustrating for me.

4350
01:35:03,189 --> 01:35:03,199

 

4351
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,870

was in it. Was in it. And then I didn't

4352
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:04,880
was in it. Was in it. And then I didn't
 

4353
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:22,310
was in it. Was in it. And then I didn't
like his uh his spoofy behavior.

4354
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:22,320

 

4355
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,990

Can you make a cheat sheet for Anchor

4356
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,000
Can you make a cheat sheet for Anchor
 

4357
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,910
Can you make a cheat sheet for Anchor
volume profile? There's a vid there's a

4358
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
volume profile? There's a vid there's a
 

4359
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,110

4362
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:37,840

 

4363
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,750

Nice. Lots of you taking the IB to VWOP

4364
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:39,760
Nice. Lots of you taking the IB to VWOP
 

4365
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,110
Nice. Lots of you taking the IB to VWOP
trade. You're about to get it. Don't be

4366
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:41,120
trade. You're about to get it. Don't be
 

4367
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,030
trade. You're about to get it. Don't be
a dick here though. Make sure there's a

4368
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:43,040
a dick here though. Make sure there's a
 

4369
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,950
a dick here though. Make sure there's a
big big node here. All right. Understand

4370
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:44,960
big big node here. All right. Understand
 

4371
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,669
big big node here. All right. Understand
that you should get it right. But you

4372
01:35:47,669 --> 01:35:47,679
that you should get it right. But you
 

4373
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,910
that you should get it right. But you
must, you know, pay yourself a little

4374
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:49,920
must, you know, pay yourself a little
 

4375
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,990
must, you know, pay yourself a little
bit into this volume node. Huge node

4376
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:52,000
bit into this volume node. Huge node
 

4377
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,910
bit into this volume node. Huge node
here. But through that, you should get

4378
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:53,920
here. But through that, you should get
 

4379
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,470
here. But through that, you should get
New York VW up. And if you get through

4380
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:56,480
New York VW up. And if you get through
 

4381
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,070
New York VW up. And if you get through
720s,

4382
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
720s,
 

4383
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,750
720s,
there is a chance to fill all the way

4384
01:35:59,750 --> 01:35:59,760
there is a chance to fill all the way
 

4385
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,590
there is a chance to fill all the way
back up here in towards this sort of

4386
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:01,600
back up here in towards this sort of
 

4387
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,310
back up here in towards this sort of
790s. All right? So, I would be paying

4388
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
790s. All right? So, I would be paying
 

4389
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,750
790s. All right? So, I would be paying
myself a lot into here, a bit into here,

4390
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:07,760
myself a lot into here, a bit into here,
 

4391
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,590
myself a lot into here, a bit into here,
and then the last lot into this, right

4392
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:09,600
and then the last lot into this, right
 

4393
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,830
and then the last lot into this, right
into this guy here.

4394
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
into this guy here.
 

4395
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,669
into this guy here.
But you've got to respect this guy here.

4396
01:36:13,669 --> 01:36:13,679
But you've got to respect this guy here.
 

4397
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:20,950
But you've got to respect this guy here.
Please respect this guy here.

4398
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:20,960

 

4399
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,950

Um, anchor to 9:30. Yeah, anchored to

01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:22,960
Um, anchor to 9:30. Yeah, anchored to
 

4401

4407
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,790
low. Uh,
do you mean value area high or do you

4408
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:40,800
do you mean value area high or do you
 

4409
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,510
do you mean value area high or do you
mean previous day value area low all the

4410
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,520
mean previous day value area low all the
 

4411
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,430
mean previous day value area low all the
way up here? W is asking a lot. I'd say

4412
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:47,440
way up here? W is asking a lot. I'd say
 

4413
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,990
way up here? W is asking a lot. I'd say
TP's a little bit now where we've just

4414
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:50,000
TP's a little bit now where we've just
 

4415
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,510
TP's a little bit now where we've just
been this node a little bit. 7:15.

4416
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:53,520
been this node a little bit. 7:15.
 

4417
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,030
been this node a little bit. 7:15.
Well, a lot now. A bit 715, a bit 800. I

4418
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:57,040
Well, a lot now. A bit 715, a bit 800. I
 

4419
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,109
Well, a lot now. A bit 715, a bit 800. I
would not expect it necessarily to get

4420
01:36:59,109 --> 01:36:59,119
would not expect it necessarily to get
 

4421
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:02,070
would not expect it necessarily to get
above 800 based on value. We do that,

4422
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,080
above 800 based on value. We do that,
 

4423
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,310
above 800 based on value. We do that,
you'll see expansion. But like this node

4424
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:04,320
you'll see expansion. But like this node
 

4425
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,910
you'll see expansion. But like this node
here, you see how key this node here is?

4426
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:05,920
here, you see how key this node here is?
 

4427
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:13,350
here, you see how key this node here is?
He's being key. He's important.

4428
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:13,360

 

4429
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,270

Rest of today going to rotate around

4430
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:15,280
Rest of today going to rotate around
 

4431
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,470
Rest of today going to rotate around
Fair Valley. I think so. Uh who is that?

4432
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:18,480
Fair Valley. I think so. Uh who is that?
 

4433
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,870
Fair Valley. I think so. Uh who is that?
Samir. Yeah, my I think we're going to

4434
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
Samir. Yeah, my I think we're going to
 

4435
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,830
Samir. Yeah, my I think we're going to
need to build out some volume. I really

4436
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:23,840
need to build out some volume. I really
 

4437
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:24,870
need to build out some volume. I really
think we're going to need to do it.

4438
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:24,880
think we're going to need to do it.
 

4439
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,189
think we're going to need to do it.
We've had like I talked about on the

4440
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:27,199
We've had like I talked about on the
 

4441
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:29,990
We've had like I talked about on the
hourlys. All right,

4442
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,000
hourlys. All right,
 

4443
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,149
hourlys. All right,
here's your failed break. Look above and

4444
01:37:32,149 --> 01:37:32,159
here's your failed break. Look above and
 

4445
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:34,229
here's your failed break. Look above and
fail. There's your first rejection.

4446
01:37:34,229 --> 01:37:34,239
fail. There's your first rejection.
 

4447
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:35,510
fail. There's your first rejection.
There's your lower high. The same on

4448
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:35,520
There's your lower high. The same on
 

4449
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,870
There's your lower high. The same on
silver, guys. Think about the alltime

4450
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:36,880
silver, guys. Think about the alltime
 

4451
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,109
silver, guys. Think about the alltime
high on silver. Pull back. Fail to

4452
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:39,119
high on silver. Pull back. Fail to
 

4453
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:40,870
high on silver. Pull back. Fail to
recover. Okay, we start the sell. There

4454
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:40,880
recover. Okay, we start the sell. There
 

4455
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,950
recover. Okay, we start the sell. There
we go. Start the sell. Start the sell.

4456
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:42,960
we go. Start the sell. Start the sell.
 

4457
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,149
we go. Start the sell. Start the sell.
Right. We're going to need to build

4458
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:44,159
Right. We're going to need to build
 

4459
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,629
Right. We're going to need to build
volume here, right? To get down into

4460
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
volume here, right? To get down into
 

4461
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,149
volume here, right? To get down into
here. So either we're going to base here

4462
01:37:48,149 --> 01:37:48,159
here. So either we're going to base here
 

4463
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:49,990
here. So either we're going to base here
or we're going to return inside, build

4464
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,000
or we're going to return inside, build
 

4465
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,430
or we're going to return inside, build
some volume, little trap, and then come

4466
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:51,440
some volume, little trap, and then come
 

4467
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,430
some volume, little trap, and then come
back for it next week. Very possible,

4468
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:53,440
back for it next week. Very possible,
 

4469
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,350
back for it next week. Very possible,
right? We can't. Unless they're going to

4470
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,360
right? We can't. Unless they're going to
 

4471
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,350
right? We can't. Unless they're going to
just if they're just like, we need to be

4472
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
just if they're just like, we need to be
 

4473
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,870
just if they're just like, we need to be
out of everything. This market is

4474
01:37:58,870 --> 01:37:58,880
out of everything. This market is
 

4475
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,870
out of everything. This market is
[\h__\h] And they can do that. Then we

4476
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:00,880
[\h__\h] And they can do that. Then we
 

4477
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,310
[\h__\h] And they can do that. Then we
will just keep going straight down. All

4478
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,320
will just keep going straight down. All
 

4479
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,390
will just keep going straight down. All
right. The market has done that before.

4480
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:04,400
right. The market has done that before.
 

4481
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,629
right. The market has done that before.
It can do it again. That requires them

4482
01:38:06,629 --> 01:38:06,639
It can do it again. That requires them
 

4483
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:09,030
It can do it again. That requires them
to just completely want out of all

4484
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,040
to just completely want out of all
 

4485
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,790
to just completely want out of all
inventory. All right. So when have we

4486
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:10,800
inventory. All right. So when have we
 

4487
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,990
inventory. All right. So when have we
done that before? Well, tariffs.

4488
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:14,000
done that before? Well, tariffs.
 

4489
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,070
done that before? Well, tariffs.
All right. when they

4490
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:16,080
All right. when they
 

4491
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,910
All right. when they
we think about this move here in the

4492
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:17,920
we think about this move here in the
 

4493
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,189
we think about this move here in the
tariffs on the daily failed to make a

4494
01:38:21,189 --> 01:38:21,199
tariffs on the daily failed to make a
 

4495
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:24,229
tariffs on the daily failed to make a
new high volume trapped here went inside

4496
01:38:24,229 --> 01:38:24,239
new high volume trapped here went inside
 

4497
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,629
new high volume trapped here went inside
had one more go and then they went [\h__\h]

4498
01:38:26,629 --> 01:38:26,639
had one more go and then they went [\h__\h]
 

4499
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:28,790
had one more go and then they went [\h__\h]
all right this breakdown here [\h__\h] get

4500
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:28,800
all right this breakdown here [\h__\h] get
 

4501
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,550
all right this breakdown here [\h__\h] get
me out of all the inventory and then it

4502
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:30,560
me out of all the inventory and then it
 

4503
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:31,990
me out of all the inventory and then it
was too discounted and they bit it back

4504
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:32,000
was too discounted and they bit it back
 

4505
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,149
was too discounted and they bit it back
up. If we look back to every crash,

4506
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:34,159
up. If we look back to every crash,
 

4507
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,470
up. If we look back to every crash,
every actual crash, it looks the same,

4508
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:36,480
every actual crash, it looks the same,
 

4509
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,870
every actual crash, it looks the same,
right? Where we get overly aggressive

4510
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
right? Where we get overly aggressive
 

4511
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,430
right? Where we get overly aggressive
24s. So this was the carry trade. This

4512
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,440
24s. So this was the carry trade. This
 

4513
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:44,709
24s. So this was the carry trade. This
was the carry trade August 24. Right.

4514
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:44,719
was the carry trade August 24. Right.
 

4515
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,709
was the carry trade August 24. Right.
[\h__\h] Big inventory dump.

4516
01:38:46,709 --> 01:38:46,719
[\h__\h] Big inventory dump.
 

4517
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,709
[\h__\h] Big inventory dump.
Overaggressive. Lower bowls. Pick it

4518
01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:48,719
Overaggressive. Lower bowls. Pick it
 

4519
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,950
Overaggressive. Lower bowls. Pick it
back up.

4520
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:52,960

 

4521
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,189

Co will be the same. It will be an

4522
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
Co will be the same. It will be an
 

4523
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:59,350
Co will be the same. It will be an
aggressive move.

4524
01:38:59,350 --> 01:38:59,360

 

4525
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,669

Where are you? Co. Was that it? There.

4526
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:01,679
Where are you? Co. Was that it? There.
 

4527
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,870
Where are you? Co. Was that it? There.
Did I just miss it? There. That's the co

4528
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:04,880
Did I just miss it? There. That's the co
 

4529
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,470
Did I just miss it? There. That's the co
one.

4530
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:06,480
one.
 

4531
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,790
one.
All right. Straight down. Failed to get

4532
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:08,800
All right. Straight down. Failed to get
 

4533
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:14,390
All right. Straight down. Failed to get
back inside. Dump.

4534
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:14,400

 

4535
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,030

We'd have to go back to like 08. Here's

4536
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:17,040
We'd have to go back to like 08. Here's
 

4537
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:22,470
We'd have to go back to like 08. Here's
one here. 15 2015.

4538
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:22,480

 

4539
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,229

08 took a while to develop. It actually

4540
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
08 took a while to develop. It actually
 

4541
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:27,910
08 took a while to develop. It actually
took to 09 and it was walked.

4542
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:27,920
took to 09 and it was walked.
 

4543
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,709
took to 09 and it was walked.
Right. So, we did this

4544
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:32,719
Right. So, we did this
 

4545
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:35,669
Right. So, we did this
failed to get a new high. Aggressive

4546
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:35,679
failed to get a new high. Aggressive
 

4547
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,990
failed to get a new high. Aggressive
failed to make a new high. And then this

4548
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:38,000
failed to make a new high. And then this
 

4549
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,229
failed to make a new high. And then this
one here was the big panic.

4550
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:40,239
one here was the big panic.
 

4551
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,910
one here was the big panic.
Right, that's the panic. Look at the

4552
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:41,920
Right, that's the panic. Look at the
 

4553
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,870
Right, that's the panic. Look at the
5day 20-day but lower bowl. Right,

4554
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:44,880
5day 20-day but lower bowl. Right,
 

4555
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,510
5day 20-day but lower bowl. Right,
history repeats itself. Same thing. So,

4556
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:47,520
history repeats itself. Same thing. So,
 

4557
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,350
history repeats itself. Same thing. So,
we're in the same kind of setup here,

4558
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:49,360
we're in the same kind of setup here,
 

4559
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,950
we're in the same kind of setup here,
but we're going to need some liquidity,

4560
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:50,960
but we're going to need some liquidity,
 

4561
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,950
but we're going to need some liquidity,
I think,

4562
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:52,960
I think,
 

4563
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,470
I think,
unless they go full panic. And remember,

4564
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:54,480
unless they go full panic. And remember,
 

4565
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,350
unless they go full panic. And remember,
we've got earnings tonight as well. Mag

4566
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:57,360
we've got earnings tonight as well. Mag
 

4567
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,430
we've got earnings tonight as well. Mag
earnings still

4568
01:39:59,430 --> 01:39:59,440
earnings still
 

4569
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,030
earnings still
gap filled. The only thing left now is

4570
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:01,040
gap filled. The only thing left now is
 

4571
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,270
gap filled. The only thing left now is
this 200 day, this guy right here. Is

4572
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:03,280
this 200 day, this guy right here. Is
 

4573
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,109
this 200 day, this guy right here. Is
there anything left to to really target

4574
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:05,119
there anything left to to really target
 

4575
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:09,590
there anything left to to really target
as a low hanging fruit?

4576
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:09,600

 

4577
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:41,030

Wait, I'll be right back.

4578
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:41,040

 

4579
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:47,750

Okay.

4580

So, still the same level down here,

4636
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
So, still the same level down here,
 

4637
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,709
So, still the same level down here,
right? Where we trapped those sellers.

4638
01:41:58,709 --> 01:41:58,719
right? Where we trapped those sellers.
 

4639
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:00,149
right? Where we trapped those sellers.
It's still the same level holding,

4640
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:00,159
It's still the same level holding,
 

4641
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:02,950
It's still the same level holding,
right? Can This is why I love footprint.

4642
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:02,960
right? Can This is why I love footprint.
 

4643
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,629
right? Can This is why I love footprint.
All right. down here. We are still not

4644
01:42:04,629 --> 01:42:04,639
All right. down here. We are still not
 

4645
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,149
All right. down here. We are still not
letting these sellers out. All right,

4646
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:06,159
letting these sellers out. All right,
 

4647
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:07,510
letting these sellers out. All right,
we're trading around point of control.

4648
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:07,520
we're trading around point of control.
 

4649
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,109
we're trading around point of control.
Now, I don't love trading around point

4650
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:09,119
Now, I don't love trading around point
 

4651
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:10,390
Now, I don't love trading around point
control, but these sellers are still

4652
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:10,400
control, but these sellers are still
 

4653
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,629
control, but these sellers are still
stuck versus 60. If you're a bottom

4654
01:42:12,629 --> 01:42:12,639
stuck versus 60. If you're a bottom
 

4655
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:14,550
stuck versus 60. If you're a bottom
fisher, basically, you can be long

4656
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:14,560
fisher, basically, you can be long
 

4657
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,870
fisher, basically, you can be long
versus 60s. Uh, you would not want it.

4658
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:16,880
versus 60s. Uh, you would not want it.
 

4659
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,709
versus 60s. Uh, you would not want it.
You'd want to be as long as close to 60

4660
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
You'd want to be as long as close to 60
 

4661
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,550
You'd want to be as long as close to 60
as possible, and you could risk it. But

4662
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:20,560
as possible, and you could risk it. But
 

4663
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,070
as possible, and you could risk it. But
for me, I'm not a bottom fisher. I don't

4664
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:22,080
for me, I'm not a bottom fisher. I don't
 

4665
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,750
for me, I'm not a bottom fisher. I don't
pick bottoms. It's not what I'm trying

4666
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:23,760
pick bottoms. It's not what I'm trying
 

4667
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,070
pick bottoms. It's not what I'm trying
to do. I'm want to wait to see if we

4668
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:26,080
to do. I'm want to wait to see if we
 

4669
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,669
to do. I'm want to wait to see if we
rotate. It's very possible, though. Look

4670
01:42:27,669 --> 01:42:27,679
rotate. It's very possible, though. Look
 

4671
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:29,189
rotate. It's very possible, though. Look
how we're building this out. This is

4672
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:29,199
how we're building this out. This is
 

4673
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:31,750
how we're building this out. This is
like a B-shaped profile. All right. We

4674
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:31,760
like a B-shaped profile. All right. We
 

4675
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,270
like a B-shaped profile. All right. We
can just build out lots and lots in

4676
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280
can just build out lots and lots in
 

4677
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,030
can just build out lots and lots in
here. Maybe they snap it this way. Maybe

4678
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
here. Maybe they snap it this way. Maybe
 

4679
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,510
here. Maybe they snap it this way. Maybe
they get lift this way. But this is

4680
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:37,520
they get lift this way. But this is
 

4681
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:38,790
they get lift this way. But this is
definitely the rotation that they're

4682
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:38,800
definitely the rotation that they're
 

4683
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,669
definitely the rotation that they're
starting to build.

4684
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:41,679
starting to build.
 

4685
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:43,590
starting to build.
I would actually like to see this lift.

4686
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:43,600
I would actually like to see this lift.
 

4687
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,189
I would actually like to see this lift.
Okay, I want to see this lift. Not

4688
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:45,199
Okay, I want to see this lift. Not
 

4689
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,109
Okay, I want to see this lift. Not
necessarily just cuz I want to get long.

4690
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:47,119
necessarily just cuz I want to get long.
 

4691
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,390
necessarily just cuz I want to get long.
It's just going to offer better

4692
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:48,400
It's just going to offer better
 

4693

opportunities for the market for

4733
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:51,990
respect this node like I talked about.
That's why I said I would be selling a

4734
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:52,000
That's why I said I would be selling a
 

4735
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,470
That's why I said I would be selling a
big chunk into there. All right. The

4736
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:54,480
big chunk into there. All right. The
 

4737
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,709
big chunk into there. All right. The
main trend, remember, is still downside,

4738
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:56,719
main trend, remember, is still downside,
 

4739
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:59,109
main trend, remember, is still downside,
but we are outside the daily Ballinger

4740
01:43:59,109 --> 01:43:59,119
but we are outside the daily Ballinger
 

4741
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:01,590
but we are outside the daily Ballinger
bands. Alex can't draw a B very well

4742
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:01,600
bands. Alex can't draw a B very well
 

4743
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,189
bands. Alex can't draw a B very well
today. Right. We're outside the daily

4744
01:44:03,189 --> 01:44:03,199
today. Right. We're outside the daily
 

4745
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,510
today. Right. We're outside the daily
Ballinger bands. So your risk assessment

4746
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:05,520
Ballinger bands. So your risk assessment
 

4747
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,070
Ballinger bands. So your risk assessment
for more downside is not very good right

4748
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:08,080
for more downside is not very good right
 

4749
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,070
for more downside is not very good right
and we talk about riskreward maybe we

4750
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:10,080
and we talk about riskreward maybe we
 

4751
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,430
and we talk about riskreward maybe we
can get down into this but your

4752
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
can get down into this but your
 

4753
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,750
can get down into this but your
positioning remember when we trade we

4754
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:13,760
positioning remember when we trade we
 

4755
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,109

momentum's been great for bearish moves

momentum's been great for bearish moves
 

4761
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,189
momentum's been great for bearish moves
right really really good for bearish

location today wasn't very good which is

4766
01:44:24,709 --> 01:44:24,719
location today wasn't very good which is
 

4767
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,310
location today wasn't very good which is
why we looked for that the location here

4768
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:26,320
why we looked for that the location here
 

4769
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:29,669
why we looked for that the location here
for a short is not good right we are

01:44:29,669 --> 01:44:29,679
for a short is not good right we are

for a short is not good right we are
trading you'll remember this is the

trading you'll remember this is the
 

4773
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:33,750
trading you'll remember this is the
lowest point we have traded since the

4774
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:33,760
lowest point we have traded since the
 

4775
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,149
lowest point we have traded since the
24th of November. All right, we're in

4776
01:44:36,149 --> 01:44:36,159
24th of November. All right, we're in
 

4777
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,790
24th of November. All right, we're in
February, folks. We don't really want to

4778
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:38,800
February, folks. We don't really want to
 

4779
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,430
February, folks. We don't really want to
start a new short position, right? If

4780
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:41,440
start a new short position, right? If
 

4781
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,709
start a new short position, right? If
we're at the lowest point since

4782
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:42,719
we're at the lowest point since
 

4783
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:45,430
we're at the lowest point since
November, do we? No, no, no, no, no. We

4784
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:45,440
November, do we? No, no, no, no, no. We
 

4785
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,030
November, do we? No, no, no, no, no. We
don't want to do that. It means we're

4786
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,040
don't want to do that. It means we're
 

4787
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,629
don't want to do that. It means we're
trying to sell deep in discount to get

4788
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:48,639
trying to sell deep in discount to get
 

4789
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,590
trying to sell deep in discount to get
lower. Very, very risky to do that.

4790
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:51,600
lower. Very, very risky to do that.
 

4791
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:59,189
lower. Very, very risky to do that.
We want to be careful.

used to play?

4804
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:13,040

 

4805
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,030

Why is everyone long? Not everyone's

4806
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:15,040
Why is everyone long? Not everyone's
 

4807
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,950
Why is everyone long? Not everyone's
long. It's not that everyone's long. The

4808
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:16,960
long. It's not that everyone's long. The
 

4809
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,750
long. It's not that everyone's long. The
short was from here to here. It might

4810
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:19,760
short was from here to here. It might
 

4811
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,590
short was from here to here. It might
very well be that you rotate under it.

4812
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:21,600
very well be that you rotate under it.
 

4813
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,470
very well be that you rotate under it.
It might, but the there's not for me. I

4814
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
It might, but the there's not for me. I
 

4815
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,510
It might, but the there's not for me. I
don't think there's a good short

4816
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:25,520
don't think there's a good short
 

4817
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,430
don't think there's a good short
position down here. It's more likely to

4818
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,440
position down here. It's more likely to
 

4819
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,109
position down here. It's more likely to
see relief at the moment. All right.

4820
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:29,119
see relief at the moment. All right.
 

4821
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:31,109
see relief at the moment. All right.
It's more likely to see relief unless we

4822
01:45:31,109 --> 01:45:31,119
It's more likely to see relief unless we
 

4823
01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:33,270
It's more likely to see relief unless we
build out lots here for another hour or

4824
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:33,280
build out lots here for another hour or
 

4825
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,270
build out lots here for another hour or
so and then let go and then even then

4826
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:35,280
so and then let go and then even then
 

4827
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,390
so and then let go and then even then
you got to be very careful about a

4828
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:36,400
you got to be very careful about a
 

4829
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,070
you got to be very careful about a
failed breakout. But if you do get a

4830
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:38,080
failed breakout. But if you do get a
 

4831
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,830
failed breakout. But if you do get a
sustained breakout, there is a move down

4832
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:39,840
sustained breakout, there is a move down
 

4833
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,189
sustained breakout, there is a move down
to here. I just won't be short down

4834
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
to here. I just won't be short down
 

4835
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:43,510
to here. I just won't be short down
here. It's way way way too risky in my

4836
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:43,520
here. It's way way way too risky in my
 

4837
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,350
here. It's way way way too risky in my
mind. That's just how I play. I was

4838
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:45,360
mind. That's just how I play. I was
 

4839
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,790
mind. That's just how I play. I was
short earlier today up here. Like I

4840
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:46,800
short earlier today up here. Like I
 

4841
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:55,910
short earlier today up here. Like I
said,

4842
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:55,920

 

4843
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,430

Alex, why not make a detailed video
 

5139
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:34,310
Alex, why not make a detailed video
explaining all the indicators you use

5140
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320
explaining all the indicators you use
 

5141
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,229
explaining all the indicators you use
and how you actually apply them? That

5142
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:36,239
and how you actually apply them? That
 

5143
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:37,910
and how you actually apply them? That
way, whenever someone asks the same

5144
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:37,920
way, whenever someone asks the same
 

5145
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,990
way, whenever someone asks the same
question, you can simply point them out

5146
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:40,000
question, you can simply point them out
 

5147
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,830
question, you can simply point them out
on the video. Yeah, I mean, it's it's a

5148
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:41,840
on the video. Yeah, I mean, it's it's a
 

5149
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,430
on the video. Yeah, I mean, it's it's a
good idea. I should probably do that. I

5150
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:43,440
good idea. I should probably do that. I
 

5151
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:44,950
good idea. I should probably do that. I
mean, there are quite a few videos on my

5152
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:44,960
mean, there are quite a few videos on my
 

5153
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:47,270
mean, there are quite a few videos on my
YouTube for it. Most what most people

5154
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:47,280
YouTube for it. Most what most people
 

5155
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,189
YouTube for it. Most what most people
ask is just they want the settings for

5156
01:51:49,189 --> 01:51:49,199
ask is just they want the settings for
 

5157
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:50,950
ask is just they want the settings for
this. Everyone seems to ask the seconds

5158
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:50,960
this. Everyone seems to ask the seconds
 

5159
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,109
this. Everyone seems to ask the seconds
for this. So, I'll probably get Nightbot

5160
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:53,119
for this. So, I'll probably get Nightbot
 

5161
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:56,629
for this. So, I'll probably get Nightbot
to just post it in chat.

5162
01:51:56,629 --> 01:51:56,639
to just post it in chat.
 

5163

Uh, DJed in Switzerland. Uh,
don't remember the club. I remember I

5168
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:04,880
don't remember the club. I remember I
 

5169
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,229
don't remember the club. I remember I
remember coming out of the club the next

5170
01:52:06,229 --> 01:52:06,239
remember coming out of the club the next
 

5171
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:07,669
remember coming out of the club the next
morning at the early hours and it was

5172
01:52:07,669 --> 01:52:07,679
morning at the early hours and it was

5175
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:10,870
the first time I'd ever seen a Tesla
ever, ever, ever. So, that would have

5176
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:10,880
ever, ever, ever. So, that would have
 

5177
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,430
ever, ever, ever. So, that would have
been like 2014,

5178
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:13,440
been like 2014,
 

5179
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:19,589

5191
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,070
lovely. I haven't heard of Bave, so I'll
check that out.

5192
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:32,080
check that out.
 

5193
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,229
check that out.
Horizon now was whoosh. Okay, that makes

5194
01:52:34,229 --> 01:52:34,239
Horizon now was whoosh. Okay, that makes
 

5195
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:41,910
Horizon now was whoosh. Okay, that makes
sense.

5196
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:41,920

 

5197
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,990

If you say that, we are fine. We'll be

5198
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:44,000
If you say that, we are fine. We'll be
 

5199
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,990
If you say that, we are fine. We'll be
buying till lunchtime. Alex got to let

5200
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:46,000
buying till lunchtime. Alex got to let
 

5201
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,390
buying till lunchtime. Alex got to let
us know. Do we bid or do we hold? Idea

5202
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:48,400
us know. Do we bid or do we hold? Idea
 

5203
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,390
us know. Do we bid or do we hold? Idea
for a new song lyrics. Oh, do we bid or

5204
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:50,400
for a new song lyrics. Oh, do we bid or
 

5205
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:51,750
for a new song lyrics. Oh, do we bid or
do we hold? I get what you're saying.

5206
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:51,760
do we hold? I get what you're saying.
 

5207
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:54,470
do we hold? I get what you're saying.
That's funny. It's a good one. How do

5208
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:54,480
That's funny. It's a good one. How do
 

5209
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,910
That's funny. It's a good one. How do
you know the buyers and sellers were

5210
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:55,920
you know the buyers and sellers were
 

5211
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,229
you know the buyers and sellers were
trapped? Uh because they were

5212
01:52:58,229 --> 01:52:58,239
trapped? Uh because they were
 

5213
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:00,470
trapped? Uh because they were
aggressively, right? They were

5214
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:00,480
aggressively, right? They were
 

5215
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,510
aggressively, right? They were
aggressively selling down here. So, this

5216
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:03,520
aggressively selling down here. So, this
 

5217
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:08,709
aggressively selling down here. So, this
delta here can be seen on

5218
01:53:08,709 --> 01:53:08,719
delta here can be seen on
 

5219
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:11,830
delta here can be seen on
this footprint

5220
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:11,840
this footprint
 

5221
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,990
this footprint
down here. But even better, it can be

5222
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:14,000
down here. But even better, it can be
 

5223
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,430
down here. But even better, it can be
seen on Ninja Trader at the lows.

5224
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:17,440
seen on Ninja Trader at the lows.
 

5225
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:23,430
seen on Ninja Trader at the lows.
Right. So if I bring NT up,

5226
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:23,440

 

5227
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:27,189

right, right here,

5228
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:27,199

 

5229
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:30,629

these aggressive participants down here

5230
01:53:30,629 --> 01:53:30,639
these aggressive participants down here
 

5231
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:32,470
these aggressive participants down here
and down here, right? These are market

5232
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:32,480
and down here, right? These are market
 

5233
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,589
and down here, right? These are market
order selling. They're trying to get the

5234
01:53:33,589 --> 01:53:33,599
order selling. They're trying to get the
 

5235
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:35,270
order selling. They're trying to get the
breakdown. We can see big delta here, a

5236
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:35,280
breakdown. We can see big delta here, a
 

5237
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:37,270
breakdown. We can see big delta here, a
value area low. Did we break below it?

5238
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:37,280
value area low. Did we break below it?
 

5239
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,109
value area low. Did we break below it?
No. What then happened? We squeezed up.

5240
01:53:39,109 --> 01:53:39,119
No. What then happened? We squeezed up.
 

5241
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:41,189
No. What then happened? We squeezed up.
Right? So bids came back in, sellers

5242
01:53:41,189 --> 01:53:41,199
Right? So bids came back in, sellers
 

5243
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:42,790
Right? So bids came back in, sellers
came back in, tried to get back down to

5244
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:42,800
came back in, tried to get back down to
 

5245
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,629
came back in, tried to get back down to
that level. They haven't been let out.

5246
01:53:44,629 --> 01:53:44,639
that level. They haven't been let out.
 

5247
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:45,990
that level. They haven't been let out.
Right? So they got out like break even

5248
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:46,000
Right? So they got out like break even
 

5249
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,910
Right? So they got out like break even
or as close to and now we're in this

5250
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:47,920
or as close to and now we're in this
 

5251
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,910
or as close to and now we're in this
range rotation. All right? So I know

5252
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:49,920
range rotation. All right? So I know
 

5253
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,430
range rotation. All right? So I know
sellers are trapped down there because I

5254
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:51,440
sellers are trapped down there because I
 

5255
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,750
sellers are trapped down there because I
can I can quite literally see them

5256
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:53,760
can I can quite literally see them
 

5257
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,390
can I can quite literally see them
trapped down there. Right? I can quite

5258
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:56,400
trapped down there. Right? I can quite
 

5259
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,629
trapped down there. Right? I can quite
literally see them trapped down there.

5260
01:53:58,629 --> 01:53:58,639
literally see them trapped down there.
 

5261
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:00,470
literally see them trapped down there.
It's not a guesswork. It's not like, oh,

5262
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
It's not a guesswork. It's not like, oh,
 

5263
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:03,189
It's not a guesswork. It's not like, oh,
the candle says, no, I can literally see

5264
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:03,199
the candle says, no, I can literally see
 

5265
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:04,629
the candle says, no, I can literally see
where they came in and got themselves

5266
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
where they came in and got themselves
 

5267
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:07,030
where they came in and got themselves
stuck. And until they are let out, all

5268
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:07,040
stuck. And until they are let out, all
 

5269
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,790
stuck. And until they are let out, all
right, they will remain stuck. And what

5270
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:08,800
right, they will remain stuck. And what
 

5271
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,790
right, they will remain stuck. And what
I would also be very concerned about

5272
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:10,800
I would also be very concerned about
 

5273
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,109
I would also be very concerned about
today if I was a short seller is if too

5274
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:13,119
today if I was a short seller is if too
 

5275
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,790
today if I was a short seller is if too
many of them pile in down here and you

5276
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:14,800
many of them pile in down here and you
 

5277
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,790
many of them pile in down here and you
get this that is where a bigger squeeze

5278
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:16,800
get this that is where a bigger squeeze
 

5279
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:17,990
get this that is where a bigger squeeze
will happen. They will be looking for

5280
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:18,000
will happen. They will be looking for
 

5281
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,149
will happen. They will be looking for
this down here. But like we talked about

5282
01:54:20,149 --> 01:54:20,159
this down here. But like we talked about
 

5283
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:22,070
this down here. But like we talked about
positionally. All right. When we talk

5284
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,080
positionally. All right. When we talk
 

5285
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,270
positionally. All right. When we talk
about location and momentum where are we

5286
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:25,280
about location and momentum where are we
 

5287
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,910
about location and momentum where are we
right now? Are we in a good location to

5288
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:27,920
right now? Are we in a good location to
 

5289
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,709
right now? Are we in a good location to
be short? All right. Are we in a good

5290
01:54:30,709 --> 01:54:30,719
be short? All right. Are we in a good
 

5291
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:32,790
be short? All right. Are we in a good
location to be short? This is not a good

5292
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:32,800
location to be short? This is not a good
 

5293
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,589
location to be short? This is not a good
location to be short, folks.

5294
01:54:35,589 --> 01:54:35,599
location to be short, folks.
 

5295
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:38,229
location to be short, folks.
Down here. This is is an awful location

5296
01:54:38,229 --> 01:54:38,239
Down here. This is is an awful location
 

5297
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:39,910
Down here. This is is an awful location
to be short. Where were the good

5298
01:54:39,910 --> 01:54:39,920
to be short. Where were the good
 

5299
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,750
to be short. Where were the good
locations? Well, the failed breakout,

5300
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:41,760
locations? Well, the failed breakout,
 

5301
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,070
locations? Well, the failed breakout,
this location here was a great location.

5302
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:44,080
this location here was a great location.
 

5303
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,750
this location here was a great location.
This rejection of here yesterday was a

5304
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:45,760
This rejection of here yesterday was a
 

5305
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,750
This rejection of here yesterday was a
great location. This drive up this

5306
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:47,760
great location. This drive up this
 

5307
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,430
great location. This drive up this
morning was not a bad location. It

5308
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
morning was not a bad location. It
 

5309
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:52,310
morning was not a bad location. It
wasn't prime. Prime was up here. This

5310
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,320
wasn't prime. Prime was up here. This
 

5311
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,550
wasn't prime. Prime was up here. This
location down here, it is terrible. That

5312
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:54,560
location down here, it is terrible. That
 

5313
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,709
location down here, it is terrible. That
is a terrible location to be short. All

5314
01:54:56,709 --> 01:54:56,719
is a terrible location to be short. All
 

5315
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:59,589
is a terrible location to be short. All
right? Because your risk is for this up

5316
01:54:59,589 --> 01:54:59,599
right? Because your risk is for this up
 

5317
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:01,669
right? Because your risk is for this up
here, isn't it? Right? So, you don't

5318
01:55:01,669 --> 01:55:01,679
here, isn't it? Right? So, you don't
 

5319
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:03,030
here, isn't it? Right? So, you don't
want to be short down there as a new

5320
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:03,040
want to be short down there as a new
 

5321
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,550
want to be short down there as a new
money short for that when your target is

5322
01:55:04,550 --> 01:55:04,560
money short for that when your target is
 

5323
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,870
money short for that when your target is
just there. That's a one to one at best

5324
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:06,880
just there. That's a one to one at best
 

5325
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,390
just there. That's a one to one at best
on a swing position. So I don't want to

5326
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:08,400
on a swing position. So I don't want to
 

5327
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,709
on a swing position. So I don't want to
be short down there. I want to manage my

5328
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:10,719
be short down there. I want to manage my
 

5329
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:12,950
be short down there. I want to manage my
expectation. Where we got short this

5330
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:12,960
expectation. Where we got short this
 

5331
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,070
expectation. Where we got short this
morning was a good location to be short.

5332
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:16,080
morning was a good location to be short.
 

5333
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,830
morning was a good location to be short.
Why? Let's just think more about trapped

5334
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:17,840
Why? Let's just think more about trapped
 

5335
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,070
Why? Let's just think more about trapped
volume. Why did we get this flush here

5336
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:20,080
volume. Why did we get this flush here
 

5337
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,629
volume. Why did we get this flush here
this morning? Think about this box. Same

5338
01:55:22,629 --> 01:55:22,639
this morning? Think about this box. Same
 

5339
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,709
this morning? Think about this box. Same
same condition, right? This box

5340
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:24,719
same condition, right? This box
 

5341
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:27,430
same condition, right? This box
overnight. There's your box overnight.

5342
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:27,440
overnight. There's your box overnight.
 

5343
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:29,189
overnight. There's your box overnight.

at some point. Right? It's just

What is that volume profile on the right

5472
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:16,560
What is that volume profile on the right
 

5473
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,990

5477
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,510
let me get over to it. Oh, okay. So,
this is

5478
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:25,520
this is
 

5479
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,430
this is
pivoted off the all-time high. All

5480
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:27,440
pivoted off the all-time high. All
 

5481
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,109
pivoted off the all-time high. All
right. So, this is off the alltime high.

5482
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:29,119
right. So, this is off the alltime high.
 

5483
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:31,350
right. So, this is off the alltime high.
So, it's showing all the volume created

5484
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:31,360
So, it's showing all the volume created
 

5485
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,669
So, it's showing all the volume created
from here. So, all of this and this one

5486
01:58:33,669 --> 01:58:33,679
from here. So, all of this and this one
 

5487
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:35,750
from here. So, all of this and this one
here is for the last 12 months. All

5488
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:35,760
here is for the last 12 months. All
 

5489
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,430
here is for the last 12 months. All
right. So, I know that this level here

5490
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:37,440
right. So, I know that this level here
 

5491
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,030
right. So, I know that this level here
is a big node. You see this node? We've

5492
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:39,040
is a big node. You see this node? We've
 

5493
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,109
is a big node. You see this node? We've
left it. All right. We might travel back

5494
01:58:41,109 --> 01:58:41,119
left it. All right. We might travel back
 

5495
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:43,750
left it. All right. We might travel back
into here and if we get really lucky

5496
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:43,760
into here and if we get really lucky
 

5497
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,910
into here and if we get really lucky
down to here. All right. But it's very

5498
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:45,920
down to here. All right. But it's very
 

5499
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,189
down to here. All right. But it's very
possible we're going to need some form

5500
01:58:47,189 --> 01:58:47,199
possible we're going to need some form
 

5501
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:49,030
possible we're going to need some form
of retest of this first, isn't it? Over

5502
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:49,040
of retest of this first, isn't it? Over
 

5503
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,910
of retest of this first, isn't it? Over
the next day or week, retest this. And

5504
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:51,920
the next day or week, retest this. And
 

5505
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:54,470
the next day or week, retest this. And
if they resell that or this node here or

5506
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:54,480
if they resell that or this node here or
 

5507
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,390
if they resell that or this node here or
this node here, then we can look for

5508
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:56,400
this node here, then we can look for
 

5509
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,950
this node here, then we can look for
this move here. And then Alex is

5510
01:58:58,950 --> 01:58:58,960
this move here. And then Alex is
 

5511
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:00,470
this move here. And then Alex is
probably going to be thinking about

5512
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:00,480
probably going to be thinking about
 

5513
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,709
probably going to be thinking about
being a buyer somewhere down here.

5514
01:59:02,709 --> 01:59:02,719
being a buyer somewhere down here.
 

5515
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,229
being a buyer somewhere down here.
Unless we're going to get very heavy and

5516
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:04,239
Unless we're going to get very heavy and
 

5517
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:06,390
Unless we're going to get very heavy and
let the whole thing go. But I might

5518
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:06,400
let the whole thing go. But I might
 

5519
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,950
let the whole thing go. But I might
start being a speculatory buyer down

5520
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:08,960
start being a speculatory buyer down
 

5521
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:11,189
start being a speculatory buyer down
here

5522
01:59:11,189 --> 01:59:11,199
here
 

5523
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:14,870
here
cuz that will be then

5524
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:14,880
cuz that will be then
 

5525
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,950
cuz that will be then
think from the highs

5526
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:16,960
think from the highs
 

5527
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:20,229
think from the highs
high down to 200 day be 10% and if we

5528
01:59:20,229 --> 01:59:20,239
high down to 200 day be 10% and if we
 

5529
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:23,109
high down to 200 day be 10% and if we
can get into this node yeah 10.33% if we

5530
01:59:23,109 --> 01:59:23,119
can get into this node yeah 10.33% if we
 

5531
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:25,270
can get into this node yeah 10.33% if we
come all the way back down to this pivot

5532
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:25,280
come all the way back down to this pivot
 

5533
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:26,950
come all the way back down to this pivot
it'll be a 12% pullback which would

5534
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:26,960
it'll be a 12% pullback which would
 

5535
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,790
it'll be a 12% pullback which would
still be healthy. So somewhere in here

5536
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:28,800
still be healthy. So somewhere in here
 

5537
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:31,910
still be healthy. So somewhere in here
is probably a very healthy pullback.

5538
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:31,920
is probably a very healthy pullback.
 

5539
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,510
is probably a very healthy pullback.
It's probably a very very healthy

5540
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:33,520
It's probably a very very healthy
 

5541
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:42,149
It's probably a very very healthy
pullback.

5542
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159

 

5543
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:44,310

Alex, Austin, Trafford is worse than LA.

5544
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:44,320
Alex, Austin, Trafford is worse than LA.
 

5545
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,070
Alex, Austin, Trafford is worse than LA.
Way behind on infrastructure. Still

5546
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:46,080
Way behind on infrastructure. Still
 

5547
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,629
Way behind on infrastructure. Still
better in better in Texas and

5548
01:59:48,629 --> 01:59:48,639
better in better in Texas and
 

5549
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:51,189
better in better in Texas and
California. Yeah, I I know, man. I know.

5550
01:59:51,189 --> 01:59:51,199
California. Yeah, I I know, man. I know.
 

5551
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:55,030
California. Yeah, I I know, man. I know.
But the taxes are better.

5552
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,040
But the taxes are better.
 

5553
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,950
But the taxes are better.
The taxes are better. And I might fancy

5554
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:56,960
The taxes are better. And I might fancy
 

5555
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:59,510
The taxes are better. And I might fancy
a change. I'll see.

5556
01:59:59,510 --> 01:59:59,520
a change. I'll see.
 

5557
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,430
a change. I'll see.
Think

5558
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:01,440
Think
 

5559
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,830
Think
we swipe the lows and then ping up on ES

5560
02:00:03,830 --> 02:00:03,840
we swipe the lows and then ping up on ES
 

5561
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:06,310
we swipe the lows and then ping up on ES
S2 and ENQ below the S2 pivot big value

5562
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:06,320
S2 and ENQ below the S2 pivot big value
 

5563
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:09,350
S2 and ENQ below the S2 pivot big value
area uh on ES. Well, ES. Yeah, you're

5564
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:09,360
area uh on ES. Well, ES. Yeah, you're
 

5565
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:11,109
area uh on ES. Well, ES. Yeah, you're
you're about to sweep the lows now.

5566
02:00:11,109 --> 02:00:11,119
you're about to sweep the lows now.
 

5567
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:12,790
you're about to sweep the lows now.
Well, we all are about on everything

5568
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:12,800
Well, we all are about on everything
 

5569
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,830
Well, we all are about on everything
right now. Vick still holding price up.

5570
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:15,840
right now. Vick still holding price up.
 

5571
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,709
right now. Vick still holding price up.
Like I said, I think I'd be watching the

5572
02:00:18,709 --> 02:00:18,719
Like I said, I think I'd be watching the
 

5573
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:21,589
Like I said, I think I'd be watching the
75s on SPY. You still got another dollar

5574
02:00:21,589 --> 02:00:21,599
75s on SPY. You still got another dollar
 

5575
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:23,270
75s on SPY. You still got another dollar
to go there on the spy. I'd be watching

5576
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:23,280
to go there on the spy. I'd be watching
 

5577
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,430
to go there on the spy. I'd be watching
those 75s. I imagine there's a big area

5578
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:25,440
those 75s. I imagine there's a big area
 

5579
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:32,629
those 75s. I imagine there's a big area
there.

5580
02:00:32,629 --> 02:00:32,639

 

5581
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:34,070

Arsenal doing good at the moment. We're

5582
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:34,080
Arsenal doing good at the moment. We're
 

5583
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:35,750
Arsenal doing good at the moment. We're
doing great, man. We're doing great.

5584
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:35,760
doing great, man. We're doing great.
 

5585
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,189
doing great, man. We're doing great.
We'll see how we go the next couple

5586
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:37,199
We'll see how we go the next couple
 

5587
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:38,870
We'll see how we go the next couple
months. Going to the World Cup. Yeah,

5588
02:00:38,870 --> 02:00:38,880
months. Going to the World Cup. Yeah,
 

5589
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:39,830
months. Going to the World Cup. Yeah,
I'll definitely be going to the World

5590
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:39,840
I'll definitely be going to the World
 

5591
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,589
I'll definitely be going to the World
Cup. I I applied for lottery tickets

5592
02:00:41,589 --> 02:00:41,599
Cup. I I applied for lottery tickets
 

5593
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:45,189
Cup. I I applied for lottery tickets
here. Didn't get any. Did not get any,

5594
02:00:45,189 --> 02:00:45,199
here. Didn't get any. Did not get any,
 

5595
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:46,390
here. Didn't get any. Did not get any,
but I applied, so I'll probably just

5596
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:46,400
but I applied, so I'll probably just
 

5597
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:47,669
but I applied, so I'll probably just
have to buy some. All right, still

5598
02:00:47,669 --> 02:00:47,679
have to buy some. All right, still
 

5599
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:49,430
have to buy some. All right, still
holding there. So, you got divergence.

5600
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:49,440
holding there. So, you got divergence.
 

5601
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,350
holding there. So, you got divergence.
These sellers are still stuck right now

5602
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:51,360
These sellers are still stuck right now
 

5603
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:53,589
These sellers are still stuck right now
under here. You have divergence. ES just

5604
02:00:53,589 --> 02:00:53,599
under here. You have divergence. ES just
 

5605
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:56,149
under here. You have divergence. ES just
swiped below. ENQ didn't. Still too

5606
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:56,159
swiped below. ENQ didn't. Still too
 

5607
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:57,589
swiped below. ENQ didn't. Still too
early. Like I said, I will not be

5608
02:00:57,589 --> 02:00:57,599
early. Like I said, I will not be
 

5609
02:00:57,599 --> 02:00:59,109
early. Like I said, I will not be
fishing down here. I'm not going to be

5610
02:00:59,109 --> 02:00:59,119
fishing down here. I'm not going to be
 

5611
02:00:59,119 --> 02:01:00,229
fishing down here. I'm not going to be
fishing today. It was going to have to

5612
02:01:00,229 --> 02:01:00,239
fishing today. It was going to have to
 

5613
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:08,629
fishing today. It was going to have to
pivot and hold.

5614
02:01:08,629 --> 02:01:08,639

 

5615
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:10,310

What time frame is this? One minute time

uh EMA 7289.

5620
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:17,760

 

5621
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:19,109

Do I think we chop around for the rest

5622
02:01:19,109 --> 02:01:19,119
Do I think we chop around for the rest
 

5623
02:01:19,119 --> 02:01:22,709
Do I think we chop around for the rest
of the day? Yeah, I do. I do. uh is the

5624
02:01:22,709 --> 02:01:22,719
of the day? Yeah, I do. I do. uh is the
 

5625
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,109
of the day? Yeah, I do. I do. uh is the
only thing right is if they are adamant

5626
02:01:25,109 --> 02:01:25,119
only thing right is if they are adamant
 

5627
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:26,870
only thing right is if they are adamant
on just keeping selling then they can

5628
02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:26,880
on just keeping selling then they can
 

5629
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:29,030
on just keeping selling then they can
use this volume to go lower but I think

5630
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:29,040
use this volume to go lower but I think
 

5631
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:31,109
use this volume to go lower but I think
we will do some [\h__\h] for the rest of

5632
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:31,119
we will do some [\h__\h] for the rest of
 

5633
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:33,109
we will do some [\h__\h] for the rest of
the day just because of where we are on

5634
02:01:33,109 --> 02:01:33,119
the day just because of where we are on
 

5635
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,709
the day just because of where we are on
the daily I think it's going to struggle

5636
02:01:34,709 --> 02:01:34,719
the daily I think it's going to struggle
 

5637
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:36,390
the daily I think it's going to struggle
to keep moving too much lower I'll give

5638
02:01:36,390 --> 02:01:36,400
to keep moving too much lower I'll give
 

5639
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,950
to keep moving too much lower I'll give
you a readout on the MAG right Tesla

5640
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:38,960
you a readout on the MAG right Tesla

1% down. Uh overall we're 1.61% down. If
we look at the daily, if we think about

5650
02:01:54,629 --> 02:01:54,639
we look at the daily, if we think about
 

5651
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:57,669
we look at the daily, if we think about
the size of the move this week, it's now

5652
02:01:57,669 --> 02:01:57,679
the size of the move this week, it's now
 

5653
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:01,910
the size of the move this week, it's now
go from the high of this week.

5654
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:01,920
go from the high of this week.
 

5655
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:07,669
go from the high of this week.
Where's

5656
02:02:07,669 --> 02:02:07,679

 

5657
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:11,270

just measure this out?

5658
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:11,280

 

5659
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:13,669

Wednesday, Monday. So, we go from the

5660
02:02:13,669 --> 02:02:13,679
Wednesday, Monday. So, we go from the
 

5661
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:18,870
Wednesday, Monday. So, we go from the
high of this week to the low.

5662
02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:18,880

 

5663
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,510

All right, we are almost 1,500 points

5664
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:21,520
All right, we are almost 1,500 points
 

5665
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:24,629
All right, we are almost 1,500 points
down on the week. If we measure out a

5666
02:02:24,629 --> 02:02:24,639
down on the week. If we measure out a
 

5667
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:28,629
down on the week. If we measure out a
sigma from like Ballinger

5668
02:02:28,629 --> 02:02:28,639
sigma from like Ballinger
 

5669
02:02:28,639 --> 02:02:31,030
sigma from like Ballinger
and we do a third standard deviation of

5670
02:02:31,030 --> 02:02:31,040
and we do a third standard deviation of
 

5671
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:34,790
and we do a third standard deviation of
the Ballinger right now,

5672
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800
the Ballinger right now,
 

5673
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,790
the Ballinger right now,
where is that? It would actually take us

5674
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:36,800
where is that? It would actually take us
 

5675
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,950
where is that? It would actually take us
to the to the 20-day. So, we're we're

5676
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:38,960
to the to the 20-day. So, we're we're
 

5677
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,030
to the to the 20-day. So, we're we're
about two and a half standard deviations

5678
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:41,040
about two and a half standard deviations
 

5679
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:42,709
about two and a half standard deviations
from the 20-day right now. So remember

5680
02:02:42,709 --> 02:02:42,719
from the 20-day right now. So remember
 

5681
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:45,030
from the 20-day right now. So remember
the get you on the chart. So remember

5682
02:02:45,030 --> 02:02:45,040
the get you on the chart. So remember
 

5683
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:48,070
the get you on the chart. So remember
the 20-day is our mean, right?

5684
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:48,080
the 20-day is our mean, right?
 

5685
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,990
the 20-day is our mean, right?
Ballingers are are two standard

5686
02:02:49,990 --> 02:02:50,000
Ballingers are are two standard
 

5687
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,910
Ballingers are are two standard
deviations. We're about a two and a half

5688
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:51,920
deviations. We're about a two and a half
 

5689
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,669
deviations. We're about a two and a half
because we're at the midpoint of this. A

5690
02:02:53,669 --> 02:02:53,679
because we're at the midpoint of this. A
 

5691
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:55,350
because we're at the midpoint of this. A
three standard deviation will take us

5692
02:02:55,350 --> 02:02:55,360
three standard deviation will take us
 

5693
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,990
three standard deviation will take us
right down into this. It's very very

5694
02:02:57,990 --> 02:02:58,000
right down into this. It's very very
 

5695
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,669
right down into this. It's very very
very very unlikely. It's possible, but

5696
02:03:01,669 --> 02:03:01,679
very very unlikely. It's possible, but
 

5697
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:04,070
very very unlikely. It's possible, but
it's very unusual that we do standard

5698
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,080
it's very unusual that we do standard
 

5699
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,070
it's very unusual that we do standard
deviation moves outside of two. We're at

5700
02:03:06,070 --> 02:03:06,080
deviation moves outside of two. We're at
 

5701
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:08,310
deviation moves outside of two. We're at
two and a half. To get to three is

5702
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:08,320
two and a half. To get to three is
 

5703
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:10,149
two and a half. To get to three is
asking a lot. You are going to need mass

5704
02:03:10,149 --> 02:03:10,159
asking a lot. You are going to need mass
 

5705
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:11,990
asking a lot. You are going to need mass
panic in the market to do that. It's not

5706
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:12,000
panic in the market to do that. It's not
 

5707
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,669
panic in the market to do that. It's not
to say it can't happen, but it it's

5708
02:03:15,669 --> 02:03:15,679
to say it can't happen, but it it's
 

5709
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:18,629
to say it can't happen, but it it's
unlikely. Okay, it's unlikely. If you

5710
02:03:18,629 --> 02:03:18,639
unlikely. Okay, it's unlikely. If you
 

5711
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:20,070
unlikely. Okay, it's unlikely. If you
even if you just want to like look at

5712
02:03:20,070 --> 02:03:20,080
even if you just want to like look at
 

5713
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:23,669
even if you just want to like look at
the pivot on like NQ1,

5714
02:03:23,669 --> 02:03:23,679
the pivot on like NQ1,
 

5715
02:03:23,679 --> 02:03:25,830
the pivot on like NQ1,
right? We are trading right into the

5716
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:25,840
right? We are trading right into the
 

5717
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:29,669
right? We are trading right into the
August highs. So, if we just go

5718
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
August highs. So, if we just go
 

5719
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,830
August highs. So, if we just go
I'm going to put you on NQ1, okay?

5720
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:31,840
I'm going to put you on NQ1, okay?
 

5721
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,910
I'm going to put you on NQ1, okay?
Rather than the H contract just for a

5722
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:33,920
Rather than the H contract just for a
 

5723
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:35,830
Rather than the H contract just for a
second. We are coming right into these

5724
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:35,840
second. We are coming right into these
 

5725
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:38,629
second. We are coming right into these
pivots. All right, we're right into this

5726
02:03:38,629 --> 02:03:38,639
pivots. All right, we're right into this
 

5727
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:43,109
pivots. All right, we're right into this
high of August. Right? We're asking a

5728
02:03:43,109 --> 02:03:43,119
high of August. Right? We're asking a
 

5729
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:46,470
high of August. Right? We're asking a
lot for it to just do this, right, in

02:03:46,470 --> 02:03:46,480
lot for it to just do this, right, in
 

5731
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:49,750
lot for it to just do this, right, in
one go. What's more reasonable is like a

5732
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:49,760
one go. What's more reasonable is like a
 

5733
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:52,709
one go. What's more reasonable is like a
back test of this and then down here.

5734
02:03:52,709 --> 02:03:52,719
back test of this and then down here.
 

5735
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:56,149
back test of this and then down here.
All right. And into this basket where we

5736
02:03:56,149 --> 02:03:56,159
All right. And into this basket where we
 

5737
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:57,750
All right. And into this basket where we
went sideways for a while and then we

5738
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:57,760
went sideways for a while and then we
 

5739
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,589
went sideways for a while and then we
broke out from, retested, broke out,

5740
02:03:59,589 --> 02:03:59,599
broke out from, retested, broke out,
 

5741
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:01,910
broke out from, retested, broke out,
undercut, retested, held, failed,

02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:01,920

5743
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,950
undercut, retested, held, failed,
breakout, back down, probably retest

5744
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:04,960
breakout, back down, probably retest
 

5745
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,950
breakout, back down, probably retest
here somewhere in here. It's probably

5746
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:06,960
here somewhere in here. It's probably
 

5747
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,870
here somewhere in here. It's probably
coming at some point. All right. All

5748
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:08,880
coming at some point. All right. All
 

5749
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,390
coming at some point. All right. All
right. So, they're asking a lot to keep

5750
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:10,400
right. So, they're asking a lot to keep
 

5751
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:11,830
right. So, they're asking a lot to keep
just driving lower and lower and lower

5752
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:11,840
just driving lower and lower and lower
 

5753
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:19,030
just driving lower and lower and lower
and lower without a back test.

5754
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:19,040

 

5755
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:20,629

Manage your expectations, right? It's

5756
02:04:20,629 --> 02:04:20,639
Manage your expectations, right? It's
 

5757
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:22,790
Manage your expectations, right? It's

02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:22,800
why I wouldn't be short down here for
 

5759
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:28,149
why I wouldn't be short down here for
me.

We left Cali for Oklahoma a few years

We left Cali for Oklahoma a few years
ago. Love it out here. Have you seen gas

02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:34,480
is 188 a gallon? Well, there you go,
 

5767
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:38,709
is 188 a gallon? Well, there you go,
Jason. Exactly. Exactly that.

property tax there sucks. Yeah, it does.

5780
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:57,760
property tax there sucks. Yeah, it does.
 

5781
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,109
property tax there sucks. Yeah, it does.
But it would still be far less than I

But it would still be far less than I
 

5783

But it would still be far less than I
pay in total tax here for sure.

5785
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:07,669

But yeah, I mean I'll consider anywhere.

5786
02:05:07,669 --> 02:05:07,679
But yeah, I mean I'll consider anywhere.
 

5787
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:09,510
But yeah, I mean I'll consider anywhere.
I'm considering Miami as well. I will

5788
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:09,520
I'm considering Miami as well. I will
 

5789
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:17,109
I'm considering Miami as well. I will
consider anywhere.

Alex, the order flow course is more for
 

5793
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,950
Alex, the order flow course is more for
mean reversion. I use volume profile for

5794
02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:20,960
mean reversion. I use volume profile for
 

5795
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,390
mean reversion. I use volume profile for

It's for everything because anything's

It's for everything because anything's
 

5799
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:25,510
It's for everything because anything's
possible once you understand the order

possible once you understand the order
 

5801
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,270
possible once you understand the order
flow. But yeah, a lot of people use

02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:27,280
flow. But yeah, a lot of people use

02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,870
flow. But yeah, a lot of people use
orderflow for mean reversion. It's it

5804
02:05:28,870 --> 02:05:28,880
orderflow for mean reversion. It's it
 

5805
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:31,510
orderflow for mean reversion. It's it
can be very it can lure you into bottom

5806
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:31,520
can be very it can lure you into bottom
 

5807
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,109
can be very it can lure you into bottom
picking. So you want to be careful with

5808
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:33,119
picking. So you want to be careful with
 

5809
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:35,109
picking. So you want to be careful with
that.

5810
02:05:35,109 --> 02:05:35,119
that.
 

5811
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:37,510
that.

moved from LA to Dallas in 2021 outside

5826
02:06:01,669 --> 02:06:01,679
moved from LA to Dallas in 2021 outside
 

5827
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:03,189
moved from LA to Dallas in 2021 outside
the ocean. Thought about Los Angeles.

5828
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:03,199
the ocean. Thought about Los Angeles.
 

5829
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:05,430
the ocean. Thought about Los Angeles.
Yeah, that's the one thing. It is the

02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:05,440
Yeah, that's the one thing. It is the

Yeah, that's the one thing. It is the
ocean. That's the one thing that I have

02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:06,880
ocean. That's the one thing that I have
 

5833
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:08,229
ocean. That's the one thing that I have
to let go of which is really hard

5834
02:06:08,229 --> 02:06:08,239
to let go of which is really hard
 

5835
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:10,390
to let go of which is really hard
because I live very close to it. Can

5836
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:10,400
because I live very close to it. Can
 

5837
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,950
because I live very close to it. Can
literally see it from where I live. I

5838
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:12,960
literally see it from where I live. I
 

5839
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:19,830
literally see it from where I live. I
can cycle there in 5 minutes.

5840
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:19,840

 

5841
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,030

Okay, so they're coming down for the

5842
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:21,040
Okay, so they're coming down for the
 

5843
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,030
Okay, so they're coming down for the
swipe. Remember, they keep getting stuck

5844
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:23,040
swipe. Remember, they keep getting stuck
 

5845
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,589
swipe. Remember, they keep getting stuck
down here. There's a swipe and a return

5846
02:06:25,589 --> 02:06:25,599
down here. There's a swipe and a return
 

5847
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:28,310
down here. There's a swipe and a return
back inside instantly. More sellers just

5848
02:06:28,310 --> 02:06:28,320
back inside instantly. More sellers just
 

5849
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,709
back inside instantly. More sellers just
got caught down there again, folks. More

5850
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
got caught down there again, folks. More
 

5851
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:32,629
got caught down there again, folks. More
sellers got caught down there again. I'd

5852
02:06:32,629 --> 02:06:32,639
sellers got caught down there again. I'd
 

5853
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:35,430
sellers got caught down there again. I'd
still think SPY might want to come to 75

5854
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:35,440
still think SPY might want to come to 75
 

5855
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:37,189
still think SPY might want to come to 75
and ES maybe to that whole number of

5856
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:37,199
and ES maybe to that whole number of
 

5857
02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:38,870
and ES maybe to that whole number of
800. You're close though. Look at that

5858
02:06:38,870 --> 02:06:38,880
800. You're close though. Look at that
 

5859
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,669
800. You're close though. Look at that
return straight back inside.

5860
02:06:41,669 --> 02:06:41,679
return straight back inside.
 

5861
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:45,189
return straight back inside.
Straight back inside for the lift. Back

5862
02:06:45,189 --> 02:06:45,199
Straight back inside for the lift. Back
 

5863
02:06:45,199 --> 02:06:47,270
Straight back inside for the lift. Back
to point of control. I would watch this

5864
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:47,280
to point of control. I would watch this
 

5865
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:49,589
to point of control. I would watch this
long now. If they swipe and reclaim

5866
02:06:49,589 --> 02:06:49,599
long now. If they swipe and reclaim
 

5867
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:50,950
long now. If they swipe and reclaim
point of control, which they are trying

5868
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:50,960
point of control, which they are trying
 

5869
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:53,270
point of control, which they are trying
to All right,

5870
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:53,280
to All right,
 

5871
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,589
to All right,
watching this. Looking for this long

5872
02:06:55,589 --> 02:06:55,599
watching this. Looking for this long
 

5873
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:58,390
watching this. Looking for this long
now. Said I wouldn't do it, but this is

5874
02:06:58,390 --> 02:06:58,400
now. Said I wouldn't do it, but this is
 

5875
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,750
now. Said I wouldn't do it, but this is
too good to miss. They just caught

5876
02:06:59,750 --> 02:06:59,760
too good to miss. They just caught
 

5877
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:01,270
too good to miss. They just caught
everyone off guard down there. Here we

5878
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,280
everyone off guard down there. Here we
 

5879
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,750
everyone off guard down there. Here we
go. Let's watch this imbalance into 23s.

5880
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:03,760
go. Let's watch this imbalance into 23s.
 

5881
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:05,350
go. Let's watch this imbalance into 23s.
I'm long. See if we can get through 23s

5882
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:05,360
I'm long. See if we can get through 23s
 

5883
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:07,030
I'm long. See if we can get through 23s
and start to really squeeze. There's the

5884
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:07,040
and start to really squeeze. There's the
 

5885
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,910
and start to really squeeze. There's the
23 tap. I'm already long. We'll add into

5886
02:07:09,910 --> 02:07:09,920
23 tap. I'm already long. We'll add into
 

5887
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,229
23 tap. I'm already long. We'll add into
this if we start to firm up here. Here

5888
02:07:12,229 --> 02:07:12,239
this if we start to firm up here. Here
 

5889
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:13,910
this if we start to firm up here. Here
we go. So, those sellers at the low of

5890
02:07:13,910 --> 02:07:13,920
we go. So, those sellers at the low of
 

5891
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:16,470
we go. So, those sellers at the low of
day are absolute wies.

5892
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:16,480
day are absolute wies.
 

5893
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,149
day are absolute wies.
Here we go, folks. All right. Next

5894
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:18,159
Here we go, folks. All right. Next
 

5895
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:20,069
Here we go, folks. All right. Next
imbalance can take us all the way up to

5896
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:20,079
imbalance can take us all the way up to
 

5897
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:23,750
imbalance can take us all the way up to
60 uh 650 and 63s. So, I want all

5898
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:23,760
60 uh 650 and 63s. So, I want all
 

5899
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,589
60 uh 650 and 63s. So, I want all
pullbacks to hold here and just see this

5900
02:07:25,589 --> 02:07:25,599
pullbacks to hold here and just see this
 

5901
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:27,589
pullbacks to hold here and just see this
expansion up towards the top side of

5902
02:07:27,589 --> 02:07:27,599
expansion up towards the top side of
 

5903
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:30,390
expansion up towards the top side of
this to 92s. Right. I'm trying to attack

5904
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:30,400
this to 92s. Right. I'm trying to attack
 

5905
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,629
this to 92s. Right. I'm trying to attack
from here now. The reclaim through this

5906
02:07:32,629 --> 02:07:32,639
from here now. The reclaim through this
 

5907
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:33,990
from here now. The reclaim through this
selling some here. And if we can get

5908
02:07:33,990 --> 02:07:34,000
selling some here. And if we can get
 

5909
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,669
selling some here. And if we can get
through 92 is great. And then we'll look

5910
02:07:35,669 --> 02:07:35,679
through 92 is great. And then we'll look
 

5911
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:37,270
through 92 is great. And then we'll look
for that same move. So they got caught

5912
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:37,280
for that same move. So they got caught
 

5913
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:40,470
for that same move. So they got caught
low day again. Again,

5914
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:40,480
low day again. Again,
 

5915
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:42,229
low day again. Again,
look at the delta lower day. Look at the

5916
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:42,239
look at the delta lower day. Look at the
 

5917
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:45,030
look at the delta lower day. Look at the
delta lower day. These these silly

5918
02:07:45,030 --> 02:07:45,040
delta lower day. These these silly
 

5919
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:46,790
delta lower day. These these silly
people keep trying to sell the lows.

5920
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:46,800
people keep trying to sell the lows.
 

5921
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,229
people keep trying to sell the lows.
That's who we're going to use their pain

5922
02:07:48,229 --> 02:07:48,239
That's who we're going to use their pain
 

5923
02:07:48,239 --> 02:07:52,950
That's who we're going to use their pain
to go higher, right? Silly silly people.

5924
02:07:52,950 --> 02:07:52,960
to go higher, right? Silly silly people.
 

5925
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,950
to go higher, right? Silly silly people.
Lovely. Right. I'm just holding a little

5926
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:54,960
Lovely. Right. I'm just holding a little
 

5927
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,189
Lovely. Right. I'm just holding a little
piece now. So if the pullback holds 600,

5928
02:07:57,189 --> 02:07:57,199
piece now. So if the pullback holds 600,
 

5929
02:07:57,199 --> 02:07:59,109
piece now. So if the pullback holds 600,
I'll sit in this. If we pull back and

5930
02:07:59,109 --> 02:07:59,119
I'll sit in this. If we pull back and
 

5931
02:07:59,119 --> 02:08:01,830
I'll sit in this. If we pull back and
hold 600, I will sit in this. Pull back

5932
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:01,840
hold 600, I will sit in this. Pull back
 

5933
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,350
hold 600, I will sit in this. Pull back
and hold 600, I will sit in this.

5934
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:03,360
and hold 600, I will sit in this.
 

5935
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:05,109
and hold 600, I will sit in this.
Already selling some into here and try

5936
02:08:05,109 --> 02:08:05,119
Already selling some into here and try
 

5937
02:08:05,119 --> 02:08:07,350
Already selling some into here and try
and get up into this. And if we get over

5938
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:07,360
and get up into this. And if we get over
 

5939
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:10,229
and get up into this. And if we get over
that, the squeeze is on.

5940
02:08:10,229 --> 02:08:10,239
that, the squeeze is on.
 

5941
02:08:10,239 --> 02:08:13,990
that, the squeeze is on.
So, imbalances here right now into 53.

5942
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:14,000
So, imbalances here right now into 53.
 

5943
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,870
So, imbalances here right now into 53.
Up to 52. Here we go. 53s up to 62s.

if we can get up into 93s. If we get

5950
02:08:25,589 --> 02:08:25,599
if we can get up into 93s. If we get
 

5951
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:27,189
if we can get up into 93s. If we get
through 93s, the squeeze is on. Like

5952
02:08:27,189 --> 02:08:27,199
through 93s, the squeeze is on. Like
 

5953
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:29,350
through 93s, the squeeze is on. Like
I've talked about these silly people at

5954
02:08:29,350 --> 02:08:29,360
I've talked about these silly people at
 

5955
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:31,109
I've talked about these silly people at
the lower days, they just don't learn,

5956
02:08:31,109 --> 02:08:31,119
the lower days, they just don't learn,
 

5957
02:08:31,119 --> 02:08:46,470
the lower days, they just don't learn,
do they? They just don't learn.

5958
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:46,480

 

5959
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:48,470

Come on. We want to just lift up in the

5960
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:48,480
Come on. We want to just lift up in the
 

5961
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:52,310
Come on. We want to just lift up in the
92s. I've only got a little bit left.

5962
02:08:52,310 --> 02:08:52,320
92s. I've only got a little bit left.
 

5963
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:53,750
92s. I've only got a little bit left.
Only got a little bit left. I want to

5964
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:53,760
Only got a little bit left. I want to
 

5965
02:08:53,760 --> 02:09:01,750
Only got a little bit left. I want to
lift into 92s.

5966
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:01,760

 

5967
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,030

Remember, we're thin up. That was a

5968
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:03,040
Remember, we're thin up. That was a
 

5969
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:04,870
Remember, we're thin up. That was a
squeeze up. So, they can flush back

5970
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:04,880
squeeze up. So, they can flush back
 

5971
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,390
squeeze up. So, they can flush back
down. We don't want that flush back down

5972
02:09:06,390 --> 02:09:06,400
down. We don't want that flush back down
 

5973
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,709
down. We don't want that flush back down
to the PC. We want a base now above this

5974
02:09:08,709 --> 02:09:08,719
to the PC. We want a base now above this
 

5975
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:11,669
to the PC. We want a base now above this
node here. We want a base above 34s. We

5976
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:11,679
node here. We want a base above 34s. We
 

5977
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:13,830
node here. We want a base above 34s. We
want a base above this for a

5978
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:13,840
want a base above this for a
 

5979
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:16,629
want a base above this for a
continuation squeeze. Base above this

5980
02:09:16,629 --> 02:09:16,639
continuation squeeze. Base above this
 

5981
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:20,470
continuation squeeze. Base above this
guy here, ideally to here, and then up

5982
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:20,480
guy here, ideally to here, and then up
 

5983
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:23,830
guy here, ideally to here, and then up
into here if we get lucky.

5984
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:23,840
into here if we get lucky.
 

5985
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:26,550
into here if we get lucky.
All because they got stuck.

5986
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:26,560
All because they got stuck.
 

5987
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,069
All because they got stuck.
All because Alex knew they would get

5988
02:09:28,069 --> 02:09:28,079
All because Alex knew they would get
 

5989
02:09:28,079 --> 02:09:30,069
All because Alex knew they would get
stuck down there because they are just

5990
02:09:30,069 --> 02:09:30,079
stuck down there because they are just
 

5991
02:09:30,079 --> 02:09:32,550
stuck down there because they are just
silly people. What did I say? Don't

5992
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:32,560
silly people. What did I say? Don't
 

5993
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:36,390
silly people. What did I say? Don't
short the low days.

5994
02:09:36,390 --> 02:09:36,400

 

5995
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:40,390

100 points later. 110 points later.

5996
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:40,400
100 points later. 110 points later.
 

5997
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:49,109
100 points later. 110 points later.
So, I'm long from this turn around.

5998
02:09:49,109 --> 02:09:49,119

 

5999
02:09:49,119 --> 02:09:55,030

I'm already partiing out.

6000
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:55,040

 

6001
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,550

Let's see if we can get VWAP. We were

6002
02:09:56,550 --> 02:09:56,560
Let's see if we can get VWAP. We were
 

6003
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:58,629
Let's see if we can get VWAP. We were
looking for this here. 92s and if we can

6004
02:09:58,629 --> 02:09:58,639
looking for this here. 92s and if we can
 

6005
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:01,350
looking for this here. 92s and if we can
get VWAP 707s and then really I'd love

6006
02:10:01,350 --> 02:10:01,360
get VWAP 707s and then really I'd love
 

6007
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:03,910
get VWAP 707s and then really I'd love
to get 800s. This is what we're longing

6008
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:03,920
to get 800s. This is what we're longing
 

6009
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:13,270
to get 800s. This is what we're longing
at the moment, folks.

6010
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:13,280

 

6011

afford a drift to 36s, but I'd love 57s

6071
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:42,470

6072
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:42,480
800s. But I'm 80% out of this now. And

800s. But I'm 80% out of this now. And
it's runners now only. All right. So 80%

6074
02:11:45,510 --> 02:11:45,520
it's runners now only. All right. So 80%
 

6075
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:48,390
it's runners now only. All right. So 80%
out of this into here. 20% in case we

6076
02:11:48,390 --> 02:11:48,400
out of this into here. 20% in case we
 

6077
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,629
out of this into here. 20% in case we
want to do something nasty up into this.

6078
02:11:50,629 --> 02:11:50,639
want to do something nasty up into this.
 

6079
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:52,550
want to do something nasty up into this.
Okay. And I will move my stop up to

Okay. And I will move my stop up to
 

6081
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,390
Okay. And I will move my stop up to
protect these 60s. Now I do want to do

02:11:54,390 --> 02:11:54,400
protect these 60s. Now I do want to do
 

6083

not want it under these.

6084
02:11:59,350 --> 02:11:59,360

Like I said, don't follow me, guys. I am
 

6087

Like I said, don't follow me, guys. I am
just a stupid 40-year-old man with a

just a stupid 40-year-old man with a
 

6089

just a stupid 40-year-old man with a
dodgy patchy beard and glasses on

02:12:06,149 --> 02:12:06,159
dodgy patchy beard and glasses on

dodgy patchy beard and glasses on
YouTube. Don't listen to me.

6092
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:21,440

 

6093
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:23,510

Hi, Alex. What ATM strategies do you

6094
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:23,520
Hi, Alex. What ATM strategies do you
 

6095
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:25,830
Hi, Alex. What ATM strategies do you
use? They are they ATR based or do you

6096
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:25,840
use? They are they ATR based or do you
 

6097
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:28,069
use? They are they ATR based or do you
enter with uh SL and stop loss? No,

6098
02:12:28,069 --> 02:12:28,079
enter with uh SL and stop loss? No,
 

6099
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:29,830
enter with uh SL and stop loss? No,
they're just automatic based on me. So,

6100
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:29,840
they're just automatic based on me. So,
 

6101
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,709
they're just automatic based on me. So,
I do like wide stops. So, it's like 40

6102
02:12:32,709 --> 02:12:32,719
I do like wide stops. So, it's like 40
 

6103
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:37,270
I do like wide stops. So, it's like 40
point stop and like a 50 to 100 point um

6104
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:37,280
point stop and like a 50 to 100 point um
 

6105
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:39,350
point stop and like a 50 to 100 point um
uh profit and then I move them instantly

6106
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:39,360
uh profit and then I move them instantly
 

6107
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:41,030
uh profit and then I move them instantly
to where I want. Right? So, that all

6108
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:41,040
to where I want. Right? So, that all
 

6109
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:43,990
to where I want. Right? So, that all
they really do is make sure that I'm

6110
02:12:43,990 --> 02:12:44,000
they really do is make sure that I'm
 

6111
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,990
they really do is make sure that I'm
positioning my limits where I want them.

6112
02:12:45,990 --> 02:12:46,000
positioning my limits where I want them.
 

6113
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:53,830
positioning my limits where I want them.
That's all they do.

6114
02:12:53,830 --> 02:12:53,840

Banger of the day. It is another banger

6124
02:13:04,550 --> 02:13:04,560
of the day. You know why it's a banger
 

6125
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:06,870
of the day. You know why it's a banger
of the day? Because the market is

6126
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:06,880
of the day? Because the market is
 

6127
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:09,109
of the day? Because the market is
leaving volume and trapping volume and

6128
02:13:09,109 --> 02:13:09,119
leaving volume and trapping volume and
 

6129
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,669
leaving volume and trapping volume and
that's what we like. Like you see how

6130
02:13:11,669 --> 02:13:11,679
that's what we like. Like you see how
 

6131
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:13,189
that's what we like. Like you see how
when we were down here, guys, you see

6132
02:13:13,189 --> 02:13:13,199
when we were down here, guys, you see
 

6133
02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:15,350
when we were down here, guys, you see
how we started talking about me moving

6134
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
how we started talking about me moving
 

6135
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:17,510
how we started talking about me moving
to Texas and like we did a few lessons

6136
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:17,520
to Texas and like we did a few lessons
 

6137
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:19,669
to Texas and like we did a few lessons
and I said we will do something once

6138
02:13:19,669 --> 02:13:19,679
and I said we will do something once
 

6139
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:21,109
and I said we will do something once
we've trapped enough and I would not

6140
02:13:21,109 --> 02:13:21,119
we've trapped enough and I would not
 

6141
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:22,470
we've trapped enough and I would not
short the low of day cuz they keep

6142
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
short the low of day cuz they keep
 

6143
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:23,830
short the low of day cuz they keep
getting trapped down here. I said it a

6144
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:23,840
getting trapped down here. I said it a
 

6145
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,430
getting trapped down here. I said it a
million times. They did it again. The

6146
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:25,440
million times. They did it again. The
 

6147
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:28,229
million times. They did it again. The
turnaround. Here we go. So 800's on deck

6148
02:13:28,229 --> 02:13:28,239
turnaround. Here we go. So 800's on deck
 

6149
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:29,750
turnaround. Here we go. So 800's on deck
now. If we can get going above this

6150
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:29,760
now. If we can get going above this
 

6151
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,390
now. If we can get going above this
green box, right, 800 is on deck. We

6152
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:32,400
green box, right, 800 is on deck. We
 

6153
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,470
green box, right, 800 is on deck. We
might get a runner to 800 here. It would

6154
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:34,480
might get a runner to 800 here. It would
 

6155
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:36,229
might get a runner to 800 here. It would
be lovely if we can get up into this

6156
02:13:36,229 --> 02:13:36,239
be lovely if we can get up into this
 

6157
02:13:36,239 --> 02:13:38,229
be lovely if we can get up into this
node. I'm going to call it 800. It's

6158
02:13:38,229 --> 02:13:38,239
node. I'm going to call it 800. It's
 

6159
02:13:38,239 --> 02:13:39,589

02:13:43,510 --> 02:13:43,520
to watch 70. Is that New York open? I
 

6165
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:44,870

just want to make sure it is. All right.

just want to make sure it is. All right.
 

6167
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:48,390
just want to make sure it is. All right.

You'd want it to defend 90s. Now I might

6210
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:56,400
You'd want it to defend 90s. Now I might
 

6211
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,790
You'd want it to defend 90s. Now I might
move my stop up to 90s here. Just under

6212
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:58,800
move my stop up to 90s here. Just under
 

6213
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,589
move my stop up to 90s here. Just under
VWAP. I'd want it to defend sort of this

6214
02:15:01,589 --> 02:15:01,599
VWAP. I'd want it to defend sort of this
 

6215
02:15:01,599 --> 02:15:03,430
VWAP. I'd want it to defend sort of this
area here now. 90s. I don't want it to

6216
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:03,440
area here now. 90s. I don't want it to
 

6217
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:04,870
area here now. 90s. I don't want it to
flush under that. We're almost there,

6218
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:04,880
flush under that. We're almost there,
 

6219
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:06,390
flush under that. We're almost there,
but I'm not going to give this whole

6220
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:06,400
but I'm not going to give this whole
 

6221
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:07,669
but I'm not going to give this whole
squeeze back. All right. So, I'm going

6222
02:15:07,669 --> 02:15:07,679
squeeze back. All right. So, I'm going
 

6223
02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:09,830
squeeze back. All right. So, I'm going
to probably risk 90s here. What's this

6224
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
to probably risk 90s here. What's this
 

6225
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,149
to probably risk 90s here. What's this
level right under here? 88. Let's risk

6226
02:15:12,149 --> 02:15:12,159
level right under here? 88. Let's risk
 

6227
02:15:12,159 --> 02:15:14,470
level right under here? 88. Let's risk
88s.

6228
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:14,480
88s.
 

6229
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:15,990
88s.
So, stop moved up to here. Remember,

6230
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:16,000
So, stop moved up to here. Remember,
 

6231
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,430
So, stop moved up to here. Remember,
I've taken most of it off. About to get

6232
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:17,440
I've taken most of it off. About to get
 

6233
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:18,790
I've taken most of it off. About to get
washed out here. Out of here on the

6234
02:15:18,790 --> 02:15:18,800
washed out here. Out of here on the
 

6235
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:21,270
washed out here. Out of here on the
runner is what it is. But that was still

6236
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:21,280
runner is what it is. But that was still
 

6237
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:22,790
runner is what it is. But that was still
really good. All right. We almost got

6238
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:22,800
really good. All right. We almost got
 

6239
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,069
really good. All right. We almost got
all the way. Maybe some of you want to

6240
02:15:24,069 --> 02:15:24,079
all the way. Maybe some of you want to
 

6241
02:15:24,079 --> 02:15:25,510
all the way. Maybe some of you want to
hold longer, but I'm not going to hold

6242
02:15:25,510 --> 02:15:25,520
hold longer, but I'm not going to hold
 

6243
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,830
hold longer, but I'm not going to hold
through that. Uh I think a best fill I

6244
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:27,840
through that. Uh I think a best fill I
 

6245
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:30,069
through that. Uh I think a best fill I
got here was 720s.

6246
02:15:30,069 --> 02:15:30,079
got here was 720s.
 

6247
02:15:30,079 --> 02:15:32,390
got here was 720s.
I just don't want to risk this coming

6248
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:32,400
I just don't want to risk this coming
 

6249
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,310
I just don't want to risk this coming
back down here and setting a higher low

6250
02:15:34,310 --> 02:15:34,320
back down here and setting a higher low
 

6251
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,830
back down here and setting a higher low
down here before it has another go

6252
02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:35,840
down here before it has another go
 

6253
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:38,149
down here before it has another go
because now this can be a fail breakout

6254
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,159
because now this can be a fail breakout
 

6255
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:39,990
because now this can be a fail breakout
of that again and it can come back into

6256
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:40,000
of that again and it can come back into
 

6257
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,510
of that again and it can come back into
the range again. So I don't want to

6258
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:41,520
the range again. So I don't want to
 

6259
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,910
the range again. So I don't want to
position myself here for that. It's too

6260
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:43,920
position myself here for that. It's too
 

6261
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,830
position myself here for that. It's too
risky. Same as that's like position

6262
02:15:45,830 --> 02:15:45,840
risky. Same as that's like position
 

6263
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,750
risky. Same as that's like position
yourself short for that. All right, so

6264
02:15:47,750 --> 02:15:47,760
yourself short for that. All right, so
 

6265
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:49,430
yourself short for that. All right, so
we got the rotation. Maybe some of you

6266
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:49,440
we got the rotation. Maybe some of you
 

6267
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:50,870
we got the rotation. Maybe some of you
are willing to hold a runner longer. You

6268
02:15:50,870 --> 02:15:50,880
are willing to hold a runner longer. You
 

6269
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,390
are willing to hold a runner longer. You
might still get it. I I do think it

6270
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:52,400
might still get it. I I do think it
 

6271
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,229
might still get it. I I do think it
wants to try and lift up into here, but

6272
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:54,239
wants to try and lift up into here, but
 

6273
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:56,629
wants to try and lift up into here, but
I got my target right. So ES also hit

6274
02:15:56,629 --> 02:15:56,639
I got my target right. So ES also hit
 

6275
02:15:56,639 --> 02:16:01,589
I got my target right. So ES also hit
New York B.

6276
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599

 

6277
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:03,109

Where was my original stop loss? Right

6278
02:16:03,109 --> 02:16:03,119
Where was my original stop loss? Right
 

6279
02:16:03,119 --> 02:16:05,350
Where was my original stop loss? Right
into the lows basically. Um I can tell

6280
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:05,360
into the lows basically. Um I can tell
 

6281
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:11,589
into the lows basically. Um I can tell
you cuz I did it on NT

6282
02:16:11,589 --> 02:16:11,599

 

6283
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:15,270

it was into 60s. All right. And this is

6284
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:15,280
it was into 60s. All right. And this is
 

6285
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:18,229
it was into 60s. All right. And this is
why. Oh, you're going to get it right.

6286
02:16:18,229 --> 02:16:18,239
why. Oh, you're going to get it right.
 

6287
02:16:18,239 --> 02:16:19,990
why. Oh, you're going to get it right.
See this

6288
02:16:19,990 --> 02:16:20,000
See this
 

6289
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,229
See this
big seller here came in. They market

6290
02:16:22,229 --> 02:16:22,239
big seller here came in. They market
 

6291
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:24,310
big seller here came in. They market
sold underneath. We reclaimed once we

6292
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:24,320
sold underneath. We reclaimed once we
 

6293
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,750
sold underneath. We reclaimed once we
ripped through that. I did not want it

6294
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:25,760
ripped through that. I did not want it
 

6295
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:27,430
ripped through that. I did not want it
to come back under 60s. Hopefully that

6296
02:16:27,430 --> 02:16:27,440
to come back under 60s. Hopefully that
 

6297
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:29,750
to come back under 60s. Hopefully that
makes sense. Uh hopefully you can see

6298
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:29,760
makes sense. Uh hopefully you can see
 

6299
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:31,430
makes sense. Uh hopefully you can see
that this is where the seller's pain

6300
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:31,440
that this is where the seller's pain
 

6301
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:33,349
that this is where the seller's pain
point was. So that was I literally moved

6302
02:16:33,349 --> 02:16:33,359
point was. So that was I literally moved
 

6303
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:34,870
point was. So that was I literally moved
straight to 60s. I'm like no reason to

6304
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:34,880
straight to 60s. I'm like no reason to
 

6305
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:36,389
straight to 60s. I'm like no reason to
come back. Oh, this is going to [\h__\h]

6355
02:19:18,479 --> 02:19:20,309

right, so your TPS are into this block

6356
02:19:20,309 --> 02:19:20,319
right, so your TPS are into this block
 

6357
02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:22,070
right, so your TPS are into this block
here. I can't believe they knocked me

6358
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:22,080
here. I can't believe they knocked me
 

6359
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:24,309
here. I can't believe they knocked me
out to do that. Your TPS are into here.

02:19:24,309 --> 02:19:24,319
out to do that. Your TPS are into here.
 

6361
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:26,230
out to do that. Your TPS are into here.
If they rip through this, it is worth

6362
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:26,240
If they rip through this, it is worth
 

6363
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:28,150
If they rip through this, it is worth
holding a little piece in case they come

6364
02:19:28,150 --> 02:19:28,160
holding a little piece in case they come
 

6365
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,469
holding a little piece in case they come
right back for this. Right. So, I would

6366
02:19:30,469 --> 02:19:30,479
right back for this. Right. So, I would
 

6367
02:19:30,479 --> 02:19:33,030
right back for this. Right. So, I would
be like 80 90% out here. It is worth

6368
02:19:33,030 --> 02:19:33,040
be like 80 90% out here. It is worth
 

6369
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:34,709
be like 80 90% out here. It is worth
holding a little piece in case they come

6370
02:19:34,709 --> 02:19:34,719
holding a little piece in case they come
 

6371
02:19:34,719 --> 02:19:37,429
holding a little piece in case they come
back for this. It is possible, right?

6372
02:19:37,429 --> 02:19:37,439
back for this. It is possible, right?
 

6373
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:39,349
back for this. It is possible, right?
You're going to get this for sure. It is

6374
02:19:39,349 --> 02:19:39,359
You're going to get this for sure. It is
 

6375
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:41,750
You're going to get this for sure. It is
possible they do this. It is possible

6376
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
possible they do this. It is possible
 

6377
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,150
possible they do this. It is possible
they do this if they get a close and a

6378
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:44,160
they do this if they get a close and a
 

6379
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,629
they do this if they get a close and a
hold over 800. So you can hold a little

6380
02:19:46,629 --> 02:19:46,639
hold over 800. So you can hold a little
 

6381
02:19:46,639 --> 02:19:47,990
hold over 800. So you can hold a little
piece for that. I'm coming right back.

6382
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:48,000
piece for that. I'm coming right back.
 

6383
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,349
piece for that. I'm coming right back.
I'm gonna get some milk for this. I'm

6384
02:19:49,349 --> 02:19:49,359

Oh my god.
Oh my god. All right, guys. Make sure

6390
02:20:40,309 --> 02:20:40,319
Oh my god. All right, guys. Make sure
 

6391
02:20:40,319 --> 02:20:42,630
Oh my god. All right, guys. Make sure
you're paying yourself. I'd say like at

6392
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:42,640
you're paying yourself. I'd say like at
 

6393
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:44,790
you're paying yourself. I'd say like at
least 80%. All right, you probably took

6394
02:20:44,790 --> 02:20:44,800
least 80%. All right, you probably took
 

6395
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:47,670
least 80%. All right, you probably took
some here, some here. There's no

6396
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:47,680
some here, some here. There's no
 

6397
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:49,190
some here, some here. There's no
guarantee we go higher, but you can hold

6398
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:49,200
guarantee we go higher, but you can hold
 

6399
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:51,190
guarantee we go higher, but you can hold
like if you were trading micros, say you

6400
02:20:51,190 --> 02:20:51,200
like if you were trading micros, say you
 

6401
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:53,349
like if you were trading micros, say you
had like 10 10 micros on or 20 micros

6402
02:20:53,349 --> 02:20:53,359
had like 10 10 micros on or 20 micros
 

6403
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:55,270

02:23:59,359 --> 02:24:00,790
left, right, and all over the place cuz
you want to show off. But in natural

6556
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:00,800
you want to show off. But in natural
 

6557
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:02,870
you want to show off. But in natural
fact, all you do is you get frustrated,

6558
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:02,880
fact, all you do is you get frustrated,
 

6559
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:04,389
fact, all you do is you get frustrated,
you snap your golf club over your knee,

6560
02:24:04,389 --> 02:24:04,399
you snap your golf club over your knee,
 

6561
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:05,429
you snap your golf club over your knee,
and then you need to go and buy another

6562
02:24:05,429 --> 02:24:05,439
and then you need to go and buy another
 

6563
02:24:05,439 --> 02:24:07,590
and then you need to go and buy another
one. But if you got your eight iron out,

6564
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:07,600
one. But if you got your eight iron out,
 

6565
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:09,750
one. But if you got your eight iron out,
all right, you might come in 10 over par

6566
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:09,760
all right, you might come in 10 over par
 

6567
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:12,070
all right, you might come in 10 over par
or whatever for the whole 18 holes, but

6568
02:24:12,070 --> 02:24:12,080
or whatever for the whole 18 holes, but
 

6569
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,750
or whatever for the whole 18 holes, but
you probably keep your balls, you don't

6570
02:24:13,750 --> 02:24:13,760
you probably keep your balls, you don't
 

6571
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,510
you probably keep your balls, you don't
be frustrated, and you play some decent

6572
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:15,520
be frustrated, and you play some decent
 

6573
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:30,070
be frustrated, and you play some decent
shots.

6574
02:24:30,070 --> 02:24:30,080

 

6575
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:35,190

I know, Fresh Trader. I know it is.

6576
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:35,200
I know, Fresh Trader. I know it is.
 

6577
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:36,950
I know, Fresh Trader. I know it is.
I know it is. I might have to rethink

6578
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:36,960
I know it is. I might have to rethink
 

6579
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:38,630
I know it is. I might have to rethink
stuff. I'm trying to play off nodes and

6580
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:38,640
stuff. I'm trying to play off nodes and
 

6581
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:39,910
stuff. I'm trying to play off nodes and
sometimes they're just swiping me. I

6582
02:24:39,910 --> 02:24:39,920
sometimes they're just swiping me. I
 

6583
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:41,030
sometimes they're just swiping me. I
might have to give stuff a little bit

6584
02:24:41,030 --> 02:24:41,040
might have to give stuff a little bit
 

6585
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,309
might have to give stuff a little bit
more room. Look, we're starting to base

6586
02:24:42,309 --> 02:24:42,319
more room. Look, we're starting to base
 

6587
02:24:42,319 --> 02:24:44,950
more room. Look, we're starting to base
over this New York open. Now, ES is

6588
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:44,960
over this New York open. Now, ES is
 

6589
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:47,110
over this New York open. Now, ES is
still not at it 24-hour VWAP or New York

6590
02:24:47,110 --> 02:24:47,120
still not at it 24-hour VWAP or New York
 

6591
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:50,070
still not at it 24-hour VWAP or New York
Open. This has got a shot here. Um, this

6592
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:50,080
Open. This has got a shot here. Um, this
 

6593
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:51,590
Open. This has got a shot here. Um, this
has got a shot here. Do not be a new

6594
02:24:51,590 --> 02:24:51,600
has got a shot here. Do not be a new
 

6595
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:53,110
has got a shot here. Do not be a new
money long, but if you're long in this,

6596
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:53,120
money long, but if you're long in this,
 

6597
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,429
money long, but if you're long in this,
this has got a shot of this, right? If

6598
02:24:55,429 --> 02:24:55,439
this has got a shot of this, right? If
 

6599
02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:58,070
this has got a shot of this, right? If
we collapse this, this is your rotation

6600
02:24:58,070 --> 02:24:58,080
we collapse this, this is your rotation
 

6601
02:24:58,080 --> 02:24:59,510
we collapse this, this is your rotation
back down. We have some nodes here that

6602
02:24:59,510 --> 02:24:59,520
back down. We have some nodes here that
 

6603
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:01,270
back down. We have some nodes here that
might come and protect. So, you'd want

6604
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:01,280
might come and protect. So, you'd want
 

6605
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:03,030
might come and protect. So, you'd want
this to base, but if it can base here,

6606
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:03,040
this to base, but if it can base here,
 

6607
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:05,349
this to base, but if it can base here,
you've got a shot. You have absolutely

6608
02:25:05,349 --> 02:25:05,359
you've got a shot. You have absolutely
 

6609
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:25,429
you've got a shot. You have absolutely
got a shot at it.

6610
02:25:25,429 --> 02:25:25,439

 

6611
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:28,309

What's that about micros and contracts?

6612
02:25:28,309 --> 02:25:28,319
What's that about micros and contracts?
 

6613
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:32,070
What's that about micros and contracts?
Oh, well, if you're trading minis,

6614
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:32,080
Oh, well, if you're trading minis,
 

6615
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:34,550
Oh, well, if you're trading minis,
right? So, depending on size account,

6616
02:25:34,550 --> 02:25:34,560
right? So, depending on size account,
 

6617
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:36,230
right? So, depending on size account,
it's very unlikely you're trading like

6618
02:25:36,230 --> 02:25:36,240
it's very unlikely you're trading like
 

6619
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:38,070
it's very unlikely you're trading like
10 plus minis down here, isn't it? Or

6620
02:25:38,070 --> 02:25:38,080
10 plus minis down here, isn't it? Or
 

6621
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:39,910
10 plus minis down here, isn't it? Or
five minis, right? unless you've got a

6622
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:39,920
five minis, right? unless you've got a
 

6623
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,830
five minis, right? unless you've got a
massive account or unless you're way way

6624
02:25:41,830 --> 02:25:41,840
massive account or unless you're way way
 

6625
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:43,670
massive account or unless you're way way
over leveraged in risk. So, it's more

6626
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:43,680
over leveraged in risk. So, it's more
 

6627
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:45,590
over leveraged in risk. So, it's more
likely that you're probably trading

6628
02:25:45,590 --> 02:25:45,600
likely that you're probably trading
 

6629
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:47,590
likely that you're probably trading
micros or maybe one or two minis. So, if

6630
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:47,600
micros or maybe one or two minis. So, if
 

6631
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:48,790
micros or maybe one or two minis. So, if
you're trading one or two minis, then

6632
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:48,800
you're trading one or two minis, then
 

6633
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:50,950
you're trading one or two minis, then
you'd be taking one off there and maybe

6634
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:50,960
you'd be taking one off there and maybe
 

6635
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,630
you'd be taking one off there and maybe
you're one off here or maybe you're just

6636
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:52,640
you're one off here or maybe you're just
 

6637
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,309
you're one off here or maybe you're just
moving your stop real tight trading that

6638
02:25:54,309 --> 02:25:54,319
moving your stop real tight trading that
 

6639
02:25:54,319 --> 02:25:56,630
moving your stop real tight trading that
one. If you're trading micros,

6640
02:25:56,630 --> 02:25:56,640
one. If you're trading micros,
 

6641
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:58,630
one. If you're trading micros,
right, for the difference of one to two

6642
02:25:58,630 --> 02:25:58,640
right, for the difference of one to two
 

6643
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:00,309
right, for the difference of one to two
minis, you could be trading 10 to 20

6644
02:26:00,309 --> 02:26:00,319
minis, you could be trading 10 to 20
 

6645
02:26:00,319 --> 02:26:01,830
minis, you could be trading 10 to 20
micros, for example. You could maybe

6646
02:26:01,830 --> 02:26:01,840
micros, for example. You could maybe
 

6647
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,670
micros, for example. You could maybe
just be trading five micros. So, we come

6648
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:03,680
just be trading five micros. So, we come
 

6649
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:05,190
just be trading five micros. So, we come
up here. Let's say you're 10 micros

6650
02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:05,200
up here. Let's say you're 10 micros
 

6651
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:08,230
up here. Let's say you're 10 micros
long, right? So, we sell three. we sell

6652
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:08,240
long, right? So, we sell three. we sell
 

6653
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:10,790
long, right? So, we sell three. we sell
maybe three more and we hold, you know,

6654
02:26:10,790 --> 02:26:10,800
maybe three more and we hold, you know,
 

6655
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:12,630
maybe three more and we hold, you know,
the last four to get up here. Or maybe

6656
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:12,640
the last four to get up here. Or maybe
 

6657
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,389
the last four to get up here. Or maybe
you sell four and four and you're

6658
02:26:14,389 --> 02:26:14,399
you sell four and four and you're
 

6659
02:26:14,399 --> 02:26:15,910
you sell four and four and you're
holding two in case you get up here, for

6660
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:15,920
holding two in case you get up here, for
 

6661
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:17,349
holding two in case you get up here, for
example. It just gives you a little bit

6662
02:26:17,349 --> 02:26:17,359
example. It just gives you a little bit
 

6663
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:18,950
example. It just gives you a little bit
more flexibility to capture the full

6664
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:18,960
more flexibility to capture the full
 

6665
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:21,510
more flexibility to capture the full
move. And it's also very good for, you

6666
02:26:21,510 --> 02:26:21,520
move. And it's also very good for, you
 

6667
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,590
move. And it's also very good for, you
know, being used to sitting in the

6668
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:23,600
know, being used to sitting in the
 

6669
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:25,270
know, being used to sitting in the
moves, right? If you're trading minis,

6670
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:25,280
moves, right? If you're trading minis,
 

6671
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:26,230
moves, right? If you're trading minis,
especially if you're new, you're

6672
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:26,240
especially if you're new, you're
 

6673
02:26:26,240 --> 02:26:27,030
especially if you're new, you're
probably seeing it up here and you're

6674
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:27,040
probably seeing it up here and you're
 

6675
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:28,550
probably seeing it up here and you're
like, "Oh, I'm up 300 bucks. I'm I'm

6676
02:26:28,550 --> 02:26:28,560
like, "Oh, I'm up 300 bucks. I'm I'm
 

6677
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:29,990
like, "Oh, I'm up 300 bucks. I'm I'm
done. I'm done. I'm done." Then you're

6678
02:26:29,990 --> 02:26:30,000
done. I'm done. I'm done." Then you're
 

6679
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,349
done. I'm done. I'm done." Then you're
going to watch it do this whole move

6680
02:26:31,349 --> 02:26:31,359
going to watch it do this whole move
 

6681
02:26:31,359 --> 02:26:33,590
going to watch it do this whole move
without you because you haven't built up

6682
02:26:33,590 --> 02:26:33,600
without you because you haven't built up
 

6683
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:35,349
without you because you haven't built up
the tolerance and resilience to

6684
02:26:35,349 --> 02:26:35,359
the tolerance and resilience to
 

6685
02:26:35,359 --> 02:26:42,790
the tolerance and resilience to
understand that this can do this.

6686
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:42,800

 

6687
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:45,349

Just passed my first ever eval watching

6688
02:26:45,349 --> 02:26:45,359
Just passed my first ever eval watching
 

6689
02:26:45,359 --> 02:26:48,389
Just passed my first ever eval watching
you. Nice. Congratulations.

6690
02:26:48,389 --> 02:26:48,399
you. Nice. Congratulations.
 

6691
02:26:48,399 --> 02:26:50,710
you. Nice. Congratulations.
Uh the only thing with micros is it will

6692
02:26:50,710 --> 02:26:50,720
Uh the only thing with micros is it will
 

6693
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:52,309
Uh the only thing with micros is it will
cost you more for the round trip. Right?

6694
02:26:52,309 --> 02:26:52,319
cost you more for the round trip. Right?
 

6695
02:26:52,319 --> 02:26:54,309
cost you more for the round trip. Right?
10 micros versus one mini will cost you

6696
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:54,319
10 micros versus one mini will cost you
 

6697
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:56,950
10 micros versus one mini will cost you
a little bit more from the round trip.

6698
02:26:56,950 --> 02:26:56,960
a little bit more from the round trip.
 

6699
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,710
a little bit more from the round trip.
But like if you wanted to move from one

6700
02:26:58,710 --> 02:26:58,720
But like if you wanted to move from one
 

6701
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:00,790
But like if you wanted to move from one
mini to two minis, I would say you'd be

6702
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:00,800
mini to two minis, I would say you'd be
 

6703
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:03,429
mini to two minis, I would say you'd be

I'm actually not doing that at the

02:29:45,910 --> 02:29:45,920
I'm actually not doing that at the
 

6823
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:47,750
I'm actually not doing that at the
moment. I was doing it and what I was

6824
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:47,760
moment. I was doing it and what I was
 

6825
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:49,349
moment. I was doing it and what I was
finding is too many accounts and they'd

6826
02:29:49,349 --> 02:29:49,359
finding is too many accounts and they'd
 

6827
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:51,110
finding is too many accounts and they'd
be lagging and then some wouldn't fill

6828
02:29:51,110 --> 02:29:51,120
be lagging and then some wouldn't fill

6857
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,270

What's the ticker? This is NQ. You're

6858
02:30:33,270 --> 02:30:33,280
What's the ticker? This is NQ. You're
 

6859
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:39,110
What's the ticker? This is NQ. You're
looking at NQ. For anyone just joining,

6860
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:39,120

 

6861
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:40,950

what are your confluences taking the

6862
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:40,960
what are your confluences taking the
 

6863
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:44,550
what are your confluences taking the
trade? uh trapped trapped participants,

6864
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:44,560
trade? uh trapped trapped participants,
 

6865
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:47,030
trade? uh trapped trapped participants,
right? Trapped parti understanding what

6866
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:47,040
right? Trapped parti understanding what
 

6867
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,630
right? Trapped parti understanding what
type of day we're in, understanding the

6868
02:30:48,630 --> 02:30:48,640
type of day we're in, understanding the
 

6869
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:50,710
type of day we're in, understanding the
loc location and then looking for

6870
02:30:50,710 --> 02:30:50,720
loc location and then looking for
 

6871
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:52,309
loc location and then looking for
trapped participants. You would have

6872
02:30:52,309 --> 02:30:52,319
trapped participants. You would have
 

6873
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:54,870
trapped participants. You would have
heard me today. I wanted to get long

6874
02:30:54,870 --> 02:30:54,880
heard me today. I wanted to get long
 

6875
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:56,309
heard me today. I wanted to get long
here for this. We got long there for

6876
02:30:56,309 --> 02:30:56,319
here for this. We got long there for
 

6877
02:30:56,319 --> 02:30:58,389
here for this. We got long there for
that once shorts were trapped. I wanted

6878
02:30:58,389 --> 02:30:58,399
that once shorts were trapped. I wanted
 

6879
02:30:58,399 --> 02:31:00,870
that once shorts were trapped. I wanted
to get short here once we left this for

6880
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:00,880
to get short here once we left this for
 

6881
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:03,990
to get short here once we left this for
a move back down to here and then Alex

6882
02:31:03,990 --> 02:31:04,000
a move back down to here and then Alex
 

6883
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,230
a move back down to here and then Alex
sold or covered before the news and we

6884
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:06,240
sold or covered before the news and we
 

6885
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,830
sold or covered before the news and we
ped the whole way down for the gap fill.

6886
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:07,840
ped the whole way down for the gap fill.
 

6887
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,349
ped the whole way down for the gap fill.
Once we filled the gap, the market is

6888
02:31:09,349 --> 02:31:09,359
Once we filled the gap, the market is
 

6889
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:10,950
Once we filled the gap, the market is
now efficient, right? There's no reason

6890
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:10,960
now efficient, right? There's no reason
 

6891
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:13,190
now efficient, right? There's no reason
for this market to go lower in one go.

6892
02:31:13,190 --> 02:31:13,200
for this market to go lower in one go.
 

6893
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:14,950
for this market to go lower in one go.
We know that shorts kept getting stuck

6894
02:31:14,950 --> 02:31:14,960
We know that shorts kept getting stuck
 

6895
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:18,309
We know that shorts kept getting stuck
down here. We know that we're at 2.5

6896
02:31:18,309 --> 02:31:18,319
down here. We know that we're at 2.5
 

6897
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:20,790
down here. We know that we're at 2.5
standard deviations on a daily. That is

6898
02:31:20,790 --> 02:31:20,800
standard deviations on a daily. That is
 

6899
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:23,110
standard deviations on a daily. That is
unsustainable on a daily. So, we are not

6900
02:31:23,110 --> 02:31:23,120
unsustainable on a daily. So, we are not
 

6901
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:25,429
unsustainable on a daily. So, we are not
going to sell the low of day, low of

6902
02:31:25,429 --> 02:31:25,439
going to sell the low of day, low of
 

6903
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:27,349
going to sell the low of day, low of
week, low of month, low of quarter, low

6904
02:31:27,349 --> 02:31:27,359
week, low of month, low of quarter, low

move to do that when you understand what

move to do that when you understand what
 

6909
02:31:32,319 --> 02:31:33,590
move to do that when you understand what
it is. So, what are we going to look

6910
02:31:33,590 --> 02:31:33,600
it is. So, what are we going to look
 

6911
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:35,670
it is. So, what are we going to look
for? these trap sellers who don't

6912
02:31:35,670 --> 02:31:35,680
for? these trap sellers who don't

understand that to compiling in and

02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:39,670
understand that to compiling in and
we're going to position their pain point

6916
02:31:39,670 --> 02:31:39,680
we're going to position their pain point
 

6917
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:41,590
we're going to position their pain point
against them for the mean reversion back

6918
02:31:41,590 --> 02:31:41,600

We've built out traders. We have trap
 

6925
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:50,230
We've built out traders. We have trap
shorts at the lows. We trade the other

02:31:50,230 --> 02:31:50,240
shorts at the lows. We trade the other
 

6927
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:51,990
shorts at the lows. We trade the other
way to them. There you go. That's the

6928
02:31:51,990 --> 02:31:52,000
way to them. There you go. That's the

6945
02:32:12,399 --> 02:32:14,230

Look at spy as well. It hit the 75s.

6946
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:14,240
Look at spy as well. It hit the 75s.
 

6947
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:16,389
Look at spy as well. It hit the 75s.
Didn't come flat in 75s, but hit 75s.

6948
02:32:16,389 --> 02:32:16,399
Didn't come flat in 75s, but hit 75s.
 

6949
02:32:16,399 --> 02:32:18,469
Didn't come flat in 75s, but hit 75s.
Q's hit the 93s on that little nasty

6950
02:32:18,469 --> 02:32:18,479
Q's hit the 93s on that little nasty
 

6951
02:32:18,479 --> 02:32:21,030
Q's hit the 93s on that little nasty
flash as well. Really good.

6952
02:32:21,030 --> 02:32:21,040
flash as well. Really good.
 

6953
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:24,950
flash as well. Really good.
Um,

6954
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:24,960

 

6955
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,469

okay. I would cut this down if I was

6956
02:32:26,469 --> 02:32:26,479
okay. I would cut this down if I was
 

6957
02:32:26,479 --> 02:32:28,230
okay. I would cut this down if I was
you. You don't want to have this drift

6958
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:28,240
you. You don't want to have this drift
 

6959
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:29,590
you. You don't want to have this drift
all the way down. But you know, you

6960
02:32:29,590 --> 02:32:29,600
all the way down. But you know, you
 

6961
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:31,429
all the way down. But you know, you
manage as as you want. But there can be

6962
02:32:31,429 --> 02:32:31,439
manage as as you want. But there can be
 

6963
02:32:31,439 --> 02:32:33,590
manage as as you want. But there can be
a retest of the 713s. If they don't hold

6964
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:33,600
a retest of the 713s. If they don't hold
 

6965
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:35,190
a retest of the 713s. If they don't hold
New York open, they can retest right

6966
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:35,200
New York open, they can retest right
 

6967
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,270
New York open, they can retest right
down into here. You do not. But we're

6968
02:32:37,270 --> 02:32:37,280
down into here. You do not. But we're
 

6969
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:38,710
down into here. You do not. But we're
straight up. You do not want to give all

6970
02:32:38,710 --> 02:32:38,720
straight up. You do not want to give all
 

6971
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:39,990
straight up. You do not want to give all
this back, right? You do not want to

6972
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:40,000
this back, right? You do not want to
 

6973
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,230
this back, right? You do not want to
give all this back on the long. Still

6974
02:32:42,230 --> 02:32:42,240
give all this back on the long. Still
 

6975
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,349
give all this back on the long. Still
think there's a chance for it to come up

6976
02:32:43,349 --> 02:32:43,359
think there's a chance for it to come up
 

6977
02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:45,110
think there's a chance for it to come up
here, but I would not be willing to see

6978
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:45,120
here, but I would not be willing to see
 

6979
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,349
here, but I would not be willing to see
that move happen if I was you. I'm

6980
02:32:47,349 --> 02:32:47,359
that move happen if I was you. I'm
 

6981
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:49,830
that move happen if I was you. I'm
already out. Like we said, I'd be 80

6982
02:32:49,830 --> 02:32:49,840
already out. Like we said, I'd be 80
 

6983
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,910
already out. Like we said, I'd be 80
plus% out where we are because this was

6984
02:32:51,910 --> 02:32:51,920
plus% out where we are because this was
 

6985
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:53,750
plus% out where we are because this was
the target. This this node here was the

6986
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:53,760
the target. This this node here was the
 

6987
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:56,150
the target. This this node here was the
target, right? The runner, if you got

6988
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,160
target, right? The runner, if you got
 

6989
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,790
target, right? The runner, if you got
very lucky, would be up here.

6990
02:32:58,790 --> 02:32:58,800
very lucky, would be up here.
 

6991
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:00,630
very lucky, would be up here.
And how we operate down here now becomes

6992
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:00,640
And how we operate down here now becomes
 

6993
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:06,150
And how we operate down here now becomes
key because this is the base out.

6994
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,160
key because this is the base out.
 

6995
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:09,429
key because this is the base out.
Failed break up. How we operate here now

6996
02:33:09,429 --> 02:33:09,439
Failed break up. How we operate here now
 

6997
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:11,110
Failed break up. How we operate here now
becomes key. If they base out here, they

6998
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:11,120
becomes key. If they base out here, they
 

6999
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:12,790
becomes key. If they base out here, they
will have another go to get higher. They

7000
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:12,800
will have another go to get higher. They
 

7001
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:15,190
will have another go to get higher. They
base out down here, right? Because

7002
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:15,200
base out down here, right? Because
 

7003
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:16,870
base out down here, right? Because
that's where all the sellers are now

7004
02:33:16,870 --> 02:33:16,880
that's where all the sellers are now
 

7005
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:20,230
that's where all the sellers are now
stuck. So this would be a breakout

7006
02:33:20,230 --> 02:33:20,240
stuck. So this would be a breakout
 

7007
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:22,230
stuck. So this would be a breakout
retest. If they hold this retest

7008
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:22,240
retest. If they hold this retest
 

7009
02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:24,150
retest. If they hold this retest
something like this, you can potentially

7010
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:24,160
something like this, you can potentially
 

7011
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:26,469
something like this, you can potentially
get a long back up. If we come back into

7012
02:33:26,469 --> 02:33:26,479
get a long back up. If we come back into
 

7013
02:33:26,479 --> 02:33:28,389
get a long back up. If we come back into
here, I would just leave this zone alone

7014
02:33:28,389 --> 02:33:28,399
here, I would just leave this zone alone
 

7015
02:33:28,399 --> 02:33:29,830
here, I would just leave this zone alone
for the rest of the day. I would not

7016
02:33:29,830 --> 02:33:29,840
for the rest of the day. I would not
 

7017
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:33,190
for the rest of the day. I would not
touch anything from 700 to 550 for the

7018
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:33,200
touch anything from 700 to 550 for the
 

7019
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:34,790
touch anything from 700 to 550 for the
rest of the day. Completely ignore that

7020
02:33:34,790 --> 02:33:34,800
rest of the day. Completely ignore that
 

7021
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:36,309
rest of the day. Completely ignore that
zone.

7022
02:33:36,309 --> 02:33:36,319
zone.
 

7023
02:33:36,319 --> 02:33:55,830
zone.
In my mind, that's how I would trade it.

7024
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:55,840

 

7025
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:58,230

Do I see a short opportunity? Not right

7026
02:33:58,230 --> 02:33:58,240
Do I see a short opportunity? Not right
 

7027
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:01,830
Do I see a short opportunity? Not right
now. Not unless we do something nasty.

7028
02:34:01,830 --> 02:34:01,840
now. Not unless we do something nasty.
 

7029
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:06,550
now. Not unless we do something nasty.
Um maybe up into all of this maybe but

7030
02:34:06,550 --> 02:34:06,560
Um maybe up into all of this maybe but
 

7031
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:09,030
Um maybe up into all of this maybe but
all right not not right now. Not right

7032
02:34:09,030 --> 02:34:09,040
all right not not right now. Not right
 

7033
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:10,790
all right not not right now. Not right
now. I think the shorts have the shorts

7034
02:34:10,790 --> 02:34:10,800
now. I think the shorts have the shorts
 

7035
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:12,870
now. I think the shorts have the shorts
are gone for me for a while. We need to

7036
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:12,880
are gone for me for a while. We need to
 

7037
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:14,309
are gone for me for a while. We need to
build out liquidity for a while now

7038
02:34:14,309 --> 02:34:14,319
build out liquidity for a while now
 

7039
02:34:14,319 --> 02:34:15,750
build out liquidity for a while now
before we think about any more short

7040
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:15,760
before we think about any more short
 

7041
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:17,990
before we think about any more short
trades. Okay. Just based on where we are

7042
02:34:17,990 --> 02:34:18,000
trades. Okay. Just based on where we are
 

7043
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,590
trades. Okay. Just based on where we are
higher time frames.

7044
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:21,600
higher time frames.
 

7045
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:22,870
higher time frames.
Based on where we are high in time

7046
02:34:22,870 --> 02:34:22,880
Based on where we are high in time
 

7047
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:27,910
Based on where we are high in time
frames. Um

7048
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:27,920

 

7049
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:29,910

what does IB stand for? Initial balance.

7050
02:34:29,910 --> 02:34:29,920
what does IB stand for? Initial balance.
 

7051
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:31,270
what does IB stand for? Initial balance.
Does your trading course include the

7052
02:34:31,270 --> 02:34:31,280
Does your trading course include the
 

7053
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,630
Does your trading course include the
order flow as well, or do I need to get

7054
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:32,640
order flow as well, or do I need to get
 

7055
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:34,309
order flow as well, or do I need to get
the volume order flow course separately?

7056
02:34:34,309 --> 02:34:34,319
the volume order flow course separately?
 

7057
02:34:34,319 --> 02:34:35,830
the volume order flow course separately?
You can get it as a bundle. You'll save

7058
02:34:35,830 --> 02:34:35,840
You can get it as a bundle. You'll save
 

7059
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:38,230
You can get it as a bundle. You'll save
like a $100 or $150 if you get them both

7060
02:34:38,230 --> 02:34:38,240
like a $100 or $150 if you get them both
 

7061
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:40,389
like a $100 or $150 if you get them both
at once. It might well get up here. You

7062
02:34:40,389 --> 02:34:40,399
at once. It might well get up here. You
 

7063
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:41,830
at once. It might well get up here. You
might well get your targets here, folks.

7064
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:41,840
might well get your targets here, folks.
 

7065
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:44,309
might well get your targets here, folks.
We will see. Um, is it smart to move

7066
02:34:44,309 --> 02:34:44,319
We will see. Um, is it smart to move
 

7067
02:34:44,319 --> 02:34:45,910
We will see. Um, is it smart to move
stop loss to break even as soon as

7068
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:45,920
stop loss to break even as soon as
 

7069
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:48,150
stop loss to break even as soon as
available? No. It caused me to lose some

7070
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:48,160
available? No. It caused me to lose some
 

7071
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:50,150
available? No. It caused me to lose some
trades, but also save me from losers. If

7072
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:50,160
trades, but also save me from losers. If
 

7073
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,070
trades, but also save me from losers. If
you're positioning well, you shouldn't

7074
02:34:52,070 --> 02:34:52,080
you're positioning well, you shouldn't
 

7075
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:54,710
you're positioning well, you shouldn't
really be moving to break even until

7076
02:34:54,710 --> 02:34:54,720
really be moving to break even until
 

7077
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:57,590
really be moving to break even until
that that the run has proved itself,

7078
02:34:57,590 --> 02:34:57,600
that that the run has proved itself,
 

7079
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:58,790
that that the run has proved itself,
right? Depends on what you're doing.

7080
02:34:58,790 --> 02:34:58,800
right? Depends on what you're doing.
 

7081
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:01,030
right? Depends on what you're doing.
Like in something like this, I will move

7082
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:01,040
Like in something like this, I will move
 

7083
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:02,790
Like in something like this, I will move
to break even. The moment we accelerate

7084
02:35:02,790 --> 02:35:02,800
to break even. The moment we accelerate
 

7085
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:04,309
to break even. The moment we accelerate
away and we break out. Okay, I'm break

7086
02:35:04,309 --> 02:35:04,319
away and we break out. Okay, I'm break
 

7087
02:35:04,319 --> 02:35:05,750
away and we break out. Okay, I'm break
even. It's got no reason to come back

7088
02:35:05,750 --> 02:35:05,760
even. It's got no reason to come back
 

7089
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:07,670
even. It's got no reason to come back
down below this. All right, and then

7090
02:35:07,670 --> 02:35:07,680
down below this. All right, and then
 

7091
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:09,990
down below this. All right, and then
I'll hold. But like it it depends on

7092
02:35:09,990 --> 02:35:10,000
I'll hold. But like it it depends on
 

7093
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,910
I'll hold. But like it it depends on
your positioning. Like if you got break

7094
02:35:11,910 --> 02:35:11,920
your positioning. Like if you got break
 

7095
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:13,429
your positioning. Like if you got break
even too early here, you're going to get

7096
02:35:13,429 --> 02:35:13,439
even too early here, you're going to get
 

7097
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:15,510
even too early here, you're going to get
knocked out three or four times, right,

7098
02:35:15,510 --> 02:35:15,520
knocked out three or four times, right,
 

7099
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:17,270
knocked out three or four times, right,
before it does that move, which does

7100
02:35:17,270 --> 02:35:17,280
before it does that move, which does
 

7101
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:19,110
before it does that move, which does
happen to me sometimes. But you don't

7102
02:35:19,110 --> 02:35:19,120
happen to me sometimes. But you don't
 

7103
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:20,550
happen to me sometimes. But you don't
want to move break even too quick. You

7104
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:20,560
want to move break even too quick. You
 

7105
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:21,910
want to move break even too quick. You
want to move break even when the when

7106
02:35:21,910 --> 02:35:21,920
want to move break even when the when
 

7107
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:27,670
want to move break even when the when
the trade's proven itself to you.

7108
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:27,680

 

7109
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:31,030

Can it hit today's high? Um, what do you

7110
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:31,040
Can it hit today's high? Um, what do you
 

7111
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:33,349
Can it hit today's high? Um, what do you
mean by today's high? Uh, GlobeEx high

7112
02:35:33,349 --> 02:35:33,359
mean by today's high? Uh, GlobeEx high
 

7113
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:35,030
mean by today's high? Uh, GlobeEx high
or New York high. It can hit New York

7114
02:35:35,030 --> 02:35:35,040
or New York high. It can hit New York
 

7115
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:36,870
or New York high. It can hit New York
high potentially. It's got to get

7116
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:36,880
high potentially. It's got to get
 

7117
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:38,230
high potentially. It's got to get
through all of this first, right? So,

7118
02:35:38,230 --> 02:35:38,240
through all of this first, right? So,
 

7119
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:40,150
through all of this first, right? So,
it's got to get over this to this. Then

7120
02:35:40,150 --> 02:35:40,160
it's got to get over this to this. Then
 

7121
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:41,990
it's got to get over this to this. Then
we probably do this for a bit. And if it

7122
02:35:41,990 --> 02:35:42,000
we probably do this for a bit. And if it
 

7123
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:45,030
we probably do this for a bit. And if it
does this, we could fill this gap, which

7124
02:35:45,030 --> 02:35:45,040
does this, we could fill this gap, which
 

7125
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:47,670
does this, we could fill this gap, which
we haven't filled. We could come up into

7126
02:35:47,670 --> 02:35:47,680
we haven't filled. We could come up into
 

7127
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:49,830
we haven't filled. We could come up into
this value area, and we could hit that

7128
02:35:49,830 --> 02:35:49,840
this value area, and we could hit that
 

7129
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:51,349
this value area, and we could hit that
potentially

7130
02:35:51,349 --> 02:35:51,359
potentially
 

7131
02:35:51,359 --> 02:35:53,270
potentially
uh to get into high of day up here,

7132
02:35:53,270 --> 02:35:53,280
uh to get into high of day up here,
 

7133
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:55,349
uh to get into high of day up here,
which is GlobeEx. We're asking quite a

7134
02:35:55,349 --> 02:35:55,359
which is GlobeEx. We're asking quite a
 

7135
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:57,510
which is GlobeEx. We're asking quite a
lot of it. We're asking quite a lot of

7136
02:35:57,510 --> 02:35:57,520
lot of it. We're asking quite a lot of
 

7137
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:00,630
lot of it. We're asking quite a lot of
it, but can't rule it out.

7138
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:00,640
it, but can't rule it out.
 

7139
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:02,150
it, but can't rule it out.
I would say it's more likely that we

7140
02:36:02,150 --> 02:36:02,160
I would say it's more likely that we
 

7141
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:09,670
I would say it's more likely that we
just rotate.

7142
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:09,680

 

7143
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:11,349

Why not back to VPO? I mean, it could

7144
02:36:11,349 --> 02:36:11,359
Why not back to VPO? I mean, it could
 

7145
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:12,710
Why not back to VPO? I mean, it could
come all the way back down to here, but

7146
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:12,720
come all the way back down to here, but
 

7147
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:16,309
come all the way back down to here, but
we've just broken out of here. So,

7148
02:36:16,309 --> 02:36:16,319
we've just broken out of here. So,
 

7149
02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:18,309
we've just broken out of here. So,
we would think that it might want to

7150
02:36:18,309 --> 02:36:18,319
we would think that it might want to
 

7151
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:20,070
we would think that it might want to
hold this first, then assuming it comes

7152
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:20,080
hold this first, then assuming it comes
 

7153
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:22,070
hold this first, then assuming it comes
all the way back down. It's possible,

7154
02:36:22,070 --> 02:36:22,080
all the way back down. It's possible,
 

7155
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:23,349
all the way back down. It's possible,
but it would need to get under this

7156
02:36:23,349 --> 02:36:23,359
but it would need to get under this
 

7157
02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:25,190
but it would need to get under this
first. So I think there's probably this

7158
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,200
first. So I think there's probably this
 

7159
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:27,190
first. So I think there's probably this
builds out first unless they complete

7160
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:27,200
builds out first unless they complete
 

7161
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:30,469
builds out first unless they complete
this in one go. So I would be very very

7162
02:36:30,469 --> 02:36:30,479
this in one go. So I would be very very
 

7163
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:32,389
this in one go. So I would be very very
careful about thinking about being

7164
02:36:32,389 --> 02:36:32,399
careful about thinking about being
 

7165
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:34,070
careful about thinking about being

02:36:35,990 --> 02:36:36,000
this this
 

7169
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,469
this this
and now you've got VWAP above this key

7170
02:36:38,469 --> 02:36:38,479
and now you've got VWAP above this key
 

7171
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:40,950
and now you've got VWAP above this key

7175
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:45,670

right? We knew their exact position
 

7199
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:11,429

7209
02:37:20,319 --> 02:37:22,230
So if buyers step in here, they will
have another go and then if they use

have another go and then if they use
 

7211
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:24,230
have another go and then if they use
this liquidity, they'll go higher. If

7212

this liquidity, they'll go higher. If
 

7213
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:25,830

7313
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,429

It's why you got to look really far back

7314
02:39:15,429 --> 02:39:15,439
It's why you got to look really far back
 

7315
02:39:15,439 --> 02:39:18,230
It's why you got to look really far back
for like untested gaps.

7316
02:39:18,230 --> 02:39:18,240
for like untested gaps.
 

7317
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:21,110
for like untested gaps.
Um, what do you make of this? 820

7318
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:21,120
Um, what do you make of this? 820
 

7319
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:22,710
Um, what do you make of this? 820
looking left. Been a big resistance

7320
02:39:22,710 --> 02:39:22,720
looking left. Been a big resistance
 

7321
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:28,630
looking left. Been a big resistance
since overnight. 820.

7322
02:39:28,630 --> 02:39:28,640

 

7323
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:31,110

I mean, yeah, I mean, it's a key level.

7324
02:39:31,110 --> 02:39:31,120
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's a key level.
 

7325
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:32,469
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's a key level.
That's why we've got the gray box there.

7326
02:39:32,469 --> 02:39:32,479
That's why we've got the gray box there.
 

7327
02:39:32,479 --> 02:39:35,349
That's why we've got the gray box there.
The nodes here or here about over over

7328
02:39:35,349 --> 02:39:35,359
The nodes here or here about over over
 

7329
02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:38,630
The nodes here or here about over over
820 though. very thin in New York up to

7330
02:39:38,630 --> 02:39:38,640
820 though. very thin in New York up to
 

7331
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:41,030
820 though. very thin in New York up to
here. So, a break over this. What I'd be

7332
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:41,040
here. So, a break over this. What I'd be
 

7333
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:42,389
here. So, a break over this. What I'd be
very careful about, like I talked about,

7334
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:42,399
very careful about, like I talked about,
 

7335
02:39:42,399 --> 02:39:44,230
very careful about, like I talked about,
is something like this happening for the

7336
02:39:44,230 --> 02:39:44,240
is something like this happening for the
 

7337
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:45,670
is something like this happening for the
rest of the day. So, I'd be very

7338
02:39:45,670 --> 02:39:45,680
rest of the day. So, I'd be very
 

7339
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:47,429
rest of the day. So, I'd be very
careful. The shorts, I guess,

7340
02:39:47,429 --> 02:39:47,439
careful. The shorts, I guess,
 

7341
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:48,550
careful. The shorts, I guess,
technically, if we're going to do a

7342
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:48,560
technically, if we're going to do a
 

7343
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:51,510
technically, if we're going to do a
rotation day, all right, it could be a

7344
02:39:51,510 --> 02:39:51,520
rotation day, all right, it could be a
 

7345
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:52,870
rotation day, all right, it could be a
short back down to here, but I do not

7346
02:39:52,870 --> 02:39:52,880
short back down to here, but I do not
 

7347
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:54,790
short back down to here, but I do not
like that. Not now that we've left this.

7348
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:54,800
like that. Not now that we've left this.
 

7349
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:56,070
like that. Not now that we've left this.
All right, all the sellers are trapped

7350
02:39:56,070 --> 02:39:56,080
All right, all the sellers are trapped
 

7351
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:59,110
All right, all the sellers are trapped
down here. My expectation would be if

7352
02:39:59,110 --> 02:39:59,120
down here. My expectation would be if
 

7353
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:00,469
down here. My expectation would be if
buyers want to step in, they want to

7354
02:40:00,469 --> 02:40:00,479
buyers want to step in, they want to
 

7355
02:40:00,479 --> 02:40:02,870
buyers want to step in, they want to
step in down here. Remember, we are deep

7356
02:40:02,870 --> 02:40:02,880
step in down here. Remember, we are deep
 

7357
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:05,910
step in down here. Remember, we are deep
discount down here on every single even

7358
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:05,920
discount down here on every single even
 

7359
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:08,389
discount down here on every single even
on a even on the current year, we would

7360
02:40:08,389 --> 02:40:08,399
on a even on the current year, we would
 

7361
02:40:08,399 --> 02:40:10,870
on a even on the current year, we would
be deep discount down here. All right?

7362
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:10,880
be deep discount down here. All right?
 

7363
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:13,030
be deep discount down here. All right?
So, it's very possible it wants to come

7364
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:13,040
So, it's very possible it wants to come
 

7365
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:15,590
So, it's very possible it wants to come
a bit higher before they resell. That's

7366
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:15,600
a bit higher before they resell. That's
 

7367
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:17,110
a bit higher before they resell. That's
not to say you can't scalp it, but

7368
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:17,120
not to say you can't scalp it, but
 

7369
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:18,870
not to say you can't scalp it, but
remember, I'm looking to position on

7370
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:18,880
remember, I'm looking to position on
 

7371
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:25,830
remember, I'm looking to position on
highly probable multi-time frame moves.

7372
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:25,840

 

7373
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:27,750

7403
02:41:00,479 --> 02:41:02,389
the other side of value? All right. And
we're still holding above these pivots.

7404
02:41:02,389 --> 02:41:02,399
we're still holding above these pivots.
 

7405

we're still holding above these pivots.
Look in here. This where that seller got

7411
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:14,230
holding 40. I wouldn't know any of this
on Trading View. So, that's why it's uh

7412
02:41:14,230 --> 02:41:14,240
on Trading View. So, that's why it's uh
 

7413
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:15,910
on Trading View. So, that's why it's uh
Look at the What did we just talk about,

7421
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:27,349

but something like this can be possible.

7422
02:41:27,349 --> 02:41:27,359
but something like this can be possible.
 

7423
02:41:27,359 --> 02:41:29,429

I literally just told you it. That's not

I literally just told you it. That's not
 

7425
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:30,710
I literally just told you it. That's not
me being arrogant and that's why I'm

7426
02:41:30,710 --> 02:41:30,720
me being arrogant and that's why I'm
 

7427
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:33,349
me being arrogant and that's why I'm
saying like you got to understand who's

7428
02:41:33,349 --> 02:41:33,359
saying like you got to understand who's
 

7429
02:41:33,359 --> 02:41:35,030
saying like you got to understand who's
trapped now. These shorts are trapped

7430
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:35,040
trapped now. These shorts are trapped
 

7431
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:36,870
trapped now. These shorts are trapped
down here. They are not being let out.

There's the pullback. If they build this

7434
02:41:38,950 --> 02:41:38,960
There's the pullback. If they build this
 

7435
02:41:38,960 --> 02:41:41,030
There's the pullback. If they build this
liquidity now, the squeeze will happen

7436
02:41:41,030 --> 02:41:41,040
liquidity now, the squeeze will happen
 

7437
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:43,590
liquidity now, the squeeze will happen
back to here. Okay?

7438
02:41:43,590 --> 02:41:43,600
back to here. Okay?
 

7439
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:45,670

folks.
Don't say I didn't tell you. Don't say I

7482
02:42:53,110 --> 02:42:53,120
Don't say I didn't tell you. Don't say I
 

7483
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:58,309
Don't say I didn't tell you. Don't say I
didn't tell you.

7484
02:42:58,309 --> 02:42:58,319

 

7485
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:00,389

ES into New York open here. All right.

7486
02:43:00,389 --> 02:43:00,399
ES into New York open here. All right.
 

7487
02:43:00,399 --> 02:43:02,389
ES into New York open here. All right.
Big level ES here. If ES gets through

7488
02:43:02,389 --> 02:43:02,399
Big level ES here. If ES gets through
 

7489
02:43:02,399 --> 02:43:05,110
Big level ES here. If ES gets through
the New York open, then it can afford a

7490
02:43:05,110 --> 02:43:05,120
the New York open, then it can afford a
 

7491
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:07,349
the New York open, then it can afford a
squeeze up to 63. So this big level here

7492
02:43:07,349 --> 02:43:07,359
squeeze up to 63. So this big level here
 

7493
02:43:07,359 --> 02:43:10,230
squeeze up to 63. So this big level here
of ES at 53 is 10 points higher if it

7494
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:10,240
of ES at 53 is 10 points higher if it
 

7495
02:43:10,240 --> 02:43:12,230
of ES at 53 is 10 points higher if it
wants to do it. We've just swiped here.

7496
02:43:12,230 --> 02:43:12,240
wants to do it. We've just swiped here.
 

7497
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:13,750
wants to do it. We've just swiped here.
So you want to see a base out now and

7498
02:43:13,750 --> 02:43:13,760
So you want to see a base out now and
 

7499
02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:15,510
So you want to see a base out now and
hold. You do not want to see them stuff

7500
02:43:15,510 --> 02:43:15,520
hold. You do not want to see them stuff
 

7501
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:18,710
hold. You do not want to see them stuff
this. Let me see who got caught in this.

7502
02:43:18,710 --> 02:43:18,720
this. Let me see who got caught in this.
 

7503
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:20,389
this. Let me see who got caught in this.
You do not want to see them stuff this

7504
02:43:20,389 --> 02:43:20,399
You do not want to see them stuff this
 

7505
02:43:20,399 --> 02:43:22,630
You do not want to see them stuff this
with buyers caught. We're going to get

7506
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:22,640
with buyers caught. We're going to get
 

7507
02:43:22,640 --> 02:43:25,750
with buyers caught. We're going to get
any data. There we go. So, some buyers

7508
02:43:25,750 --> 02:43:25,760
any data. There we go. So, some buyers
 

7509
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:27,510
any data. There we go. So, some buyers
got caught above 26s. So, they need to

7510
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:27,520
got caught above 26s. So, they need to
 

7511
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:30,710
got caught above 26s. So, they need to
get back above the 26s here on the cues

7512
02:43:30,710 --> 02:43:30,720
get back above the 26s here on the cues
 

7513
02:43:30,720 --> 02:43:32,309
get back above the 26s here on the cues
and then we're going to get a move up

7514
02:43:32,309 --> 02:43:32,319
and then we're going to get a move up
 

7515
02:43:32,319 --> 02:43:34,469
and then we're going to get a move up
into these 80s

7516
02:43:34,469 --> 02:43:34,479
into these 80s
 

7517
02:43:34,479 --> 02:43:36,070
into these 80s
and you're going to get full TP if you

7518
02:43:36,070 --> 02:43:36,080
and you're going to get full TP if you
 

7519
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:37,429
and you're going to get full TP if you
held through that. Or if you bought that

7520
02:43:37,429 --> 02:43:37,439
held through that. Or if you bought that
 

7521
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:39,270
held through that. Or if you bought that
dip into flow zones before, like I said,

7522
02:43:39,270 --> 02:43:39,280
dip into flow zones before, like I said,
 

7523
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:40,309
dip into flow zones before, like I said,
I wouldn't be short here. I think

7524
02:43:40,309 --> 02:43:40,319
I wouldn't be short here. I think
 

7525
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:41,830
I wouldn't be short here. I think
they'll probably reclaim. I would cut

7526
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:41,840
they'll probably reclaim. I would cut
 

7527
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:43,830
they'll probably reclaim. I would cut
the long and then they'll probably

7528
02:43:43,830 --> 02:43:43,840
the long and then they'll probably
 

7529
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:46,710
the long and then they'll probably
reclaim. And here we go.

7530
02:43:46,710 --> 02:43:46,720
reclaim. And here we go.
 

7531
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:47,990
reclaim. And here we go.
Like I said, don't know what I'm talking

7532
02:43:47,990 --> 02:43:48,000
Like I said, don't know what I'm talking
 

7533
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:55,269
Like I said, don't know what I'm talking
about.

7534
02:43:55,269 --> 02:43:55,279

 

7535
02:43:55,279 --> 02:43:56,950

How long have I been trading for? Uh,

7536
02:43:56,950 --> 02:43:56,960
How long have I been trading for? Uh,
 

7537
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:58,790
How long have I been trading for? Uh,
full-time, like six or seven years. But

7538
02:43:58,790 --> 02:43:58,800
full-time, like six or seven years. But
 

7539
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:01,510
full-time, like six or seven years. But
I mean, I started when I was 21, so half

7540
02:44:01,510 --> 02:44:01,520
I mean, I started when I was 21, so half
 

7541
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:08,710
I mean, I started when I was 21, so half
my life ago.

7542
02:44:08,710 --> 02:44:08,720

 

7543
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:10,389

Yeah, whoever went short at the bottom

7544
02:44:10,389 --> 02:44:10,399
Yeah, whoever went short at the bottom
 

7545
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:14,550
Yeah, whoever went short at the bottom
haven't done Alex's course quite right.

7546
02:44:14,550 --> 02:44:14,560
haven't done Alex's course quite right.
 

7547
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:15,910
haven't done Alex's course quite right.

guys. Would it be smart to start looking

7556
02:44:24,389 --> 02:44:24,399
guys. Would it be smart to start looking
 

7557
02:44:24,399 --> 02:44:26,389
guys. Would it be smart to start looking
for a short down to lows of day? Not

7558
02:44:26,389 --> 02:44:26,399
for a short down to lows of day? Not
 

7559
02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:28,309
for a short down to lows of day? Not
right now. Right, we just went over

7560
02:44:28,309 --> 02:44:28,319
right now. Right, we just went over
 

7561
02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:29,830
right now. Right, we just went over
this. Maybe you said that before.

7562
02:44:29,830 --> 02:44:29,840
this. Maybe you said that before.
 

7563
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:32,230
this. Maybe you said that before.
Remember, shorts are caught in here

7564
02:44:32,230 --> 02:44:32,240
Remember, shorts are caught in here
 

7565
02:44:32,240 --> 02:44:34,630
Remember, shorts are caught in here
right now. Here's the rotation and lots

7566
02:44:34,630 --> 02:44:34,640
right now. Here's the rotation and lots
 

7567
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:36,389
right now. Here's the rotation and lots
of them caught at the lows. We have

7568
02:44:36,389 --> 02:44:36,399
of them caught at the lows. We have
 

7569
02:44:36,399 --> 02:44:38,389
of them caught at the lows. We have
broken out. All right, this is a very

7570
02:44:38,389 --> 02:44:38,399
broken out. All right, this is a very
 

7571
02:44:38,399 --> 02:44:40,309
broken out. All right, this is a very
small woff type thing. All right, this

7572
02:44:40,309 --> 02:44:40,319
small woff type thing. All right, this
 

7573
02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:41,830
small woff type thing. All right, this
little wick here, there's a fail

7574
02:44:41,830 --> 02:44:41,840
little wick here, there's a fail
 

7575
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:43,670
little wick here, there's a fail
breakout. There's your spring. There's

7576
02:44:43,670 --> 02:44:43,680
breakout. There's your spring. There's
 

7577
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:45,429
breakout. There's your spring. There's
your sign of strength. There's the

7578
02:44:45,429 --> 02:44:45,439
your sign of strength. There's the
 

7579
02:44:45,439 --> 02:44:47,750
your sign of strength. There's the
pullback to hold. There's the volume.

7580
02:44:47,750 --> 02:44:47,760
pullback to hold. There's the volume.
 

7581
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:49,590
pullback to hold. There's the volume.
All right. This is a key level. Now, if

7582
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:49,600
All right. This is a key level. Now, if
 

7583
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:51,830
All right. This is a key level. Now, if
we hold this, the rotation is on and

7584
02:44:51,830 --> 02:44:51,840
we hold this, the rotation is on and
 

7585
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:53,670
we hold this, the rotation is on and
they have reasons to go higher. We can

7586
02:44:53,670 --> 02:44:53,680
they have reasons to go higher. We can
 

7587
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:55,670
they have reasons to go higher. We can
come and test previous day value area

7588
02:44:55,670 --> 02:44:55,680
come and test previous day value area
 

7589
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:57,429
come and test previous day value area
low. We can come and test the IB. We can

7590
02:44:57,429 --> 02:44:57,439
low. We can come and test the IB. We can
 

7591
02:44:57,439 --> 02:44:59,349
low. We can come and test the IB. We can
come and close the New York gap. We can

7592
02:44:59,349 --> 02:44:59,359
come and close the New York gap. We can
 

7593
02:44:59,359 --> 02:45:01,830
come and close the New York gap. We can
come up to current uh profile from the

7594
02:45:01,830 --> 02:45:01,840
come up to current uh profile from the
 

7595
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:03,269
come up to current uh profile from the
developing week. We can come and test

7596
02:45:03,269 --> 02:45:03,279
developing week. We can come and test
 

7597
02:45:03,279 --> 02:45:06,710
developing week. We can come and test
this naked point of control. We can come

7598
02:45:06,710 --> 02:45:06,720
this naked point of control. We can come
 

7599
02:45:06,720 --> 02:45:08,550
this naked point of control. We can come
all the way up here. If they want to

7600
02:45:08,550 --> 02:45:08,560
all the way up here. If they want to
 

7601
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:12,710
all the way up here. If they want to
really [\h__\h] send it, they can. So why

7602
02:45:12,710 --> 02:45:12,720
really [\h__\h] send it, they can. So why
 

7603
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:14,469
really [\h__\h] send it, they can. So why
be short against this right now? Look at

7604
02:45:14,469 --> 02:45:14,479
be short against this right now? Look at
 

7605
02:45:14,479 --> 02:45:16,150
be short against this right now? Look at
the structure we've left. This is

7606
02:45:16,150 --> 02:45:16,160
the structure we've left. This is
 

7607
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:17,590
the structure we've left. This is
bullish structure, right? This is

7608
02:45:17,590 --> 02:45:17,600
bullish structure, right? This is
 

7609
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:20,389
bullish structure, right? This is
bearish structure. This is flattening.

7610
02:45:20,389 --> 02:45:20,399
bearish structure. This is flattening.
 

7611
02:45:20,399 --> 02:45:22,710
bearish structure. This is flattening.
This is breakout, pullback, hold. We're

7612
02:45:22,710 --> 02:45:22,720
This is breakout, pullback, hold. We're
 

7613
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:24,630
This is breakout, pullback, hold. We're
in the next leg higher. Do not be trying

7614
02:45:24,630 --> 02:45:24,640
in the next leg higher. Do not be trying
 

7615
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:26,710
in the next leg higher. Do not be trying
to short this. You will be guessing for

7616
02:45:26,710 --> 02:45:26,720
to short this. You will be guessing for
 

7617
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:28,309
to short this. You will be guessing for
the rotation which is not given you.

7618
02:45:28,309 --> 02:45:28,319
the rotation which is not given you.
 

7619
02:45:28,319 --> 02:45:30,070
the rotation which is not given you.
Same way down here. We don't just long

7620
02:45:30,070 --> 02:45:30,080
Same way down here. We don't just long
 

7621
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:32,550
Same way down here. We don't just long
for no reason. We wait. It's got good

7622
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:32,560
for no reason. We wait. It's got good
 

7623
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,070
for no reason. We wait. It's got good
reason to come up into this node. And

7624
02:45:34,070 --> 02:45:34,080
reason to come up into this node. And
 

7625
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,429
reason to come up into this node. And
it's possible if we get through this

7626
02:45:35,429 --> 02:45:35,439
it's possible if we get through this
 

7627
02:45:35,439 --> 02:45:40,309
it's possible if we get through this
gray box. I would not rule out this.

7628
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:40,319
gray box. I would not rule out this.
 

7629
02:45:40,319 --> 02:45:42,870
gray box. I would not rule out this.
I would not rule out that. That is a 500

7630
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:42,880
I would not rule out that. That is a 500
 

7631
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:44,870
I would not rule out that. That is a 500
[\h__\h] point trade. But uh it's

7632
02:45:44,870 --> 02:45:44,880
[\h__\h] point trade. But uh it's
 

7633
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:46,309
[\h__\h] point trade. But uh it's
possible. It' be it would take a long

7634
02:45:46,309 --> 02:45:46,319
possible. It' be it would take a long
 

7635
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:48,389
possible. It' be it would take a long
time to get there. But probable is to

7636
02:45:48,389 --> 02:45:48,399
time to get there. But probable is to
 

7637
02:45:48,399 --> 02:45:52,630
time to get there. But probable is to
here right now is to like 90s. Possible

7638
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:52,640
here right now is to like 90s. Possible
 

7639
02:45:52,640 --> 02:46:00,630
here right now is to like 90s. Possible
is a 500 point trade up there.

7640

7735
02:47:48,399 --> 02:47:49,910
this doesn't hold this gray box now, be
careful of a flush back down. What's the

They might well hold this gray box

7744
02:47:58,230 --> 02:47:58,240
They might well hold this gray box
 

7745
02:47:58,240 --> 02:47:59,830
They might well hold this gray box
still. This is still your key level. You

7746
02:47:59,830 --> 02:47:59,840
still. This is still your key level. You
 

7747
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:01,590
still. This is still your key level. You
do not want them to lose this. All

7748
02:48:01,590 --> 02:48:01,600
do not want them to lose this. All
 

7749
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:02,710
do not want them to lose this. All
right, this is where they're trying to

7750
02:48:02,710 --> 02:48:02,720
right, this is where they're trying to
 

7751
02:48:02,720 --> 02:48:05,510
right, this is where they're trying to
complete. We missed it by or like 20

7752
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:05,520
complete. We missed it by or like 20
 

7753
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:07,349
complete. We missed it by or like 20
points. If they hold this, they're going

7754
02:48:07,349 --> 02:48:07,359
points. If they hold this, they're going
 

7755
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:08,710
points. If they hold this, they're going
to have one more shot at it. So, this

7756
02:48:08,710 --> 02:48:08,720
to have one more shot at it. So, this
 

7757
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:10,469
to have one more shot at it. So, this
gray box, see this gray box, this volume

7758
02:48:10,469 --> 02:48:10,479
gray box, see this gray box, this volume
 

7759
02:48:10,479 --> 02:48:12,630
gray box, see this gray box, this volume
node, is still bidding off this trying

7760
02:48:12,630 --> 02:48:12,640
node, is still bidding off this trying
 

7761
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:14,710
node, is still bidding off this trying
to get up into here. All right, you

7762
02:48:14,710 --> 02:48:14,720
to get up into here. All right, you
 

7763
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:16,070
to get up into here. All right, you
don't need to cut the trade until you

7764
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:16,080
don't need to cut the trade until you
 

7765
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:17,429
don't need to cut the trade until you
come under that gray box. Under that

02:48:17,429 --> 02:48:17,439
come under that gray box. Under that
 

7767
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:24,550
come under that gray box. Under that

02:51:22,870 --> 02:51:22,880
easy for them to hide uh contracts doing
 

7907
02:51:22,880 --> 02:51:24,630
easy for them to hide uh contracts doing
that. The best thing about futures is

7908
02:51:24,630 --> 02:51:24,640
that. The best thing about futures is
 

7909
02:51:24,640 --> 02:51:26,870
that. The best thing about futures is
it's centralized on CME. So, we have

7910
02:51:26,870 --> 02:51:26,880
it's centralized on CME. So, we have
 

7911
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:29,590
it's centralized on CME. So, we have
centralized data. They can't, you know,

7912
02:51:29,590 --> 02:51:29,600
centralized data. They can't, you know,
 

7913
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:32,469
centralized data. They can't, you know,
they can't hide in the same way. And

7914
02:51:32,469 --> 02:51:32,479
they can't hide in the same way. And
 

7915
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:36,230
they can't hide in the same way. And
that's why it's for me where the edge

7916
02:51:36,230 --> 02:51:36,240
that's why it's for me where the edge
 

7917
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:38,710
that's why it's for me where the edge
is, right? For the me where the edges is

7918
02:51:38,710 --> 02:51:38,720
is, right? For the me where the edges is
 

7919
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:40,469
is, right? For the me where the edges is
understanding we have all the data in

7920
02:51:40,469 --> 02:51:40,479
understanding we have all the data in
 

7921
02:51:40,479 --> 02:51:41,830
understanding we have all the data in
front of us. It's quite literally

7922
02:51:41,830 --> 02:51:41,840
front of us. It's quite literally
 

7923
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:43,670
front of us. It's quite literally
showing you who's trapped, where they're

7924
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:43,680
showing you who's trapped, where they're
 

7925
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:45,190
showing you who's trapped, where they're
trapped, where the levels are. It's just

7926
02:51:45,190 --> 02:51:45,200
trapped, where the levels are. It's just
 

7927
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:46,389
trapped, where the levels are. It's just
do you have the discipline and

7928
02:51:46,389 --> 02:51:46,399
do you have the discipline and
 

7929
02:51:46,399 --> 02:51:48,150
do you have the discipline and
understanding? That took me a little bit

7930
02:51:48,150 --> 02:51:48,160
understanding? That took me a little bit
 

7931
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:49,990
understanding? That took me a little bit
of time. From then it became much

7932
02:51:49,990 --> 02:51:50,000
of time. From then it became much
 

7933
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:54,710
of time. From then it became much
easier.

7934
02:51:54,710 --> 02:51:54,720

 

7935
02:51:54,720 --> 02:51:56,550

Does the indicator in the course include

7936
02:51:56,550 --> 02:51:56,560
Does the indicator in the course include
 

7937
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:58,469
Does the indicator in the course include
the gray boxes? No. No. No indicator

7938
02:51:58,469 --> 02:51:58,479
the gray boxes? No. No. No indicator
 

7939
02:51:58,479 --> 02:52:00,790
the gray boxes? No. No. No indicator
includes these. I draw these on. I draw

7940
02:52:00,790 --> 02:52:00,800
includes these. I draw these on. I draw
 

7941
02:52:00,800 --> 02:52:02,230
includes these. I draw these on. I draw
these on. You can draw these on. Look,

7942
02:52:02,230 --> 02:52:02,240
these on. You can draw these on. Look,
 

7943
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,830
these on. You can draw these on. Look,
all you have to do is get the profile

7944
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:03,840
all you have to do is get the profile
 

7945
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:05,429
all you have to do is get the profile
and draw them on based on the profile.

7946
02:52:05,429 --> 02:52:05,439
and draw them on based on the profile.
 

7947
02:52:05,439 --> 02:52:06,790
and draw them on based on the profile.
All right. If we start losing this, I

7948
02:52:06,790 --> 02:52:06,800
All right. If we start losing this, I
 

7949
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:08,389
All right. If we start losing this, I
would cut this trade. This is a failed

7950
02:52:08,389 --> 02:52:08,399
would cut this trade. This is a failed
 

7951
02:52:08,399 --> 02:52:10,150
would cut this trade. This is a failed
opportunity to break higher. They might

7952
02:52:10,150 --> 02:52:10,160
opportunity to break higher. They might
 

7953
02:52:10,160 --> 02:52:12,150
opportunity to break higher. They might
be really dirty and dip down to 45, but

7954
02:52:12,150 --> 02:52:12,160
be really dirty and dip down to 45, but
 

7955
02:52:12,160 --> 02:52:13,349
be really dirty and dip down to 45, but
I would cut this trade now that you're

7956
02:52:13,349 --> 02:52:13,359
I would cut this trade now that you're
 

7957
02:52:13,359 --> 02:52:15,830
I would cut this trade now that you're
losing this. I personally, I would not

7958
02:52:15,830 --> 02:52:15,840
losing this. I personally, I would not
 

7959
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:17,670
losing this. I personally, I would not
be holding on to this, right?

7960
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:17,680
be holding on to this, right?
 

7961
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:19,910
be holding on to this, right?
Personally, they might be really dirty

7962
02:52:19,910 --> 02:52:19,920
Personally, they might be really dirty
 

7963
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:23,349
Personally, they might be really dirty
and do this. But personally, I would not

7964
02:52:23,349 --> 02:52:23,359
and do this. But personally, I would not
 

7965
02:52:23,359 --> 02:52:25,110
and do this. But personally, I would not
be keeping holding on to this. They if

7966
02:52:25,110 --> 02:52:25,120
be keeping holding on to this. They if
 

7967
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:26,790
be keeping holding on to this. They if
they lose this gray box, I would just

7968
02:52:26,790 --> 02:52:26,800
they lose this gray box, I would just
 

7969
02:52:26,800 --> 02:52:28,790
they lose this gray box, I would just
let it go. Just be happy with what

7970
02:52:28,790 --> 02:52:28,800
let it go. Just be happy with what
 

7971
02:52:28,800 --> 02:52:30,389
let it go. Just be happy with what
you've got. But, you know, maybe some of

7972
02:52:30,389 --> 02:52:30,399
you've got. But, you know, maybe some of
 

7973
02:52:30,399 --> 02:52:32,710
you've got. But, you know, maybe some of
you are still positioned from here and

7974
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:32,720
you are still positioned from here and
 

7975
02:52:32,720 --> 02:52:34,309
you are still positioned from here and
you can afford to to hold a better

7976
02:52:34,309 --> 02:52:34,319
you can afford to to hold a better
 

7977
02:52:34,319 --> 02:52:35,830
you can afford to to hold a better
position. But those of you who are long

7978
02:52:35,830 --> 02:52:35,840
position. But those of you who are long
 

7979
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:37,110
position. But those of you who are long
from here, I wouldn't give the whole

7980
02:52:37,110 --> 02:52:37,120
from here, I wouldn't give the whole
 

7981
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:43,510
from here, I wouldn't give the whole
thing back.

7982
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:43,520

 

7983
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:48,309

Uh few more questions here and then
 

8007
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:31,110
Uh few more questions here and then
we'll do these giveaways. Folks,

8008
02:53:31,110 --> 02:53:31,120
we'll do these giveaways. Folks,
 

8009
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:33,110
we'll do these giveaways. Folks,
do I view the world through bookmap or

02:53:33,110 --> 02:53:33,120
do I view the world through bookmap or
 

8011
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:34,870
do I view the world through bookmap or
like Neo in the matrix? Yeah, exactly

8012
02:53:34,870 --> 02:53:34,880
like Neo in the matrix? Yeah, exactly
 

8013
02:53:34,880 --> 02:53:44,870
like Neo in the matrix? Yeah, exactly
that.

8014
02:53:44,870 --> 02:53:44,880

 

8015
02:53:44,880 --> 02:53:46,870

This is a healthy uptrend. Uh yeah.

8016
02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:46,880
This is a healthy uptrend. Uh yeah.
 

8017
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:50,389
This is a healthy uptrend. Uh yeah.
Well, we're we're we're in a downtrend.

8018
02:53:50,389 --> 02:53:50,399
Well, we're we're we're in a downtrend.
 

8019
02:53:50,399 --> 02:53:54,150
Well, we're we're we're in a downtrend.
I can draw like if we think about

8020
02:53:54,150 --> 02:53:54,160
I can draw like if we think about
 

8021
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:56,230
I can draw like if we think about
think about what's happened, right? So

8022
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:56,240
think about what's happened, right? So
 

8023
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:59,269
think about what's happened, right? So
the daily did this for a while, right?

8024
02:53:59,269 --> 02:53:59,279
the daily did this for a while, right?
 

8025
02:53:59,279 --> 02:54:00,870
the daily did this for a while, right?
And then this is what the daily is

8026
02:54:00,870 --> 02:54:00,880
And then this is what the daily is
 

8027
02:54:00,880 --> 02:54:04,309
And then this is what the daily is
doing, right? Currently, we're in this

8028
02:54:04,309 --> 02:54:04,319
doing, right? Currently, we're in this
 

8029
02:54:04,319 --> 02:54:06,469
doing, right? Currently, we're in this
part of the daily, right? We're in this

8030
02:54:06,469 --> 02:54:06,479
part of the daily, right? We're in this
 

8031
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:09,190
part of the daily, right? We're in this
part of the daily. So on a lower time

8032
02:54:09,190 --> 02:54:09,200
part of the daily. So on a lower time
 

8033
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:12,309
part of the daily. So on a lower time
frame today, if we just saw this on a

8034
02:54:12,309 --> 02:54:12,319
frame today, if we just saw this on a
 

8035
02:54:12,319 --> 02:54:16,870
frame today, if we just saw this on a
daily, it would look like this,

8036
02:54:16,870 --> 02:54:16,880

 

8037
02:54:16,880 --> 02:54:18,550

right? That's what we're seeing on a

8038
02:54:18,550 --> 02:54:18,560
right? That's what we're seeing on a
 

8039
02:54:18,560 --> 02:54:21,110
right? That's what we're seeing on a
lower time frame on like an hourly. So

8040
02:54:21,110 --> 02:54:21,120
lower time frame on like an hourly. So
 

8041
02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:24,070
lower time frame on like an hourly. So
we're trying to join this leg here or

8042
02:54:24,070 --> 02:54:24,080
we're trying to join this leg here or
 

8043
02:54:24,080 --> 02:54:26,230
we're trying to join this leg here or
range rotation in here. Now, we don't

8044
02:54:26,230 --> 02:54:26,240
range rotation in here. Now, we don't
 

8045
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:28,070
range rotation in here. Now, we don't
know how far this comes up. Does it come

8046
02:54:28,070 --> 02:54:28,080
know how far this comes up. Does it come
 

8047
02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:30,230
know how far this comes up. Does it come
all the way up to here? Is it possible

8048
02:54:30,230 --> 02:54:30,240
all the way up to here? Is it possible
 

8049
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:33,190
all the way up to here? Is it possible
that they do this? Yep. Is it possible

8050
02:54:33,190 --> 02:54:33,200
that they do this? Yep. Is it possible
 

8051
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:35,030
that they do this? Yep. Is it possible
on a daily that they do this and reject?

8052
02:54:35,030 --> 02:54:35,040
on a daily that they do this and reject?
 

8053
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:36,550
on a daily that they do this and reject?
Yeah. So, we're just playing this leg

8054
02:54:36,550 --> 02:54:36,560
Yeah. So, we're just playing this leg
 

8055
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:38,070
Yeah. So, we're just playing this leg
here on a daily. Right. This is where we

8056
02:54:38,070 --> 02:54:38,080
here on a daily. Right. This is where we
 

8057
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:40,309
here on a daily. Right. This is where we
talk about multi-time frame. The easiest

8058
02:54:40,309 --> 02:54:40,319
talk about multi-time frame. The easiest
 

8059
02:54:40,319 --> 02:54:43,910
talk about multi-time frame. The easiest
trades, right, the layup trades are the

8060
02:54:43,910 --> 02:54:43,920
trades, right, the layup trades are the
 

8061
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,590
trades, right, the layup trades are the
protrend

8062
02:54:45,590 --> 02:54:45,600
protrend
 

8063
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:47,510
protrend
are the protrend. But we are too

8064
02:54:47,510 --> 02:54:47,520
are the protrend. But we are too
 

8065
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:49,750
are the protrend. But we are too
extended now. We've had multi-legg down.

8066
02:54:49,750 --> 02:54:49,760
extended now. We've had multi-legg down.
 

8067
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:52,150
extended now. We've had multi-legg down.
We expect a pullback.

8068
02:54:52,150 --> 02:54:52,160
We expect a pullback.
 

8069
02:54:52,160 --> 02:54:53,510
We expect a pullback.
So, we're trying to play the long for

8070
02:54:53,510 --> 02:54:53,520
So, we're trying to play the long for
 

8071
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:54,870
So, we're trying to play the long for
the relief on the pullback. Hopefully

8072
02:54:54,870 --> 02:54:54,880
the relief on the pullback. Hopefully
 

8073
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:58,550
the relief on the pullback. Hopefully
that makes sense.

8074
02:54:58,550 --> 02:54:58,560

 

8075
02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:00,469

That's where we are in this market at

8076
02:55:00,469 --> 02:55:00,479
That's where we are in this market at
 

8077
02:55:00,479 --> 02:55:02,790
That's where we are in this market at
the moment. So the main trend has been

8078
02:55:02,790 --> 02:55:02,800
the moment. So the main trend has been
 

8079
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:05,190
the moment. So the main trend has been
down, but we are overextended. So to

8080
02:55:05,190 --> 02:55:05,200
down, but we are overextended. So to
 

8081
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:06,950
down, but we are overextended. So to
draw that out for you really quickly as

8082
02:55:06,950 --> 02:55:06,960
draw that out for you really quickly as
 

8083
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:08,309
draw that out for you really quickly as
a lesson, right? I'm going to draw this

8084
02:55:08,309 --> 02:55:08,319
a lesson, right? I'm going to draw this
 

8085
02:55:08,319 --> 02:55:10,630
a lesson, right? I'm going to draw this
out on a line chart.

8086
02:55:10,630 --> 02:55:10,640
out on a line chart.
 

8087
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:12,389
out on a line chart.
Right, this is what happened. The daily

8088
02:55:12,389 --> 02:55:12,399
Right, this is what happened. The daily
 

8089
02:55:12,399 --> 02:55:14,550
Right, this is what happened. The daily
went sideways for ages and ages and

8090
02:55:14,550 --> 02:55:14,560
went sideways for ages and ages and
 

8091
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:16,309
went sideways for ages and ages and
ages. I'm going to like just simplify

8092
02:55:16,309 --> 02:55:16,319
ages. I'm going to like just simplify
 

8093
02:55:16,319 --> 02:55:17,910
ages. I'm going to like just simplify
it. This is what we did on the daily.

8094
02:55:17,910 --> 02:55:17,920
it. This is what we did on the daily.
 

8095
02:55:17,920 --> 02:55:20,230
it. This is what we did on the daily.
Then we did a fail breakout and then

8096
02:55:20,230 --> 02:55:20,240
Then we did a fail breakout and then
 

8097
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:22,950
Then we did a fail breakout and then
this has started. All right, we're here.

8098
02:55:22,950 --> 02:55:22,960
this has started. All right, we're here.
 

8099
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:25,030
this has started. All right, we're here.
We're here. We expect the market

8100
02:55:25,030 --> 02:55:25,040
We're here. We expect the market
 

8101
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:27,990
We're here. We expect the market
probably to do this. All right. Once

8102
02:55:27,990 --> 02:55:28,000
probably to do this. All right. Once
 

8103
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:29,429
probably to do this. All right. Once
it's done this move, it would make a

8104
02:55:29,429 --> 02:55:29,439
it's done this move, it would make a
 

8105
02:55:29,439 --> 02:55:31,830
it's done this move, it would make a
decision. Is it going to come here or is

8106
02:55:31,830 --> 02:55:31,840
decision. Is it going to come here or is
 

8107
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:33,750
decision. Is it going to come here or is
it going to do this and come higher and

8108
02:55:33,750 --> 02:55:33,760
it going to do this and come higher and
 

8109
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:35,429
it going to do this and come higher and
then come down for a retest and then

8110
02:55:35,429 --> 02:55:35,439
then come down for a retest and then
 

8111
02:55:35,439 --> 02:55:36,870
then come down for a retest and then
make a decision of what it's going to

8112
02:55:36,870 --> 02:55:36,880
make a decision of what it's going to
 

8113
02:55:36,880 --> 02:55:38,950
make a decision of what it's going to
do. All right. But we are in this little

8114
02:55:38,950 --> 02:55:38,960
do. All right. But we are in this little
 

8115
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:42,309
do. All right. But we are in this little
part here, right? We don't expect the

8116
02:55:42,309 --> 02:55:42,319
part here, right? We don't expect the
 

8117
02:55:42,319 --> 02:55:43,830
part here, right? We don't expect the
market like we talked about to just keep

8118
02:55:43,830 --> 02:55:43,840
market like we talked about to just keep
 

8119
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:45,910
market like we talked about to just keep
go straight down in one one direction.

8120
02:55:45,910 --> 02:55:45,920
go straight down in one one direction.
 

8121
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:47,910
go straight down in one one direction.
The only time that happens is when

8122
02:55:47,910 --> 02:55:47,920
The only time that happens is when
 

8123
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:49,670
The only time that happens is when
they're dumping inventory. All right? If

8124
02:55:49,670 --> 02:55:49,680
they're dumping inventory. All right? If
 

8125
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:51,670
they're dumping inventory. All right? If
there is like a big black swan event and

8126
02:55:51,670 --> 02:55:51,680
there is like a big black swan event and
 

8127
02:55:51,680 --> 02:55:53,830
there is like a big black swan event and
it's like, "Hey, the market's on fire.

8128
02:55:53,830 --> 02:55:53,840
it's like, "Hey, the market's on fire.
 

8129
02:55:53,840 --> 02:55:55,750
it's like, "Hey, the market's on fire.
We're going to war. Everything's wrong."

8130
02:55:55,750 --> 02:55:55,760
We're going to war. Everything's wrong."
 

8131
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:57,110
We're going to war. Everything's wrong."
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

8132
02:55:57,110 --> 02:55:57,120
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
 

8133
02:55:57,120 --> 02:55:59,510
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Okay. Yeah, maybe COVID, right? COVID

8134
02:55:59,510 --> 02:55:59,520
Okay. Yeah, maybe COVID, right? COVID
 

8135
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:01,910
Okay. Yeah, maybe COVID, right? COVID
type thing. Other than that, it's

8136
02:56:01,910 --> 02:56:01,920
type thing. Other than that, it's
 

8137
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:04,790
type thing. Other than that, it's
probably more likely to look something

8138
02:56:04,790 --> 02:56:04,800
probably more likely to look something
 

8139
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:06,630
probably more likely to look something
like this. Even if we come for the low

8140
02:56:06,630 --> 02:56:06,640
like this. Even if we come for the low
 

8141
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:09,349
like this. Even if we come for the low
or maybe we do this, this and come back

8142
02:56:09,349 --> 02:56:09,359
or maybe we do this, this and come back
 

8143
02:56:09,359 --> 02:56:11,990
or maybe we do this, this and come back
inside here and then reject. Right? So

8144
02:56:11,990 --> 02:56:12,000
inside here and then reject. Right? So
 

8145
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,469
inside here and then reject. Right? So
just understanding the positioning of

8146
02:56:14,469 --> 02:56:14,479
just understanding the positioning of
 

8147
02:56:14,479 --> 02:56:23,750
just understanding the positioning of
how the market moves will help you.

8148
02:56:23,750 --> 02:56:23,760

 

8149
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:26,230

This does Discord come with any of your

8150
02:56:26,230 --> 02:56:26,240
This does Discord come with any of your
 

8151
02:56:26,240 --> 02:56:28,230
This does Discord come with any of your
courses and indicators? Yeah, the 20our

8152
02:56:28,230 --> 02:56:28,240

02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:32,560
course has indicators and Discord in it.
 

8157
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:34,790
course has indicators and Discord in it.
Where do you see ES Spy will go if it

8158
02:56:34,790 --> 02:56:34,800
Where do you see ES Spy will go if it
 

8159
02:56:34,800 --> 02:56:36,950
Where do you see ES Spy will go if it
stays bullish?

8160
02:56:36,950 --> 02:56:36,960
stays bullish?
 

8161
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:39,030
stays bullish?
Well, SPY's just come back into a pivot.

8162
02:56:39,030 --> 02:56:39,040
Well, SPY's just come back into a pivot.
 

8163
02:56:39,040 --> 02:56:43,190
Well, SPY's just come back into a pivot.
So that 81s to 8177 is that old low. So

8164
02:56:43,190 --> 02:56:43,200
So that 81s to 8177 is that old low. So
 

8165
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:45,110
So that 81s to 8177 is that old low. So
it's just rejected that. So you're going

8166
02:56:45,110 --> 02:56:45,120
it's just rejected that. So you're going
 

8167
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:48,469
it's just rejected that. So you're going
to need spy to reclaim 81s and 82s. You

8168
02:56:48,469 --> 02:56:48,479
to need spy to reclaim 81s and 82s. You
 

8169
02:56:48,479 --> 02:56:51,910
to need spy to reclaim 81s and 82s. You
got IB higher 8372s. Once we get through

8170
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:51,920
got IB higher 8372s. Once we get through
 

8171
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:54,389
got IB higher 8372s. Once we get through
that it's going to be tough though. But

8172
02:56:54,389 --> 02:56:54,399
that it's going to be tough though. But
 

8173
02:56:54,399 --> 02:56:55,990
that it's going to be tough though. But
if it could get through if it can get

8174
02:56:55,990 --> 02:56:56,000
if it could get through if it can get
 

8175
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:59,110
if it could get through if it can get
through 8177 which was previous day low.

8176
02:56:59,110 --> 02:56:59,120
through 8177 which was previous day low.
 

8177
02:56:59,120 --> 02:57:01,590
through 8177 which was previous day low.
There is a potential lift to 8372s.

8178
02:57:01,590 --> 02:57:01,600
There is a potential lift to 8372s.
 

8179
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:03,990
There is a potential lift to 8372s.
Through 8372s I'd be watching that pivot

8180
02:57:03,990 --> 02:57:04,000
Through 8372s I'd be watching that pivot
 

8181
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,389
Through 8372s I'd be watching that pivot
low yesterday. 8466s.

8182
02:57:06,389 --> 02:57:06,399
low yesterday. 8466s.
 

8183
02:57:06,399 --> 02:57:09,110
low yesterday. 8466s.
if it can get through that gap fill and

8184
02:57:09,110 --> 02:57:09,120
if it can get through that gap fill and
 

8185
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:12,070
if it can get through that gap fill and
the 50-day at 8620. But you're asking an

8186
02:57:12,070 --> 02:57:12,080
the 50-day at 8620. But you're asking an
 

8187
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:13,910
the 50-day at 8620. But you're asking an
awful lot. It's more likely that we just

8188
02:57:13,910 --> 02:57:13,920
awful lot. It's more likely that we just
 

8189
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:18,469
awful lot. It's more likely that we just
range.

8190
02:57:18,469 --> 02:57:18,479

8303
02:59:53,439 --> 02:59:55,429

every day. But the rotation out of
 

8305
02:59:55,439 --> 02:59:57,910

software has been massive.
 

8307
02:59:57,920 --> 03:00:00,710
software has been massive.

8314
03:00:07,670 --> 03:00:07,680
here. Like I really like this area, but
 

8315
03:00:07,680 --> 03:00:09,510
here. Like I really like this area, but
I don't feel the need to be first in it.

8316
03:00:09,510 --> 03:00:09,520
I don't feel the need to be first in it.
 

8317

8321
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:17,349
60%. It's tempting, man. It's tempting
to put a starter on there. I will be

8322

to put a starter on there. I will be
 

8323
03:00:17,359 --> 03:00:20,070
to put a starter on there. I will be
honest with you. Um

8324
03:00:20,070 --> 03:00:20,080
honest with you. Um
 

8325
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:22,550

but we are dumping out of this is what

8326
03:00:22,550 --> 03:00:22,560
but we are dumping out of this is what
 

8327
03:00:22,560 --> 03:00:25,190
but we are dumping out of this is what
they're rotating out of because the AI

8328
03:00:25,190 --> 03:00:25,200
they're rotating out of because the AI
 

8329
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:26,870
they're rotating out of because the AI
exposure to this they're too worried

8330
03:00:26,870 --> 03:00:26,880
exposure to this they're too worried
 

8331
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:28,790
exposure to this they're too worried
about software. So if we think about

8332
03:00:28,790 --> 03:00:28,800
about software. So if we think about
 

8333
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:32,150
about software. So if we think about
what's Adobe Adobe Same thing dumping

8334
03:00:32,150 --> 03:00:32,160
what's Adobe Adobe Same thing dumping
 

8335

Adobe. It's the same kind of sector,
right? They're dumping anything where

8340
03:00:37,349 --> 03:00:37,359
right? They're dumping anything where
 

8341
03:00:37,359 --> 03:00:39,030
right? They're dumping anything where
they think they've got negative exposure

8342
03:00:39,030 --> 03:00:39,040
they think they've got negative exposure
 

8343
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:41,349
they think they've got negative exposure
to AI, right? So I'd be watching Adobe.

8344
03:00:41,349 --> 03:00:41,359
to AI, right? So I'd be watching Adobe.
 

8345
03:00:41,359 --> 03:00:43,269
to AI, right? So I'd be watching Adobe.

03:01:07,269 --> 03:01:07,279
day. Um but you know, if the market's
 

8365
03:01:07,279 --> 03:01:09,030
day. Um but you know, if the market's
going to bleed more, like if if we're

8366
03:01:09,030 --> 03:01:09,040
going to bleed more, like if if we're
 

8367
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:10,870
going to bleed more, like if if we're
going to bleed more in tech, then we're

8368
03:01:10,870 --> 03:01:10,880
going to bleed more in tech, then we're
 

8369
03:01:10,880 --> 03:01:12,630
going to bleed more in tech, then we're
going to expect these to have weakness.

8370
03:01:12,630 --> 03:01:12,640
going to expect these to have weakness.
 

8371
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:14,870

03:03:15,269 --> 03:03:15,279
they look pretty good. The lagging
 

8459
03:03:15,279 --> 03:03:18,150

03:03:23,349 --> 03:03:23,359
back into metals, right? Which is what
 

8467
03:03:23,359 --> 03:03:26,070
back into metals, right? Which is what
we're seeing. So, out of these, which

8468
03:03:26,070 --> 03:03:26,080
we're seeing. So, out of these, which
 

8469
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:27,510
we're seeing. So, out of these, which
have been up, you know, we tal we went

03:03:27,510 --> 03:03:27,520
have been up, you know, we tal we went
 

8471
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:28,950
have been up, you know, we tal we went
over this yesterday. Worth going back to

8472
03:03:28,950 --> 03:03:28,960
over this yesterday. Worth going back to
 

8473
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:30,309
over this yesterday. Worth going back to
yesterday's stream and having a watch.

8474

yesterday's stream and having a watch.
 

8475
03:03:30,319 --> 03:03:32,230
yesterday's stream and having a watch.
Like some of these are up hundreds and

8476
03:03:32,230 --> 03:03:32,240
Like some of these are up hundreds and
 

8477
03:03:32,240 --> 03:03:35,030
Like some of these are up hundreds and
thousands of percent. These are all

8478
03:03:35,030 --> 03:03:35,040
thousands of percent. These are all
 

8479
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:38,389
thousands of percent. These are all
lagging behind. These are very, very

8480
03:03:38,389 --> 03:03:38,399
lagging behind. These are very, very
 

8481
03:03:38,399 --> 03:03:40,309
lagging behind. These are very, very
easy sectors to hold in. like we are

8482
03:03:40,309 --> 03:03:40,319
easy sectors to hold in. like we are
 

8483
03:03:40,319 --> 03:03:41,990
easy sectors to hold in. like we are
always going to Costco's always going to

8484
03:03:41,990 --> 03:03:42,000
always going to Costco's always going to
 

8485
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:43,590
always going to Costco's always going to
be there. All these Coca-Cola, they're

8486
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:43,600
be there. All these Coca-Cola, they're
 

8487
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:44,630
be there. All these Coca-Cola, they're
always going to be there. So, we're

8488
03:03:44,630 --> 03:03:44,640
always going to be there. So, we're
 

8489
03:03:44,640 --> 03:03:47,269
always going to be there. So, we're
going back into lagging sectors because

8490
03:03:47,269 --> 03:03:47,279
going back into lagging sectors because
 

8491
03:03:47,279 --> 03:03:48,870
going back into lagging sectors because
we're going risk off. All right. So,

8492
03:03:48,870 --> 03:03:48,880
we're going risk off. All right. So,
 

8493
03:03:48,880 --> 03:04:02,469
we're going risk off. All right. So,
we're rotating out. All right. Out of

8494
03:04:02,469 --> 03:04:02,479

 

8495
03:04:02,479 --> 03:04:06,070

right, we're rotating out of parabolic

8496
03:04:06,070 --> 03:04:06,080
right, we're rotating out of parabolic
 

8497
03:04:06,080 --> 03:04:11,990
right, we're rotating out of parabolic
markets.

8498
03:04:11,990 --> 03:04:12,000

 

8499
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:19,670

out of parabolic markets which are up

8500
03:04:19,670 --> 03:04:19,680

 

8501
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:21,590

2,000%

8502
03:04:21,590 --> 03:04:21,600
2,000%
 

8503
03:04:21,600 --> 03:04:24,870
2,000%
since the low in 22. All right, into

8504
03:04:24,870 --> 03:04:24,880
since the low in 22. All right, into
 

8505
03:04:24,880 --> 03:04:27,269
since the low in 22. All right, into
sectors which are lagging behind. All

8506
03:04:27,269 --> 03:04:27,279
sectors which are lagging behind. All
 

8507
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:28,790
sectors which are lagging behind. All
right, into sectors which are lagging

8508
03:04:28,790 --> 03:04:28,800
right, into sectors which are lagging
 

8509
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:31,110
right, into sectors which are lagging
behind. Right, because we don't want to

8510
03:04:31,110 --> 03:04:31,120
behind. Right, because we don't want to
 

8511
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:32,469
behind. Right, because we don't want to
it's the same story, right? They don't

8512
03:04:32,469 --> 03:04:32,479
it's the same story, right? They don't
 

8513
03:04:32,479 --> 03:04:33,830
it's the same story, right? They don't
want to buy up here. here. All right.

8514
03:04:33,830 --> 03:04:33,840
want to buy up here. here. All right.
 

8515
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:35,510
want to buy up here. here. All right.
So, if they can rotate out of this, if

8516
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:35,520
So, if they can rotate out of this, if
 

8517
03:04:35,520 --> 03:04:37,349
So, if they can rotate out of this, if
they lock in some of their profits and

8518
03:04:37,349 --> 03:04:37,359
they lock in some of their profits and
 

8519
03:04:37,359 --> 03:04:38,950
they lock in some of their profits and
they rotate into sectors which are

8520
03:04:38,950 --> 03:04:38,960
they rotate into sectors which are
 

8521
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:40,550
they rotate into sectors which are
lagging behind here and they bid this

8522
03:04:40,550 --> 03:04:40,560
lagging behind here and they bid this
 

8523
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:42,309
lagging behind here and they bid this
back up, right? Then these sectors start

8524
03:04:42,309 --> 03:04:42,319
back up, right? Then these sectors start
 

8525
03:04:42,319 --> 03:04:44,070
back up, right? Then these sectors start
going, this comes back down, then they

8526
03:04:44,070 --> 03:04:44,080
going, this comes back down, then they
 

8527
03:04:44,080 --> 03:04:45,830
going, this comes back down, then they
rotate back into this, they get this in

8528
03:04:45,830 --> 03:04:45,840
rotate back into this, they get this in
 

8529
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:47,510
rotate back into this, they get this in
discount, they bid this back up, they

8530
03:04:47,510 --> 03:04:47,520
discount, they bid this back up, they
 

8531
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:48,950
discount, they bid this back up, they
sell this one that they bought. Does

8532
03:04:48,950 --> 03:04:48,960
sell this one that they bought. Does
 

8533
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:52,389
sell this one that they bought. Does
that make sense? So, if I drew that out,

8534
03:04:52,389 --> 03:04:52,399
that make sense? So, if I drew that out,
 

8535
03:04:52,399 --> 03:04:55,429
that make sense? So, if I drew that out,
right, if this is NQ, uh, or let's just

8536
03:04:55,429 --> 03:04:55,439
right, if this is NQ, uh, or let's just
 

8537
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:57,510
right, if this is NQ, uh, or let's just
call this whole of tech and then we have

8538
03:04:57,510 --> 03:04:57,520
call this whole of tech and then we have
 

8539
03:04:57,520 --> 03:04:59,910
call this whole of tech and then we have
defensive stocks, which would maybe look

8540
03:04:59,910 --> 03:04:59,920
defensive stocks, which would maybe look
 

8541
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:05,830
defensive stocks, which would maybe look
something like this.

8542
03:05:05,830 --> 03:05:05,840

 

8543
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:07,269

Okay, so they're going to sell this,

8544
03:05:07,269 --> 03:05:07,279
Okay, so they're going to sell this,
 

8545
03:05:07,279 --> 03:05:09,110
Okay, so they're going to sell this,
take profits in this, which means this

8546
03:05:09,110 --> 03:05:09,120
take profits in this, which means this
 

8547
03:05:09,120 --> 03:05:11,510
take profits in this, which means this
will sell and they're going to buy this

8548
03:05:11,510 --> 03:05:11,520
will sell and they're going to buy this
 

8549
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:12,790
will sell and they're going to buy this
because it's only the equivalent of

8550
03:05:12,790 --> 03:05:12,800
because it's only the equivalent of
 

8551
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:14,389
because it's only the equivalent of
here. And this will drive up and then

8552
03:05:14,389 --> 03:05:14,399
here. And this will drive up and then
 

8553
03:05:14,399 --> 03:05:16,230
here. And this will drive up and then
once they get new highs, they will sell

8554
03:05:16,230 --> 03:05:16,240
once they get new highs, they will sell
 

8555
03:05:16,240 --> 03:05:17,910
once they get new highs, they will sell
some of this and they will rotate back

8556
03:05:17,910 --> 03:05:17,920
some of this and they will rotate back
 

8557
03:05:17,920 --> 03:05:19,830
some of this and they will rotate back
into the cues and this will go up,

8558
03:05:19,830 --> 03:05:19,840
into the cues and this will go up,
 

8559
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:21,429
into the cues and this will go up,
right? And this is what we see all the

8560
03:05:21,429 --> 03:05:21,439
right? And this is what we see all the
 

8561
03:05:21,439 --> 03:05:23,590
right? And this is what we see all the
time. All the time. So we think about

8562
03:05:23,590 --> 03:05:23,600
time. All the time. So we think about
 

8563
03:05:23,600 --> 03:05:26,150
time. All the time. So we think about
COVID. We came out of all of this,

8564
03:05:26,150 --> 03:05:26,160
COVID. We came out of all of this,
 

8565
03:05:26,160 --> 03:05:27,590
COVID. We came out of all of this,
right? And originally, what did we go

8566
03:05:27,590 --> 03:05:27,600
right? And originally, what did we go
 

8567
03:05:27,600 --> 03:05:32,070
right? And originally, what did we go
into down here, right? Ma

8568
03:05:32,070 --> 03:05:32,080
into down here, right? Ma
 

8569

into down here, right? Ma
Uh trying to think of all these stocks.

Zoom,
right? They rotated into all these

8576
03:05:40,389 --> 03:05:40,399
right? They rotated into all these
 

8577
03:05:40,399 --> 03:05:42,630
right? They rotated into all these
[\h__\h] names, all the healthc care

8578
03:05:42,630 --> 03:05:42,640
[\h__\h] names, all the healthc care
 

8579
03:05:42,640 --> 03:05:44,550
[\h__\h] names, all the healthc care
stuff, right? And that went rippy rippy

8580
03:05:44,550 --> 03:05:44,560
stuff, right? And that went rippy rippy
 

8581
03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:46,389
stuff, right? And that went rippy rippy
rippy. And once they rotated out of

8582
03:05:46,389 --> 03:05:46,399
rippy. And once they rotated out of
 

8583
03:05:46,399 --> 03:05:47,670
rippy. And once they rotated out of
that, they went, "All right, right. Tech

8584
03:05:47,670 --> 03:05:47,680
that, they went, "All right, right. Tech
 

8585
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:49,590
that, they went, "All right, right. Tech
time, right?" And that's how we move.

8586
03:05:49,590 --> 03:05:49,600
time, right?" And that's how we move.
 

8587
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:51,110
time, right?" And that's how we move.
That's how we move assets because we

8588
03:05:51,110 --> 03:05:51,120
That's how we move assets because we
 

8589
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:53,030
That's how we move assets because we
can't just pump one thing over and over

8590
03:05:53,030 --> 03:05:53,040
can't just pump one thing over and over
 

8591

03:05:56,710 --> 03:05:56,720
they have like a shelf life and then we
 

8595
03:05:56,720 --> 03:06:09,349
they have like a shelf life and then we
have to reset for a moment.

8596

8663
03:07:16,560 --> 03:07:18,150

Uh, you're going to see small cap start

8664
03:07:18,150 --> 03:07:18,160
Uh, you're going to see small cap start
 

8665
03:07:18,160 --> 03:07:20,630
Uh, you're going to see small cap start
to like be pumped into at the moment as

8666
03:07:20,630 --> 03:07:20,640
to like be pumped into at the moment as
 

8667
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:22,950
to like be pumped into at the moment as
well. lot. That's why you're seeing like

well. lot. That's why you're seeing like
 

8669
03:07:22,960 --> 03:07:25,750
well. lot. That's why you're seeing like
RTY has done very very well, right?

8670
03:07:25,750 --> 03:07:25,760
RTY has done very very well, right?
 

8671
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:27,030
RTY has done very very well, right?
Because you're seeing that small cap

8672
03:07:27,030 --> 03:07:27,040
Because you're seeing that small cap
 

8673
03:07:27,040 --> 03:07:29,990
Because you're seeing that small cap
rotation, right? Think about where RTY

8674
03:07:29,990 --> 03:07:30,000
rotation, right? Think about where RTY
 

8675
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,150
rotation, right? Think about where RTY
is. All right, it's look at this. If you

8676
03:07:32,150 --> 03:07:32,160
is. All right, it's look at this. If you
 

8677
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:35,030
is. All right, it's look at this. If you
compared this to NQ,

8678
03:07:35,030 --> 03:07:35,040
compared this to NQ,
 

8679
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:37,030
compared this to NQ,
all right, we are still holding very,

8680
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:37,040
all right, we are still holding very,
 

8681
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:38,710
all right, we are still holding very,
very well up here because this is a

8682
03:07:38,710 --> 03:07:38,720
very well up here because this is a
 

8683
03:07:38,720 --> 03:07:42,070
very well up here because this is a
different rotation. All right.

failed to get all the way up here.

8842
03:14:08,870 --> 03:14:08,880
failed to get all the way up here.
 

8843
03:14:08,880 --> 03:14:10,469
failed to get all the way up here.
You've now got trapped volume above

8844
03:14:10,469 --> 03:14:10,479
You've now got trapped volume above
 

8845
03:14:10,479 --> 03:14:12,469
You've now got trapped volume above
this. Here's your new view up. Here's

8846
03:14:12,469 --> 03:14:12,479
this. Here's your new view up. Here's
 

8847
03:14:12,479 --> 03:14:14,150
this. Here's your new view up. Here's
the top of that old gap. All right,

8848
03:14:14,150 --> 03:14:14,160
the top of that old gap. All right,
 

8849
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:15,510
the top of that old gap. All right,
where the sellers got trapped originally

8850
03:14:15,510 --> 03:14:15,520
where the sellers got trapped originally
 

8851
03:14:15,520 --> 03:14:16,710
where the sellers got trapped originally
on the day. They're trying to pivot

8852
03:14:16,710 --> 03:14:16,720
on the day. They're trying to pivot
 

8853
03:14:16,720 --> 03:14:18,870
on the day. They're trying to pivot
above this. So, maybe this is like a 50%

8854
03:14:18,870 --> 03:14:18,880
above this. So, maybe this is like a 50%
 

8855
03:14:18,880 --> 03:14:21,830
above this. So, maybe this is like a 50%
pullback. Um, I would be less and less

8856
03:14:21,830 --> 03:14:21,840
pullback. Um, I would be less and less
 

8857
03:14:21,840 --> 03:14:23,670
pullback. Um, I would be less and less
interested in this as the day develops.

8858
03:14:23,670 --> 03:14:23,680
interested in this as the day develops.
 

8859
03:14:23,680 --> 03:14:24,790
interested in this as the day develops.
Now, I think they're just going to have

8860
03:14:24,790 --> 03:14:24,800
Now, I think they're just going to have
 

8861
03:14:24,800 --> 03:14:28,630
Now, I think they're just going to have
to build out liquidity. um you've got

8862
03:14:28,630 --> 03:14:28,640
to build out liquidity. um you've got
 

8863
03:14:28,640 --> 03:14:30,870
to build out liquidity. um you've got
opportunities both sides. This would be

8864
03:14:30,870 --> 03:14:30,880
opportunities both sides. This would be
 

8865
03:14:30,880 --> 03:14:33,110
opportunities both sides. This would be
like buying the midpoint of of this

8866
03:14:33,110 --> 03:14:33,120
like buying the midpoint of of this
 

8867
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:35,590
like buying the midpoint of of this
range to try and get up here and if they

8868
03:14:35,590 --> 03:14:35,600
range to try and get up here and if they
 

8869
03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:37,429
range to try and get up here and if they
lose this they can also do this. So the

8870
03:14:37,429 --> 03:14:37,439
lose this they can also do this. So the
 

8871
03:14:37,439 --> 03:14:40,710
lose this they can also do this. So the
your probability is not so good. Main

8872
03:14:40,710 --> 03:14:40,720
your probability is not so good. Main
 

8873
03:14:40,720 --> 03:14:42,550
your probability is not so good. Main
trend is down but I think we finished

8874
03:14:42,550 --> 03:14:42,560
trend is down but I think we finished
 

8875
03:14:42,560 --> 03:14:44,870
trend is down but I think we finished
that. I think we might need to do this

8876
03:14:44,870 --> 03:14:44,880
that. I think we might need to do this
 

8877
03:14:44,880 --> 03:14:47,670
that. I think we might need to do this
rotation up here but it's have they got

8878
03:14:47,670 --> 03:14:47,680
rotation up here but it's have they got
 

8879
03:14:47,680 --> 03:14:49,269
rotation up here but it's have they got
the juice to do it today? I don't know.

8880
03:14:49,269 --> 03:14:49,279
the juice to do it today? I don't know.
 

8881
03:14:49,279 --> 03:14:51,510
the juice to do it today? I don't know.
I will remind you you have mag earnings

8882
03:14:51,510 --> 03:14:51,520
I will remind you you have mag earnings
 

8883
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:53,190
I will remind you you have mag earnings
at the bell. I still think this is

8884
03:14:53,190 --> 03:14:53,200
at the bell. I still think this is
 

8885
03:14:53,200 --> 03:14:55,670
at the bell. I still think this is
possible up here. All right. And if they

8886
03:14:55,670 --> 03:14:55,680
possible up here. All right. And if they
 

8887
03:14:55,680 --> 03:14:59,429
possible up here. All right. And if they
get going over these 800s, 820s, you're

8888
03:14:59,429 --> 03:14:59,439
get going over these 800s, 820s, you're
 

8889
03:14:59,439 --> 03:15:02,070
get going over these 800s, 820s, you're
looking for 890s, 900s, and then maybe

8890
03:15:02,070 --> 03:15:02,080
looking for 890s, 900s, and then maybe
 

8891
03:15:02,080 --> 03:15:03,590
looking for 890s, 900s, and then maybe
even all the way up here. Right, they

8892
03:15:03,590 --> 03:15:03,600
even all the way up here. Right, they
 

8893
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:05,030
even all the way up here. Right, they
just held that New York view up. You can

8894
03:15:05,030 --> 03:15:05,040
just held that New York view up. You can
 

8895
03:15:05,040 --> 03:15:07,349
just held that New York view up. You can
see cash still coming in and playing. I

8896
03:15:07,349 --> 03:15:07,359
see cash still coming in and playing. I
 

8897
03:15:07,359 --> 03:15:08,630
see cash still coming in and playing. I
think there could be relief here this

8898
03:15:08,630 --> 03:15:08,640
think there could be relief here this
 

8899
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:11,110
think there could be relief here this
afternoon, but I uh I will not be

8900

afternoon, but I uh I will not be
 

8901
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:12,950
afternoon, but I uh I will not be
playing anymore. I don't think those in

8902
03:15:12,950 --> 03:15:12,960
playing anymore. I don't think those in
 

8903
03:15:12,960 --> 03:15:15,030
playing anymore. I don't think those in
