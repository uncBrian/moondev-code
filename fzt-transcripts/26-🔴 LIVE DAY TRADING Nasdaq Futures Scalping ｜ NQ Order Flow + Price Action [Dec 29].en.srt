Hopefully you had a good uh good
Christmas holiday period. Uh markets are

14
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
Christmas holiday period. Uh markets are
 

15
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,830
Christmas holiday period. Uh markets are
moving this morning, so let's just focus

16
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
moving this morning, so let's just focus
 

17
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,470
moving this morning, so let's just focus
on that. So wishing you all fantastic

18
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
on that. So wishing you all fantastic
 

19
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,390
on that. So wishing you all fantastic
festive season. It's not over yet. So we

20
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
festive season. It's not over yet. So we
 

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,070
festive season. It's not over yet. So we
expect volume still to be light. All

22
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
expect volume still to be light. All
 

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,710
expect volume still to be light. All
right, we expect volume to be light. If

24
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
right, we expect volume to be light. If
 

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,190
right, we expect volume to be light. If
we focus on the daily chart. All right,

26
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
we focus on the daily chart. All right,
 

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,150
we focus on the daily chart. All right,
we can just have a look. Last week off

28
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
we can just have a look. Last week off
 

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,110
we can just have a look. Last week off
light volume. Uh you can see Monday,

30
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
light volume. Uh you can see Monday,
 

31
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,350
light volume. Uh you can see Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday into Friday

32
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday into Friday
 

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,030
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday into Friday
just straight upside. Obviously we

34
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
just straight upside. Obviously we
 

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,270
just straight upside. Obviously we
missed uh the Thursday. There was no

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
missed uh the Thursday. There was no
 

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,509
missed uh the Thursday. There was no
Thursday, but straight upside on a light

38
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
Thursday, but straight upside on a light
 

39
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,670
Thursday, but straight upside on a light
volume drift. We're seeing that pullback

40
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
volume drift. We're seeing that pullback
 

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,470
volume drift. We're seeing that pullback
now. All right. So there was no recheck

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
now. All right. So there was no recheck
 

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,949
now. All right. So there was no recheck
of this area since that drift higher.

44
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
of this area since that drift higher.
 

45
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,710
of this area since that drift higher.
We're starting to see it into this low

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
We're starting to see it into this low
 

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,790
We're starting to see it into this low
volume node, right? So that's happening

48
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
volume node, right? So that's happening
 

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,229
volume node, right? So that's happening
overnight. So we're watching this. We've

50
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
overnight. So we're watching this. We've
 

51
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,869
overnight. So we're watching this. We've
got a cluster down here, 50-day, 20-day.

52
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
got a cluster down here, 50-day, 20-day.
 

53
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,229
got a cluster down here, 50-day, 20-day.
We've already let go of the 5day. So

54
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
We've already let go of the 5day. So
 

55
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,229
We've already let go of the 5day. So
we're back testing this. The question

56
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
we're back testing this. The question
 

57
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,309
we're back testing this. The question
really remains, are bulls able to hold

58
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
really remains, are bulls able to hold
 

59
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,149
really remains, are bulls able to hold
this area? We expected this pullback.

60
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
this area? We expected this pullback.
 

61
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,350
this area? We expected this pullback.
Unfortunately, it's happened without us.

62
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
Unfortunately, it's happened without us.
 

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,030
Unfortunately, it's happened without us.
It would have been nice to be involved

64
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
It would have been nice to be involved
 

65
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,710
It would have been nice to be involved
from this high volume node. You would

66
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
from this high volume node. You would
 

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,990
from this high volume node. You would
have seen we talked about this in the

68
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
have seen we talked about this in the
 

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,110
have seen we talked about this in the
newsletter, right? And in there, the old

70
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
newsletter, right? And in there, the old
 

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,110
newsletter, right? And in there, the old
point of control, two week balance range

72
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
point of control, two week balance range
 

73
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,630
point of control, two week balance range
in here. We're rejecting that old point

74
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
in here. We're rejecting that old point
 

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,710
in here. We're rejecting that old point
of control. We expect a pullback right

76
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
of control. We expect a pullback right
 

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,309
of control. We expect a pullback right
into this node. We've already done that.

78
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
into this node. We've already done that.
 

79
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,309
into this node. We've already done that.
So, the question now remains, do bulls

80
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
So, the question now remains, do bulls
 

81
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,630
So, the question now remains, do bulls
defend this for the move back up? Do we

82
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
defend this for the move back up? Do we
 

83
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,470
defend this for the move back up? Do we
go sideways or are we going to start

84
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
go sideways or are we going to start
 

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,309
go sideways or are we going to start
collapsing underneath this in the

86
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
collapsing underneath this in the
 

87
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,670
collapsing underneath this in the
market? And we can look for the hourly

88
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
market? And we can look for the hourly
 

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,070
market? And we can look for the hourly
for a few more clues into what's really

90
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
for a few more clues into what's really
 

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,190
for a few more clues into what's really
going on. So, let's have a look there.

92
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
going on. So, let's have a look there.
 

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,070
going on. So, let's have a look there.
Over into the hourly chart. Move this

94
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
Over into the hourly chart. Move this
 

95
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,509
Over into the hourly chart. Move this
one up for you. Make sure you can see it

96
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
one up for you. Make sure you can see it
 

97
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,190
one up for you. Make sure you can see it
all. All right. You can see here. Here's

98
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
all. All right. You can see here. Here's
 

99
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,509
all. All right. You can see here. Here's
the old balance range which we are

100
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
the old balance range which we are
 

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,830
the old balance range which we are
rejecting. All right, this looks a

102
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
rejecting. All right, this looks a
 

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,949
rejecting. All right, this looks a
little bit different because it's on the

104
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
little bit different because it's on the
 

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,589
little bit different because it's on the
new contract, but uh that old balance

106
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
new contract, but uh that old balance
 

107
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,350
new contract, but uh that old balance
range basically the point of control can

108
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
range basically the point of control can
 

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,229
range basically the point of control can
measure out here from the week uh going

110
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
measure out here from the week uh going
 

111
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,870
measure out here from the week uh going
back to Monday the 8th, right? Comes

112
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
back to Monday the 8th, right? Comes
 

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,990
back to Monday the 8th, right? Comes
right in at 9:22.

114
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
right in at 9:22.
 

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,670
right in at 9:22.
And you can see we hit highs just over

116
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
And you can see we hit highs just over
 

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,830
And you can see we hit highs just over
that 946. We peaked above an old balance

118
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
that 946. We peaked above an old balance
 

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,550
that 946. We peaked above an old balance
range inside last week's rotation.

120
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
range inside last week's rotation.
 

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,189
range inside last week's rotation.
Here's uh or last the Friday's rotation.

122
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
Here's uh or last the Friday's rotation.
 

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,510
Here's uh or last the Friday's rotation.
Friday's rotation. Old balance range was

124
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
Friday's rotation. Old balance range was
 

125
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,790
Friday's rotation. Old balance range was
actually 22s right here. All right,

126
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
actually 22s right here. All right,
 

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,310
actually 22s right here. All right,
we're starting to reject that point of

128
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
we're starting to reject that point of
 

129
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,790
we're starting to reject that point of
control. We lost previous day. We're

130
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
control. We lost previous day. We're
 

131
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,670
control. We lost previous day. We're
inside previous week. We're back down to

132
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
inside previous week. We're back down to
 

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,350
inside previous week. We're back down to
the bottom side of this profile from

134
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
the bottom side of this profile from
 

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,430
the bottom side of this profile from
previous week. So the question really is

136
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
previous week. So the question really is
 

137
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,909
previous week. So the question really is
very very simple. Do bids come back in

138
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
very very simple. Do bids come back in
 

139
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,230
very very simple. Do bids come back in
here? Remember this is a low volume node

140
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
here? Remember this is a low volume node
 

141
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,550
here? Remember this is a low volume node
on the daily? The daily profile from the

142
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
on the daily? The daily profile from the
 

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,189
on the daily? The daily profile from the
year looks something like this. Okay. So

144
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
year looks something like this. Okay. So
 

145
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,990
year looks something like this. Okay. So
do we protect in here? Do we project

146
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
do we protect in here? Do we project
 

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,350
do we protect in here? Do we project
against the previous week point of

148
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
against the previous week point of
 

149
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,950
against the previous week point of
control, the previous week's value? All

150
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
control, the previous week's value? All
 

151
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,710
control, the previous week's value? All
right, this is where bulls must come in

152
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
right, this is where bulls must come in
 

153
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,150
right, this is where bulls must come in
to defend this. If they're going to hold

154
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
to defend this. If they're going to hold
 

155
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,790
to defend this. If they're going to hold
dips, they really want to be holding

156
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
dips, they really want to be holding
 

157
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,110
dips, they really want to be holding
into the previous week's value into here

158
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
into the previous week's value into here
 

159
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,870
into the previous week's value into here
or a look below and fail and a reclaim

160
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
or a look below and fail and a reclaim
 

161
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,749
or a look below and fail and a reclaim
for a move back up. If they stay heavy,

162
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
for a move back up. If they stay heavy,
 

163
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,029
for a move back up. If they stay heavy,
all right, if there's increased pressure

164
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
all right, if there's increased pressure
 

165
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,790
all right, if there's increased pressure
on this market, we have that gap fill

166
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
on this market, we have that gap fill
 

167
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,790
on this market, we have that gap fill
potential, right, which we can think

168
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
potential, right, which we can think
 

169
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,550
potential, right, which we can think
about gap fill potential. If we lose

170
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
about gap fill potential. If we lose
 

171
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,390
about gap fill potential. If we lose
that, we're looking at the previous

172
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
that, we're looking at the previous
 

173
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,670
that, we're looking at the previous
week's value into 527 and then down into

174
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
week's value into 527 and then down into
 

175
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,590
week's value into 527 and then down into
the 33s.

176
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
the 33s.
 

177
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,590
the 33s.
Fact, I'm going to move this down right

178
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
Fact, I'm going to move this down right
 

179
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,830
Fact, I'm going to move this down right
here. 333s. [snorts] All right, so

180
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
here. 333s. [snorts] All right, so
 

181
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,189
here. 333s. [snorts] All right, so
that's what we're looking at. I want to

182
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
that's what we're looking at. I want to
 

183
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,510
that's what we're looking at. I want to
first think about dips.

184
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
first think about dips.
 

185
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,070
first think about dips.
All right, as we come into the other

186
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
All right, as we come into the other
 

187
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,070
All right, as we come into the other
side of range because this based on the

188
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
side of range because this based on the
 

189
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,990
side of range because this based on the
previous week is cheap. All right, this

190
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
previous week is cheap. All right, this
 

191
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,150
previous week is cheap. All right, this
is discount. [snorts] So, do we want to

192
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
is discount. [snorts] So, do we want to
 

193
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,230
is discount. [snorts] So, do we want to
trade inside? If we can't reclaim point

194
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
trade inside? If we can't reclaim point
 

195
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,710
trade inside? If we can't reclaim point
of control and we lose value, then I'll

196
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
of control and we lose value, then I'll
 

197
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,629
of control and we lose value, then I'll
be thinking about this into these levels

198
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
be thinking about this into these levels
 

199
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,150
be thinking about this into these levels
here. Very, very simple. I want to be

200
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
here. Very, very simple. I want to be
 

201
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,950
here. Very, very simple. I want to be
nimble today and careful with sizing and

202
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
nimble today and careful with sizing and
 

203
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,390
nimble today and careful with sizing and
positioning given that we're seeing

204
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
positioning given that we're seeing
 

205
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,310
positioning given that we're seeing
weakness in the market on a very very

206
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
weakness in the market on a very very
 

207
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,270
weakness in the market on a very very
low volume uh period. Okay, so don't

208
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
low volume uh period. Okay, so don't
 

209
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,830
low volume uh period. Okay, so don't
want to be overly aggressive and sized

210
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
want to be overly aggressive and sized
 

211
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,830
want to be overly aggressive and sized
in. You can see this move here on the

212
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
in. You can see this move here on the
 

213
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,309
in. You can see this move here on the
5minute chart. Really, really clean.

214
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
5minute chart. Really, really clean.
 

215
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,150
5minute chart. Really, really clean.
This was once we broke down. All right,

216
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
This was once we broke down. All right,
 

217
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,430
This was once we broke down. All right,
here's the rollover. Right. Peak above

218
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
here's the rollover. Right. Peak above
 

219
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,430
here's the rollover. Right. Peak above
that two week balance range. Peak above.

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
that two week balance range. Peak above.
 

221
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,749
that two week balance range. Peak above.
Peak above. Peak above. Fail. Fail

00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
Peak above. Peak above. Fail. Fail

Peak above. Peak above. Fail. Fail
previous day. There comes the rotation.

224
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
previous day. There comes the rotation.
 

225
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,629
previous day. There comes the rotation.
Fail to get back above those 770s and

226
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
Fail to get back above those 770s and
 

227
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,909
Fail to get back above those 770s and
back into previous week point of

228
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
back into previous week point of
 

229
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,670
back into previous week point of
control. Previous week value area low

230
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
control. Previous week value area low
 

231
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,749
control. Previous week value area low
below us. All right, let's have a look

232
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
below us. All right, let's have a look
 

233
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,189
below us. All right, let's have a look
at the broader market because there are

234
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
at the broader market because there are
 

235
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,909
at the broader market because there are
lots of things moving right now.

236
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919

 

237
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,590

Move you up here and go to five minute

238
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
Move you up here and go to five minute
 

239
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,390
Move you up here and go to five minute
and just focus on the spiders. All

240
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
and just focus on the spiders. All
 

241
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,070
and just focus on the spiders. All
right. spiders doing the same thing

242
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
right. spiders doing the same thing
 

243
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,230
right. spiders doing the same thing
here. Starting to see that rotation.

244
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
here. Starting to see that rotation.
 

245
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,790
here. Starting to see that rotation.
Okay, big highs here

246
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
Okay, big highs here
 

247
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,230
Okay, big highs here
and starting to see that pull back

248
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
and starting to see that pull back
 

249
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,189
and starting to see that pull back
inside into this kind of cliff shelf

250
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
inside into this kind of cliff shelf
 

251
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,230
inside into this kind of cliff shelf
into 85s I would say. So even on the

252
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
into 85s I would say. So even on the
 

253
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,469
into 85s I would say. So even on the
options I would say 85 is probably a big

254
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
options I would say 85 is probably a big
 

255
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,629
options I would say 85 is probably a big
level underneath that we know that it

256
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
level underneath that we know that it
 

257
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,270
level underneath that we know that it
was going to be the same as before 85s

258
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
was going to be the same as before 85s
 

259
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,870
was going to be the same as before 85s
82s 80s and you can see this old put

260
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
82s 80s and you can see this old put
 

261
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,790
82s 80s and you can see this old put
wall down here at 70s long long way away

262
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
wall down here at 70s long long way away
 

263
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,029
wall down here at 70s long long way away
but we want to see if uh there is some

264
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
but we want to see if uh there is some
 

265
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,550
but we want to see if uh there is some
response here into 85 on the spiders for

266
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
response here into 85 on the spiders for
 

267
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,230
response here into 85 on the spiders for
that move back up. I would be watching

268
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
that move back up. I would be watching
 

269
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,150
that move back up. I would be watching
in case we get that Q. Same kind of

270
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
in case we get that Q. Same kind of
 

271
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,390
in case we get that Q. Same kind of
story, right? Coming down. You can see

272
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
story, right? Coming down. You can see
 

273
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,189
story, right? Coming down. You can see
these key levels down here into well 20s

274
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
these key levels down here into well 20s
 

275
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,230
these key levels down here into well 20s
if we reclaim and then 17s below and 15s

276
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
if we reclaim and then 17s below and 15s
 

277
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,070
if we reclaim and then 17s below and 15s
below is what we're looking out for. Uh

278
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
below is what we're looking out for. Uh
 

279
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,150
below is what we're looking out for. Uh
the big movers are coming in the metals

280
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
the big movers are coming in the metals
 

281
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,070
the big movers are coming in the metals
though. So big gap up here in VIX. We're

282
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
though. So big gap up here in VIX. We're
 

283
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,510
though. So big gap up here in VIX. We're
still in the low teens. I want to be

284
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
still in the low teens. I want to be
 

285
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,790
still in the low teens. I want to be
aware of that. We're still in the low

286
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
aware of that. We're still in the low
 

287
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,390
aware of that. We're still in the low
teens gapping up into an area which we

288
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
teens gapping up into an area which we
 

289
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,150
teens gapping up into an area which we
have uh struggled at before. It's an old

290
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
have uh struggled at before. It's an old
 

291
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,029
have uh struggled at before. It's an old
pivot. So really the question is is uh

292
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
pivot. So really the question is is uh
 

293
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,870
pivot. So really the question is is uh
the VIX able to reclaim this? If the

294
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
the VIX able to reclaim this? If the
 

295
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,710
the VIX able to reclaim this? If the
answer is yes, then we might have

296
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
answer is yes, then we might have
 

297
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,790
answer is yes, then we might have
increased downside volatility coming in

298
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
increased downside volatility coming in
 

299
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,830
increased downside volatility coming in
this market this morning. Uh gold

300
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
this market this morning. Uh gold
 

301
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,629
this market this morning. Uh gold
leading actually probably copper leading

302
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
leading actually probably copper leading
 

303
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,950
leading actually probably copper leading
I would say. You can see bit of a

304
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
I would say. You can see bit of a
 

305
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,350
I would say. You can see bit of a
blowoff top here coming back into what

306
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
blowoff top here coming back into what
 

307
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,749
blowoff top here coming back into what
could be an RBS level. We can clean this

308
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
could be an RBS level. We can clean this
 

309
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,189
could be an RBS level. We can clean this
up. All right, this area here is an area

310
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
up. All right, this area here is an area
 

311
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,710
up. All right, this area here is an area
of interest. Right, if they're going to

312
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
of interest. Right, if they're going to
 

313
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,629
of interest. Right, if they're going to
hold dips on gold, I think we're

314
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
hold dips on gold, I think we're
 

315
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,749
hold dips on gold, I think we're
probably going to see a short-term

316
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
probably going to see a short-term
 

317
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,589
probably going to see a short-term
pullback and it might last a month or

318
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
pullback and it might last a month or
 

319
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,390
pullback and it might last a month or
two before we go again. Uh the main eyes

320
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
two before we go again. Uh the main eyes
 

321
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,230
two before we go again. Uh the main eyes
right now are on the liquidity or

322
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
right now are on the liquidity or
 

323
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,510
right now are on the liquidity or
potential liquidity issues uh over on

capture some of the move as we see some
 

341
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,430
capture some of the move as we see some
profit taking. So this is the failure to

342
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
profit taking. So this is the failure to
 

343
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,550
profit taking. So this is the failure to
follow through that we always talk

344
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
follow through that we always talk
 

345
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,829
follow through that we always talk
about. That's your first failure to

346
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
about. That's your first failure to
 

347
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,389
about. That's your first failure to
follow through coming back into range.

short if we're going to come back down
into here and then see if they go over a

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
into here and then see if they go over a
 

355
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,150
into here and then see if they go over a
number of months of accumulation before

number of months of accumulation before
 

357
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,910

environment. You know, is there going to
 

365
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,269

421
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,350
That's the one that I'd probably leave
alone. Wait to see if either of these

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
All right, try to reclaim. You have to
 

433
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,110
All right, try to reclaim. You have to
think about where you are on a bigger

It's trying to get up there. Can it hold

440
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
It's trying to get up there. Can it hold
 

441
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,870
It's trying to get up there. Can it hold
a dip for that move? Failure to do so.

We've got this marked out. It's uh the

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
We've got this marked out. It's uh the
 

445
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,470
We've got this marked out. It's uh the
key level, which hasn't yet broken down

446
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
key level, which hasn't yet broken down
 

447
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,470
key level, which hasn't yet broken down
from. So, it still looks okay on Nvidia,

448
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
from. So, it still looks okay on Nvidia,
 

449
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,190
from. So, it still looks okay on Nvidia,
to be honest. Looks pretty good, but

450
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
to be honest. Looks pretty good, but

long term. Tesla just missed those uh

454
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
long term. Tesla just missed those uh
 

455
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,310
long term. Tesla just missed those uh
500s. All right, got pretty good close

456
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
500s. All right, got pretty good close
 

457
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,030
500s. All right, got pretty good close
99s. So, back into this shelf now. It's

458
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
99s. So, back into this shelf now. It's
 

459
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,350
99s. So, back into this shelf now. It's
a very volatile stock. Giving the whole

460
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
a very volatile stock. Giving the whole
 

461
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,389
a very volatile stock. Giving the whole
lot back and uh into the 66s. If we

462
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
lot back and uh into the 66s. If we
 

463
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,910
lot back and uh into the 66s. If we
start breaking down, staying heavy under

start breaking down, staying heavy under
 

465
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,430
start breaking down, staying heavy under
that, I would be very careful because

466
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
that, I would be very careful because
 

467
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,190
that, I would be very careful because
you're going to leave all this volume

468
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200

want the volume up. Uh it can't go much
higher. Might have to turn it up your

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,470
right Now around the previous week point
of control, previous week's value area

626
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
of control, previous week's value area
 

627
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,069
of control, previous week's value area
low is this previous week low underneath

628
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
low is this previous week low underneath
 

629
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,629
low is this previous week low underneath
us. Yes, into sixes. Yeah, this previous

630
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
us. Yes, into sixes. Yeah, this previous
 

631
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,870
us. Yes, into sixes. Yeah, this previous
week low beneath us. Right. So, just

632
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
week low beneath us. Right. So, just
 

633
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,110
week low beneath us. Right. So, just
watching that. We do have a gap that

634
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
watching that. We do have a gap that
 

635
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,829
watching that. We do have a gap that
never quite got filled uh down into

636
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
never quite got filled uh down into
 

637
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,430
never quite got filled uh down into
these sixes as well. So, want to be

638
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
these sixes as well. So, want to be
 

639
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,389
these sixes as well. So, want to be
aware of that. But right now, starting

640
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
aware of that. But right now, starting
 

641
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,269
aware of that. But right now, starting
to sort of find a somewhat of a bid. So,

642
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
to sort of find a somewhat of a bid. So,
 

643
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,230
to sort of find a somewhat of a bid. So,
remember this is discount last week.

644
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
remember this is discount last week.
 

645
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,389
remember this is discount last week.
This is point of control list last week.

646
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
This is point of control list last week.
 

647
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,189
This is point of control list last week.
This is fair value. This is discount.

648
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
This is fair value. This is discount.
 

649
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,430
This is fair value. This is discount.
All right. This is minus D discount down

650
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440
All right. This is minus D discount down
 

651
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,110
All right. This is minus D discount down
here. So, we don't really want to be

652
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
here. So, we don't really want to be
 

653
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,310
here. So, we don't really want to be
short down at these lows unless we're

654
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
short down at these lows unless we're
 

655
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,069
short down at these lows unless we're
going to start to roll over and lose a

656
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
going to start to roll over and lose a
 

657
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,069
going to start to roll over and lose a
bid underneath and migrate back down to

658
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
bid underneath and migrate back down to
 

659
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,110
bid underneath and migrate back down to
the week before its uh value. All right.

660
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
the week before its uh value. All right.
 

661
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,110
the week before its uh value. All right.
So, we're going to watch very very

662
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
So, we're going to watch very very
 

663
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,870
So, we're going to watch very very
carefully how we act here into the open.

664
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
carefully how we act here into the open.
 

665

671
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,069
Uh, yes. Well, quite right, CC. I mean,
it's just a shortterm um position where

672
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
it's just a shortterm um position where
 

673
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,829
it's just a shortterm um position where
they're all down at the same time. It it

they're all down at the same time. It it
 

675
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,470
they're all down at the same time. It it
won't last long. Things will change.

Yeah, things will change. What you're
just seeing is some risk off across

just seeing is some risk off across
 

681
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,990
just seeing is some risk off across
every sector right now, but that that

682
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
every sector right now, but that that
 

683
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,590
every sector right now, but that that
will change and you'll probably go back

684
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
will change and you'll probably go back
 

685
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,829
will change and you'll probably go back
into some level of um

686
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839

 

687
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,310

open. If they're going to hold bids down
 

785
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,990

here and get back above previous week
 

787
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,110
here and get back above previous week
point control, they're going to have to

788
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
point control, they're going to have to
 

789
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,390
point control, they're going to have to
get back above these levels that we're

790
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
get back above these levels that we're
 

791
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,172
get back above these levels that we're
at now. [snorts]

792
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:37,182
at now. [snorts]
 

793
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,150

799
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,990

up on my phone. Losing that 65. So big

800
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
up on my phone. Losing that 65. So big
 

801
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,830
up on my phone. Losing that 65. So big
level on Tesla if it stays heavy down

802
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
level on Tesla if it stays heavy down
 

803
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,150
level on Tesla if it stays heavy down
here. Here's the New York open drive.

804
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
here. Here's the New York open drive.
 

805
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,590
here. Here's the New York open drive.
All right. So they found bids here this

806
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
All right. So they found bids here this
 

807
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,909
All right. So they found bids here this
morning.

808
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
morning.
 

809
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,830
morning.
Maybe back up to test GlobeEx some of

810
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
Maybe back up to test GlobeEx some of
 

811
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,870
Maybe back up to test GlobeEx some of
these Globex levels now

812
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
these Globex levels now
 

813
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,710
these Globex levels now
into this shelf. All right, we can see

814
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
into this shelf. All right, we can see
 

815
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,789
into this shelf. All right, we can see
clear shelf here into 730 all the way up

816
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
clear shelf here into 730 all the way up
 

817
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,549
clear shelf here into 730 all the way up
to 770s.

818
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
to 770s.
 

819
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,950
to 770s.
So, can they reclaim that shelf at 730s?

820
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
So, can they reclaim that shelf at 730s?
 

821
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,310
So, can they reclaim that shelf at 730s?
If not, if there's a rejection there,

822
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
If not, if there's a rejection there,
 

823
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,070
If not, if there's a rejection there,
then we'd probably go and complete the

824
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
then we'd probably go and complete the
 

825
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,190
then we'd probably go and complete the
rotation to uh

826
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
rotation to uh
 

827
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,630
rotation to uh
uh previous value area low.

828
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
uh previous value area low.
 

829
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,070
uh previous value area low.
I'm just trying to let all this settle

830
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
I'm just trying to let all this settle
 

831
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,310
I'm just trying to let all this settle
down for a moment. Wonder if there's a

832
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
down for a moment. Wonder if there's a
 

833
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,390
down for a moment. Wonder if there's a
short opportunity up here on a drive up

834
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
short opportunity up here on a drive up
 

835
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,590
short opportunity up here on a drive up
if they trap bulls up here or if they're

836
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
if they trap bulls up here or if they're
 

837
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,669
if they trap bulls up here or if they're
just going to go reclaim and back into

838
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
just going to go reclaim and back into
 

839
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,070
just going to go reclaim and back into
value on a rotation from last week.

840
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
value on a rotation from last week.
 

841
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,549
value on a rotation from last week.
Remember that we can rotate all the way

842
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
Remember that we can rotate all the way
 

843
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,549
Remember that we can rotate all the way
back up to 820s. No problem. It's not a

844
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
back up to 820s. No problem. It's not a
 

845
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,669
back up to 820s. No problem. It's not a
huge move. 660s to 820s over the next

846
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
huge move. 660s to 820s over the next
 

847
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,590
huge move. 660s to 820s over the next
coming days. That's the rotation that

848
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
coming days. That's the rotation that
 

849
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,830
coming days. That's the rotation that
we're in right now. I would imagine up

850
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
we're in right now. I would imagine up
 

851
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,070
we're in right now. I would imagine up
here there might be a short between 730

852
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
here there might be a short between 730
 

853
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,710
here there might be a short between 730
and 770. We will have to see see what

854
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
and 770. We will have to see see what
 

855
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,750
and 770. We will have to see see what
they do. Just going to give it time.

856
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760

 

857
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,750

Thank you, Kelvin. Yeah, well, you know,

858
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
Thank you, Kelvin. Yeah, well, you know,
 

859
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,350
Thank you, Kelvin. Yeah, well, you know,
market's been very thin the last few

860
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
market's been very thin the last few
 

861
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,950
market's been very thin the last few
days. I've barely watched it to be

862
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
days. I've barely watched it to be
 

863
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,430
days. I've barely watched it to be
honest. It's important that uh we

864
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
honest. It's important that uh we
 

865
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,190
honest. It's important that uh we
remember why we trade. It's for freedom

866
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
remember why we trade. It's for freedom
 

867
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,789
remember why we trade. It's for freedom
to spend time with our families. If

868
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
to spend time with our families. If
 

869
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,470
to spend time with our families. If
we're sat here over the Christmas and

870
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
we're sat here over the Christmas and
 

871
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,310
we're sat here over the Christmas and
holiday period, there's probably

872
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
holiday period, there's probably
 

873
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,510
holiday period, there's probably
something wrong with us. We don't want

874
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
something wrong with us. We don't want
 

875
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,150
something wrong with us. We don't want
to do too much of that.

876
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160

 

877
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,390

Yeah, very possible, Josh. Very, very

878
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
Yeah, very possible, Josh. Very, very
 

879
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,150
Yeah, very possible, Josh. Very, very
possible.

880
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
possible.
 

881
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,070
possible.
Starting to get stuck here into 720s. I

882
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
Starting to get stuck here into 720s. I
 

883
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,150
Starting to get stuck here into 720s. I
want to see a retest up here in 730s if

884
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
want to see a retest up here in 730s if
 

885
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,070
want to see a retest up here in 730s if
possible. Uh, starting to see some

886
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
possible. Uh, starting to see some
 

887
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,830
possible. Uh, starting to see some
bullish action up here get trapped. So,

888
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
bullish action up here get trapped. So,
 

889
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,590
bullish action up here get trapped. So,
I am interested in the short up here if

890
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
I am interested in the short up here if
 

891
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,110
I am interested in the short up here if
we fail. Um, but trying to give this a

892
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
we fail. Um, but trying to give this a
 

893
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,630
we fail. Um, but trying to give this a
little bit of time to develop, but it's

894
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:36,640
little bit of time to develop, but it's
 

895
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,190
little bit of time to develop, but it's
starting to get close to those 730s.

896
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
starting to get close to those 730s.
 

897
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,190
starting to get close to those 730s.
Everything above 714 is aggressive

898
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
Everything above 714 is aggressive
 

899
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,590
Everything above 714 is aggressive
buyers not getting their way right now.

900
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
buyers not getting their way right now.
 

901
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,110
buyers not getting their way right now.
Right. point control in this session's

902
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
Right. point control in this session's
 

903
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,510
Right. point control in this session's
moved up to 714 7:15. So I'm looking to

904
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520
moved up to 714 7:15. So I'm looking to
 

905
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,549
moved up to 714 7:15. So I'm looking to
see if we get up towards that 730 or 770

906
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
see if we get up towards that 730 or 770
 

907
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,710
see if we get up towards that 730 or 770
track buyers and see if some sellers

908
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
track buyers and see if some sellers
 

909
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,230
track buyers and see if some sellers
come back in market. Staying heavy

910
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240
come back in market. Staying heavy
 

911
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,549
come back in market. Staying heavy
across the board right now. Where's

912
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
across the board right now. Where's
 

913
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,789
across the board right now. Where's
Tesla? Right back at that 65.

914
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
Tesla? Right back at that 65.
 

915
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,350
Tesla? Right back at that 65.
So I'm interested in what happens in

916
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
So I'm interested in what happens in
 

917
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,070
So I'm interested in what happens in
this sort of area here. Do buyers get

918
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
this sort of area here. Do buyers get
 

919
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,750
this sort of area here. Do buyers get
trapped somewhere in here? Do we reject

920
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
trapped somewhere in here? Do we reject
 

921
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,350
trapped somewhere in here? Do we reject
this? Do we reject this? If the answer

922
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
this? Do we reject this? If the answer
 

923
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,710
this? Do we reject this? If the answer
is no and we do this, then I'm not

924
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
is no and we do this, then I'm not
 

925
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,270
is no and we do this, then I'm not
really interested much at all. We will

926
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
really interested much at all. We will
 

927
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,870
really interested much at all. We will
see.

928
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
see.
 

929
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,470
see.
Still they push

930
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480

 

931
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,110

more buyers getting uh piling in here

932
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
more buyers getting uh piling in here
 

933
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,390
more buyers getting uh piling in here
without the ability to move higher yet.

934
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
without the ability to move higher yet.
 

935
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,830
without the ability to move higher yet.
There's definitely some passive selling

936
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
There's definitely some passive selling
 

937
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,830
There's definitely some passive selling
up here. All very light.

938
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
up here. All very light.
 

939
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,510
up here. All very light.
Yes. Doing the same thing coming up to

940
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
Yes. Doing the same thing coming up to
 

941
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,230
Yes. Doing the same thing coming up to
this sort of shelf here into 57s. It's

942
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
this sort of shelf here into 57s. It's
 

943
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,750
this sort of shelf here into 57s. It's
got VWAP above 24hour VWOP into 61s. It

944
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
got VWAP above 24hour VWOP into 61s. It
 

945
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,270
got VWAP above 24hour VWOP into 61s. It
might want to fill. We're right the way

946
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
might want to fill. We're right the way
 

947
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,830
might want to fill. We're right the way
up here at 61s as well, interestingly.

948
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
up here at 61s as well, interestingly.
 

949
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,110
up here at 61s as well, interestingly.
So, both VWOPS at 61s. More buying

950
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
So, both VWOPS at 61s. More buying
 

951
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,310
So, both VWOPS at 61s. More buying
coming up here trying to force this

952
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
coming up here trying to force this
 

953
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,549
coming up here trying to force this
market higher. Mag staying red right

954
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
market higher. Mag staying red right
 

955
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,190
market higher. Mag staying red right
now.

956
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200

 

957
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,990

ES could not get as ES VIX could not get

958
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
ES could not get as ES VIX could not get
 

959
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,950
ES could not get as ES VIX could not get
back above those 1508s.

960
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
back above those 1508s.
 

961
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,029
back above those 1508s.
So, some rejection there on ES. I'm

962
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
So, some rejection there on ES. I'm
 

963
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,789
So, some rejection there on ES. I'm
starting to get interested. This is the

964
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
starting to get interested. This is the
 

965
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,310
starting to get interested. This is the
kind of level that we talked about these

966
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
kind of level that we talked about these
 

967
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,950
kind of level that we talked about these
730s, right? 730s and above. We're

968
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
730s, right? 730s and above. We're
 

969
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,789
730s, right? 730s and above. We're
starting to see some reaction here.

970
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
starting to see some reaction here.
 

971
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,870
starting to see some reaction here.
Market really needs to close back

972
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
Market really needs to close back
 

973
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,950
Market really needs to close back
beneath 7:15 to leave any buyers

974
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
beneath 7:15 to leave any buyers
 

975
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,710
beneath 7:15 to leave any buyers
trapped. So, still not interested yet.

976
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
trapped. So, still not interested yet.
 

977
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,990
trapped. So, still not interested yet.
Just watching at these key levels.

978
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
Just watching at these key levels.
 

979
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,350
Just watching at these key levels.
Remember, if it wants to squeeze up to

980
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
Remember, if it wants to squeeze up to
 

981
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,990
Remember, if it wants to squeeze up to
770, if they just lift the offer, they

982
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
770, if they just lift the offer, they
 

983
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,310
770, if they just lift the offer, they
will let it through. That's fine. We can

984
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
will let it through. That's fine. We can
 

985
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,470
will let it through. That's fine. We can
uh watch higher, but I'm starting to get

986
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
uh watch higher, but I'm starting to get
 

987
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,750
uh watch higher, but I'm starting to get
interested in what's happening on the

988
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
interested in what's happening on the
 

989
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,909
interested in what's happening on the
tape here.

990
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
tape here.
 

991
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,990
tape here.
It might be that nothing comes at all.

992
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
It might be that nothing comes at all.
 

993
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,350
It might be that nothing comes at all.
These are the levels we're interested

994
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
These are the levels we're interested
 

995
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,669
These are the levels we're interested
in.

996
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
in.
 

997
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,350
in.
So, some of you I know were long out the

998
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
So, some of you I know were long out the
 

999
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,270
So, some of you I know were long out the
gate. I would be taking a partial into

1000
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
gate. I would be taking a partial into
 

1001
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,430
gate. I would be taking a partial into
here and then seeing holding a runner

1002
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
here and then seeing holding a runner
 

1003
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,950
here and then seeing holding a runner
just in case you get all the way up here

1004
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
just in case you get all the way up here
 

1005
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,789
just in case you get all the way up here
if you were long. I'm waiting to see if

1006
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
if you were long. I'm waiting to see if
 

1007
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,470
if you were long. I'm waiting to see if
there's a short opportunity which there

1008
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
there's a short opportunity which there
 

1009
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,870
there's a short opportunity which there
might not be. But uh here we go. So they

1010
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
might not be. But uh here we go. So they
 

1011
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,390
might not be. But uh here we go. So they
lifted and then we're going to come back

1012
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
lifted and then we're going to come back
 

1013
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,430
lifted and then we're going to come back
for this VWAP test now. And this is the

1014
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
for this VWAP test now. And this is the
 

1015
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,470
for this VWAP test now. And this is the
area of real interest and intent

1016
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
area of real interest and intent
 

1017
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,230
area of real interest and intent
is they've done a big old shove up.

1018
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
is they've done a big old shove up.
 

1019
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,029
is they've done a big old shove up.
How much more juice have they got? Some

1020
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
How much more juice have they got? Some
 

1021
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,029
How much more juice have they got? Some
clearly

1022
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039

 

1023
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,950

still going

1024
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
still going
 

1025
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,669
still going
into this old pivot. Now we come. Maybe

1026
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
into this old pivot. Now we come. Maybe
 

1027
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,750
into this old pivot. Now we come. Maybe
they come and wash people out there. So

1028
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
they come and wash people out there. So
 

1029
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,990
they come and wash people out there. So
if you were long, you're looking good

1030
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000

 

1031
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,909

into the 85. Big old squeeze. Apple

1032
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
into the 85. Big old squeeze. Apple
 

1033
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,149
into the 85. Big old squeeze. Apple
going green.

1034
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
going green.
 

1035
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,350
going green.
Tesla reclaiming that 65 level. Still

1036
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
Tesla reclaiming that 65 level. Still
 

1037
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,510
Tesla reclaiming that 65 level. Still
just watching here.

1038
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
just watching here.
 

1039
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,830
just watching here.
Very, very thin on this move. Maybe we

1040
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
Very, very thin on this move. Maybe we
 

1041
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,350
Very, very thin on this move. Maybe we
come up to this previous week value area

1042
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
come up to this previous week value area
 

1043
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,710
come up to this previous week value area
high in one push. Just do a full

1044
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
high in one push. Just do a full
 

1045
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,830
high in one push. Just do a full
rotation. Who knows? It's very thin. It

1046
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
rotation. Who knows? It's very thin. It
 

1047
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,270
rotation. Who knows? It's very thin. It
wouldn't take a lot to do anything into

1048
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
wouldn't take a lot to do anything into
 

1049
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,350
wouldn't take a lot to do anything into
these 800 tests.

1050
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360

 

1051
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,270

Still no position for me. Just waiting

1052
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
Still no position for me. Just waiting
 

1053
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,950
Still no position for me. Just waiting
here to see how we are. Starting to get

1054
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
here to see how we are. Starting to get
 

1055
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,110
here to see how we are. Starting to get
my head around what this market wants to

1056
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,120
my head around what this market wants to
 

1057
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,750
my head around what this market wants to
do in this first session. Back up we go

1058
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
do in this first session. Back up we go
 

1059
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,669
do in this first session. Back up we go
into previous week value area high. Big

1060
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
into previous week value area high. Big
 

1061
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,990
into previous week value area high. Big
big big shove here. All right. So, we

1062
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
big big shove here. All right. So, we
 

1063
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,350
big big shove here. All right. So, we
expect sellers to come in and defend

1064
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
expect sellers to come in and defend
 

1065
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,149
expect sellers to come in and defend
this. We've just rotated

1066
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
this. We've just rotated
 

1067
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,149
this. We've just rotated
from uh previous week point of control.

1068
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
from uh previous week point of control.
 

1069
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,990
from uh previous week point of control.
Never came to value. We're coming right

1070
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
Never came to value. We're coming right
 

1071
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,350
Never came to value. We're coming right
back up to previous week value area

1072
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
back up to previous week value area
 

1073
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,350
back up to previous week value area
high. I would say around here because we

1074
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
high. I would say around here because we
 

1075
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,710
high. I would say around here because we
didn't because we didn't defend this.

1076
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
didn't because we didn't defend this.
 

1077
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,549
didn't because we didn't defend this.
You'd imagine around here there will be

1078
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
You'd imagine around here there will be
 

1079
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,870
You'd imagine around here there will be
some profit taking on this recent shove

1080
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
some profit taking on this recent shove
 

1081
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,230
some profit taking on this recent shove
up and then we see what's what 812 saw a

1082
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240
up and then we see what's what 812 saw a
 

1083
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,430
up and then we see what's what 812 saw a
big seller step in there. Huge seller

1084
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440

 

1085
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,470

is we're so thin. It would not take much

1086
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
is we're so thin. It would not take much
 

1087
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,310
is we're so thin. It would not take much
to move this market either way right

1088
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
to move this market either way right
 

1089
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,669
to move this market either way right
now. You can keep

1090
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:27,679
now. You can keep
 

1091
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,909
now. You can keep
shoving it around. No one's really at

1092
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
shoving it around. No one's really at
 

1093
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,230
shoving it around. No one's really at
the table yet. Nice full forward. Yeah,

1094
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
the table yet. Nice full forward. Yeah,
 

1095
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,430
the table yet. Nice full forward. Yeah,
I thought it was you that said you were

1096
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
I thought it was you that said you were
 

1097
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,350
I thought it was you that said you were
long premarket or just before the open.

1098
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
long premarket or just before the open.
 

1099
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,510
long premarket or just before the open.
Really nice. And just lock some in here

1100
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
Really nice. And just lock some in here
 

1101
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,830
Really nice. And just lock some in here
inside of value. So, we expect them to

1102
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
inside of value. So, we expect them to
 

1103
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,350
inside of value. So, we expect them to
protect value if we're going in a range

1104
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
protect value if we're going in a range
 

1105
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,350
protect value if we're going in a range
rotation.

1106
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360

 

1107
00:23:47,360 --> 00:24:01,190

It is very thin. Very, very thin.

1108
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200

 

1109
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,950

Nice work, folks. All you that got long

1110
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
Nice work, folks. All you that got long
 

1111
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,149
Nice work, folks. All you that got long
for the move up. Really nice.

1112
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
for the move up. Really nice.
 

1113
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,750
for the move up. Really nice.
That runner work quick. You see how

1114
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
That runner work quick. You see how
 

1115
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,190
That runner work quick. You see how
quickly they lifted it from there to

1116
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
quickly they lifted it from there to
 

1117
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,390
quickly they lifted it from there to
there. Very, very quick. It's cuz we're

1118
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
there. Very, very quick. It's cuz we're
 

1119
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,470
there. Very, very quick. It's cuz we're
a very, very thin market right now.

1120
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
a very, very thin market right now.
 

1121
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,510
a very, very thin market right now.
Really will not take a lot to move this.

1122
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
Really will not take a lot to move this.
 

1123
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,990
Really will not take a lot to move this.
So, really bulls will want a pullback to

1124
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
So, really bulls will want a pullback to
 

1125
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,950
So, really bulls will want a pullback to
hold into this area here. They must hold

1126
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
hold into this area here. They must hold
 

1127
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,669
hold into this area here. They must hold
that area there. So there is some shorts

1128
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
that area there. So there is some shorts
 

1129
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,029
that area there. So there is some shorts
coming in here defending this level.

1130
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
coming in here defending this level.
 

1131
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,430
coming in here defending this level.
Point of control now move to 95. If they

1132
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
Point of control now move to 95. If they
 

1133
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,510
Point of control now move to 95. If they
lose that there is a possible pull back

1134
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
lose that there is a possible pull back
 

1135
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,190
lose that there is a possible pull back
into here and then we have to decide

1136
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
into here and then we have to decide
 

1137
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,390
into here and then we have to decide
what we do. All right. If they pull back

1138
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400
what we do. All right. If they pull back
 

1139
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,830
what we do. All right. If they pull back
into here, remember this is basically

1140
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
into here, remember this is basically
 

1141
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,830
into here, remember this is basically
midpoint of this range. It's not ideal.

1142
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
midpoint of this range. It's not ideal.
 

1143
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,350
midpoint of this range. It's not ideal.
And then bulls can have another attempt

1144
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
And then bulls can have another attempt
 

1145
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,630
And then bulls can have another attempt
for this. You want to be careful of a

1146
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
for this. You want to be careful of a
 

1147
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,630
for this. You want to be careful of a
fail breakout over that. So if you're

1148
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
fail breakout over that. So if you're
 

1149
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,549
fail breakout over that. So if you're
bullish, you want to absorb dips here.

1150
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
bullish, you want to absorb dips here.
 

1151
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,470
bullish, you want to absorb dips here.
If they lose that, the full rotation can

1152
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
If they lose that, the full rotation can
 

1153
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,070
If they lose that, the full rotation can
happen.

1154
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
happen.
 

1155
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,669
happen.
And their target right now is to get to

1156
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
And their target right now is to get to
 

1157
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,070
And their target right now is to get to
previous week value area high. And then

1158
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080
previous week value area high. And then
 

1159
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,230
previous week value area high. And then
this level up here 860s. This would be a

1160
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
this level up here 860s. This would be a
 

1161
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,870
this level up here 860s. This would be a
gap fill, right? This is gap fill.

1162
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
gap fill, right? This is gap fill.
 

1163
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,149
gap fill, right? This is gap fill.
Previous uh Friday's point of control,

1164
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
Previous uh Friday's point of control,
 

1165
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,470
Previous uh Friday's point of control,
Friday's value area low would be gap

1166
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
Friday's value area low would be gap
 

1167
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,549
Friday's value area low would be gap
fill. So if they can absorb on this

1168
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
fill. So if they can absorb on this
 

1169
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,269
fill. So if they can absorb on this
pullback, that's your only shot left to

1170
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
pullback, that's your only shot left to
 

1171
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:19,190
pullback, that's your only shot left to
go higher.

1172
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200

 

1173
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,350

What is this blue level I've got marked

1174
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
What is this blue level I've got marked
 

1175
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,190
What is this blue level I've got marked
out here down?

1176
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200
out here down?
 

1177
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,510

in. Still being absorbed. So, I'm just
 

1183
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,029
in. Still being absorbed. So, I'm just
waiting for this tape to calm down.

1184
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
waiting for this tape to calm down.
 

1185

good sign for the broader market. If it

1190
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,760
good sign for the broader market. If it
 

1191
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,269
good sign for the broader market. If it
stays heavy under there, it's going to

1192
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:43,279
stays heavy under there, it's going to
 

1193
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,909
stays heavy under there, it's going to
be a problem. Starting to see this move

1194
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
be a problem. Starting to see this move
 

1195
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,990
be a problem. Starting to see this move
back towards this sort of gray box. All

1261
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,390
volume out in this area that we're at
right now. Dips so far holding not quite

right now. Dips so far holding not quite
coming to this level yet.

1264
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
coming to this level yet.
 

1265
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,350

There are some buyers stuck above 14s on

1266
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
There are some buyers stuck above 14s on
 

1267
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,110
There are some buyers stuck above 14s on
this auction but not a lot but there

1268
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
this auction but not a lot but there
 

1269
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,710
this auction but not a lot but there
were some buyers. The sellers got

1270
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
were some buyers. The sellers got
 

1271
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,549
were some buyers. The sellers got
aggressive from twelves. They've tried

1272
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:04,559
aggressive from twelves. They've tried
 

1273
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,549
aggressive from twelves. They've tried
again to get aggressive at 94 and not

1274
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
again to get aggressive at 94 and not
 

1275
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,470
again to get aggressive at 94 and not
had success. So that's kind of the

1276
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:08,480
had success. So that's kind of the
 

1277
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,350
had success. So that's kind of the
rotation right now is sort of from 95 to

1278
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,360
rotation right now is sort of from 95 to
 

1279
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,590
rotation right now is sort of from 95 to
14s I would say and we can see if

They don't catch a bid. If they don't do

1328
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399

00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
right back down into this because we're
 

1335
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,149
right back down into this because we're
very thin. So, they need to catch a bid

1336
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
very thin. So, they need to catch a bid
 

1337
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,310
very thin. So, they need to catch a bid
here for the sort of bear trap kind of

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
something like this and collapsing,
 

1343
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,669
something like this and collapsing,
we're going to come right back down.

1344

shelf. So, if they don't find a bid

1352
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
shelf. So, if they don't find a bid
 

1353
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,029
shelf. So, if they don't find a bid
here, it will get very, very weak. It's

1423
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,310

we've got more room. More absorption

if they stay heavy there. So we're just
 

1459

if they stay heavy there. So we're just
in a rotational market. We left this

in a rotational market. We left this
 

1461
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,990

have cut rates. Going to take a while to
 

2063
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,710
have cut rates. Going to take a while to
see that start to affect anything.

2064
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:02,720
see that start to affect anything.
 

2065
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,470
see that start to affect anything.
Starting to build out a range here.

2066
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
Starting to build out a range here.
 

2067

2071
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,910

see follow through. I don't think we

2072
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:19,920
see follow through. I don't think we
 

2073
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,510
see follow through. I don't think we
finished selling yet, but uh

2074
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
finished selling yet, but uh
 

2075
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,910
finished selling yet, but uh
we will see. These 700s look like they

2076
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
we will see. These 700s look like they
 

2077
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,109
we will see. These 700s look like they
want to be tagged. Here they go. They're

2078
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:27,119
want to be tagged. Here they go. They're
 

2079
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,349
want to be tagged. Here they go. They're

00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
back into the shelf again. This guy
 

2081
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,270
back into the shelf again. This guy
right here. If they lose that, it's the

2082
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,280
right here. If they lose that, it's the
 

2083
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,030
right here. If they lose that, it's the
New York open is the big over under.

2084
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,040
New York open is the big over under.
 

2085
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,510
New York open is the big over under.

00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,200
coming in at those lows. Not seeing
 

2089
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,270
coming in at those lows. Not seeing
follow through yet. I think 700s are

2090
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,280
follow through yet. I think 700s are
 

2091
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,270
follow through yet. I think 700s are
very, very possible here.

2092
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,280

 

2093
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,030

very aggressive here on the tape. There

2094
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,040
very aggressive here on the tape. There
 

2095
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,270
very aggressive here on the tape. There

2098
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,040

2099
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,750
into this New York open. What do they do
here is the question.

2100
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
here is the question.
 

2101
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,030
here is the question.
So if you're still in the short, you

2102
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,040
So if you're still in the short, you
 

2103
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,990
So if you're still in the short, you
look good. This New York open is your TP

2104
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
look good. This New York open is your TP
 

2105
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,430
look good. This New York open is your TP
somewhere around here. Sellers are

2106
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
somewhere around here. Sellers are
 

2107
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,870
somewhere around here. Sellers are
coming flying in here and starting to

2108
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:58,880
coming flying in here and starting to
 

2109
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,950
coming flying in here and starting to
get themselves bit aggressive at the

2110
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
get themselves bit aggressive at the
 

2111
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,030
get themselves bit aggressive at the
lows. So just TP some out. I'm not in

2112
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
lows. So just TP some out. I'm not in
 

2113
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,270
lows. So just TP some out. I'm not in
any of this now. Like I said, already

2114
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
any of this now. Like I said, already
 

2115
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,510
any of this now. Like I said, already
covered on that last move down to here.

2116
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,520
covered on that last move down to here.
 

2117
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,150
covered on that last move down to here.
This last one down here.

2118
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,160
This last one down here.
 

2119
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,510
This last one down here.
If we start collapsing this, you're

2120
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
If we start collapsing this, you're
 

2121
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,710
If we start collapsing this, you're
watching this previous week point

2122
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
watching this previous week point
 

2123
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,470
watching this previous week point
control this blue box. Do they find a

2125
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,910

bid here? If they don't find a bid here,

2126
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:15,920
bid here? If they don't find a bid here,
 

2127
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,670
bid here? If they don't find a bid here,
we have clear targets. All right. If

2128
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680
we have clear targets. All right. If
 

2129
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,309
we have clear targets. All right. If
they don't find a bid here, we have

2130
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:20,319

2131
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,510
they don't find a bid here, we have
clear targets. If they find a bid here,

2132
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
clear targets. If they find a bid here,
 

2133
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,190
clear targets. If they find a bid here,
rotation back up to here is possible.

2134
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
rotation back up to here is possible.
 

2135
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,870
rotation back up to here is possible.
This is our shelf now. So, we built one

2136
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
This is our shelf now. So, we built one
 

2137
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,430
This is our shelf now. So, we built one
shelf, two shelves. All right. How we

Where's my delta and everything gone?

2146
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:41,200
Where's my delta and everything gone?

Where's my delta and everything gone?
There it is. There we go.

00:45:46,446 --> 00:45:49,910

[snorts]

2150
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:49,920

 

2151
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,349

Right, back to these teens. Back to

Right, back to these teens. Back to
these lows. Still in front of this New

gets swiped. It's It's a matter of time

There's your New York open. This is

There's your New York open. This is
 

2171
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,750
There's your New York open. This is
sentiment. Now, what do they do with

2172
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:11,760
sentiment. Now, what do they do with
 

2173
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,750
sentiment. Now, what do they do with
this? If you come under New York open,

2174
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
this? If you come under New York open,
 

2175
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,430
this? If you come under New York open,
maybe previous weak point of control,

maybe previous weak point of control,

maybe previous weak point of control,
but you should have been covering some

2187
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,750

It's New York open so far right on that

retesting value area low. Now it looks
 

2213
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,670
retesting value area low. Now it looks
very different on mine here. So value

2214
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
very different on mine here. So value
 

2215
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,790
very different on mine here. So value
area low for me on Ninja is 27s. So do

00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:20,800
area low for me on Ninja is 27s. So do
 

2217
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,349
area low for me on Ninja is 27s. So do
they find a bid in front of that or not?

2218
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359
they find a bid in front of that or not?
 

2219
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,589
they find a bid in front of that or not?
If they do, we can go back into rotation

2220
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:25,599
If they do, we can go back into rotation
 

2221
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,270
If they do, we can go back into rotation
inside value for the session, right? and

2222
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:27,280
inside value for the session, right? and
 

2223
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,030
inside value for the session, right? and
we can go right back up to this shelf.

2224
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,040
we can go right back up to this shelf.
 

2225
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,870
we can go right back up to this shelf.
So, I'm watching sort of 27 somewhere

2226
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:30,880
So, I'm watching sort of 27 somewhere
 

2227
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,589
So, I'm watching sort of 27 somewhere
around here. I'm not going to trade it.

2228
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:33,599
around here. I'm not going to trade it.

If they hold this, all right, the

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,910
If they hold this, all right, the

00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920
rotation is possible. If they let go of
 

2233
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,750
rotation is possible. If they let go of
this, I'm expecting, especially under

this, I'm expecting, especially under

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,150

here, we have low hanging fruit if they

2236
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,160
here, we have low hanging fruit if they
 

2237
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,670
here, we have low hanging fruit if they
want to really go for it. At the moment,

2238
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:43,680
want to really go for it. At the moment,
 

2239
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,349
want to really go for it. At the moment,
we're just going into a rotational

we're just going into a rotational
 

2241
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,829
we're just going into a rotational

How do I see it? Again, using orderflow,
guys. Using order flow, you won't see

2248
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
guys. Using order flow, you won't see
 

2249
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,630
guys. Using order flow, you won't see
the sellers and buyers unless you're

00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:06,640
the sellers and buyers unless you're

00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:24,800

 

2259
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,470

Where this big seller came in is right

2260
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,480
Where this big seller came in is right
 

2261
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,430
Where this big seller came in is right
here where we are now. 165 lot came in

2262
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
here where we are now. 165 lot came in
 

2263
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,589
here where we are now. 165 lot came in
at 720 and below. So they need it back

2264
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:31,599
at 720 and below. So they need it back
 

2265
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,829
at 720 and below. So they need it back
below 720. These sellers if they don't

2266
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:33,839
below 720. These sellers if they don't
 

2267
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,589
below 720. These sellers if they don't
get it back below 720s they are going to

2268
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
get it back below 720s they are going to
 

2269
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,670
get it back below 720s they are going to
remain stuck down here. They need it

2270
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:37,680
remain stuck down here. They need it
 

2271
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,990
remain stuck down here. They need it
back below 720s for them to be back in

2272
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,000
back below 720s for them to be back in
 

2273
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,670
back below 720s for them to be back in
the money. So this is how it becomes

2274
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
the money. So this is how it becomes
 

2275
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,549
the money. So this is how it becomes
key. Now if buyers bid at 720s then the

2276
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:44,559
key. Now if buyers bid at 720s then the
 

2277
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,230
key. Now if buyers bid at 720s then the
sellers remain stuck. If buyers don't

2278
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,240
sellers remain stuck. If buyers don't
 

2279
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,309
sellers remain stuck. If buyers don't
bid at 720s, then sellers can come back

2280
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:48,319
bid at 720s, then sellers can come back
 

2281
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,150
bid at 720s, then sellers can come back
in, try and complete that rotation

2282
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
in, try and complete that rotation
 

2283
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,790
in, try and complete that rotation
underneath that New York open.

2284
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:52,800
underneath that New York open.
 

2285
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,950
underneath that New York open.
So, this is why 720s is starting to

2286
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
So, this is why 720s is starting to
 

2287
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,829
So, this is why 720s is starting to
become key here.

2288
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
become key here.
 

2289
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,589
become key here.
Yes, underneath that New York open or

2290
00:48:59,589 --> 00:48:59,599
Yes, underneath that New York open or
 

2291
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,950
Yes, underneath that New York open or
sort of right at it. So, 720s becoming

2292
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
sort of right at it. So, 720s becoming
 

2293
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,190
sort of right at it. So, 720s becoming
key here. Do we start to stay heavy

2294
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:05,200
key here. Do we start to stay heavy
 

2295
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,950
key here. Do we start to stay heavy
underneath this and let these sellers in

2296
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
underneath this and let these sellers in
 

2297
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,270
underneath this and let these sellers in
the money? Here we go. So, big selling

2298
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:09,280
the money? Here we go. So, big selling
 

2299
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,190
the money? Here we go. So, big selling
came in at 13s. That's the next level

2300
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,200
came in at 13s. That's the next level
 

2301
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,430
came in at 13s. That's the next level
under 20s, 13s and then 10. And then

2302
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:13,440
under 20s, 13s and then 10. And then
 

2303
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,349
under 20s, 13s and then 10. And then
under there we're thin and we can look

2304
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:15,359
under there we're thin and we can look
 

2305
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,190
under there we're thin and we can look
at for expansion underneath that New

2306
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
at for expansion underneath that New
 

2307
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,030
at for expansion underneath that New
York open. So this kind of area here is

2308
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,040
York open. So this kind of area here is
 

2309
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,190
York open. So this kind of area here is
the key battle. Now this is where

2310
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
the key battle. Now this is where
 

2311
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,109
the key battle. Now this is where
sellers keep trying to get acceptance

2312
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:23,119
sellers keep trying to get acceptance
 

2313
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,870
sellers keep trying to get acceptance
lower at these lows and they're not able

2314
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:24,880
lower at these lows and they're not able
 

2315
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,109
lower at these lows and they're not able
to yet. We are seeing some form of

2316
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:29,119
to yet. We are seeing some form of
 

2317
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,630
to yet. We are seeing some form of
passive buying. Uh CBD looks absolutely

2318
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:32,640
passive buying. Uh CBD looks absolutely
 

2319
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,990
passive buying. Uh CBD looks absolutely
terrible in this session. I'll tell you

2320
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
terrible in this session. I'll tell you
 

2321
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,309
terrible in this session. I'll tell you
that much. Looks looks awful. It's

2322
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319

2417
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,549
liquidity a bit like we had here. So a
break above this can come up to here. A

00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:12,720
one thing that's putting me off what I'm
 

2505

week point of control. So, underneath
 

2511
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,750

And if you are short, uh I think you

2520
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,440
And if you are short, uh I think you
 

2521
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,710
And if you are short, uh I think you
want 15s and 20s to be protected. All

00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:34,720
want 15s and 20s to be protected. All

want 15s and 20s to be protected. All
right? So any pop-up, you want 15 and 20

2524
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,040
right? So any pop-up, you want 15 and 20
 

2525
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,589
right? So any pop-up, you want 15 and 20
to be protected. I personally would not

2526
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
to be protected. I personally would not
 

2527
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,109
to be protected. I personally would not
want to see it go over that if I was

2528
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:41,119
want to see it go over that if I was
 

2529
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,790
want to see it go over that if I was
short in this.

2613
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,030

I'd be watching this trigger point on

2614
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:23,040
I'd be watching this trigger point on
 

2615
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,430
I'd be watching this trigger point on
the queue. So 20day on the cues is into

2616
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:25,440
the queue. So 20day on the cues is into
 

2617
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,829
the queue. So 20day on the cues is into
this six 1920s.

2618
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:29,839
this six 1920s.
 

2619
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,910
this six 1920s.
What VIX has got to get going. I don't

2620
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
What VIX has got to get going. I don't
 

2621
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,750
What VIX has got to get going. I don't
like what I'm seeing here on the VIX. So

2622
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:33,760
like what I'm seeing here on the VIX. So
 

2623
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,990
like what I'm seeing here on the VIX. So
one thing makes me a little bit iffy.

2624
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:36,000
one thing makes me a little bit iffy.
 

2625
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,750
one thing makes me a little bit iffy.
You look good to keep holding but I

2626
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:37,760
You look good to keep holding but I
 

2627
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,190
You look good to keep holding but I
wouldn't be adding size. If VIX was

2628
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:39,200
wouldn't be adding size. If VIX was
 

2629
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,790
wouldn't be adding size. If VIX was
breaking out upside, I'd be willing to

2630

So 670 is next level. Like I said,
 

2635
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,910
So 670 is next level. Like I said,

2711
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,430

There is a bid down here at 660. They

2712
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,440
There is a bid down here at 660. They
 

2713
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,829
There is a bid down here at 660. They
still got unfinished business. It's just

2714
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:27,839
still got unfinished business. It's just
 

2715
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,190
still got unfinished business. It's just
whether they need to drift higher to

2716
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
whether they need to drift higher to
 

2717
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,349
whether they need to drift higher to
reload it or not. Here's the 74s again.

2718
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:33,359
reload it or not. Here's the 74s again.
 

2719
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,670
reload it or not. Here's the 74s again.
If they fail these, you'd imagine 660s

2720
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:35,680
If they fail these, you'd imagine 660s
 

2721
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,470
If they fail these, you'd imagine 660s
will come pretty quick. Here we go. So,

2722
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:38,480
will come pretty quick. Here we go. So,
 

2723
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,470
will come pretty quick. Here we go. So,
this is 70s. They're going to look 60s

2724
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
this is 70s. They're going to look 60s
 

2725
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,750
this is 70s. They're going to look 60s
here. They're going to look to take out

2726
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
here. They're going to look to take out
 

2727
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,750
here. They're going to look to take out
these uh stops here and then try and get

2728
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:43,760
these uh stops here and then try and get
 

2729
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,270
these uh stops here and then try and get
back down into value low. That's what

2730
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
back down into value low. That's what
 

2731
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,589
back down into value low. That's what
they're looking to do. Remember, if

2732
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
they're looking to do. Remember, if
 

2733
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,829
they're looking to do. Remember, if
you're a buyer here and you get stopped

2734
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:49,839
you're a buyer here and you get stopped
 

2735
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,510
you're a buyer here and you get stopped
out, you become a seller and that wash

2736
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:51,520
out, you become a seller and that wash
 

2737
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,030
out, you become a seller and that wash
into there then becomes possible, which

2738
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
into there then becomes possible, which
 

2739
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,734
into there then becomes possible, which
is what they're looking for.

The fact that we rejected the old twoe

There they go. They're going to try and
sweep these stops out here. So, your

00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:36,079
sweep these stops out here. So, your
 

2809
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,470
sweep these stops out here. So, your
TPS, your next TPS might be hit there.

Big selling has come in at 72. So,
 

2813
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,750
Big selling has come in at 72. So,
that's your overunder in this like

little shelf here. They've got to stay
 

2817
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,309
little shelf here. They've got to stay
heavy around here for that wash that

heavy around here for that wash that
 

2819
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,870
heavy around here for that wash that
back down to uh value area low. I would

2820
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:48,880
back down to uh value area low. I would
 

2821
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,630
back down to uh value area low. I would
say if they can get there previous week

2822
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:50,640
say if they can get there previous week
 

2823
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,750
say if they can get there previous week
value area low which is into the 40s.

we uh if they stop run these and you get
 

2851

Oh, so you made $42. Maybe that's what

Overall on the daily, we are in a

01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:58,240
Overall on the daily, we are in a
 

2881
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,990
Overall on the daily, we are in a

Let's have a look at the daily. How we

2886
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:02,799
Let's have a look at the daily. How we
 

2887
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:07,349
Let's have a look at the daily. How we
started the day. Uh yeah, so we're in

2888
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
started the day. Uh yeah, so we're in
 

2889
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,349
started the day. Uh yeah, so we're in
we're in that balance. Where are you

2890
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:09,359
we're in that balance. Where are you
 

2891
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:10,870
we're in that balance. Where are you
guys? Let me just get you over to this

2892
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:10,880
guys? Let me just get you over to this
 

2893
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,510
guys? Let me just get you over to this
daily.

2894
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:13,520
daily.
 

2895
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,950
daily.
All right, we're in that balance, aren't

2896
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:14,960
All right, we're in that balance, aren't
 

2897
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,430
All right, we're in that balance, aren't
we? If we think about what the market's

2898
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440
we? If we think about what the market's
 

2899
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,789
we? If we think about what the market's
done

2900
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:20,799

 

2901
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,750

from swing to swing, right, there's your

2902
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
from swing to swing, right, there's your
 

2903
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,349
from swing to swing, right, there's your
61.

2904
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
61.
 

2905
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,069
61.
This is the old balance range. And this,

2906
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:28,079
This is the old balance range. And this,
 

2907
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,789
This is the old balance range. And this,
have we reclaimed it? No. All right,

2908
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:30,799
have we reclaimed it? No. All right,
 

2909
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,150
have we reclaimed it? No. All right,
there's the pullback. Did we make a

2910
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
there's the pullback. Did we make a
 

2911
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,990
there's the pullback. Did we make a
lower low?

2912
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
lower low?
 

2913
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,470
lower low?
No. All right, we're in a rotation from

2914
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,480
No. All right, we're in a rotation from
 

2915
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,510
No. All right, we're in a rotation from
here to here at the moment. If bulls

2916
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
here to here at the moment. If bulls
 

2917
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,030
here to here at the moment. If bulls
need to take control, they need to take

2918
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,040
need to take control, they need to take
 

2919
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,030
need to take control, they need to take
control of this and bid back over this.

2920
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,040
control of this and bid back over this.
 

2921
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,030
control of this and bid back over this.
And that will allow that new all-time

2922
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,040
And that will allow that new all-time
 

2923
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,950
And that will allow that new all-time
high. If they fail here, we probably

2924
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:46,960
high. If they fail here, we probably
 

2925
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,789
high. If they fail here, we probably
rotate back down to this. If they fail

2926
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
rotate back down to this. If they fail
 

2927
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,710
rotate back down to this. If they fail
this, we can come back down to this. If

2928
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,720
this, we can come back down to this. If
 

2929
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,309
this, we can come back down to this. If
they fail this, then we're going to have

2930
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
they fail this, then we're going to have
 

2931
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:56,630
they fail this, then we're going to have
a huge amount of volume built out

2932
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
a huge amount of volume built out
 

2933
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,870
a huge amount of volume built out
and that wash becomes more and more

2934
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:58,880
and that wash becomes more and more
 

2935
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,870
and that wash becomes more and more
probable. Right? if they cannot get back

2936
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:00,880
probable. Right? if they cannot get back
 

2937
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,190
probable. Right? if they cannot get back
above this

2938
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:03,200
above this
 

2939
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,589
above this
and remember we've seen divergence

2940
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:05,599
and remember we've seen divergence
 

2941
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:11,430
and remember we've seen divergence
remember ES uh RTY etc etc right taking

2942
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
remember ES uh RTY etc etc right taking
 

2943
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,549
remember ES uh RTY etc etc right taking
this out and pulling back so we just

2944
01:02:14,549 --> 01:02:14,559
this out and pulling back so we just
 

2945
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,150
this out and pulling back so we just
need to give it a little bit of time at

2946
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,160
need to give it a little bit of time at
 

2947
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,230
need to give it a little bit of time at
the moment but yes like you can see this

2948
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
the moment but yes like you can see this
 

2949
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,829
the moment but yes like you can see this
low volume node is where we caught a bid

2950
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
low volume node is where we caught a bid
 

2951
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,309
low volume node is where we caught a bid
look at look at how condensed

2952
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:22,319
look at look at how condensed
 

2953
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,670
look at look at how condensed
even this is 50-day

01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:25,680
even this is 50-day

bands that will change. I still think

2958
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:30,559
bands that will change. I still think
 

2959
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,630
bands that will change. I still think
this guy down here is looming for a

2960
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
this guy down here is looming for a
 

2961
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,230
this guy down here is looming for a
retest. When was the last retest of him?

2962
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
retest. When was the last retest of him?
 

2963
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,349
retest. When was the last retest of him?
May. Right. So, Mr. 200, I think, is

2964
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:41,359
May. Right. So, Mr. 200, I think, is
 

2965
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,109
May. Right. So, Mr. 200, I think, is
looming for a retest, but we're we're

2966
01:02:43,109 --> 01:02:43,119
looming for a retest, but we're we're
 

2967
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,190
looming for a retest, but we're we're
just give it time. Remember, we're we're

2968
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,200
just give it time. Remember, we're we're
 

2969
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,349
just give it time. Remember, we're we're
not expecting much in this uh session

2970
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:47,359
not expecting much in this uh session
 

2971
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:52,309
not expecting much in this uh session
here.

2972
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:52,319

 

2973
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,950

Okay, there's your retest.

2974
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960

 

2975
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,549

There's your retest.

2976
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:00,559

 

2977
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:01,990

So, I couldn't sweep this out. I only

2978
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,000
So, I couldn't sweep this out. I only
 

2979
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,670
So, I couldn't sweep this out. I only
swept the internal. Couldn't sweep this

2980
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
swept the internal. Couldn't sweep this
 

2981
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,309
swept the internal. Couldn't sweep this
out. That's pretty annoying, isn't it?

2982
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319
out. That's pretty annoying, isn't it?
 

2983
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,030
out. That's pretty annoying, isn't it?
There we go. All right, back to the

2984
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,040
There we go. All right, back to the
 

2985
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,589
There we go. All right, back to the
open.

2986
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:11,599
open.
 

2987
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,390

01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:14,400
Back to uh

Back to uh

2990
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640

ES trying to get back to its open. It's

2992
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
ES trying to get back to its open. It's
 

2993
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,069
ES trying to get back to its open. It's
back to its open now. It's got both VWs

2994
01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:20,079
back to its open now. It's got both VWs
 

2995
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,950
back to its open now. It's got both VWs
above it as do we. And you can see

2996
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
above it as do we. And you can see
 

2997
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,910
above it as do we. And you can see
volume shifting, migrating now. Big old

2998
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
volume shifting, migrating now. Big old
 

2999

Dshape, right? If we think about this so

3000
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:28,640
Dshape, right? If we think about this so
 

3001
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,029
Dshape, right? If we think about this so
far on this session,

3002
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
far on this session,
 

3003
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,750
far on this session,
not many nodes, big old Dshape. There's

3004
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:33,760
not many nodes, big old Dshape. There's
 

3005
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,470
not many nodes, big old Dshape. There's
your rotation.

3006
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,480
your rotation.
 

3007
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,829
your rotation.
So far in this session, we're coming

3008
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:37,839
So far in this session, we're coming
 

3009
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,510
So far in this session, we're coming
right to the midpoint of it. Fun, fun,

3010
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,520
right to the midpoint of it. Fun, fun,
 

3011
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,270
right to the midpoint of it. Fun, fun,
fun, fun, fun. That's why we have to be

3012
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,280
fun, fun, fun. That's why we have to be
 

3013
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,870
fun, fun, fun. That's why we have to be
taking profits down here. We didn't

3014
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:42,880
taking profits down here. We didn't
 

3015
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,230
taking profits down here. We didn't
never got that snap. Unfortunately, it

3016
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:44,240
never got that snap. Unfortunately, it
 

3017
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,670
never got that snap. Unfortunately, it
might come later. We might retest it and

3018
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
might come later. We might retest it and
 

3019
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,230
might come later. We might retest it and
stay heavy. We don't know. But, uh, this

3020
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
stay heavy. We don't know. But, uh, this
 

3021
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,349
stay heavy. We don't know. But, uh, this
is the level that we talked about

3022
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:49,359
is the level that we talked about
 

3023
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,510
is the level that we talked about
earlier where the sellers came flying

3024
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,520
earlier where the sellers came flying
 

3025
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,950
earlier where the sellers came flying
in. It's these teens. If they get stuck

3026
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:54,960
in. It's these teens. If they get stuck
 

3027
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,430
in. It's these teens. If they get stuck
here, there is a squeeze out probably

3028
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:57,440
here, there is a squeeze out probably
 

3029
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,069
here, there is a squeeze out probably
above 20s. The next level above being to

3030
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:00,079
above 20s. The next level above being to
 

3031
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,390
above 20s. The next level above being to
sort of 38ish, somewhere around that.

3032
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:04,400
sort of 38ish, somewhere around that.
 

3033
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,829
sort of 38ish, somewhere around that.
Sellers running out of bullets. I just

3034
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
Sellers running out of bullets. I just
 

3035
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,510
Sellers running out of bullets. I just
think we're in a rotation. We're just in

3036
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:07,520
think we're in a rotation. We're just in
 

3037
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,069
think we're in a rotation. We're just in
a rotation, right? We're guys, it's it's

3038
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079
a rotation, right? We're guys, it's it's
 

3039
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,309
a rotation, right? We're guys, it's it's
7:18. We've been here 50 minutes on a

3040
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:12,319
7:18. We've been here 50 minutes on a
 

3041
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:15,109
7:18. We've been here 50 minutes on a
low volume day. I think lots of time

3042
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:15,119
low volume day. I think lots of time
 

3043
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,670
low volume day. I think lots of time
left, right? This can still be resold.

3044
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:17,680
left, right? This can still be resold.
 

3045
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,109
left, right? This can still be resold.
Think about this, right? If this is your

3046
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:21,119
Think about this, right? If this is your
 

3047
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,870
Think about this, right? If this is your
thin level where we got thin, where we

3048
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
thin level where we got thin, where we
 

3049
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,190
thin level where we got thin, where we
trapped buyers, where we sold down and

3050
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:27,200
trapped buyers, where we sold down and
 

3051
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,430
trapped buyers, where we sold down and
sold down, right? They can see still

3052
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
sold down, right? They can see still
 

3053
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,349
sold down, right? They can see still
resell this. I'll change my mind if we

3054
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359
resell this. I'll change my mind if we
 

3055
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:32,950
resell this. I'll change my mind if we
start to do this, right? If we start to

3056
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
start to do this, right? If we start to
 

3057
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,069
start to do this, right? If we start to
build top side of here, this far too

3058
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:36,079
build top side of here, this far too
 

3059
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,230
build top side of here, this far too
early to say sellers are done. Far far

3060
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
early to say sellers are done. Far far
 

3061
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:45,910
early to say sellers are done. Far far
far too early. We're just in a balance.

3062
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:45,920

 

3063
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:52,950

Plenty of time left in this session.

3064
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960

 

3065
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,789

and ES couldn't get back up to its speed

3066
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:54,799
and ES couldn't get back up to its speed
 

3067
01:04:54,799 --> 01:05:01,349
and ES couldn't get back up to its speed
up there.

3069
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,190

Well, VIX doesn't look good really,

3070
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
Well, VIX doesn't look good really,
 

3071
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,750
Well, VIX doesn't look good really,
Peter. It's drifting lower. I don't I

3072
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:05,760
Peter. It's drifting lower. I don't I
 

3073
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,190
Peter. It's drifting lower. I don't I
don't really like what I'm seeing on the

3074
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,200
don't really like what I'm seeing on the
 

3075
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,430
don't really like what I'm seeing on the
VIX right now.

3076
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
VIX right now.
 

3077
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,349
VIX right now.
It's uh it's it needs to get back above

3078
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
It's uh it's it needs to get back above
 

3079
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:17,910
It's uh it's it needs to get back above
1510. really above 1510 uh for a VIX

3080
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:17,920
1510. really above 1510 uh for a VIX
 

3081
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,430
1510. really above 1510 uh for a VIX
squeeze would be nice rather than

3082
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
squeeze would be nice rather than
 

3083
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:25,109
squeeze would be nice rather than
keeping rejecting the pivot up here.

3084
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119

 

3085
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,029

Remember, we want VIX to do inverse of

shelf here into 20s. Remember I said if
 

3141
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,750
shelf here into 20s. Remember I said if
we get through 20s, they probably led it

3142
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:31,760
we get through 20s, they probably led it
 

3143
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,950
we get through 20s, they probably led it
to 36.

3144
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:34,960

01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
candles up here above sort of above the
 

3149
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,190
candles up here above sort of above the
15. So this is the big level, right? If

3150
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,200
15. So this is the big level, right? If
 

3151
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,950
15. So this is the big level, right? If
we look at I can take you over here.

3152
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:44,960
we look at I can take you over here.

We think about where big selling came

3154
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
We think about where big selling came
 

3155
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,670
We think about where big selling came
in. Look at this strong shift here where

3156
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:49,680
in. Look at this strong shift here where
 

3157
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,150
in. Look at this strong shift here where
these buyers last got caught. All right,

3158
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,160
these buyers last got caught. All right,
 

3159
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,150
these buyers last got caught. All right,
we went buy side shove up

3160
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
we went buy side shove up
 

3161
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,950
we went buy side shove up
into sort of here. Come on.

3162
01:06:58,950 --> 01:06:58,960
into sort of here. Come on.
 

3163
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,549
into sort of here. Come on.
Right here. This is where the buyers

3164
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:00,559
Right here. This is where the buyers
 

3165
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:01,910
Right here. This is where the buyers
last got caught on the sell. We're

3166
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:01,920
last got caught on the sell. We're
 

3167
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,230
last got caught on the sell. We're
revisiting that level through here. This

3168
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
revisiting that level through here. This
 

3169
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,069
revisiting that level through here. This
is where strong selling took place. Look

3170
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
is where strong selling took place. Look
 

3171
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,990
is where strong selling took place. Look
at the delta. Big selling in this candle

3172
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
at the delta. Big selling in this candle
 

3173
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,789
at the delta. Big selling in this candle
here. All right. So, this 20 to 40s

3174
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
here. All right. So, this 20 to 40s
 

3175
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,069
here. All right. So, this 20 to 40s
becomes key as well. I was saying if

3176
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:12,079
becomes key as well. I was saying if
 

3177
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,190
becomes key as well. I was saying if
they get through 20s, they're probably

3178
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:13,200
they get through 20s, they're probably
 

3179
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,029
they get through 20s, they're probably
going to go 38s 40s.

3180
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,039
going to go 38s 40s.
 

3181
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,870
going to go 38s 40s.
All right. Just just based on what

3182
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:18,880
All right. Just just based on what
 

3183
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,750
All right. Just just based on what
actually occurred during this this sort

3184
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:21,760
actually occurred during this this sort
 

3185
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,789
actually occurred during this this sort
of time here. I'd say from 9:55 to

3186
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:24,799
of time here. I'd say from 9:55 to
 

3187
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,870
of time here. I'd say from 9:55 to
10:02, right? So, we're just watching

3188
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:28,880
10:02, right? So, we're just watching
 

3189
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,990
10:02, right? So, we're just watching
price revisit that area of let's just

3190
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,000
price revisit that area of let's just
 

3191
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,390
price revisit that area of let's just
call it of a battle of of a contestion.

Don't do that. You're going to see Think

Don't do that. You're going to see Think
 

3245
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,229
Don't do that. You're going to see Think

01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
going to see some profit taking. Do not
 

3257
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,390

first dip, right? You don't need to rush
 

3261
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,789
first dip, right? You don't need to rush
into these positions, right? They take

3262
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
into these positions, right? They take
 

3263
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,870
into these positions, right? They take
time to develop. This could very, very

3264
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:06,880
time to develop. This could very, very
 

3265
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,950
time to develop. This could very, very
well come all the way back down to here

well come all the way back down to here
 

3267
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,149
well come all the way back down to here
and see if it can find some

3268
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
and see if it can find some
 

3269
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,630
and see if it can find some
consolidation for a go back up. It might

3270
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:12,640
consolidation for a go back up. It might
 

3271
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,390
consolidation for a go back up. It might
find a bid before. It could also come up

3272
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
find a bid before. It could also come up
 

3273
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,910
find a bid before. It could also come up
here and find a failed follow through.

3274
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
here and find a failed follow through.
 

3275

If enough retail get trapped here, this

If enough retail get trapped here, this
 

3277
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,430
If enough retail get trapped here, this
will be the collapse of it. All right?

3278
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:19,440
will be the collapse of it. All right?

the first to buy it on a dip. You guys
saying you're buying uh against this big

01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,829
up there like absolute psychopath move.
Even if we go going to think about this

3310
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:53,839
Even if we go going to think about this
 

3311
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,149
Even if we go going to think about this
whole thing, right? 50% retracement. You

3312
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:56,159
whole thing, right? 50% retracement. You
 

3313
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,950
whole thing, right? 50% retracement. You
got to get back to 64 or right 61 in

3314
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
got to get back to 64 or right 61 in
 

3315
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,390
got to get back to 64 or right 61 in
this golden zone. You got to get back

3316
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:00,400
this golden zone. You got to get back
 

3317
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,550
this golden zone. You got to get back
into the 60s per ounce. It's got a long

3318
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
into the 60s per ounce. It's got a long
 

3319
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,950
into the 60s per ounce. It's got a long
way to go before I'd consider buying it.

3320
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
way to go before I'd consider buying it.
 

3321
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,030
way to go before I'd consider buying it.
Long, long way.

3322
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,040
Long, long way.

what
I don't know CNN and CBS and all these

01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:13,679
I don't know CNN and CBS and all these

I don't know CNN and CBS and all these
people saying. They will get you caught.

people saying. They will get you caught.
 

3331
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,070
people saying. They will get you caught.
All right? They don't know what they're

3332
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
All right? They don't know what they're
 

3333
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,830
All right? They don't know what they're
talking about. Do not get caught into

01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:24,310
talking about. Do not get caught into
that trap.

3336
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320

 

3337
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,510

Do not get caught into the trap.

3338
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520

 

3339
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,910

Ask yourself, if you are up almost 100%

3340
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:31,920
Ask yourself, if you are up almost 100%
 

3341
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,750
Ask yourself, if you are up almost 100%
in a month, would you be buying or would

3342
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:33,760
in a month, would you be buying or would
 

3343
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,229
in a month, would you be buying or would
you be taking some profits, right? And

3344
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:36,239
you be taking some profits, right? And
 

3345
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,189
you be taking some profits, right? And
then times that by

3346
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:39,199
then times that by
 

3347
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:42,149
then times that by
billions and trillions of dollars. Okay,

3348
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:42,159
billions and trillions of dollars. Okay,
 

3349
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,390
billions and trillions of dollars. Okay,
we are due a pullback. Do I think it

3350
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
we are due a pullback. Do I think it
 

3351
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,630
we are due a pullback. Do I think it
would be rebid on? Yes, I do think it

3352
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
would be rebid on? Yes, I do think it
 

3353
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,110
would be rebid on? Yes, I do think it
would be rebid on early between Jan and

3354
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,120
would be rebid on early between Jan and
 

3355
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,950
would be rebid on early between Jan and
Mark.

3356
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,960
Mark.
 

3357
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,390
Mark.
But you're currently trying to buy a

3358
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
But you're currently trying to buy a
 

3359
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,630
But you're currently trying to buy a
pullback on 29th

3360
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:54,640
pullback on 29th
 

3361
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,750
pullback on 29th
after last week it went up over 25%. And

3362
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:57,760
after last week it went up over 25%. And
 

3363
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,350
after last week it went up over 25%. And
over the month it's gone up almost 100%.

3364
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
over the month it's gone up almost 100%.
 

3365
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,149
over the month it's gone up almost 100%.
Right? So you just don't do that. Make

3366
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:04,159
Right? So you just don't do that. Make
 

3367
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,310
Right? So you just don't do that. Make
that make sense to me. If Apple had

3368
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:06,320
that make sense to me. If Apple had
 

3369
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,630
that make sense to me. If Apple had
moved from 200 to 400 in a couple of

3370
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:10,640
moved from 200 to 400 in a couple of
 

3371
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,950
moved from 200 to 400 in a couple of
days in in a in a week or two weeks or

3372
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:12,960
days in in a in a week or two weeks or
 

3373
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,310
days in in a in a week or two weeks or
three weeks, would you be buying it? No,

3374
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:14,320
three weeks, would you be buying it? No,
 

3375
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,510
three weeks, would you be buying it? No,
you wouldn't. So don't do it with

3376
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:15,520
you wouldn't. So don't do it with
 

3377
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,189
you wouldn't. So don't do it with
anything else just cuz just cuz they're

3378
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:17,199
anything else just cuz just cuz they're
 

3379
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,630
anything else just cuz just cuz they're
talking about it. Understand the auction

3380
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:18,640
talking about it. Understand the auction
 

3381
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,910
talking about it. Understand the auction
theory.

3382
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:19,920
theory.
 

3383
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,870
theory.
Clearly, it can't find value up there.

3384
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:22,880
Clearly, it can't find value up there.
 

3385
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,669
Clearly, it can't find value up there.
Very, very clearly. It's moved from 30

3386
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
Very, very clearly. It's moved from 30
 

3387
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,189
Very, very clearly. It's moved from 30
an ounce to 80 an ounce. Like, just make

3388
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
an ounce to 80 an ounce. Like, just make
 

3389
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,070
an ounce to 80 an ounce. Like, just make
it make sense.

3390
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
it make sense.
 

3391
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,910
it make sense.
Can't do it forever. All right. Doesn't

3392
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:33,920
Can't do it forever. All right. Doesn't
 

3393
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,350
Can't do it forever. All right. Doesn't
mean it can't go back there and revisit

3394
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:35,360
mean it can't go back there and revisit
 

3395
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,189
mean it can't go back there and revisit
it. But why buy the first pullback,

3396
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:37,199
it. But why buy the first pullback,
 

3397
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,950
it. But why buy the first pullback,
folks? You're too smart to do that. All

3398
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:38,960
folks? You're too smart to do that. All
 

3399
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,990
folks? You're too smart to do that. All
right? You're far too smart to do that.

3400
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
right? You're far too smart to do that.
 

3401
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,630
right? You're far too smart to do that.
Why don't I use IB? I do use IB. Initial

3407
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,430

There's no initial balance to trade yet,

3408
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:53,440
There's no initial balance to trade yet,
 

3409

There's no initial balance to trade yet,
my friend. It's the first hour of

3415
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:08,790

Absolutely. Use initial balance.

01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:08,800

 

3417
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,470

01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,480
this session up into here into this VW
 

3429
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,390
this session up into here into this VW
up. All right, you can see this is the

3430
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:24,400
up. All right, you can see this is the
 

3431
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,310
up. All right, you can see this is the
D-shaped profile. It might well be that

3432
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,320
D-shaped profile. It might well be that
 

3433
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,910
D-shaped profile. It might well be that
they rotate from here. All right, if

3434
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
they rotate from here. All right, if
 

3435
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,669
they rotate from here. All right, if
they get acceptance through here or

3436
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:29,679
they get acceptance through here or
 

3437
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,189
they get acceptance through here or
they're going to get through this thin

3438
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
they're going to get through this thin
 

3439
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,630
they're going to get through this thin
structure, aren't they? So sellers will

3440
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:32,640
structure, aren't they? So sellers will
 

3441
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,830
structure, aren't they? So sellers will
want to come and defend this for the

3442
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:33,840
want to come and defend this for the
 

3443
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,189
want to come and defend this for the
rotation. Buyers will want to try and

3444
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:35,199
rotation. Buyers will want to try and
 

3445
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,030
rotation. Buyers will want to try and
force a squeeze here, force their hand

3446
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:37,040
force a squeeze here, force their hand
 

3447
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,950
force a squeeze here, force their hand
out to get back to these highs. We can

3448
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960
out to get back to these highs. We can
 

3449
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,430
out to get back to these highs. We can
just wait. You've got four minutes until

3450
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,440
just wait. You've got four minutes until
 

3451
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,990
just wait. You've got four minutes until
a new 30 minute candle and 15 minute and

3452
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:44,000
a new 30 minute candle and 15 minute and
 

3453
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,830
a new 30 minute candle and 15 minute and
5 minute candle and IB is set.

3454
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:47,840
5 minute candle and IB is set.
 

3455
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,229
5 minute candle and IB is set.
I imagine the sellers will want to

3456
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:50,239
I imagine the sellers will want to
 

3457
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:53,110
I imagine the sellers will want to
defend here or hereabouts.

3458
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,120
defend here or hereabouts.
 

3459
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,390
defend here or hereabouts.
And if they don't, then we're going to

3460
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:54,400
And if they don't, then we're going to
 

3461
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,990
And if they don't, then we're going to
go back for that shelf that we first

3462
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,000
go back for that shelf that we first
 

3463
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,110
go back for that shelf that we first
shorted this morning.

3464
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,120
shorted this morning.
 

3465
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,350
shorted this morning.
What is IB? IB is initial balance. All

3466
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,360
What is IB? IB is initial balance. All
 

3467
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,830
What is IB? IB is initial balance. All
it is is the highest point and the

3468
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:03,840
it is is the highest point and the
 

3469
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,910
it is is the highest point and the
lowest point of the first hour of

3470
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:05,920
lowest point of the first hour of
 

3471
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,510
lowest point of the first hour of
trading in a current session. So

3472
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
trading in a current session. So
 

3473
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,350
trading in a current session. So
obviously we're trading New York. So

3474
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
obviously we're trading New York. So
 

3475
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,950
obviously we're trading New York. So
it's 9:30 to 10:30, right? 9:30 to

3476
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:12,960
it's 9:30 to 10:30, right? 9:30 to
 

3477
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,030
it's 9:30 to 10:30, right? 9:30 to
10:30. Everything's still being

3478
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,040
10:30. Everything's still being
 

3479
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,709
10:30. Everything's still being
absorbed. There's sellers here at 50,

3480
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:16,719
absorbed. There's sellers here at 50,
 

3481
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,950
absorbed. There's sellers here at 50,
55, 60. There was a seller at 80, but

3482
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
55, 60. There was a seller at 80, but
 

3483
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:29,350
55, 60. There was a seller at 80, but
he's left the building right now.

3484
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,360

 

3485
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,950

And where did that big buyer come in?

3486
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:30,960
And where did that big buyer come in?
 

3487
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,350
And where did that big buyer come in?
39. All right. So we've got delta,

3488
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,360
39. All right. So we've got delta,
 

3489
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,669
39. All right. So we've got delta,
positive delta above 39. They're trying

3490
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
positive delta above 39. They're trying
 

3491
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,910
positive delta above 39. They're trying
to hold above 39s right now. These

3492
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
to hold above 39s right now. These
 

3493
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,750
to hold above 39s right now. These
buyers

3494
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:39,760
buyers
 

3495
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,669
buyers
revisit towards an old imbalance and be

3496
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:43,679
revisit towards an old imbalance and be
 

3497
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:54,390
revisit towards an old imbalance and be
up here into 50.

3498
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:54,400

 

3499
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,950

There we go. Testing this seller up

3500
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:56,960
There we go. Testing this seller up
 

3501
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,510
There we go. Testing this seller up
here. This is that imbalance into around

3502
01:13:59,510 --> 01:13:59,520
here. This is that imbalance into around
 

3503
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,550
here. This is that imbalance into around
the 50s and the value area high. So, do

3504
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:02,560
the 50s and the value area high. So, do
 

3505
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,630
the 50s and the value area high. So, do
sellers do a little look above? Do they

3506
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:04,640
sellers do a little look above? Do they
 

3507
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,310
sellers do a little look above? Do they
let them come above, do a look above and

3508
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,320
let them come above, do a look above and
 

3509
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,709
let them come above, do a look above and
fail,

3510
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:08,719
fail,
 

3511
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,709
fail,
or do they just defend this range and go

3512
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:10,719
or do they just defend this range and go
 

3513
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:18,550
or do they just defend this range and go
for rotation? We're about to find out.

3514
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:18,560

 

3515
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,070

So, this is the 40 where we have

3516
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:20,080
So, this is the 40 where we have
 

3517
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,430
So, this is the 40 where we have
positive delta above which they're

3518
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
positive delta above which they're
 

3519
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,950
positive delta above which they're
testing now. It's where the big buyer

3520
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:22,960
testing now. It's where the big buyer
 

3521
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:30,630
testing now. It's where the big buyer
came in

3522
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:30,640

 

3523
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,310

and big buyer still holding price there

3524
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
and big buyer still holding price there
 

3525
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,070
and big buyer still holding price there
right now. So 40 was the level. I can

3526
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:34,080
right now. So 40 was the level. I can
 

3527
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,669
right now. So 40 was the level. I can
see it on the tape. Right. So you also

3528
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:35,679
see it on the tape. Right. So you also
 

3529
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,350
see it on the tape. Right. So you also
have a little shelf here. I'm just

3530
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:37,360
have a little shelf here. I'm just
 

3531
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,830
have a little shelf here. I'm just
watching the delta on that tape at 40.

3532
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,840
watching the delta on that tape at 40.
 

3533
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,350
watching the delta on that tape at 40.
We had like an outside bar. It's

3534
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:41,360
We had like an outside bar. It's
 

3535
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,550
We had like an outside bar. It's
starting to be paired off a little bit

3536
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:42,560
starting to be paired off a little bit
 

3537
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,910
starting to be paired off a little bit
because we did have an aggressive seller

3538
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:43,920
because we did have an aggressive seller
 

3539
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,990
because we did have an aggressive seller
into it. This is a big level here. Here

3540
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:46,000
into it. This is a big level here. Here
 

3541
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,430
into it. This is a big level here. Here
they go. So here's the flush back down

3542
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:47,440
they go. So here's the flush back down
 

3543
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,030
they go. So here's the flush back down
into view up today. Absorb this. Now

3544
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,040
into view up today. Absorb this. Now
 

3545
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,709
into view up today. Absorb this. Now
remember, we are in a rotation. You can

3546
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:50,719
remember, we are in a rotation. You can
 

3547
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,390
remember, we are in a rotation. You can
see the D-shape. All right. We're in a

3548
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,400
see the D-shape. All right. We're in a
 

3549
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,630
see the D-shape. All right. We're in a
rotation day. There's your Dshape. All

3550
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:54,640
rotation day. There's your Dshape. All
 

3551
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,630
rotation day. There's your Dshape. All
right. No acceptance below. No

3552
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
right. No acceptance below. No
 

3553
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,430
right. No acceptance below. No
acceptance above this yet. Okay. I'd be

3554
01:14:59,430 --> 01:14:59,440
acceptance above this yet. Okay. I'd be
 

3555
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,110
acceptance above this yet. Okay. I'd be
very careful about a look above and fail

3556
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:01,120
very careful about a look above and fail
 

3557
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,950
very careful about a look above and fail
on a rotation. If they look above and

3558
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:02,960
on a rotation. If they look above and
 

3559
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,229
on a rotation. If they look above and
hold, we know here is where we trapped

3560
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:06,239
hold, we know here is where we trapped
 

3561
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,630
hold, we know here is where we trapped
those buyers this morning. So buyers are

3562
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
those buyers this morning. So buyers are
 

3563
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,149
those buyers this morning. So buyers are
trying to get the market up to here so

3564
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:10,159
trying to get the market up to here so
 

3565
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,550
trying to get the market up to here so
they can get let out of the market.

3566
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
they can get let out of the market.
 

3567
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,630
they can get let out of the market.
Sellers, if I was a seller, I'd be

3568
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:14,640
Sellers, if I was a seller, I'd be
 

3569
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,470
Sellers, if I was a seller, I'd be
trying to encourage them to do this. All

3570
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,480
trying to encourage them to do this. All
 

3571
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,390
trying to encourage them to do this. All
right, a little look above into a low

3572
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
right, a little look above into a low
 

3573
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,229
right, a little look above into a low
volume and fail. That's the kind of move

3574
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
volume and fail. That's the kind of move
 

3575
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:23,030
volume and fail. That's the kind of move
if I was a seller and I enjoy trading

3576
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,040
if I was a seller and I enjoy trading
 

3577
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,630
if I was a seller and I enjoy trading
rotation, which I don't. But that's the

3578
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:24,640
rotation, which I don't. But that's the
 

3579
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,790
rotation, which I don't. But that's the
kind of thing that I'd be looking at. We

3580
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
kind of thing that I'd be looking at. We
 

3581
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,350
kind of thing that I'd be looking at. We
know 40 is a big level, right?

3582
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:29,360
know 40 is a big level, right?
 

3583
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,030
know 40 is a big level, right?
It's started to be paired off now, but

3584
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:31,040
It's started to be paired off now, but
 

3585
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:35,270
It's started to be paired off now, but
it was a very very big level.

3586
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
it was a very very big level.
 

3587
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,110
it was a very very big level.
I'd be same as orb today. Yeah, you

3588
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,120
I'd be same as orb today. Yeah, you
 

3589
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,870
I'd be same as orb today. Yeah, you
you're right. You're right. The uh

3590
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:38,880
you're right. You're right. The uh
 

3591
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,669
you're right. You're right. The uh
15minute drive if you're a 15-minute orb

3592
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:41,679
15minute drive if you're a 15-minute orb
 

3593
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,310
15minute drive if you're a 15-minute orb
trader. Yeah, absolutely right. Unless

3594
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:44,320
trader. Yeah, absolutely right. Unless
 

3595
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,350
trader. Yeah, absolutely right. Unless
uh we do a huge spike, but yeah, you can

3596
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,360
uh we do a huge spike, but yeah, you can
 

3597
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,350
uh we do a huge spike, but yeah, you can
see purple lines, these little dots

3598
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360
see purple lines, these little dots
 

3599
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,950
see purple lines, these little dots
which start to get bigger and bigger.

3600
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:50,960
which start to get bigger and bigger.
 

3601
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,229
which start to get bigger and bigger.
Those are my initial balances. All

3602
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
Those are my initial balances. All
 

3603
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,470
Those are my initial balances. All
right. So, you're quite right. IB is the

3604
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
right. So, you're quite right. IB is the
 

3605
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,669
right. So, you're quite right. IB is the
same as orb today.

3606
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:57,679
same as orb today.
 

3607
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,430
same as orb today.
They are defending the edge of this

3608
01:15:59,430 --> 01:15:59,440
They are defending the edge of this
 

3609
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,030
They are defending the edge of this
value area high on this session at the

3610
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:01,040
value area high on this session at the
 

3611
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,350
value area high on this session at the
moment.

3612
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
moment.
 

3613
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,070
moment.
Alex, would you be open to a trade in

3614
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:06,080
Alex, would you be open to a trade in
 

3615
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,189
Alex, would you be open to a trade in
gold futures in 2026? Uh more for a

3619
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:18,149

I'm open to a trade on uh

3620
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:18,159
I'm open to a trade on uh
 

3621
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,709
I'm open to a trade on uh
anything which is moving

3622
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:20,719
anything which is moving
 

3623

anything which is moving
well outside of where it should be in

3624
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:23,679
well outside of where it should be in
 

3625
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,590
well outside of where it should be in
2026. So, I'm open to gold and silver um

3628
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:33,440

 

3629
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,750

I don't want to actively trade them, not

3630
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:35,760
I don't want to actively trade them, not
 

3631
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,270
I don't want to actively trade them, not
dayto-day.

3632
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
dayto-day.
 

3633
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,470
dayto-day.
I think the way they move, you're

3634
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:38,480
I think the way they move, you're
 

3635
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,830
I think the way they move, you're
better, you're almost better to be

3636
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:39,840
better, you're almost better to be
 

3637
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,550
better, you're almost better to be
positioned long-term in those.

3638
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560

 

3639
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,590

If the 21 crosses VWAP with Momo, do you

3640
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,600
If the 21 crosses VWAP with Momo, do you
 

3641
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,229
If the 21 crosses VWAP with Momo, do you
scout counter long since it's above

3642
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:50,239
scout counter long since it's above
 

3643
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,350
scout counter long since it's above
value area high or is that probability?

3644
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:53,360
value area high or is that probability?
 

3645
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,470
value area high or is that probability?
If the TW Oh, since you you mean above

3646
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:56,480
If the TW Oh, since you you mean above
 

3647
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,390
If the TW Oh, since you you mean above
the current value area high. Well, you

3648
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,400
the current value area high. Well, you
 

3649
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,830
the current value area high. Well, you
got to remember where we are in

3650
01:16:59,830 --> 01:16:59,840
got to remember where we are in
 

3651
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,830
got to remember where we are in
rotation.

3652
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:01,840
rotation.
 

3653
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,030
rotation.
This is the rotation.

3654
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
This is the rotation.
 

3655
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,790
This is the rotation.
This is the current rotation.

3656
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:08,800
This is the current rotation.
 

3657
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,750
This is the current rotation.
Any trade above here for me is kind of

3658
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:11,760
Any trade above here for me is kind of
 

3659
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,149
Any trade above here for me is kind of
dangerous. The maximum you get is that

3660
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:14,159
dangerous. The maximum you get is that
 

3661
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,070
dangerous. The maximum you get is that
relief to here, right? The better

3662
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:16,080
relief to here, right? The better
 

3663
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,110
relief to here, right? The better
rotation would be if it bases above or

3664
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:19,120
rotation would be if it bases above or
 

3665
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,350
rotation would be if it bases above or
if you catch the low. I wouldn't be uh

3666
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,360
if you catch the low. I wouldn't be uh
 

3667
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,149
if you catch the low. I wouldn't be uh
looking I'm I would not be playing this

3668
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:24,159
looking I'm I would not be playing this
 

3669
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,030
looking I'm I would not be playing this
move here. No, I would rather let that

3670
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,040
move here. No, I would rather let that
 

3671
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,189
move here. No, I would rather let that
fake out and die and play that move

3672
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:29,199
fake out and die and play that move
 

3673
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:37,590
fake out and die and play that move
there.

3674
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:37,600

 

3675
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,189

As most of you know, I don't love

3676
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
As most of you know, I don't love
 

3677
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:44,310
As most of you know, I don't love
playing rotation anyway. [snorts]

3678
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:44,320

 

3679
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,070

New York VW. Is that just anchored to

3680
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:46,080
New York VW. Is that just anchored to
 

3681
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,669
New York VW. Is that just anchored to
the New York session? Yes, correct. Just

3682
01:17:47,669 --> 01:17:47,679
the New York session? Yes, correct. Just
 

3683
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,830
the New York session? Yes, correct. Just
a 9:30 open. All right. So it's a cash

3684
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:49,840
a 9:30 open. All right. So it's a cash
 

3685
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,870
a 9:30 open. All right. So it's a cash
print.

3686
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:52,880

 

3687
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,030

Yeah. It doesn't mean do you know when I

3688
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,040
Yeah. It doesn't mean do you know when I
 

3689
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,270
Yeah. It doesn't mean do you know when I
play that Otus is if there was plenty of

3690
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:57,280
play that Otus is if there was plenty of
 

3691
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,590
play that Otus is if there was plenty of
room above, right? If we were migrating

3692
01:17:59,590 --> 01:17:59,600
room above, right? If we were migrating
 

3693
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,990
room above, right? If we were migrating
higher and there was room above for

3694

and sort of 95 stand out. They stand out
 

3847
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,790
and sort of 95 stand out. They stand out
above. Remember volume today very very

3848
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
above. Remember volume today very very
 

3849
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:55,910
above. Remember volume today very very
thin not a lot of volume.

3850
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:55,920

 

3851
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,990

I might enter along. No, I would be more

3852
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:58,000
I might enter along. No, I would be more
 

3853
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,910
I might enter along. No, I would be more
interested if I see a passive seller

3854
01:21:59,910 --> 01:21:59,920
interested if I see a passive seller
 

3855
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,709
interested if I see a passive seller
here uh absorb aggressive buyers and

3856
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:02,719
here uh absorb aggressive buyers and
 

3857
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,229
here uh absorb aggressive buyers and
close down back inside range for

3858
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:04,239
close down back inside range for
 

3859
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:07,110
close down back inside range for
rotation. I'm I'm

3860
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:07,120
rotation. I'm I'm
 

3861
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,270
rotation. I'm I'm
I would be careful about a long. All

3862
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:09,280
I would be careful about a long. All
 

3863
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,870
I would be careful about a long. All
right. All the time we've squeezed up

3864
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:10,880
right. All the time we've squeezed up
 

3865
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,629
right. All the time we've squeezed up
without building a base. All right. for

3866
01:22:12,629 --> 01:22:12,639
without building a base. All right. for
 

3867
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,629
without building a base. All right. for
me. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

3868
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:14,639
me. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
 

3869
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,310
me. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
This is the look above kind of level we

3870
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:16,320
This is the look above kind of level we
 

3871
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,669
This is the look above kind of level we
just talked about. If there's a passive

3872
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:17,679
just talked about. If there's a passive
 

3873
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,030
just talked about. If there's a passive
seller here and we close in here, they

3874
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,040
seller here and we close in here, they
 

3875
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,870
seller here and we close in here, they
can go in rotation. If they do this and

3876
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:20,880
can go in rotation. If they do this and
 

3877
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,790
can go in rotation. If they do this and
then they start absorbing,

3878
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:24,800

 

3879
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,550

even then, I don't really like it in a

3880
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:26,560
even then, I don't really like it in a
 

3881
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,950
even then, I don't really like it in a
rotation, but we we're just we'll see.

3882
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:28,960
rotation, but we we're just we'll see.
 

3883
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,310
rotation, but we we're just we'll see.
We're starting to see that passive

3884
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:30,320
We're starting to see that passive
 

3885
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,990
We're starting to see that passive
seller up here. This is what I talked

3886
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
seller up here. This is what I talked
 

3887
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,310
seller up here. This is what I talked
about, the look above and fail above

3888
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:34,320
about, the look above and fail above
 

3889
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,910
about, the look above and fail above
value area high. This is what I'd be

3890
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:35,920
value area high. This is what I'd be
 

3891
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,390
value area high. This is what I'd be
more interested in playing. And we're

3892
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:38,400
more interested in playing. And we're
 

3893
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,990
more interested in playing. And we're
starting to see that. So, if they don't

3894
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,000
starting to see that. So, if they don't
 

3895
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,229
starting to see that. So, if they don't
bid here at VWAP, all right, if this is

3896
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:42,239
bid here at VWAP, all right, if this is
 

3897
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,149
bid here at VWAP, all right, if this is
a look above and fail, this can get

3898
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
a look above and fail, this can get
 

3899
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:52,310
a look above and fail, this can get
very, very aggressive to the downside.

3900
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:52,320

 

3901
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,470

Just watching carefully here to see what

3902
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:54,480
Just watching carefully here to see what
 

3903
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,149
Just watching carefully here to see what
happens.

3904
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159

 

3905
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,390

So, I think Otus just asked this and we

3906
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:00,400
So, I think Otus just asked this and we
 

3907
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,910
So, I think Otus just asked this and we
talked about this move here. Be very

3908
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:01,920
talked about this move here. Be very
 

3909
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,669
talked about this move here. Be very
careful. This is the gray box. Remember,

3910
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
careful. This is the gray box. Remember,
 

3911
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,189
careful. This is the gray box. Remember,
if they fail this and they get back

3912
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:05,199
if they fail this and they get back
 

3913
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:06,709
if they fail this and they get back
under point of control on this session,

3914
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:06,719
under point of control on this session,
 

3915
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,629
under point of control on this session,
we will probably rotate lower because

3916
01:23:08,629 --> 01:23:08,639
we will probably rotate lower because
 

3917
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,229
we will probably rotate lower because
this is the kind of trap at the edge. If

3918
01:23:10,229 --> 01:23:10,239
this is the kind of trap at the edge. If
 

3919
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,310
this is the kind of trap at the edge. If
they can print above this, then their

3920
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:12,320
they can print above this, then their
 

3921
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,149
they can print above this, then their
their aim is to get back into this up

3922
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:14,159
their aim is to get back into this up
 

3923
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:19,830
their aim is to get back into this up
here. The sort of 94 iss

3924
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:19,840

 

3925
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,830

long up here. I think the the risk

3926
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:21,840
long up here. I think the the risk
 

3927
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,669
long up here. I think the the risk
parameter is not very good. You are

3928
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:23,679
parameter is not very good. You are
 

3929
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,590
parameter is not very good. You are
bidding at the one of the worst areas of

3930
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:25,600
bidding at the one of the worst areas of
 

3931
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,950
bidding at the one of the worst areas of
the day. Doesn't mean it can't move

3932
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:26,960
the day. Doesn't mean it can't move
 

3933
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,030
the day. Doesn't mean it can't move
higher, but remember when we assess

3934
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:29,040
higher, but remember when we assess
 

3935
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,310
higher, but remember when we assess
whether we're going to trade, we want

3936
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
whether we're going to trade, we want
 

3937
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,149
whether we're going to trade, we want
like pocket aces. Here's VWAP. So if

3938
01:23:32,149 --> 01:23:32,159
like pocket aces. Here's VWAP. So if
 

3939
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:33,430
like pocket aces. Here's VWAP. So if
they don't bid this, you are going to

3940
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:33,440
they don't bid this, you are going to
 

3941
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:38,002
they don't bid this, you are going to
get more of a flush in this market.

3942
01:23:38,002 --> 01:23:38,012

 

3943
01:23:38,012 --> 01:23:39,270

3944
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,280
[snorts]
 

3945
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,790
[snorts]
Does that make sense, Otus? Because I

3946
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:40,800
Does that make sense, Otus? Because I
 

3947
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,629
Does that make sense, Otus? Because I
know you just you just you just asked

3948
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:42,639
know you just you just you just asked
 

3949
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:49,669
know you just you just you just asked
this exact question.

3950
01:23:49,669 --> 01:23:49,679

 

3951
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,030

Yeah, hopefully that makes sense. So

3952
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
Yeah, hopefully that makes sense. So
 

3953
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,550
Yeah, hopefully that makes sense. So
this was value. This is Dshape. We want

3954
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:56,560
this was value. This is Dshape. We want
 

3955
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,030
this was value. This is Dshape. We want
to bid from here to here and sellers are

3956
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,040
to bid from here to here and sellers are
 

3957
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,629
to bid from here to here and sellers are
likely to sell this. Do you remember

3958
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:00,639
likely to sell this. Do you remember
 

3959
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,629
likely to sell this. Do you remember
what I said when I said what would I

3960
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
what I said when I said what would I
 

3961
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,229
what I said when I said what would I
like to see if I was a short seller and

3962
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
like to see if I was a short seller and
 

3963
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,070
like to see if I was a short seller and
I liked rotation? I'd like a failed

3964
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:06,080
I liked rotation? I'd like a failed
 

3965
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,149
I liked rotation? I'd like a failed
breakout.

3966
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:08,159
breakout.
 

3967
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,910
breakout.
You going back and remind what I said

3968
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
You going back and remind what I said
 

3969
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,910
You going back and remind what I said
into this low volume for aggressive

3970
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:11,920
into this low volume for aggressive
 

3971
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,470
into this low volume for aggressive
buyers to come back in and get met with

3972
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
buyers to come back in and get met with
 

3973
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,030
buyers to come back in and get met with
passive sellers and then get back under

3974
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
passive sellers and then get back under
 

3975
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,550
passive sellers and then get back under
here and we can rotate. You're starting

3976
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:18,560
here and we can rotate. You're starting
 

3977
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,189
here and we can rotate. You're starting
to see it all happen very very quickly.

3978
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:21,199
to see it all happen very very quickly.
 

3979
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,030
to see it all happen very very quickly.
All right. Hopefully that makes sense,

3980
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
All right. Hopefully that makes sense,
 

3981
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,709
All right. Hopefully that makes sense,
but just let me know in chat because I

3982
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:24,719
but just let me know in chat because I
 

3983
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,470
but just let me know in chat because I
tried to explain that to you before it

3984
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:26,480
tried to explain that to you before it
 

3985
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,550
tried to explain that to you before it
happened.

3986
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560

 

3987
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,470

That's my dog. Hang on. Let me just open

3988
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:32,480
That's my dog. Hang on. Let me just open
 

3989
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,830
That's my dog. Hang on. Let me just open
this up. You all right, Luna?

3990
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:35,840
this up. You all right, Luna?
 

3991
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,470
this up. You all right, Luna?
What's up with you? Come here, Mr.

3992
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,480
What's up with you? Come here, Mr.

Hello.

3994
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480

 

3995
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:48,950

Nana's going to take you. Don't worry.

3996
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960

 

3997
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,750

Uh, I understand why you dislike

3998
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
Uh, I understand why you dislike
 

3999
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,350
Uh, I understand why you dislike
rotation now. Yeah, it's just not my

4000
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,360
rotation now. Yeah, it's just not my
 

4001
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,790
rotation now. Yeah, it's just not my
favorite trade. It's not my favorite

4002
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:54,800
favorite trade. It's not my favorite
 

4003
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,950
favorite trade. It's not my favorite
trade. Especially, you got to remember

4004
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:56,960
trade. Especially, you got to remember
 

4005
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,550
trade. Especially, you got to remember
we're inside the previous week, but

4006
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,560
we're inside the previous week, but
 

4007
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,629
we're inside the previous week, but
we're under the previous day and we're

4008
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
we're under the previous day and we're
 

4009
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,470
we're under the previous day and we're
now in a Dshape on the day. I mean, it's

4010
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:02,480
now in a Dshape on the day. I mean, it's
 

4011
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,390
now in a Dshape on the day. I mean, it's
just

4012
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:04,400
just
 

4013
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,910
just
nothing. I wouldn't say it's a high

4014
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:05,920
nothing. I wouldn't say it's a high
 

4015
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,149
nothing. I wouldn't say it's a high
probability day.

4016
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:08,159
probability day.
 

4017
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,709
probability day.
What's up?

4018
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:10,719
What's up?
 

4019
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,310
What's up?
Is there a VWAP indicator on Ninja

4020
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:12,320
Is there a VWAP indicator on Ninja
 

4021
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,950
Is there a VWAP indicator on Ninja
Trader? There is. Uh there's a free one

4022
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:14,960
Trader? There is. Uh there's a free one
 

4023
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,470
Trader? There is. Uh there's a free one
if you're using Orderflow and

4024
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,480
if you're using Orderflow and
 

4025
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,550
if you're using Orderflow and
there is one if you go to Ninja Trader

4026
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:20,560
there is one if you go to Ninja Trader
 

4027
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,990
there is one if you go to Ninja Trader
communities or whatever it's called.

4028
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:22,000
communities or whatever it's called.
 

4029
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,270
communities or whatever it's called.
Someone's built one. I think it's called

4030
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:23,280
Someone's built one. I think it's called
 

4031
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:29,830
Someone's built one. I think it's called
like VWAP X or something like that.

4032
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:29,840

 

4033
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,430

You played the fail breakout made 20

4034
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:31,440
You played the fail breakout made 20
 

4035
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:37,830
You played the fail breakout made 20
points. There you go, Gary. Nice,

4036
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840

 

4037
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,870

nice, nice, nice. Yeah, for me I'm just

4038
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
nice, nice, nice. Yeah, for me I'm just
 

4039
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,870
nice, nice, nice. Yeah, for me I'm just
just flat. Just not uh this is not

4040
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880
just flat. Just not uh this is not
 

4041
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,390
just flat. Just not uh this is not
something that's grabbing my attention.

4042
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:46,400
something that's grabbing my attention.
 

4043
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,390
something that's grabbing my attention.
But you can see this gray level came in

4044
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:48,400
But you can see this gray level came in
 

4045
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,310
But you can see this gray level came in
important. All right. Why? It's the same

4046
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,320
important. All right. Why? It's the same
 

4047
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,910
important. All right. Why? It's the same
level as earlier. All right. So, what

4048
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:51,920
level as earlier. All right. So, what
 

4049
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,470
level as earlier. All right. So, what
you've got to think about

4050
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,480
you've got to think about
 

4051
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,790
you've got to think about
at the start of the day, think about the

4052
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:56,800
at the start of the day, think about the
 

4053
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,310
at the start of the day, think about the
very very start of the day, we talked

4054
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:58,320
very very start of the day, we talked
 

4055
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,550
very very start of the day, we talked
about,

4056
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:00,560
about,
 

4057
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,550
about,
you hear my dog, she's not happy. We

4058
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:02,560
you hear my dog, she's not happy. We
 

4059
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,390
you hear my dog, she's not happy. We
talked about a drive up here being sold

4060
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:04,400
talked about a drive up here being sold
 

4061
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,030
talked about a drive up here being sold
into. They didn't. They got a what what

4062
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
into. They didn't. They got a what what
 

4063
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,709
into. They didn't. They got a what what
I would call almost like a blowoff top.

4064
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:08,719
I would call almost like a blowoff top.
 

4065
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,629
I would call almost like a blowoff top.
Buyers got trapped above this level. All

4066
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
Buyers got trapped above this level. All
 

4067
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,470
Buyers got trapped above this level. All
right. So, once we got back below this,

4068
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
right. So, once we got back below this,
 

4069
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,870
right. So, once we got back below this,
shorts took control. Shorts didn't

4070
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:14,880
shorts took control. Shorts didn't
 

4071
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,390
shorts took control. Shorts didn't
complete the rotation under here. They

4072
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,400
complete the rotation under here. They
 

4073
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,669
complete the rotation under here. They
wanted this, they didn't get it. So,

4074
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:17,679
wanted this, they didn't get it. So,
 

4075
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:19,430
wanted this, they didn't get it. So,
we've had relief all the way back and

4076
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:19,440
we've had relief all the way back and
 

4077
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,030
we've had relief all the way back and
they're stepping in at the same level.

4078
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:21,040
they're stepping in at the same level.
 

4079
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,870
they're stepping in at the same level.
Now, if we start just building liquidity

4080
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
Now, if we start just building liquidity
 

4081
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,950
Now, if we start just building liquidity
here, or even if we build liquidity

4082
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:24,960
here, or even if we build liquidity
 

4083
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,229
here, or even if we build liquidity
here, all right, we're just building

4084
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:26,239
here, all right, we're just building
 

4085
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,229
here, all right, we're just building
this out for the next leg, our

4086
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239
this out for the next leg, our
 

4087
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,070
this out for the next leg, our
probability of a really good move

4088
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:30,080
probability of a really good move
 

4089
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,229
probability of a really good move
diminishes, especially given the type of

4090
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:32,239
diminishes, especially given the type of
 

4091
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:34,229
diminishes, especially given the type of
day it is. Remember, it's the 29th of

4092
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:34,239
day it is. Remember, it's the 29th of
 

4093
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:36,070
day it is. Remember, it's the 29th of
December. Not that many people at their

4094
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:36,080
December. Not that many people at their
 

4095
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:56,950
December. Not that many people at their
desks. Not that many people.

4096
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:56,960

 

4097
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,830

I would yes trader Rick I would agree

4098
01:26:59,830 --> 01:26:59,840
I would yes trader Rick I would agree
 

4099
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,110
I would yes trader Rick I would agree
but just remember I wouldn't consider uh

4100
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,120
but just remember I wouldn't consider uh
 

4101
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,590
but just remember I wouldn't consider uh
the next two or this trading session to

4102
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:05,600
the next two or this trading session to
 

4103
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,430
the next two or this trading session to
necessarily be high probability plays uh

4104
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:09,440
necessarily be high probability plays uh
 

4105
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,510
necessarily be high probability plays uh
within value same as last week um just

4106
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:13,520
within value same as last week um just
 

4107
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,790
within value same as last week um just
because I think the volume's going to be

4108
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:14,800
because I think the volume's going to be
 

4109
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,470
because I think the volume's going to be
lower and I think big participants might

4110
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
lower and I think big participants might
 

4111
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,390
lower and I think big participants might
not sort of turn up. I'm more interested

4112
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:18,400
not sort of turn up. I'm more interested
 

4113
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,470
not sort of turn up. I'm more interested
in where we're at, you know, one two

4114
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,480
in where we're at, you know, one two
 

4115
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,310
in where we're at, you know, one two
weeks into January. But yes,

4116
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
weeks into January. But yes,
 

4117
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,790
weeks into January. But yes,
you know what happens? I would ask you,

4118
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:26,800
you know what happens? I would ask you,
 

4119
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,430
you know what happens? I would ask you,
we've left from the bigger context. I

4120
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:29,440
we've left from the bigger context. I
 

4121
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,950
we've left from the bigger context. I
wouldn't necessarily say all of the

4122
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:30,960
wouldn't necessarily say all of the
 

4123
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,709
wouldn't necessarily say all of the
context is bullish because if we come

4124
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:32,719
context is bullish because if we come
 

4125
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,709
context is bullish because if we come
down here,

4126
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:34,719
down here,
 

4127
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:35,910
down here,
right, this is what you need to

4128
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:35,920
right, this is what you need to
 

4129
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,510
right, this is what you need to
understand about the old balance range.

4130
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,520
understand about the old balance range.
 

4131
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,189
understand about the old balance range.
This old balance range,

4132
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
This old balance range,
 

4133
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,189
This old balance range,
we are not finding acceptance back in.

4134
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:45,199
we are not finding acceptance back in.
 

4135
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:46,870
we are not finding acceptance back in.
It's a two weeks balance range. We are

4136
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:46,880
It's a two weeks balance range. We are
 

4137
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,669
It's a two weeks balance range. We are
rejecting point of control from that old

4138
01:27:49,669 --> 01:27:49,679
rejecting point of control from that old
 

4139
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:52,629
rejecting point of control from that old
range is two is 920s. All right, in here

4140
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:52,639
range is two is 920s. All right, in here
 

4141
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,470
range is two is 920s. All right, in here
we can't get back in inside of it. At

4142
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
we can't get back in inside of it. At
 

4143
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,070
we can't get back in inside of it. At
the moment, we keep rejecting this old

4144
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:56,080
the moment, we keep rejecting this old
 

4145
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,030
the moment, we keep rejecting this old
balance range, right? So maybe there's a

4146
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,040
balance range, right? So maybe there's a
 

4147
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,350
balance range, right? So maybe there's a
deeper pullback to be had. If we lose

4148
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:01,360
deeper pullback to be had. If we lose
 

4149
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,189
deeper pullback to be had. If we lose
previous week's value, maybe we pull

4150
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:03,199
previous week's value, maybe we pull
 

4151
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,350
previous week's value, maybe we pull
back into the weeks before I would say

4152
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:05,360
back into the weeks before I would say
 

4153
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,110
back into the weeks before I would say
down here, this old naked point of

4154
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:07,120
down here, this old naked point of
 

4155
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,110
down here, this old naked point of
control is an area I'm interested in.

4156
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:09,120
control is an area I'm interested in.
 

4157
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,830
control is an area I'm interested in.
buyers bid off that then you know that's

4158
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:11,840
buyers bid off that then you know that's
 

4159
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,310
buyers bid off that then you know that's
the kind of swing point where I think if

4160
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:14,320
the kind of swing point where I think if
 

4161
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,229
the kind of swing point where I think if
I was going to be very bullish in this

4162
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:16,239
I was going to be very bullish in this
 

4163
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:18,709
I was going to be very bullish in this
market if I was a perma bull right and

4164
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
market if I was a perma bull right and
 

4165
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,830
market if I was a perma bull right and
we'd done this and we'd rejected this

4166
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:21,840
we'd done this and we'd rejected this
 

4167
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,669
we'd done this and we'd rejected this
I'd be looking for a pullback into here

4168
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:23,679
I'd be looking for a pullback into here
 

4169
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:26,790
I'd be looking for a pullback into here
to bid off to go back to highs that's

4170
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:26,800
to bid off to go back to highs that's
 

4171
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,510
to bid off to go back to highs that's
what where my brain is right now and if

4172
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:29,520
what where my brain is right now and if
 

4173
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,910
what where my brain is right now and if
we lose that then I'd say well buyers

4174
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:31,920
we lose that then I'd say well buyers
 

4175
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,830
we lose that then I'd say well buyers
have just completely failed to hold the

4176
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:33,840
have just completely failed to hold the
 

4177
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,709
have just completely failed to hold the
rotation and new lows are probable so

4178
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:36,719
rotation and new lows are probable so
 

4179
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,030
rotation and new lows are probable so
this for me is the big level, right?

4180
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:39,040
this for me is the big level, right?
 

4181
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:43,669
this for me is the big level, right?
It's when we come back into here.

4182
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:43,679

 

4183
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,669

This is clear. We can't find acceptance

4184
01:28:45,669 --> 01:28:45,679
This is clear. We can't find acceptance
 

4185
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,270
This is clear. We can't find acceptance
back in it. Not yet. Maybe we find

4186
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,280
back in it. Not yet. Maybe we find
 

4187
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,709
back in it. Not yet. Maybe we find
acceptance in the next few days, but

4188
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:48,719
acceptance in the next few days, but
 

4189
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:51,270
acceptance in the next few days, but
right now we can't. This is where I

4190
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:51,280
right now we can't. This is where I
 

4191
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,629
right now we can't. This is where I
think I will peique my interest of does

4192
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:54,639
think I will peique my interest of does
 

4193
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,629
think I will peique my interest of does
institutional buying take place there or

4194
01:28:56,629 --> 01:28:56,639
institutional buying take place there or
 

4195
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,030
institutional buying take place there or
not.

4196
01:28:59,030 --> 01:28:59,040
not.
 

4197
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,470
not.
At least that's how that's how my

4198
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:00,480
At least that's how that's how my
 

4199
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,830
At least that's how that's how my
brain's working, right? That's what I'm

4200
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:01,840
brain's working, right? That's what I'm
 

4201
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,669
brain's working, right? That's what I'm
seeing. Doesn't mean I'm right. It's

4202
01:29:03,669 --> 01:29:03,679
seeing. Doesn't mean I'm right. It's
 

4203
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:12,870
seeing. Doesn't mean I'm right. It's
just how I'm viewing the market.

4204
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:12,880

 

4205
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,390

That's not necessarily true. It's back

4206
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,400
That's not necessarily true. It's back
 

4207
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,390
That's not necessarily true. It's back
to value from two week balance. So I

4208
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:16,400
to value from two week balance. So I
 

4209
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,350
to value from two week balance. So I
would say your idea is invalid. Well, I

4210
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:19,360
would say your idea is invalid. Well, I
 

4211
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,550
would say your idea is invalid. Well, I
don't think we are back there. We've

4212
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:20,560
don't think we are back there. We've
 

4213
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,110
don't think we are back there. We've
we've clearly rejected it. We we just

4214
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:23,120
we've clearly rejected it. We we just
 

4215
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,189
we've clearly rejected it. We we just
rejected point of control and we we're

4216
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
rejected point of control and we we're
 

4217
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,189
rejected point of control and we we're
back. This is what I'm saying. We're

4218
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:27,199
back. This is what I'm saying. We're
 

4219
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,830
back. This is what I'm saying. We're
back there on a low volume drift higher

4220
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:29,840
back there on a low volume drift higher
 

4221
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,750
back there on a low volume drift higher
week. All right. Where I don't think

4222
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:31,760
week. All right. Where I don't think
 

4223
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,669
week. All right. Where I don't think
many people were at the desk. And this

4224
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:33,679
many people were at the desk. And this
 

4225
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,030
many people were at the desk. And this
is what I'm saying. Like if this had

4226
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
is what I'm saying. Like if this had
 

4227
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,350
is what I'm saying. Like if this had
happened first week at January, I'd give

4228
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:37,360
happened first week at January, I'd give
 

4229
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,550
happened first week at January, I'd give
it more consideration. I'm not I'm I'm

4230
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:40,560
it more consideration. I'm not I'm I'm
 

4231
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,669
it more consideration. I'm not I'm I'm
not going to give it too much

4232
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:41,679
not going to give it too much
 

4233
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,990
not going to give it too much
consideration when we're low volume. But

4234
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,000
consideration when we're low volume. But
 

4235
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,669
consideration when we're low volume. But
like I said, I'm happy to be wrong and

4236
01:29:45,669 --> 01:29:45,679
like I said, I'm happy to be wrong and
 

4237
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:47,510
like I said, I'm happy to be wrong and
that's okay. What I would say though is

4238
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:47,520
that's okay. What I would say though is
 

4239
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,430
that's okay. What I would say though is
VIX is continuing to fall into its gap

4240
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
VIX is continuing to fall into its gap
 

4241
01:29:51,440 --> 01:30:03,669
VIX is continuing to fall into its gap
and this market might get going here.

4242
01:30:03,669 --> 01:30:03,679

 

4243
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:06,550

do not like the divergence uh on the VIC

4244
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:06,560
do not like the divergence uh on the VIC
 

4245
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,470
do not like the divergence uh on the VIC
and the SP VIX and spiders right now.

4246
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:08,480
and the SP VIX and spiders right now.
 

4247
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,590
and the SP VIX and spiders right now.
VIX well into its gap.

4248
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:11,600
VIX well into its gap.
 

4249
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,669
VIX well into its gap.
Previous day high on the VIX will take

4250
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:13,679
Previous day high on the VIX will take
 

4251
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:17,030
Previous day high on the VIX will take
it back down to sort of 1430s.

4252
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:17,040
it back down to sort of 1430s.
 

4253
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,709
it back down to sort of 1430s.
Gap fill on the VIX is all the way down

4254
01:30:18,709 --> 01:30:18,719
Gap fill on the VIX is all the way down
 

4255
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,790
Gap fill on the VIX is all the way down
into 1360s.

4256
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:22,800

 

4257
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,070

It is rejecting an old pivot into these

4258
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:26,080
It is rejecting an old pivot into these
 

4259
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,709
It is rejecting an old pivot into these
15s. It might well pull back into these

4260
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:28,719
15s. It might well pull back into these
 

4261
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,110
15s. It might well pull back into these
1430s, 1420s and see if it can find a

4262
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:31,120
1430s, 1420s and see if it can find a
 

4263
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:48,310
1430s, 1420s and see if it can find a
bid.

4264
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,320

 

4265
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,910

the law. Well, technically technically

4266
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:49,920
the law. Well, technically technically
 

4267
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,870
the law. Well, technically technically
it's between VIX and ES, not BNQ. But

4268
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:52,880
it's between VIX and ES, not BNQ. But
 

4269
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,110
it's between VIX and ES, not BNQ. But
yes, in in a healthy market, the

4270
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,120
yes, in in a healthy market, the
 

4271
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,629
yes, in in a healthy market, the
correlation is that they do the

4272
01:30:56,629 --> 01:30:56,639
correlation is that they do the
 

4273
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,790
correlation is that they do the
opposite. But we've got VIX breaking

4274
01:30:58,790 --> 01:30:58,800
opposite. But we've got VIX breaking
 

4275
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,590
opposite. But we've got VIX breaking
down underneath lows and spiders

4276
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:01,600
down underneath lows and spiders
 

4277
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:13,350
down underneath lows and spiders
midpoint of the range.

4278
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,360

 

4279
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,030

Market just gone still here and we're

4280
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,040
Market just gone still here and we're
 

4281
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:22,390
Market just gone still here and we're
developing a big fat node here as well.

4282
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:22,400

4295

I'll be here today and tomorrow. Maybe
I'll be here Wednesday. I'll see. But

4296
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:38,320
I'll be here Wednesday. I'll see. But
 

4297
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,950
I'll be here Wednesday. I'll see. But
yeah, very light trading week.

4298
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:40,960
yeah, very light trading week.
 

4299
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:51,750
yeah, very light trading week.
Not expecting much at all.

4300
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:51,760

 

4301
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,149

bearish bull can't handle the pressure.

4302
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:54,159
bearish bull can't handle the pressure.
 

4303
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:55,669
bearish bull can't handle the pressure.
Well, you I would say you probably need

4304
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:55,679
Well, you I would say you probably need
 

4305
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,870
Well, you I would say you probably need
to size down if that's the case.

4306
01:31:58,870 --> 01:31:58,880
to size down if that's the case.
 

4307
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,030
to size down if that's the case.
If your P&L swings too big, it's

4308
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,040
If your P&L swings too big, it's
 

4309
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,629
If your P&L swings too big, it's
probably stressing you out. Yeah, just

4310
01:32:02,629 --> 01:32:02,639
probably stressing you out. Yeah, just
 

4311
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,950
probably stressing you out. Yeah, just
size down. You got to earn the right to

4312
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:04,960
size down. You got to earn the right to
 

4313
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,470
size down. You got to earn the right to
size up. You got to earn the right to

4314
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:06,480
size up. You got to earn the right to
 

4315
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,390
size up. You got to earn the right to
have bigger P&L swings. You got to get

4316
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:08,400
have bigger P&L swings. You got to get
 

4317
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,390
have bigger P&L swings. You got to get
comfortable with that slowly. You know,

4318
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:10,400
comfortable with that slowly. You know,
 

4319
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,950
comfortable with that slowly. You know,
the jump from one

4320
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:12,960
the jump from one
 

4321
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,430
the jump from one
micro to two micros is manageable, even

4322
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:15,440
micro to two micros is manageable, even
 

4323
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,510
micro to two micros is manageable, even
though it's a 100% jump. The jump from

4324
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:17,520
though it's a 100% jump. The jump from
 

4325
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,310
though it's a 100% jump. The jump from
one mini to two minis is probably not so

4326
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
one mini to two minis is probably not so
 

4327
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,030
one mini to two minis is probably not so
manageable. So, just size down, move to

4328
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,040
manageable. So, just size down, move to
 

4329
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,750
manageable. So, just size down, move to
micros, nice and slow, or don't even

4330
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:25,760
micros, nice and slow, or don't even
 

4331
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,390
micros, nice and slow, or don't even
trade cash, you know.

4332
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400

4333
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,550
trade cash, you know.
Don't trade cash.

4334
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:30,560
Don't trade cash.
 

4335
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,390
Don't trade cash.

They're trying to build out volume node

They're trying to build out volume node
 

4369
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,110
They're trying to build out volume node
here. The question is, do they let this

4370
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:07,120
here. The question is, do they let this
 

4371
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,229
here. The question is, do they let this
go? Do they protect this again or do we

4372
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:10,239
go? Do they protect this again or do we
 

4373
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:12,470
go? Do they protect this again or do we
come into this or do buyers trap all

4374
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
come into this or do buyers trap all
 

4375
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,229
come into this or do buyers trap all
these sellers and complete this rotation

4376
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:14,239
these sellers and complete this rotation
 

4377
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:19,590
these sellers and complete this rotation
and let these buyers out?

4378
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:19,600

 

4379
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,390

Right now, I'd say sellers

01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,400
Right now, I'd say sellers
 

4381
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,950
Right now, I'd say sellers
in this node here have done a good job.

4382
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:24,960

It's just whether they can leave this

4384
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
It's just whether they can leave this
 

4385
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,470
It's just whether they can leave this
volume trapped here and start to return

4386
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:30,480
volume trapped here and start to return
 

4387
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,229
volume trapped here and start to return
back down here would be my question

4388
01:33:32,229 --> 01:33:32,239
back down here would be my question
 

4389
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:39,830
back down here would be my question
right now for these sellers.

4390
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:39,840

 

4391
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,270

It's crazy how gold always rejects the

01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:57,910
It's crazy how gold always rejects the

session. Is that right? I mean, it's
 

4403
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,510

Partials here. Then runners are your low

4498
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:51,040
Partials here. Then runners are your low
 

4499
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,950
Partials here. Then runners are your low
of day. Remember, we didn't quite sweep

4500
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
of day. Remember, we didn't quite sweep
 

4501

this. But if we sweep this, all right,
then you're probably going to see a stop

4506
01:35:58,709 --> 01:35:58,719
then you're probably going to see a stop
 

4507
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:00,870
then you're probably going to see a stop
run somewhere into here. And this is

4508
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:00,880
run somewhere into here. And this is
 

4509
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,270
run somewhere into here. And this is
your next TP. So, I'd be like TP1 to

4510
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:03,280
your next TP. So, I'd be like TP1 to
 

4511
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,390
your next TP. So, I'd be like TP1 to
protect TP2 down into this. All right.

4512
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:06,400
protect TP2 down into this. All right.

This is my indicator.

4641
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,950

Um, no, I wouldn't necessarily agree

01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:04,960
Um, no, I wouldn't necessarily agree
 

4643
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,750
Um, no, I wouldn't necessarily agree
with that. Uh,

4644
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,760
with that. Uh,
 

4645
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,750
with that. Uh,
level we're at now is key from last

4646
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:09,760
level we're at now is key from last

01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:17,590
level we're at now is key from last

4649
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:22,629

I'd say there is some volume at sort of

4650
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:22,639
I'd say there is some volume at sort of
 

4651
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:27,910
I'd say there is some volume at sort of
580 to 5 550s

4652
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:27,920
580 to 5 550s
 

4653
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,430
580 to 5 550s
uh if we get down there. But the moment

4654
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,440
uh if we get down there. But the moment
 

4655
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,510
uh if we get down there. But the moment
keeps finding finding a bid in this area

4656
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:31,520
keeps finding finding a bid in this area
 

4657
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,030
keeps finding finding a bid in this area
same as it did last week. If you look at

4658
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:33,040
same as it did last week. If you look at
 

4659
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,950
same as it did last week. If you look at
Monday last week, Tuesday last week

4660
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:34,960
Monday last week, Tuesday last week
 

4661
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,350
Monday last week, Tuesday last week
keeps finding a bid in this area. Uh if

4662
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
keeps finding a bid in this area. Uh if
 

4663
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,590
keeps finding a bid in this area. Uh if
we break those lows that there is a node

4664
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:39,600
we break those lows that there is a node
 

4665
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,030
we break those lows that there is a node
that's why I have this down here that

4666
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,040
that's why I have this down here that
 

4667
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,350
that's why I have this down here that
there's a node down here and then under

4668
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:43,360
there's a node down here and then under
 

4669
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,070
there's a node down here and then under
that the old value from the week before

4670
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:46,080
that the old value from the week before
 

4671
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,109
that the old value from the week before
will be down at 522s. uh once we start

4672
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:49,119
will be down at 522s. uh once we start
 

4673
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,470
will be down at 522s. uh once we start
letting go of that then I think there's

4674
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:50,480
letting go of that then I think there's
 

4675
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,950
letting go of that then I think there's
a wash into the 330s but you know they

4676
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:52,960
a wash into the 330s but you know they
 

4677
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,870
a wash into the 330s but you know they
keep buying dips down here we are just

4678
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:54,880
keep buying dips down here we are just
 

4679
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,950
keep buying dips down here we are just
in a rotational market please remember

4680
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:56,960
in a rotational market please remember
 

4681
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:03,910
in a rotational market please remember
that

4682
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:03,920

 

4683
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,390

why don't I use the bands and viewer

4684
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:06,400
why don't I use the bands and viewer
 

4685
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,030
why don't I use the bands and viewer
because I don't need them they're not

4686
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:09,040
because I don't need them they're not
 

4687
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,669
because I don't need them they're not
something I don't know that's a I don't

4688
01:40:11,669 --> 01:40:11,679
something I don't know that's a I don't
 

4689
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,430
something I don't know that's a I don't
know how to answer that question because

4690
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
know how to answer that question because
 

4691
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,109
know how to answer that question because
they're not part of my strategy because

4692
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:15,119
they're not part of my strategy because
 

4693
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:17,430
they're not part of my strategy because
my strategy how I trade doesn't use them

4694
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:17,440
my strategy how I trade doesn't use them
 

4695
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,870
my strategy how I trade doesn't use them
that's why I don't use them. It's not

4696
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:18,880
that's why I don't use them. It's not
 

4697
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,189
that's why I don't use them. It's not
cuz they don't work. Everything works

4698
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:21,199
cuz they don't work. Everything works
 

4699
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,030
cuz they don't work. Everything works
once you build a system around it. It's

4700
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,040
once you build a system around it. It's
 

4701
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,709
once you build a system around it. It's
just they're not what I like to use.

4702
01:40:24,709 --> 01:40:24,719
just they're not what I like to use.
 

4703
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,229
just they're not what I like to use.
Doesn't mean you shouldn't use them.

4704
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:26,239
Doesn't mean you shouldn't use them.
 

4705
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:37,270
Doesn't mean you shouldn't use them.
There's no right and wrongs.

4706
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:37,280

 

4707
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,510

Up 1k on 20 emails today. Nice, Tom.
 

4709
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:44,390
Up 1k on 20 emails today. Nice, Tom.
Good work.

4710
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,400

 

4711
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,590

Nice, David.

4712
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:49,600

 

4713
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,950

I mean, it's not bad. Uh, this move

4714
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:52,960
I mean, it's not bad. Uh, this move
 

4715
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,590
I mean, it's not bad. Uh, this move
here. Yeah, potentially. Just remember

4716
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:55,600
here. Yeah, potentially. Just remember
 

4717
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,590
here. Yeah, potentially. Just remember
this. This is the big level from

4718
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:57,600
this. This is the big level from
 

4719
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,750
this. This is the big level from
previous week. So, it depends. Like, I'd

4720
01:40:59,750 --> 01:40:59,760
previous week. So, it depends. Like, I'd
 

4721
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,790
previous week. So, it depends. Like, I'd
almost wait to see if they're willing to

4722
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:02,800
almost wait to see if they're willing to
 

4723
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,950
almost wait to see if they're willing to
rotate this. Just remember last week,

4724
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:04,960
rotate this. Just remember last week,
 

4725
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:12,629
rotate this. Just remember last week,
right, we found bids here. Um,

4726
01:41:12,629 --> 01:41:12,639

 

4727
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:15,030

it's where we keep finding bids. Oh,

4728
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,040
it's where we keep finding bids. Oh,
 

4729
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,950
it's where we keep finding bids. Oh,
there we go. All right. Into this

4730
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:16,960
there we go. All right. Into this
 

4731
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,189
there we go. All right. Into this
structure here. You want to be careful,

4732
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
structure here. You want to be careful,
 

4733
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,950
structure here. You want to be careful,
right? The the buyers keep coming in

4734
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:20,960
right? The the buyers keep coming in
 

4735
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:22,629
right? The the buyers keep coming in
down here. So, I wouldn't be thinking

4736
01:41:22,629 --> 01:41:22,639
down here. So, I wouldn't be thinking
 

4737
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,109
down here. So, I wouldn't be thinking
about getting too much today. All right.

4738
01:41:25,109 --> 01:41:25,119
about getting too much today. All right.
 

4739
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:26,790
about getting too much today. All right.
This is the you're in the middle of the

4740
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:26,800
This is the you're in the middle of the
 

4741
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,790
This is the you're in the middle of the
profile. Any drift higher goes back into

4742
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:28,800
profile. Any drift higher goes back into
 

4743
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,550
profile. Any drift higher goes back into
the middle of the profile. We're just in

4744
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:30,560
the middle of the profile. We're just in
 

4745
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,510
the middle of the profile. We're just in
a rotation, folks. Don't look for trend

4746
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:33,520
a rotation, folks. Don't look for trend
 

4747
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,750
a rotation, folks. Don't look for trend
in a rotation. All right. Let it

4748
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:35,760
in a rotation. All right. Let it
 

4749
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,750
in a rotation. All right. Let it
develop. If you It's going to have to

4750
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:37,760
develop. If you It's going to have to
 

4751
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,310
develop. If you It's going to have to
really show you it wants to do it.

4752
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:40,320
really show you it wants to do it.
 

4753
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,470
really show you it wants to do it.
You're in a low volume week as well.

4754
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,480
You're in a low volume week as well.
 

4755
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,510
You're in a low volume week as well.
Like why why why why be like trying to

4756
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:45,520
Like why why why why be like trying to
 

4757
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,510
Like why why why why be like trying to
play trend and risk on and like why do

4758
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:47,520
play trend and risk on and like why do
 

4759
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,950
play trend and risk on and like why do
anything in a low volume week? Do you

4760
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:48,960
anything in a low volume week? Do you
 

4761
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:50,709
anything in a low volume week? Do you
know what I mean? Like we're in the

4762
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
know what I mean? Like we're in the
 

4763
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:54,550
know what I mean? Like we're in the
middle of a Dshape.

4764
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:54,560
middle of a Dshape.
 

4765
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,430
middle of a Dshape.
We're protecting edges.

4766
01:41:57,430 --> 01:41:57,440
We're protecting edges.
 

4767
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,030
We're protecting edges.
I wouldn't really be doing much here.

4768
01:41:59,030 --> 01:41:59,040
I wouldn't really be doing much here.
 

4769
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,629
I wouldn't really be doing much here.
Like maybe you wanted to take this,

4770
01:42:00,629 --> 01:42:00,639
Like maybe you wanted to take this,
 

4771
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:02,149
Like maybe you wanted to take this,
maybe you took this this morning, but

4772
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:02,159
maybe you took this this morning, but
 

4773
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,550
maybe you took this this morning, but
like you're you're I would say we have

4774
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:04,560

01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:09,840
the VIX is diverging from everything?
 

4781
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,990
the VIX is diverging from everything?
like it doesn't look very good out here

4782

like it doesn't look very good out here
right now in terms of like high

4784
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:13,440
right now in terms of like high
 

4785
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:20,229
right now in terms of like high
probability setups.

4786
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:20,239

 

4787
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:31,590

4795
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,990
right and wrongs. Like, um, I can't
remember who asked me about the VWAP

4796
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:38,000
remember who asked me about the VWAP
 

4797
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,629
remember who asked me about the VWAP
bands, but if they work for you, use

4798
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:40,639
bands, but if they work for you, use
 

4799
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:42,870
bands, but if they work for you, use
them, right? If they work for you, use

4800
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:42,880
them, right? If they work for you, use
 

4801
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,470
them, right? If they work for you, use
them. But if you've developed a strategy

4802
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:44,480
them. But if you've developed a strategy
 

4803
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,229
them. But if you've developed a strategy
around them, use them. It's not like I

4804
01:42:46,229 --> 01:42:46,239
around them, use them. It's not like I
 

4805
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:47,750
around them, use them. It's not like I
think they don't work. It's just not

4806
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:47,760
think they don't work. It's just not
 

4807
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:53,750
think they don't work. It's just not
part of how I trade. That's all it is.

trading before a key level. It means

4886
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:56,000
trading before a key level. It means
 

4887
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,990
trading before a key level. It means

Uh depends how if they're overlever if

01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,440
Uh depends how if they're overlever if

Uh depends how if they're overlever if
they're overleveraged short side uh it

01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:54,480
they're overleveraged short side uh it
 

4937
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,910
they're overleveraged short side uh it
will force them to cover at least

01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:55,920
will force them to cover at least

4940
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:57,119
especially if the margin requirements
 

4941
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:58,709
especially if the margin requirements
are more overnight. It affects them both

4942
01:45:58,709 --> 01:45:58,719
are more overnight. It affects them both
 

4943
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:00,870
are more overnight. It affects them both
the same way affects them both the same

4944
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:00,880
the same way affects them both the same
 

4945
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,629
the same way affects them both the same
way in the futures market. Doesn't

4946
01:46:02,629 --> 01:46:02,639
way in the futures market. Doesn't
 

4947
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,070
way in the futures market. Doesn't
matter which side of that trade you

4948
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:04,080
matter which side of that trade you
 

4949
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,669
matter which side of that trade you
take. It's more about who's placed more

4950
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
take. It's more about who's placed more
 

4951
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,430
take. It's more about who's placed more
uh positions in the last 48 hours. Let's

4952
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:11,440
uh positions in the last 48 hours. Let's
 

4953
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,270
uh positions in the last 48 hours. Let's
say who's bought the highs or who

4954
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:13,280
say who's bought the highs or who
 

4955
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,030
say who's bought the highs or who
shorted the highs, what price has done

4956
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:15,040
shorted the highs, what price has done
 

4957
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,590
shorted the highs, what price has done
since. At the moment, uh price has

4958
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:17,600
since. At the moment, uh price has
 

4959
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,669
since. At the moment, uh price has
pulled about 8% since those highs. So,

4960
01:46:19,669 --> 01:46:19,679
pulled about 8% since those highs. So,
 

4961
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:22,790
pulled about 8% since those highs. So,
anyone who took a short [snorts]

4962
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:22,800
anyone who took a short [snorts]
 

4963

anyone who took a short [snorts]

4964
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:25,440
with high margin requirements
 

4965
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,830
with high margin requirements
is comfortable. Any retail who bought

4966
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:27,840
is comfortable. Any retail who bought
 

4967
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,149
is comfortable. Any retail who bought
the high is absolutely pinned. Most

4968
01:46:30,149 --> 01:46:30,159
the high is absolutely pinned. Most
 

4969
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:33,270
the high is absolutely pinned. Most

weren't prepared for that margin
 

4995
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,229
weren't prepared for that margin

4999
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,310

Not new to trading. What's better, Apex

5000
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:08,320
Not new to trading. What's better, Apex
 

5001
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,629
Not new to trading. What's better, Apex
or Tradeify? That comes down to what

5002
01:47:10,629 --> 01:47:10,639
or Tradeify? That comes down to what
 

5003
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:13,430
or Tradeify? That comes down to what
your ambitions are. Uh Apex, you get

5004
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:13,440
your ambitions are. Uh Apex, you get
 

5005
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,950
your ambitions are. Uh Apex, you get
more accounts. Tradeify, you don't have

5006
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:14,960
more accounts. Tradeify, you don't have
 

5007
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,790
more accounts. Tradeify, you don't have
to deal with trading trading draw down.

5008
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:16,800
to deal with trading trading draw down.
 

5009
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,070
to deal with trading trading draw down.
So if you don't like dealing with

5010
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:18,080
So if you don't like dealing with
 

5011
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,750
So if you don't like dealing with
trading trading draw down, probably go

5012
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:19,760
trading trading draw down, probably go
 

5013
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,830
trading trading draw down, probably go
with a tradeify account. If you just

5014
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:21,840
with a tradeify account. If you just
 

5015
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,189
with a tradeify account. If you just
want to scale and you're willing to be

5016
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:23,199
want to scale and you're willing to be

want to scale and you're willing to be
patient and you want max profit,

01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:25,600
patient and you want max profit,
 

5019
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:35,910
patient and you want max profit,
probably go with Apex.

5020
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:35,920

Yeah, exactly. Uh is it Virgil? Yeah,
 

5023
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:39,750

stick with what I know. We went over
 

5025
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,229
stick with what I know. We went over
metals at the beginning of the day. I

01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:42,239
metals at the beginning of the day. I
 

5027
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:43,510
metals at the beginning of the day. I
think that there will be swing

5028
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:43,520
think that there will be swing
 

5029
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,109
think that there will be swing
opportunities coming both sides of that

5030
01:47:45,109 --> 01:47:45,119
opportunities coming both sides of that
 

5031
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:47,669
opportunities coming both sides of that
trade. I'm not too fussed at the M

5032
01:47:47,669 --> 01:47:47,679
trade. I'm not too fussed at the M
 

5033
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:49,109

today. I think it'll be a crowded trade

01:47:49,109 --> 01:47:49,119
today. I think it'll be a crowded trade
 

5035
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:51,189

both sides. Just let everyone else go

01:47:51,189 --> 01:47:51,199
both sides. Just let everyone else go
 

5037
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,350
both sides. Just let everyone else go
through hysteria. The the way I see it,

5038
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:53,360
through hysteria. The the way I see it,
 

5039
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,430
through hysteria. The the way I see it,
right, it's it's

01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,870
this market and in general, this market
is feeling more and more like a small

01:47:58,870 --> 01:47:58,880
is feeling more and more like a small
 

5045
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,790
is feeling more and more like a small
cap, right? I don't want to take the

5046
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:00,800
cap, right? I don't want to take the
 

5047
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:04,550

multi-week fade, I won't need to be
 

5053
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,109
multi-week fade, I won't need to be
shortening it today. I can let it build

5054
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:11,119
shortening it today. I can let it build
 

5055
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:12,709
shortening it today. I can let it build
out. Let it set a lower high. Let

5065
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,550
reversion or a bigger fade back to 30s,
for example, on silver, which I'm not

01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:22,560
for example, on silver, which I'm not
 

5067

convinced there is, but if there was,
 

5069
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:26,070
convinced there is, but if there was,
then I'll take that trade when it's not

01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,080
then I'll take that trade when it's not
 

5071

then I'll take that trade when it's not
so crowded, put some position on, and

01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:27,760
so crowded, put some position on, and
 

5073
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,830
so crowded, put some position on, and
just let it work. the same way smart

01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:40,320
right, it's no different to GME. Look at
 

5085
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,950
right, it's no different to GME. Look at
GME when everyone got the hysteria about

01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:42,960
GME when everyone got the hysteria about
 

5087

GME when everyone got the hysteria about

01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:45,760
jumping into GME. Oh, going to get long
 

5089
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,950
jumping into GME. Oh, going to get long
because everyone's told me to get long

smashing short. Okay, great. You got

5096
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:51,600
smashing short. Okay, great. You got
 

5097
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,070
smashing short. Okay, great. You got
loads of volatility. If you waited three

5098
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:54,080
loads of volatility. If you waited three
 

5099
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,910
loads of volatility. If you waited three
months and put a short position on and

5100
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:55,920
months and put a short position on and
 

5101
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,109

5103
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:58,709
closed your eyes for three or four
years, you're laughing, right? So, you

5104
01:48:58,709 --> 01:48:58,719
years, you're laughing, right? So, you
 

5105
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:00,950
years, you're laughing, right? So, you
don't need to trade like the huge

5106
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:00,960
don't need to trade like the huge
 

5107
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,550
don't need to trade like the huge
volatility day one. That's what I'm

5108
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:02,560
volatility day one. That's what I'm
 

5109
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,135
volatility day one. That's what I'm
trying to say, I guess.

01:49:30,629 --> 01:49:30,639
big if, but that's what I'd be looking

protecting this level, you just got to

5323
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,070

if you watch every little move, you're

5324
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:02,080
if you watch every little move, you're
 

5325
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,430
if you watch every little move, you're
going to be exhausted. What you want to

5326
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:03,440
going to be exhausted. What you want to
 

5327
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,750
going to be exhausted. What you want to
do is once you learn to read orderflow,

5328
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:05,760
do is once you learn to read orderflow,
 

5329
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,830
do is once you learn to read orderflow,
you want to read what watch it when you

5330
01:55:07,830 --> 01:55:07,840
you want to read what watch it when you
 

5331
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,750
you want to read what watch it when you
come into your key levels, when you're

5332
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:09,760
come into your key levels, when you're
 

5333
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,750
come into your key levels, when you're
at your key levels. All right? So, if

5334
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:11,760
at your key levels. All right? So, if
 

5335
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,510
at your key levels. All right? So, if
your key levels are 200 points apart,

5336
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:13,520
your key levels are 200 points apart,
 

5337
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,589
your key levels are 200 points apart,
it's like just set price alerts for when

5338
01:55:15,589 --> 01:55:15,599
it's like just set price alerts for when
 

5339
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:17,270
it's like just set price alerts for when
you get close to a key level and then

5340
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,280
you get close to a key level and then
 

5341
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:18,709
you get close to a key level and then
zoom in and start watching it once you

5342
01:55:18,709 --> 01:55:18,719
zoom in and start watching it once you
 

5343
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:20,709
zoom in and start watching it once you
get there. Otherwise, your brain will uh

5344
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:20,719
get there. Otherwise, your brain will uh
 

5345
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,550
get there. Otherwise, your brain will uh
or in my opinion, your brain will get

5346
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:22,560
or in my opinion, your brain will get
 

5347
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,950
or in my opinion, your brain will get
very very tired.

5348
01:55:24,950 --> 01:55:24,960

5393
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:31,510
on your volume profile. Is there any
reason you don't care to see up down?

5394
01:56:31,510 --> 01:56:31,520
reason you don't care to see up down?
 

5395
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,910
reason you don't care to see up down?
What do you mean? I have it.

5396
01:56:33,910 --> 01:56:33,920
What do you mean? I have it.
 

5397
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,830
What do you mean? I have it.
I see you just have the volume area. No,

5398
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:35,840
I see you just have the volume area. No,
 

5399
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,990
I see you just have the volume area. No,
it's here, my friend. It's here. You see

5400
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:38,000
it's here, my friend. It's here. You see
 

5401
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,750
it's here, my friend. It's here. You see
this gray part? You probably just maybe

5402
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:39,760
this gray part? You probably just maybe
 

5403
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:43,750
this gray part? You probably just maybe
can't see it. This and this. This is up

5404
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:43,760
can't see it. This and this. This is up
 

5405
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:47,750
can't see it. This and this. This is up
and down. Yeah. So, that's value on the

5406
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:47,760
and down. Yeah. So, that's value on the
 

5407
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,550
and down. Yeah. So, that's value on the
session. This is outside of value.

5408
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:50,560
session. This is outside of value.
 

5409
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,550
session. This is outside of value.
This is just based on New York session,

5410
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
This is just based on New York session,
 

5411
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,149
This is just based on New York session,
right? So, it's it's anchored to New

5412
01:56:54,149 --> 01:56:54,159
right? So, it's it's anchored to New
 

5413
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:55,830
right? So, it's it's anchored to New
York session.

5414
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:55,840
York session.
 

5415
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:59,990
York session.
Yes, I do use it.

5416
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:00,000

come in. I've done everyone else's.

5424
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:09,440
come in. I've done everyone else's.
 

5425
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:18,070
come in. I've done everyone else's.
There's only so many I can do. Um,

5426
01:57:18,070 --> 01:57:18,080

 

5427
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,990

did you fill the form in correctly and

5428
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:20,000

Right. Cuz I can see some here. One,
 

5433
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,510
Right. Cuz I can see some here. One,
two, three, four, five that I need to do

5434
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:27,520
two, three, four, five that I need to do
 

5435
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:30,550
two, three, four, five that I need to do
after here. But uh I did everyone

5436
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:30,560

5437
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,350
after here. But uh I did everyone
yesterday.

5438
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:33,360
yesterday.
 

5439
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:36,390
yesterday.
Oh, I see what you're saying. Uh no, not

5440
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:36,400
Oh, I see what you're saying. Uh no, not
 

5441
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:39,990
Oh, I see what you're saying. Uh no, not
so outside of outside of value. What do

5442
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:40,000
so outside of outside of value. What do
 

5443
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,310
so outside of outside of value. What do
I care about if they've built a node?

5444
01:57:42,310 --> 01:57:42,320
I care about if they've built a node?
 

5445
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:45,430
I care about if they've built a node?
Right. I don't really I'm not do too,

5446
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:45,440
Right. I don't really I'm not do too,
 

5447
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,950
Right. I don't really I'm not do too,
you know, if we got acceptance above

5448
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:46,960
you know, if we got acceptance above
 

5449
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:47,990
you know, if we got acceptance above
here, where are we going to go? All

5450
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:48,000
here, where are we going to go? All
 

5451
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,669
here, where are we going to go? All
right. Probably to this this node up

5452
01:57:49,669 --> 01:57:49,679
right. Probably to this this node up
 

5453
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:51,589
right. Probably to this this node up
here. I'm not too bothered about this.

5454
01:57:51,589 --> 01:57:51,599
here. I'm not too bothered about this.
 

5455
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:52,709
here. I'm not too bothered about this.
Right. There's not there's nothing

5456
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
Right. There's not there's nothing
 

5457
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:55,669
Right. There's not there's nothing
really taking place out there. So if you

5458
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:55,679
really taking place out there. So if you
 

5459
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:57,669
really taking place out there. So if you
think about areas I care about this

5460
01:57:57,669 --> 01:57:57,679
think about areas I care about this
 

5461
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,750
think about areas I care about this
area, this area, this area, this area,

5462
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:01,760
area, this area, this area, this area,
 

5463
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:03,350
area, this area, this area, this area,
right? If shorts protect this, that's

5464
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:03,360
right? If shorts protect this, that's
 

5465
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:06,070
right? If shorts protect this, that's
the trap, right? Like we did here, like

5466
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:06,080
the trap, right? Like we did here, like
 

5467
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:09,510
the trap, right? Like we did here, like
we did here into thin areas.

5468
01:58:09,510 --> 01:58:09,520
we did here into thin areas.
 

5469
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:11,350
we did here into thin areas.
So I do care about what happens outside

5470
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:11,360
So I do care about what happens outside
 

5471
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,189
So I do care about what happens outside
if they've built some actual liquidity.

5472
01:58:13,189 --> 01:58:13,199
if they've built some actual liquidity.
 

5473
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,189
if they've built some actual liquidity.
If this was just like this, then that

5474
01:58:15,189 --> 01:58:15,199
If this was just like this, then that
 

5475
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:16,470
If this was just like this, then that
just says to me, well, there's no build

5476
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:16,480
just says to me, well, there's no build
 

5477
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:18,229
just says to me, well, there's no build
out of liquidity there. Not it's not an

5478
01:58:18,229 --> 01:58:18,239
out of liquidity there. Not it's not an
 

5479
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:24,470
out of liquidity there. Not it's not an
area of interest. [snorts]

5480
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:24,480

 

5481
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,589

Yes, I did. Well, I mean, okay, let me

5482
01:58:27,589 --> 01:58:27,599
Yes, I did. Well, I mean, okay, let me
 

5483
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,310
Yes, I did. Well, I mean, okay, let me
have another look then, Carol, because I

5484
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:30,320
have another look then, Carol, because I
 

5485
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:33,189
have another look then, Carol, because I
can't uh

5486
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:33,199
can't uh
 

5487
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:37,350
can't uh
see it, but I'll have a look.

5488
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:37,360
see it, but I'll have a look.
 

5489
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,189
see it, but I'll have a look.
I'll just authorize everyone now. And if

5490
01:58:39,189 --> 01:58:39,199
I'll just authorize everyone now. And if
 

5491
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:41,189
I'll just authorize everyone now. And if
you if you're not on there, it means you

5492
01:58:41,189 --> 01:58:41,199
you if you're not on there, it means you
 

5493
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:43,430
you if you're not on there, it means you
haven't filled in your Trading View name

5494
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,440
haven't filled in your Trading View name
 

5495
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:52,629
haven't filled in your Trading View name
correctly. But I will do it now.

5496
01:58:52,629 --> 01:58:52,639

 

5497
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:55,270

What's your actual name? Carol Wright.

5498
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:55,280
What's your actual name? Carol Wright.
 

5499
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,030
What's your actual name? Carol Wright.
Carol's Trading. I can see it there.

5500
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:57,040
Carol's Trading. I can see it there.
 

5501
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,589
Carol's Trading. I can see it there.
December 26th. Let's see if it's in

5502
01:58:59,589 --> 01:58:59,599
December 26th. Let's see if it's in
 

5503
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:07,030
December 26th. Let's see if it's in
there or not.

5504
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:07,040

 

5505
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,589

Can you try now, Carol? See if that

5506
01:59:09,589 --> 01:59:09,599
Can you try now, Carol? See if that
 

5507
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:12,390
Can you try now, Carol? See if that
worked.

5508
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:12,400
worked.
 

5509
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:15,910
worked.
I'll email you as well.

5510
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:15,920
I'll email you as well.
 

5511
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,430
I'll email you as well.
Apologies about that if it hadn't gone

5512
01:59:17,430 --> 01:59:17,440
Apologies about that if it hadn't gone
 

5513
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:31,669
Apologies about that if it hadn't gone
through for whatever reason.

5514
01:59:31,669 --> 01:59:31,679

 

5515
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:34,229

Should have just emailed you now. These

5516
01:59:34,229 --> 01:59:34,239
Should have just emailed you now. These
 

5517
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:35,750
Should have just emailed you now. These
people, they type in things like they

5518
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:35,760
people, they type in things like they
 

5519
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,310
people, they type in things like they
put their name

5520
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:38,320
put their name
 

5521
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:41,270
put their name
and then it's not their username.

5522
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:41,280
and then it's not their username.
 

5523
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:50,709
and then it's not their username.
Let's try that one.

5524
01:59:50,709 --> 01:59:50,719

 

5525
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:52,550

Give me a second here, folks, to just

01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:52,560
Give me a second here, folks, to just
 

5527
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,070
Give me a second here, folks, to just
make sure everyone's got this who

01:59:54,080 --> 02:00:03,350
make sure everyone's got this who
applied for it this morning.

5530
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:03,360

 

5531
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,470

It's another incorrect name.

5532
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:06,480
It's another incorrect name.
 

5533
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:13,589
It's another incorrect name.
Don Money. Let's try you.

5534
02:00:13,589 --> 02:00:13,599

 

5535
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:20,870

There we go. He has one.

5536
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:20,880

 

5537
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,790

One sec, folks. I'll be right back with

5540
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:25,520

5541
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:30,790
you. Apologies. Make sure everyone's set
up here.

5542
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:30,800

 

5543
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:40,310

Audrey.

5544
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:40,320

 

5545
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,390

Alex Todd. That won't work. It's wrong

5546
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:42,400
Alex Todd. That won't work. It's wrong
 

5547
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:50,870
Alex Todd. That won't work. It's wrong

5705
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:43,030
week's value areas, where are the high
volume nodes, where is the SNR level,

5706
02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:43,040
volume nodes, where is the SNR level,
 

5707
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,709
volume nodes, where is the SNR level,
does it match with a high volume node,

5708
02:04:44,709 --> 02:04:44,719
does it match with a high volume node,
 

5709
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:46,870
does it match with a high volume node,
do we have an area of liquidity? Like

5710
02:04:46,870 --> 02:04:46,880
do we have an area of liquidity? Like
 

5711
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,390
do we have an area of liquidity? Like
you got to just get through the process

5712
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:48,400
you got to just get through the process
 

5713
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:50,870
you got to just get through the process
of going through it every single day.

5714
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:50,880
of going through it every single day.
 

5715
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:53,030
of going through it every single day.
And it becomes easier and easier because

5716
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:53,040
And it becomes easier and easier because
 

5717
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,589
And it becomes easier and easier because
you know once you get through process of

5718
02:04:55,589 --> 02:04:55,599
you know once you get through process of
 

5719
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:57,589
you know once you get through process of
doing it once all you're doing is moving

5720
02:04:57,589 --> 02:04:57,599
doing it once all you're doing is moving
 

5721
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:02,470
doing it once all you're doing is moving
moving areas.

But 1 hour and 4 hour will work for you

Rick, sorry. Yeah,

5734
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:26,880

 

5735
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:29,750

we'll see, won't we? We'll see. It's I

5736
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:29,760
we'll see, won't we? We'll see. It's I
 

5737
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,669
we'll see, won't we? We'll see. It's I
mean, it's it's holding the bid very

5738
02:05:31,669 --> 02:05:31,679
mean, it's it's holding the bid very
 

5739
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:33,589
mean, it's it's holding the bid very
very well here. There's cannot deny that

5740
02:05:33,589 --> 02:05:33,599
very well here. There's cannot deny that
 

5741
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:34,870
very well here. There's cannot deny that
it's holding the bid very very well

5742
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:34,880
it's holding the bid very very well
 

5743
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:37,109
it's holding the bid very very well
here. I just think there's a huge amount

5744
02:05:37,109 --> 02:05:37,119
here. I just think there's a huge amount
 

5745
02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:39,669
here. I just think there's a huge amount
of liquidity or stops down here without

5746
02:05:39,669 --> 02:05:39,679
of liquidity or stops down here without
 

5747
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:42,390
of liquidity or stops down here without
a full retest of this area. But you know

5748
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:42,400
a full retest of this area. But you know
 

5749
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:45,270
a full retest of this area. But you know
if they are going to bid up

5750
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:45,280
if they are going to bid up
 

5751
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,950
if they are going to bid up
I wouldn't be surprised to see it wash

5752
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:46,960
I wouldn't be surprised to see it wash
 

5753
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,390
I wouldn't be surprised to see it wash
down here first whether it's today

5754
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
down here first whether it's today
 

5755
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:51,589
down here first whether it's today
tomorrow uh Wednesday or next week I

5756
02:05:51,589 --> 02:05:51,599
tomorrow uh Wednesday or next week I
 

5757
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:53,109
tomorrow uh Wednesday or next week I
wouldn't be surprised to see it come and

5758
02:05:53,109 --> 02:05:53,119
wouldn't be surprised to see it come and
 

5759
02:05:53,119 --> 02:05:55,030
wouldn't be surprised to see it come and
retest this first the way it's built

5760
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:55,040
retest this first the way it's built
 

5761
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:58,229
retest this first the way it's built
this out and on if it can hold a pivot

5762
02:05:58,229 --> 02:05:58,239
this out and on if it can hold a pivot
 

5763
02:05:58,239 --> 02:05:59,990
this out and on if it can hold a pivot
here and then do it then I think it's a

5764
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:00,000
here and then do it then I think it's a
 

5765
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,510
here and then do it then I think it's a
good area right personally

5766
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:03,520
good area right personally
 

5767
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,550
good area right personally
you know if you're looking for that

5768
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:04,560
you know if you're looking for that
 

5769
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:07,270
you know if you're looking for that
rotation off one go makes sense based on

5770
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:07,280
rotation off one go makes sense based on
 

5771
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,109
rotation off one go makes sense based on
what you're seeing here but I wouldn't

5772
02:06:09,109 --> 02:06:09,119
what you're seeing here but I wouldn't
 

5773
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:10,790
what you're seeing here but I wouldn't
be surprised to see everyone get run out

5774
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:10,800
be surprised to see everyone get run out
 

5775
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,629
be surprised to see everyone get run out
first and then them try and do it. But

5776
02:06:12,629 --> 02:06:12,639
first and then them try and do it. But
 

5777
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:14,709
first and then them try and do it. But
let we will just see. You've got to

5778
02:06:14,709 --> 02:06:14,719
let we will just see. You've got to
 

5779
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:17,189
let we will just see. You've got to
trade what your setup is. Like I said,

5780
02:06:17,189 --> 02:06:17,199
trade what your setup is. Like I said,
 

5781
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:19,030
trade what your setup is. Like I said,
it doesn't matter what I think. It only

it doesn't matter what I think. It only
 

5783
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:22,310
it doesn't matter what I think. It only
matters what your setup is. If your

02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:22,320
matters what your setup is. If your
 

5785
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:23,750

setup, if you've got proven track record
 

5787
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:24,870
setup, if you've got proven track record
trading that setup, you should

5788
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:24,880
trading that setup, you should
 

5789
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,510
trading that setup, you should
absolutely be trading your setup. It

5790

absolutely be trading your setup. It
 

5791
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,109
absolutely be trading your setup. It
really doesn't matter what I think. I'm

really doesn't matter what I think. I'm
just another guy on YouTube. The same

way I don't care what anyone else thinks
 

5797
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:34,790
way I don't care what anyone else thinks
or what they do. I I have to trade my

5798
02:06:34,790 --> 02:06:34,800
or what they do. I I have to trade my
 

5799
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:45,589
or what they do. I I have to trade my
edge.

5800
02:06:45,589 --> 02:06:45,599

 

5801
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:48,069

I think that makes sense. Rick Rick

5802
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:48,079
I think that makes sense. Rick Rick
 

5803
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:50,149
I think that makes sense. Rick Rick

saying it's definitely a low volume week
 

5805
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:51,910
saying it's definitely a low volume week
so it's going to test my patience taking

5806
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:51,920
so it's going to test my patience taking
 

5807
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:55,030
so it's going to test my patience taking
small size given uh the weak backdrop. I

5808
02:06:55,030 --> 02:06:55,040
small size given uh the weak backdrop. I
 

5809
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:57,109
small size given uh the weak backdrop. I
think that that is a wise and sensible

5810
02:06:57,109 --> 02:06:57,119
think that that is a wise and sensible
 

5811
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:59,037
think that that is a wise and sensible
decision.

5812
02:06:59,037 --> 02:06:59,047
decision.
 

5813
02:06:59,047 --> 02:07:02,709
decision.

Yeah, exactly. Run run run the stops,

Yeah, exactly. Run run run the stops,

Yeah, exactly. Run run run the stops,
reclaim then go. That's that's where

5818
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:08,800
reclaim then go. That's that's where
 

5819
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,430
reclaim then go. That's that's where
what I would think is probable. But it

5820
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:11,440
what I would think is probable. But it
 

5821
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,030
what I would think is probable. But it
doesn't matter what I think. If your

5822
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:13,040
doesn't matter what I think. If your
 

5823
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,709
doesn't matter what I think. If your

bidding now, small size for a for a
 

5827
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:19,350
bidding now, small size for a for a
bigger swing, then that's what you

5828
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:19,360
bigger swing, then that's what you
 

5829
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:20,629
bigger swing, then that's what you
should be doing. It doesn't matter what

5830
02:07:20,629 --> 02:07:20,639
should be doing. It doesn't matter what
 

5831
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:22,149
should be doing. It doesn't matter what
I say, you should be doing what your

I say, you should be doing what your
 

5833
02:07:22,159 --> 02:07:24,229
I say, you should be doing what your
edge is, right? So like if that's what

5834
02:07:24,229 --> 02:07:24,239
edge is, right? So like if that's what
 

5835
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:25,669
edge is, right? So like if that's what
your edge is right now and you're taking

02:07:25,669 --> 02:07:25,679
your edge is right now and you're taking

02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:27,430
your edge is right now and you're taking
that position, you're doing the right

02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:27,440
that position, you're doing the right
 

5839
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:29,669
that position, you're doing the right
thing. You can only trade your your

02:07:29,669 --> 02:07:29,679
thing. You can only trade your your
 

5841
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:31,109
thing. You can only trade your your
system in your edge. You're absolutely

system in your edge. You're absolutely

02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:32,320
doing the right thing if that's what it

5860
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:46,400
video describes. Yes, I think it's a
 

5861
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,550
video describes. Yes, I think it's a
good video. I think it's a good video. I

5862
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:48,560
good video. I think it's a good video. I
 

5863
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,870
good video. I think it's a good video. I
think it would help a lot of people

5864
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:50,880
think it would help a lot of people
 

5865
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,430
think it would help a lot of people
stay out of poor poor trades. That's

5866
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:53,440
stay out of poor poor trades. That's
 

5867
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:54,950
stay out of poor poor trades. That's
normally what lets people down. They can

5868
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:54,960
normally what lets people down. They can
 

5869
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,470
normally what lets people down. They can
spot good trades. They can't stay out of

5870
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:56,480
spot good trades. They can't stay out of
 

5871
02:07:56,480 --> 02:08:14,229
spot good trades. They can't stay out of
poor trades.

5872
02:08:14,229 --> 02:08:14,239

 

5873
02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:15,990

What time frame am I watching? This is a

5874
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:16,000
What time frame am I watching? This is a
 

5875
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,990
What time frame am I watching? This is a
one minute. Um, I execute on a one

5876
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:18,000
one minute. Um, I execute on a one
 

5877
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,069
one minute. Um, I execute on a one
minute. I'll be honest with you. I'm

5878
02:08:20,069 --> 02:08:20,079
minute. I'll be honest with you. I'm
 

5879
02:08:20,079 --> 02:08:22,069
minute. I'll be honest with you. I'm
watching a five and a one. Right. So,

5880
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:22,079
watching a five and a one. Right. So,
 

5881
02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:24,709
watching a five and a one. Right. So,
once I've done my top top down analysis,

5882
02:08:24,709 --> 02:08:24,719
once I've done my top top down analysis,
 

5883
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:27,109
once I've done my top top down analysis,
I have a an hourly that I pay close

5884
02:08:27,109 --> 02:08:27,119
I have a an hourly that I pay close
 

5885
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:29,270
I have a an hourly that I pay close
attention to and a five and a one.

5886
02:08:29,270 --> 02:08:29,280
attention to and a five and a one.
 

5887
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,270
attention to and a five and a one.
Right? So when I'm looking when we come

5888
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:31,280
Right? So when I'm looking when we come
 

5889
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,270
Right? So when I'm looking when we come
into areas of interest, I'm looking to

5890
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:33,280
into areas of interest, I'm looking to
 

5891
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,189
into areas of interest, I'm looking to
see who's trapped and where they're

5892
02:08:35,189 --> 02:08:35,199
see who's trapped and where they're
 

5893
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:40,069
see who's trapped and where they're
trapped on the volume uh on order flow

5894
02:08:40,069 --> 02:08:40,079
trapped on the volume uh on order flow
 

5895
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:42,950
trapped on the volume uh on order flow
on footprint on bookmat using a five

5896
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:42,960
on footprint on bookmat using a five
 

5897
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,470
on footprint on bookmat using a five
minute and a one minute. That's that's

5898
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:44,480
minute and a one minute. That's that's
 

5899
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:47,270
minute and a one minute. That's that's
what I'm looking at. All right, that's

5900
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:47,280
what I'm looking at. All right, that's
 

5901
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,629
what I'm looking at. All right, that's
all I'm looking at. So like my five

5902
02:08:48,629 --> 02:08:48,639
all I'm looking at. So like my five
 

5903
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:51,109
all I'm looking at. So like my five
minute right here,

5904
02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:51,119
minute right here,
 

5905
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:53,669
minute right here,
right? So I've got my flow zones on here

5906
02:08:53,669 --> 02:08:53,679
right? So I've got my flow zones on here
 

5907
02:08:53,679 --> 02:08:55,910
right? So I've got my flow zones on here
on a fivem minute and I'm just looking

5908
02:08:55,910 --> 02:08:55,920
on a fivem minute and I'm just looking
 

5909
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,310
on a fivem minute and I'm just looking
at where are shorts coming flying in.

5910
02:08:58,310 --> 02:08:58,320
at where are shorts coming flying in.
 

5911
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,310
at where are shorts coming flying in.
Where did buyers get stuck this morning?

5912
02:09:00,310 --> 02:09:00,320
Where did buyers get stuck this morning?
 

5913
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,550
Where did buyers get stuck this morning?
Where is value? Where are we migrating?

5914
02:09:02,550 --> 02:09:02,560
Where is value? Where are we migrating?
 

5915
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,830
Where is value? Where are we migrating?
Where are their stops that we can

5916
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:03,840
Where are their stops that we can
 

5917
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,990
Where are their stops that we can
potentially run? And once we get into

5918
02:09:05,990 --> 02:09:06,000
potentially run? And once we get into
 

5919
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,669
potentially run? And once we get into
those areas on a 5m minute, then maybe

5920
02:09:07,669 --> 02:09:07,679
those areas on a 5m minute, then maybe
 

5921
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:09,109
those areas on a 5m minute, then maybe
I'm looking at a one minute being like,

5922
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:09,119
I'm looking at a one minute being like,
 

5923
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:12,390
I'm looking at a one minute being like,
okay, who can I see in a very low time

5924
02:09:12,390 --> 02:09:12,400
okay, who can I see in a very low time
 

5925
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:15,830
okay, who can I see in a very low time
frame who's getting themselves caught?

5926
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:15,840
frame who's getting themselves caught?
 

5927
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:18,229
frame who's getting themselves caught?
I haven't tried deep charts. Uh there's

5928
02:09:18,229 --> 02:09:18,239
I haven't tried deep charts. Uh there's
 

5929
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:19,990
I haven't tried deep charts. Uh there's
some guys in the in my group who have

5930
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:20,000
some guys in the in my group who have
 

5931
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,069
some guys in the in my group who have
used them, think they're very good, but

5932
02:09:22,069 --> 02:09:22,079
used them, think they're very good, but
 

5933
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:25,990
used them, think they're very good, but
my what I'm using is very very similar

5934
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:26,000
my what I'm using is very very similar
 

5935
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,550
my what I'm using is very very similar
on Ninja Trader. very very similar.

5936
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:30,560
on Ninja Trader. very very similar.
 

5937
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,629

Thank you, Rosco. Appreciate the kind
words. Yeah, if anyone hasn't watched

5940
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:34,320
words. Yeah, if anyone hasn't watched
 

5941
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:35,669
words. Yeah, if anyone hasn't watched
it, I dropped a new video at the

5942
02:09:35,669 --> 02:09:35,679
it, I dropped a new video at the
 

5943
02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:37,990
it, I dropped a new video at the
weekend. I'll post it in chat. Um, it's

5944
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,000
weekend. I'll post it in chat. Um, it's
 

5945
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,550
weekend. I'll post it in chat. Um, it's
probably useful to you guys about when

5946
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:40,560
probably useful to you guys about when
 

5947
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,390
probably useful to you guys about when
to get into a trade and why to get into

5948
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:42,400
to get into a trade and why to get into
 

5949
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,470
to get into a trade and why to get into
a trade and just building a very simple

5950
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:44,480
a trade and just building a very simple
 

5951
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:48,069
a trade and just building a very simple
system, right, to give you context of

5952
02:09:48,069 --> 02:09:48,079
system, right, to give you context of
 

5953
02:09:48,079 --> 02:09:49,750
system, right, to give you context of
what you're looking at on the day. And

5954
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:49,760
what you're looking at on the day. And
 

5955
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:51,350
what you're looking at on the day. And
if you just go through it over and over

5956
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:51,360
if you just go through it over and over
 

5957
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,109
if you just go through it over and over
and over again, if you get into it every

5958
02:09:53,109 --> 02:09:53,119
and over again, if you get into it every
 

5959
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:55,350
and over again, if you get into it every
day, that video right there, I would

5960
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:55,360
day, that video right there, I would
 

5961
02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:01,109
day, that video right there, I would
advise you guys go and watch it.

5962
02:10:01,109 --> 02:10:01,119

 

5963
02:10:01,119 --> 02:10:02,950

We're still just trading inside of the

5964
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:02,960
We're still just trading inside of the
 

5965
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:05,510
We're still just trading inside of the
orb, inside of the IB, inside of value

5966
02:10:05,510 --> 02:10:05,520
orb, inside of the IB, inside of value
 

5967
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:06,950
orb, inside of the IB, inside of value
on the day. We're just rotating,

5968
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:06,960
on the day. We're just rotating,
 

5969
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,550
on the day. We're just rotating,
rotating, rotating, rotating. I tell you

5970
02:10:08,550 --> 02:10:08,560
rotating, rotating, rotating. I tell you
 

5971
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,310
rotating, rotating, rotating. I tell you
what, if shorts don't get this breakdown

5972
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:10,320
what, if shorts don't get this breakdown
 

5973
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:12,790
what, if shorts don't get this breakdown
soon, uh Rick will get his play because

5974
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:12,800
soon, uh Rick will get his play because
 

5975
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:14,149
soon, uh Rick will get his play because
they will get themselves stuck. They

5976
02:10:14,149 --> 02:10:14,159
they will get themselves stuck. They
 

5977
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:16,870
they will get themselves stuck. They
have tried here and here. And if they

5978
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:16,880
have tried here and here. And if they
 

5979
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,310
have tried here and here. And if they
don't get this move soon, you will have

5980
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:18,320
don't get this move soon, you will have
 

5981
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:20,310
don't get this move soon, you will have
a lot of shorts piled into this. And

5982
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:20,320
a lot of shorts piled into this. And
 

5983
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,910
a lot of shorts piled into this. And
Rick will probably get that squeeze up

5984
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:21,920
Rick will probably get that squeeze up
 

5985
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:23,350
Rick will probably get that squeeze up
to here. And if they get acceptance,

5986
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:23,360
to here. And if they get acceptance,
 

5987
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:29,950
to here. And if they get acceptance,
then they have the next node.

5988
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:29,960

 

5989
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:31,915

5993
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:39,669

Do I know if there's another way to see

5994
02:10:39,669 --> 02:10:39,679
Do I know if there's another way to see
 

5995
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:41,830
Do I know if there's another way to see
delta levels on volume profile like on

5996
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:41,840
delta levels on volume profile like on
 

5997
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:44,149
delta levels on volume profile like on
deep charts? uh like this. This is what

5998
02:10:44,149 --> 02:10:44,159
deep charts? uh like this. This is what
 

5999
02:10:44,159 --> 02:10:47,510
deep charts? uh like this. This is what
I'm looking at. This is delta, right?

6000
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:47,520
I'm looking at. This is delta, right?
 

6001
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:50,950
I'm looking at. This is delta, right?
This is volume. This is delta. So, yes,

6002
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:50,960
This is volume. This is delta. So, yes,
 

6003
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:53,109
This is volume. This is delta. So, yes,
but you need third party apps to to do

6004
02:10:53,109 --> 02:10:53,119
but you need third party apps to to do
 

6005
02:10:53,119 --> 02:10:54,870
but you need third party apps to to do
it. But that's exactly what I have on

6006
02:10:54,870 --> 02:10:54,880
it. But that's exactly what I have on
 

6007
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:56,950
it. But that's exactly what I have on
Ninja Trader.

6008
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:56,960
Ninja Trader.
 

6009
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:01,189
Ninja Trader.
Exactly what I'm looking at.

6010
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:01,199

 

6011
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:04,229

Or alternatively, if you're using BMAP,

6551
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:14,630
I want to see if they can you want to
see if they can attack these stops down

6553
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:16,950

these stops down here, I do think we

6556
02:26:18,389 --> 02:26:18,399
these stops down here, I do think we
 

6557
02:26:18,399 --> 02:26:19,830
these stops down here, I do think we
have unfinished business at the lows.

6558

have unfinished business at the lows.
 

6559

thanks for explaining it. And that sums

6792
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:49,200
thanks for explaining it. And that sums
 

6793
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:53,371
thanks for explaining it. And that sums
up retail.

How about taking the time to learn

6798
02:32:57,830 --> 02:32:57,840
How about taking the time to learn
 

6799
02:32:57,840 --> 02:33:00,309
How about taking the time to learn
something first?

6800
02:33:00,309 --> 02:33:00,319
something first?
 

6801

because the market said it's going to go
 

6817
02:33:26,319 --> 02:33:28,309
because the market said it's going to go
higher. It's not working. Why isn't it

02:33:28,309 --> 02:33:28,319
higher. It's not working. Why isn't it
 

6819

I couldn't go and look at a car engine
 

6867
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:31,349
I couldn't go and look at a car engine

6868
02:34:31,349 --> 02:34:31,359
and be like, "Oh, that's [\h__\h]

broken." I am I haven't got Scooby-Doo.
What's going on if I look at something

6872
02:34:36,150 --> 02:34:36,160
What's going on if I look at something
 

6873
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:39,481
What's going on if I look at something

Yeah. This is me being calm.

6886
02:34:55,990 --> 02:34:56,000

 

6887
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,150

Okay. Still nothing happening here.

6888
02:34:58,150 --> 02:34:58,160
Okay. Still nothing happening here.
 

6889
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:00,150
Okay. Still nothing happening here.
Divergence to ES. Did ES break down that

6890
02:35:00,150 --> 02:35:00,160
Divergence to ES. Did ES break down that
 

6891
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:01,910
Divergence to ES. Did ES break down that
pre-market low? It didn't. It did sweep

6892
02:35:01,910 --> 02:35:01,920
pre-market low? It didn't. It did sweep
 

6893
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:03,270
pre-market low? It didn't. It did sweep
the initial balance low though. All

6894
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:03,280
the initial balance low though. All
 

6895
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:05,990
the initial balance low though. All
right. If we want to have a look at ES,

6896
02:35:05,990 --> 02:35:06,000
right. If we want to have a look at ES,
 

6897
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,670
right. If we want to have a look at ES,
we did see a sweep of the IB low right

6898
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:09,680
we did see a sweep of the IB low right
 

6899
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:11,590
we did see a sweep of the IB low right
here. We're not finding acceptance below

6900
02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:11,600
here. We're not finding acceptance below
 

6901
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:13,910
here. We're not finding acceptance below
it though. Right now,

6902
02:35:13,910 --> 02:35:13,920
it though. Right now,
 

6903
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:15,190
it though. Right now,
we can't find acceptance. We didn't

6904
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:15,200
we can't find acceptance. We didn't
 

6905
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:16,550
we can't find acceptance. We didn't
sweep premarket. That's what I was

6906
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:16,560
sweep premarket. That's what I was
 

6907
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,710
sweep premarket. That's what I was
looking to see if we would sweep it. And

6908
02:35:18,710 --> 02:35:18,720
looking to see if we would sweep it. And
 

6909
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:20,630
looking to see if we would sweep it. And
you'll see some form of compression

6910
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:20,640
you'll see some form of compression
 

6911
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:22,309
you'll see some form of compression
here. Okay. If they don't fill their

6912
02:35:22,309 --> 02:35:22,319
here. Okay. If they don't fill their
 

6913
02:35:22,319 --> 02:35:24,710
here. Okay. If they don't fill their
obligation, if they cannot successfully

6914
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:24,720
obligation, if they cannot successfully
 

6915
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:26,710
obligation, if they cannot successfully
take out all these stops and shorts keep

6916
02:35:26,710 --> 02:35:26,720
take out all these stops and shorts keep
 

6917
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:28,630
take out all these stops and shorts keep
piling in, at some point you might get

6918
02:35:28,630 --> 02:35:28,640
piling in, at some point you might get
 

6919
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:30,870
piling in, at some point you might get
that short covering rally, which is what

6920
02:35:30,870 --> 02:35:30,880
that short covering rally, which is what
 

6921
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:32,550
that short covering rally, which is what
uh I think Rick was looking for the

6922
02:35:32,550 --> 02:35:32,560
uh I think Rick was looking for the
 

6923
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:34,389
uh I think Rick was looking for the
start of a short covering rally. Just

6924
02:35:34,389 --> 02:35:34,399
start of a short covering rally. Just
 

6925
02:35:34,399 --> 02:35:37,110
start of a short covering rally. Just
depends whether ENQ uh which is holding

6926
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:37,120
depends whether ENQ uh which is holding
 

6927
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:38,550
depends whether ENQ uh which is holding
up pretty well right now. Remember, we

6928
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:38,560
up pretty well right now. Remember, we
 

6929
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:40,469
up pretty well right now. Remember, we
haven't swept this low, but we are like

6930
02:35:40,469 --> 02:35:40,479
haven't swept this low, but we are like
 

6931
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:42,550
haven't swept this low, but we are like
we talked about in this sort of zone

6932
02:35:42,550 --> 02:35:42,560
we talked about in this sort of zone
 

6933
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:43,990
we talked about in this sort of zone
that we pivoted from this morning. So,

6934
02:35:43,990 --> 02:35:44,000
that we pivoted from this morning. So,
 

6935
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,349
that we pivoted from this morning. So,
if we think about structure, there's

6936
02:35:45,349 --> 02:35:45,359
if we think about structure, there's
 

6937
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:47,750
if we think about structure, there's
your pre-market flush. There's the

6938
02:35:47,750 --> 02:35:47,760
your pre-market flush. There's the
 

6939
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:49,429
your pre-market flush. There's the
breakdown. There's a pivot off. There's

6940
02:35:49,429 --> 02:35:49,439
breakdown. There's a pivot off. There's
 

6941
02:35:49,439 --> 02:35:51,590
breakdown. There's a pivot off. There's
the first retest, and we're just

6942
02:35:51,590 --> 02:35:51,600
the first retest, and we're just
 

6943
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:54,150
the first retest, and we're just
building out volume here. Remember,

6944
02:35:54,150 --> 02:35:54,160
building out volume here. Remember,
 

6945
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:56,230
building out volume here. Remember,
we're in a rotational market. There's

6946
02:35:56,230 --> 02:35:56,240
we're in a rotational market. There's
 

6947
02:35:56,240 --> 02:35:58,309
we're in a rotational market. There's
your shape right now, condensing in

What do I think about gold after this

6982
02:37:01,270 --> 02:37:01,280
What do I think about gold after this
 

6983
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:32,469
What do I think about gold after this
little crash? Um,

6984
02:37:32,469 --> 02:37:32,479

 

6985
02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:35,110

Looks fine.

6986
02:37:35,110 --> 02:37:35,120
Looks fine.
 

6987
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:37,830
Looks fine.
What's the volume like

6988
02:37:37,830 --> 02:37:37,840
What's the volume like
 

6989
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,270
What's the volume like
when I'd start getting concerned about

6990
02:37:39,270 --> 02:37:39,280
when I'd start getting concerned about
 

6991
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:41,190
when I'd start getting concerned about
gold, right? I would like a bid will

6992
02:37:41,190 --> 02:37:41,200
gold, right? I would like a bid will
 

6993
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:44,150
gold, right? I would like a bid will
probably come in around this shelf.

6994
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:44,160
probably come in around this shelf.
 

6995
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:46,230
probably come in around this shelf.
Maybe it comes in here. What I'd be

6996
02:37:46,230 --> 02:37:46,240
Maybe it comes in here. What I'd be
 

6997
02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:47,910
Maybe it comes in here. What I'd be
concerned about is if you get a failure

6998
02:37:47,910 --> 02:37:47,920
concerned about is if you get a failure
 

6999
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:49,590
concerned about is if you get a failure
to follow through. If you push up and

7000
02:37:49,590 --> 02:37:49,600
to follow through. If you push up and
 

7001
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:51,510
to follow through. If you push up and
you leave these guys trapped, one, two,

7002
02:37:51,510 --> 02:37:51,520
you leave these guys trapped, one, two,
 

7003
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:53,750
you leave these guys trapped, one, two,
three, four, five days worth trapped and

7004
02:37:53,750 --> 02:37:53,760
three, four, five days worth trapped and
 

7005
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:56,070
three, four, five days worth trapped and
a deeper pull back into here maybe. and

7006
02:37:56,070 --> 02:37:56,080
a deeper pull back into here maybe. and
 

7007
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:57,510
a deeper pull back into here maybe. and
then if there's a continuation to the

7008
02:37:57,510 --> 02:37:57,520
then if there's a continuation to the
 

7009
02:37:57,520 --> 02:37:59,190
then if there's a continuation to the
bottom side of this range. But at the

7010
02:37:59,190 --> 02:37:59,200
bottom side of this range. But at the
 

7011
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:01,429
bottom side of this range. But at the
moment it looks okay. I wouldn't be like

7012
02:38:01,429 --> 02:38:01,439
moment it looks okay. I wouldn't be like
 

7013
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:04,150
moment it looks okay. I wouldn't be like
bidding on this market uh necessarily

7014
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:04,160
bidding on this market uh necessarily
 

7015
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:06,230
bidding on this market uh necessarily
like swing. But if you're swing long in

7016
02:38:06,230 --> 02:38:06,240
like swing. But if you're swing long in
 

7017
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:08,309
like swing. But if you're swing long in
gold and have been you know since this

7018
02:38:08,309 --> 02:38:08,319
gold and have been you know since this
 

7019
02:38:08,319 --> 02:38:10,389
gold and have been you know since this
pullback remember the last time I played

7020
02:38:10,389 --> 02:38:10,399
pullback remember the last time I played
 

7021
02:38:10,399 --> 02:38:12,870
pullback remember the last time I played
gold was a short

7022
02:38:12,870 --> 02:38:12,880
gold was a short
 

7023
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:14,389
gold was a short
here

7024
02:38:14,389 --> 02:38:14,399
here
 

7025
02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:16,469
here
right for this move. We've accumulated

7026
02:38:16,469 --> 02:38:16,479
right for this move. We've accumulated
 

7027
02:38:16,479 --> 02:38:19,670
right for this move. We've accumulated
since okay the pullback into this sort

7028
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:19,680
since okay the pullback into this sort
 

7029
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:21,270
since okay the pullback into this sort
of range here is what they're trying to

7030
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:21,280
of range here is what they're trying to
 

7031
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:24,469
of range here is what they're trying to
hold for a rep push higher. Okay. If you

7032
02:38:24,469 --> 02:38:24,479
hold for a rep push higher. Okay. If you
 

7033
02:38:24,479 --> 02:38:27,270
hold for a rep push higher. Okay. If you
start to see failures to reclaim and

7034
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:27,280
start to see failures to reclaim and
 

7035
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,510
start to see failures to reclaim and
start to go backside without the ability

7036
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:29,520
start to go backside without the ability
 

7037
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:31,110
start to go backside without the ability
to reclaim, that's when I'd be more

7038
02:38:31,110 --> 02:38:31,120
to reclaim, that's when I'd be more
 

7039
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:33,190
to reclaim, that's when I'd be more
concerned about gold doing a bigger

7040
02:38:33,190 --> 02:38:33,200
concerned about gold doing a bigger
 

7041
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:34,790
concerned about gold doing a bigger
pullback. But, you know, with what's

7042
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:34,800
pullback. But, you know, with what's
 

7043
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:37,190
pullback. But, you know, with what's
going on macrowise, I think it looks

7044
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:37,200
going on macrowise, I think it looks
 

7045
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:39,990
going on macrowise, I think it looks
okay right now.

7046
02:38:39,990 --> 02:38:40,000
okay right now.
 

7047
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,150
okay right now.
Same in silver. I mean, if we look at

7048
02:38:42,150 --> 02:38:42,160
Same in silver. I mean, if we look at
 

7049
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:48,710
Same in silver. I mean, if we look at
expansion of this range,

7050
02:38:48,710 --> 02:38:48,720

 

7051
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:51,910

getting right up to the fours.

7052
02:38:51,910 --> 02:38:51,920
getting right up to the fours.
 

7053
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:55,110
getting right up to the fours.
If we think about retracement

7054
02:38:55,110 --> 02:38:55,120
If we think about retracement
 

7055
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:57,590
If we think about retracement
one pivot low,

7056
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:57,600
one pivot low,
 

7057
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:59,349
one pivot low,
right, it's still healthy. It's fine. It

7058
02:38:59,349 --> 02:38:59,359
right, it's still healthy. It's fine. It
 

7059
02:38:59,359 --> 02:39:01,830
right, it's still healthy. It's fine. It
hasn't even retraced 50%. Remember, we

7060
02:39:01,830 --> 02:39:01,840
hasn't even retraced 50%. Remember, we
 

7061
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:03,349
hasn't even retraced 50%. Remember, we
talked about it. Like this move last

7062
02:39:03,349 --> 02:39:03,359
talked about it. Like this move last
 

7063
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:05,590
talked about it. Like this move last
week was a 25% push up. You have to

7064
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:05,600
week was a 25% push up. You have to
 

7065
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,910
week was a 25% push up. You have to
understand how big a move this was on

7066
02:39:07,910 --> 02:39:07,920
understand how big a move this was on
 

7067
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:16,309
understand how big a move this was on
low volume. Where's last week? Monday

7068
02:39:16,309 --> 02:39:16,319

 

7069
02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:18,469

almost 25%. Right. It's a big [\h__\h]

7070
02:39:18,469 --> 02:39:18,479
almost 25%. Right. It's a big [\h__\h]
 

7071
02:39:18,479 --> 02:39:21,670
almost 25%. Right. It's a big [\h__\h]
move. One, two, three, four days. It it

7072
02:39:21,670 --> 02:39:21,680
move. One, two, three, four days. It it
 

7073
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:24,150
move. One, two, three, four days. It it
needed it needed and it needs a

7074
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:24,160
needed it needed and it needs a
 

7075
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:26,150
needed it needed and it needs a
pullback. Okay. What you don't want to

7076
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:26,160
pullback. Okay. What you don't want to
 

7077
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:27,990
pullback. Okay. What you don't want to
do is the guy who's like, "Oh, silver's

7078
02:39:27,990 --> 02:39:28,000
do is the guy who's like, "Oh, silver's
 

7079
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,510
do is the guy who's like, "Oh, silver's
at all times and buying." Right? You're

7080
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:29,520
at all times and buying." Right? You're
 

7081
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:31,190
at all times and buying." Right? You're
becoming the liquidity for them to sell

7082
02:39:31,190 --> 02:39:31,200
becoming the liquidity for them to sell
 

7083
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:33,030
becoming the liquidity for them to sell
into. You got to remember how an auction

7084
02:39:33,030 --> 02:39:33,040
into. You got to remember how an auction
 

7085
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:37,190
into. You got to remember how an auction
works, right? They can't sell. They

7086
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:37,200
works, right? They can't sell. They
 

7087
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:40,550
works, right? They can't sell. They
market makers, institutions can't sell

7088
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:40,560
market makers, institutions can't sell
 

7089
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:43,190
market makers, institutions can't sell
to nobody. They need retail. All right?

7090
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:43,200
to nobody. They need retail. All right?
 

7091
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:44,710
to nobody. They need retail. All right?
They need retail the other side of the

7092
02:39:44,710 --> 02:39:44,720
They need retail the other side of the
 

7093
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:48,070
They need retail the other side of the
trade. So, hysteria, gold, all silver at

7117
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:14,870

understand how the auction works. It is
 

7119
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:17,510
understand how the auction works. It is
about buying low and selling high, but

7120
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:17,520
about buying low and selling high, but
 

7121
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:19,349
about buying low and selling high, but
it's about using the liquidity at those

it's about using the liquidity at those
 

7123
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:21,429
it's about using the liquidity at those

It's why you often see like, you know,

7148
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:00,240
It's why you often see like, you know,
 

7149
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:01,990
It's why you often see like, you know,
big news events. It's already priced in.

7150
02:41:01,990 --> 02:41:02,000
big news events. It's already priced in.
 

7151
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:03,830
big news events. It's already priced in.
The news event comes and you get the

02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:03,840
The news event comes and you get the
 

7153
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:12,550
The news event comes and you get the

7154
02:41:12,550 --> 02:41:12,560

 

7155
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:14,630

Some say that futures are such an

7156
02:41:14,630 --> 02:41:14,640
Some say that futures are such an
 

7157
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:15,990
Some say that futures are such an
efficient market. It's difficult to find

7158
02:41:15,990 --> 02:41:16,000
efficient market. It's difficult to find
 

7159
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,710
efficient market. It's difficult to find
edge. Have you used a variation of your

7160
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:18,720
edge. Have you used a variation of your
 

7161
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:20,309
edge. Have you used a variation of your
methodology on equities? Yeah, I would

7162
02:41:20,309 --> 02:41:20,319
methodology on equities? Yeah, I would
 

7163
02:41:20,319 --> 02:41:23,190
methodology on equities? Yeah, I would
agree with that. I think um futures are

7164
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:23,200
agree with that. I think um futures are
 

7165
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,110
agree with that. I think um futures are
very very efficient market. Doesn't mean

7166
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:25,120
very very efficient market. Doesn't mean
 

7167
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:26,790
very very efficient market. Doesn't mean
that there is an edge. You have to be

7168
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:26,800
that there is an edge. You have to be
 

7169
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:29,190
that there is an edge. You have to be
very very patient. But you're not or

7170
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:29,200
very very patient. But you're not or
 

7171
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:32,550
very very patient. But you're not or
you're it's not true always because

7172
02:41:32,550 --> 02:41:32,560
you're it's not true always because
 

7173
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:34,630
you're it's not true always because
silver is a prime example. Okay? If you

7174
02:41:34,630 --> 02:41:34,640
silver is a prime example. Okay? If you
 

7175
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:36,389
silver is a prime example. Okay? If you
if you've taken that short position on

7176
02:41:36,389 --> 02:41:36,399
if you've taken that short position on
 

7177
02:41:36,399 --> 02:41:38,309
if you've taken that short position on
silver overnight, it was very very

7178
02:41:38,309 --> 02:41:38,319
silver overnight, it was very very
 

7179
02:41:38,319 --> 02:41:40,950
silver overnight, it was very very
clearly needed that retracement. All

7180
02:41:40,950 --> 02:41:40,960
clearly needed that retracement. All
 

7181
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:43,190
clearly needed that retracement. All
right? like I will show I'll I don't

7182
02:41:43,190 --> 02:41:43,200
right? like I will show I'll I don't
 

7183
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:44,950
right? like I will show I'll I don't
even know but I can guarantee you it's

7184
02:41:44,950 --> 02:41:44,960
even know but I can guarantee you it's
 

7185
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:46,630
even know but I can guarantee you it's
well outside the standard deviation. We

7186
02:41:46,630 --> 02:41:46,640
well outside the standard deviation. We
 

7187
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:47,990
well outside the standard deviation. We
will just have a look. Right, let's go

7188
02:41:47,990 --> 02:41:48,000
will just have a look. Right, let's go
 

7189
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,550
will just have a look. Right, let's go
to our daily.

7190
02:41:50,550 --> 02:41:50,560
to our daily.
 

7191
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:54,790
to our daily.
All right, let's look at silver.

7192
02:41:54,790 --> 02:41:54,800

 

7193
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:57,429

Okay, surprise surprise. We're outside a

7194
02:41:57,429 --> 02:41:57,439
Okay, surprise surprise. We're outside a
 

7195
02:41:57,439 --> 02:41:59,429
Okay, surprise surprise. We're outside a
standard deviation, right? We're well

7196
02:41:59,429 --> 02:41:59,439
standard deviation, right? We're well
 

7197
02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:01,590
standard deviation, right? We're well
over two standard deviations. In fact,

7198
02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:01,600
over two standard deviations. In fact,
 

7199
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:03,110
over two standard deviations. In fact,
I'd say we're probably at three standard

7200
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:03,120
I'd say we're probably at three standard
 

7201
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:05,190
I'd say we're probably at three standard
deviations plus. Let me have a look on

7202
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:05,200
deviations plus. Let me have a look on
 

7203
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:07,670
deviations plus. Let me have a look on
the 20-day. There you go. So, uh two and

7204
02:42:07,670 --> 02:42:07,680
the 20-day. There you go. So, uh two and
 

7205
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:09,349
the 20-day. There you go. So, uh two and
a half, just shy of three standard

7206
02:42:09,349 --> 02:42:09,359
a half, just shy of three standard
 

7207
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:12,309
a half, just shy of three standard
deviations. We were 2.7 standard

7208
02:42:12,309 --> 02:42:12,319
deviations. We were 2.7 standard
 

7209
02:42:12,319 --> 02:42:14,070
deviations. We were 2.7 standard
deviations outside of the mean on

7210
02:42:14,070 --> 02:42:14,080
deviations outside of the mean on
 

7211
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:16,309
deviations outside of the mean on
silver. Okay. So I already know markets

7212
02:42:16,309 --> 02:42:16,319
silver. Okay. So I already know markets
 

7213
02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:17,990
silver. Okay. So I already know markets
cannot live outside two standard

7214
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:18,000
cannot live outside two standard
 

7215
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,230
cannot live outside two standard
deviations. Almost all markets unless

7216
02:42:20,230 --> 02:42:20,240
deviations. Almost all markets unless
 

7217
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:21,670
deviations. Almost all markets unless
you're talking about small cap and even

7218
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:21,680
you're talking about small cap and even
 

7219
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:23,190
you're talking about small cap and even
those traditionally can live outside

7220
02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:23,200
those traditionally can live outside
 

7221
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:27,349
those traditionally can live outside
three. This all right is a fantastic

7222
02:42:27,349 --> 02:42:27,359
three. This all right is a fantastic
 

7223
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:29,670
three. This all right is a fantastic
condition to be short on silver. All

7224
02:42:29,670 --> 02:42:29,680
condition to be short on silver. All
 

7225
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:31,670
condition to be short on silver. All
right for a mean reversion trade where

7226
02:42:31,670 --> 02:42:31,680
right for a mean reversion trade where
 

7227
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:33,990
right for a mean reversion trade where
we where's the first reversion? 5day

7228
02:42:33,990 --> 02:42:34,000
we where's the first reversion? 5day
 

7229
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:35,830
we where's the first reversion? 5day
second reversion 20day. All right

7230
02:42:35,830 --> 02:42:35,840
second reversion 20day. All right
 

7231
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:38,630
second reversion 20day. All right
outside of Ballinger band overextension.

7232
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:38,640
outside of Ballinger band overextension.
 

7233
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:41,990
outside of Ballinger band overextension.
So to say that there's no edge would be

7234
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:42,000
So to say that there's no edge would be
 

7235
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:45,030
So to say that there's no edge would be
incorrect. To say there's less edge I

7236
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,040
incorrect. To say there's less edge I
 

7237
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,429
incorrect. To say there's less edge I
would say is correct. Why? Because

7238
02:42:47,429 --> 02:42:47,439
would say is correct. Why? Because
 

7239
02:42:47,439 --> 02:42:49,349
would say is correct. Why? Because
you've got more vehicles to trade in

7240
02:42:49,349 --> 02:42:49,359
you've got more vehicles to trade in
 

7241
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:51,429
you've got more vehicles to trade in
stocks. Okay. So if we think about

7242
02:42:51,429 --> 02:42:51,439
stocks. Okay. So if we think about
 

7243
02:42:51,439 --> 02:42:54,150
stocks. Okay. So if we think about
something equivalent of in stocks, I

7244
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:54,160
something equivalent of in stocks, I
 

7245
02:42:54,160 --> 02:42:55,349
something equivalent of in stocks, I
don't know. Let's look at some of the

7246
02:42:55,349 --> 02:42:55,359
don't know. Let's look at some of the
 

7247
02:42:55,359 --> 02:42:57,670
don't know. Let's look at some of the
high gamma exposure names. RGTI for

7248
02:42:57,670 --> 02:42:57,680
high gamma exposure names. RGTI for
 

7249
02:42:57,680 --> 02:43:05,429
high gamma exposure names. RGTI for
example. Can we find that? RGTI.

7250
02:43:05,429 --> 02:43:05,439

 

7251
02:43:05,439 --> 02:43:06,950

Okay.

7252
02:43:06,950 --> 02:43:06,960
Okay.
 

7253
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:11,190
Okay.
This right is very very clearly a short

7254
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:11,200
This right is very very clearly a short
 

7255
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:13,429
This right is very very clearly a short
squeeze on continuation on retail

7256
02:43:13,429 --> 02:43:13,439

Um,

7278
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,120
Um,
 

7279
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:43,269
Um,
and if you think about you've got 500

7280
02:43:43,269 --> 02:43:43,279
and if you think about you've got 500
 

7281
02:43:43,279 --> 02:43:45,030
and if you think about you've got 500
stocks plus to look at and that's on the

02:43:45,030 --> 02:43:45,040
stocks plus to look at and that's on the
 

7283
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:46,710
stocks plus to look at and that's on the
S&P alone. If you want to include the

7284
02:43:46,710 --> 02:43:46,720
S&P alone. If you want to include the
 

7285
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:49,110
S&P alone. If you want to include the
New York Stock Exchange even more, if

7286
02:43:49,110 --> 02:43:49,120
New York Stock Exchange even more, if

you want to include small caps even
 

7289
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:52,309
you want to include small caps even
more, right, then you have more

7290
02:43:52,309 --> 02:43:52,319
more, right, then you have more
 

7291
02:43:52,319 --> 02:43:53,990
more, right, then you have more
opportunities

7292
02:43:53,990 --> 02:43:54,000
opportunities
 

7293
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,469
opportunities
in those names

7294
02:43:56,469 --> 02:43:56,479
in those names
 

7295
02:43:56,479 --> 02:43:58,790
in those names
to find

7296
02:43:58,790 --> 02:43:58,800
to find
 

7297
02:43:58,800 --> 02:43:59,910
to find
really what you're talking about is

7298
02:43:59,910 --> 02:43:59,920
really what you're talking about is
 

7299
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:01,590
really what you're talking about is
finding participants offside. That's

7300
02:44:01,590 --> 02:44:01,600
finding participants offside. That's
 

7301
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:02,950
finding participants offside. That's
really what we're talking about all the

7302
02:44:02,950 --> 02:44:02,960
really what we're talking about all the
 

7303
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:04,309
really what we're talking about all the
time. When we talk about efficiency,

7304
02:44:04,309 --> 02:44:04,319
time. When we talk about efficiency,
 

7305
02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:05,750
time. When we talk about efficiency,
we're talking about finding participants

7306
02:44:05,750 --> 02:44:05,760
we're talking about finding participants
 

7307
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:08,230
we're talking about finding participants
offside. So, I would agree with that to

7308
02:44:08,230 --> 02:44:08,240
offside. So, I would agree with that to
 

7309
02:44:08,240 --> 02:44:10,790
offside. So, I would agree with that to
an extent. But what I'd say is if you

7310
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:10,800
an extent. But what I'd say is if you
 

7311
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:13,110
an extent. But what I'd say is if you
learn to trade this market, whether it

7312
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:13,120
learn to trade this market, whether it
 

7313
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:15,030
learn to trade this market, whether it
be Q's, ES, gold, whatever, if you learn

7314
02:44:15,030 --> 02:44:15,040
be Q's, ES, gold, whatever, if you learn
 

7315
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:17,110
be Q's, ES, gold, whatever, if you learn
the personalities, you will be able to

7316
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:17,120
the personalities, you will be able to
 

7317
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:19,030
the personalities, you will be able to
find some edge there. It's just very

7318
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:19,040
find some edge there. It's just very
 

7319
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:31,429
find some edge there. It's just very
much about being patient.

7320
02:44:31,429 --> 02:44:31,439

 

7321
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:33,110

Where you based in the UK? I'm not I'm

7322
02:44:33,110 --> 02:44:33,120
Where you based in the UK? I'm not I'm
 

7323
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:34,950
Where you based in the UK? I'm not I'm
based on Los Los Angeles. I'm from

7324
02:44:34,950 --> 02:44:34,960
based on Los Los Angeles. I'm from
 

7325
02:44:34,960 --> 02:44:39,590
based on Los Los Angeles. I'm from
London, but I'm based in LA.

7326
02:44:39,590 --> 02:44:39,600

 

7327
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:41,990

What is my setup to take a trade? Uh my

7328
02:44:41,990 --> 02:44:42,000
What is my setup to take a trade? Uh my
 

7329
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,790
What is my setup to take a trade? Uh my
favorite setup will be multi-time frame

7330
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:44,800
favorite setup will be multi-time frame
 

7331
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:47,510
favorite setup will be multi-time frame
trap participants. Okay, multi-time

7332
02:44:47,510 --> 02:44:47,520
trap participants. Okay, multi-time
 

7333
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:49,750
trap participants. Okay, multi-time
frame trapped participants. So, if we

7334
02:44:49,750 --> 02:44:49,760
frame trapped participants. So, if we
 

7335
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:52,790
frame trapped participants. So, if we
have left a volume shelf,

7336
02:44:52,790 --> 02:44:52,800
have left a volume shelf,
 

7337
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:54,309
have left a volume shelf,
we've talked about this a few times last

7338
02:44:54,309 --> 02:44:54,319
we've talked about this a few times last
 

7339
02:44:54,319 --> 02:44:56,550
we've talked about this a few times last
week. Let's

7340
02:44:56,550 --> 02:44:56,560
week. Let's
 

7341
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:59,830
week. Let's
think about it.

7342
02:44:59,830 --> 02:44:59,840
think about it.
 

7343
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:03,190
think about it.
I can give you examples of trades I like

7344
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:03,200
I can give you examples of trades I like
 

7345
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:06,070
I can give you examples of trades I like
here.

7346
02:45:06,070 --> 02:45:06,080
here.
 

7347
02:45:06,080 --> 02:45:08,630
here.
This was a trade we participated in with

7348
02:45:08,630 --> 02:45:08,640
This was a trade we participated in with
 

7349
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:10,389
This was a trade we participated in with
size, right? Because we left a twoe

7350
02:45:10,389 --> 02:45:10,399
size, right? Because we left a twoe
 

7351
02:45:10,399 --> 02:45:12,870
size, right? Because we left a twoe
balance range trapped. Fail breakout,

7352
02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:12,880
balance range trapped. Fail breakout,
 

7353
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:14,870
balance range trapped. Fail breakout,
fail breakout, fail breakout. Everyone

7354
02:45:14,870 --> 02:45:14,880
fail breakout, fail breakout. Everyone
 

7355
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:17,110
fail breakout, fail breakout. Everyone
who's long in there is caught. Fail to

7356
02:45:17,110 --> 02:45:17,120
who's long in there is caught. Fail to
 

7357
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:19,510
who's long in there is caught. Fail to
re reclaim. That is a high probability

7358
02:45:19,510 --> 02:45:19,520
re reclaim. That is a high probability
 

7359
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:21,990
re reclaim. That is a high probability
higher time frame short. So we look for

7360
02:45:21,990 --> 02:45:22,000
higher time frame short. So we look for
 

7361
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:25,030
higher time frame short. So we look for
a lower time frame entry. Short short.

7362
02:45:25,030 --> 02:45:25,040
a lower time frame entry. Short short.
 

7363
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:27,190
a lower time frame entry. Short short.
Here we traded the squeeze back up while

7364
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:27,200
Here we traded the squeeze back up while
 

7365
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:29,110
Here we traded the squeeze back up while
everyone else was looking short. This

7366
02:45:29,110 --> 02:45:29,120
everyone else was looking short. This
 

7367
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:32,630
everyone else was looking short. This
was an old naked point of control on a

7368
02:45:32,630 --> 02:45:32,640
was an old naked point of control on a
 

7369
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:34,710
was an old naked point of control on a
weekly chart. Once we hit this and we

7370
02:45:34,710 --> 02:45:34,720
weekly chart. Once we hit this and we
 

7371
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:36,230
weekly chart. Once we hit this and we
started reclaiming, everyone was looking

7372
02:45:36,230 --> 02:45:36,240
started reclaiming, everyone was looking
 

7373
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:39,030
started reclaiming, everyone was looking
for a continuation. Had not very many

7374
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:39,040
for a continuation. Had not very many
 

7375
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:41,429
for a continuation. Had not very many
reasons to go lower. This was a long

7376
02:45:41,429 --> 02:45:41,439
reasons to go lower. This was a long
 

7377
02:45:41,439 --> 02:45:43,670
reasons to go lower. This was a long
back up. I'd say this is an A trade.

7378
02:45:43,670 --> 02:45:43,680
back up. I'd say this is an A trade.
 

7379
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:46,150
back up. I'd say this is an A trade.
This up here was an A+ scenario. These

7380
02:45:46,150 --> 02:45:46,160
This up here was an A+ scenario. These
 

7381
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:47,910
This up here was an A+ scenario. These
fades here were A+. This is probably an

7382
02:45:47,910 --> 02:45:47,920
fades here were A+. This is probably an
 

7383
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:50,630
fades here were A+. This is probably an
A setup. This right here is like a C

7384
02:45:50,630 --> 02:45:50,640
A setup. This right here is like a C
 

7385
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:52,870
A setup. This right here is like a C
setup for me. It's like I don't really

7386
02:45:52,870 --> 02:45:52,880
setup for me. It's like I don't really
 

7387
02:45:52,880 --> 02:45:54,790
setup for me. It's like I don't really
want to trade inside these. I'm

7388
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:54,800
want to trade inside these. I'm
 

7389
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:57,910
want to trade inside these. I'm
interested above here or below here or

7390
02:45:57,910 --> 02:45:57,920
interested above here or below here or
 

7391
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:00,550
interested above here or below here or
for a reclaim here. Right? So that

7392
02:46:00,550 --> 02:46:00,560
for a reclaim here. Right? So that
 

7393
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:02,710
for a reclaim here. Right? So that
that's how I deem it. Easy way of

7394
02:46:02,710 --> 02:46:02,720
that's how I deem it. Easy way of
 

7395
02:46:02,720 --> 02:46:05,030
that's how I deem it. Easy way of
putting that I'm looking for a protrend.

7396
02:46:05,030 --> 02:46:05,040
putting that I'm looking for a protrend.
 

7397
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,590
putting that I'm looking for a protrend.
I'm looking for alignment where what I'm

7398
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:07,600
I'm looking for alignment where what I'm
 

7399
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:09,590
I'm looking for alignment where what I'm
seeing on an intraday session aligns

7400
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:09,600
seeing on an intraday session aligns
 

7401
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:12,230
seeing on an intraday session aligns
with my thesis on a higher time frame

7402
02:46:12,230 --> 02:46:12,240
with my thesis on a higher time frame
 

7403
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:15,755
with my thesis on a higher time frame
session and we're at a key area.

7404
02:46:15,755 --> 02:46:15,765
session and we're at a key area.
 

7405
02:46:15,765 --> 02:46:21,590
session and we're at a key area.
[snorts]

7406
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:21,600

 

7407
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:23,990

Just cuz I mean it doesn't have an

7408
02:46:23,990 --> 02:46:24,000
Just cuz I mean it doesn't have an
 

7409
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,150
Just cuz I mean it doesn't have an
accent does it doesn't mean you live

7410
02:46:26,150 --> 02:46:26,160
accent does it doesn't mean you live
 

7411
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:29,670
accent does it doesn't mean you live
there.

7412
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:29,680

 

7413
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:31,510

right? Even under here, right? Maybe I

7640
02:51:43,830 --> 02:51:43,840
right? Even under here, right? Maybe I
 

7641
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:45,269
right? Even under here, right? Maybe I
can be like, I'm hope the market

7642
02:51:45,269 --> 02:51:45,279
can be like, I'm hope the market
 

7643
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:46,550
can be like, I'm hope the market
protects that or I hope the market

7644
02:51:46,550 --> 02:51:46,560

protects that. These are the swing
 

7649
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:50,389
protects that. These are the swing
points that the market's going to look

7650
02:51:50,389 --> 02:51:50,399
points that the market's going to look

all the rules. So, if you log into your
 

7783
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:46,950
all the rules. So, if you log into your
account, you'll probably see that you're

account, you'll probably see that you're
 

7785
